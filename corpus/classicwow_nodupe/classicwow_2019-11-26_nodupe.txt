I run a fury prot build and we typically raid with 35 people. When I DW tank we kill my target first. If I'm the MT on bosses, I use a shield. Deep prot doesn't have that much more mitigation than sticking 20 points in there. I'm also pretty stacked with gear so my healers dont have issues keeping me alive
---
---
---
Fade only reduces aggro temporarily, once the effect ... fades, you get all your aggro back. So use it instantly when you pull aggro and you'll be fine, no salv needed, pretty much ever.
---
Because their tier gear looks like bananas
---
We cleared MC in greens. You don't need lionheart helm to be raid ready.
---
Indeed. Blizzard was worried people would be spending to much time in there and not in the world. Queue garrisons lol.
---
Horde vs Alliance
---
I had this happen yesterday running BFD, I’m a priest and I wanted those pants to drop so bad, you know the ones with 15 spirit. Well the mage in our party wanted them too (despite them not reaaaaallly being mage gear) but I found myself hoping they wouldn’t drop just so he wouldn’t get them. Reading your post made me realize what an asshole way to think this is, thanks op for helping me check myself. Remember to enjoy the game and don’t get to caught up in the loot grind! Btw the pants didn’t drop, at least I got my wand though.
---
Most of them are bad. You're supposed to be dispelling, dotting, and if there's a member that's about to die you pop out of shadow form and heal them. Healers should be cc'd and maybe mana burned. For premades though, shadow priest is the worst spec to bring.
---
and there is one of the reasons they don't want classic to be treated like a stand alone game.
---

---
money whoring? yep
---
so chad they cant even fight back in a video game
---
Thinkyou missed my point.
---
I was showing that's what most people think.
---
In reality we have a lot to offer
---
This MIGHT not be the best place... maybe you should join your server's discord server?  Also, each realm has its own subreddit so....
---
All I'm trying to say is this is like the worst place to accomplish what you're trying to accomplish.
---
The boots dont seem to match either but I guess that's a risk I had to take when I thought I could take your place as the life of the party.
---
Seems like a bit much for an arcanite rod, but sounds like the price is not what you're complaining about. Sounds like you're complaining about this dude not trusting a complete stranger over several hours of his time that he took to farm the gold/mats.
---
Sorry to be the one to break it to you but you're not the center of the universe. Random people in an online game do not know you or how trustworthy you are. They have every right to look for an assurance in case you're not.
---
"If somebody don't trust *me* enough to give *me* mats". The question is, *who the fuck* are you ? You gotta realize that.
---
&gt;with no room for variation other than luck (i.e. crit). That’s simply not true.
---
Because there is no other deviation outside of crit and killtime within the class. If its "simply not true", tell us what else there is to it. There is no ressource pooling, no procs or ability interactions. It's cast all your damage racials/CDs and then cast frostbolt 27 times in a row.
---
Sorry, but its not only mages. Every single class is on about the same level. Especially healers. If you want to check it yourself warcraftlogs is free to use and public information. And this information is crystal clear. Just check ANY of those low killtime logs. All of them are going to be mainly orange logs, some purple. Thats because the difference between a good and a bad player is pretty much non existant.
---
Barely any abilitys interact with eachother and you end up with one abiity outperforming every single other one to a point its not worth using.
---
Alliance on Benediction do the same bs.
---
Not an issue I have, but 15-18 seconds of stealth followed by a 10 minute cooldown....dont think it's going to get them far. If they could spam them everytime before the stealth was up then sure, it would be a viable strat.
---
As I said mate I’m new to this so I have no clue to be completely honest, well thank you for telling me that, I really appreciate it but you could’ve started with that geez haha
---
bless the troops
---
Obligatory plug for Fight Club discord, they have everything you could possibly need to know about warriors.
---
As others have said, fury-prot isn't really necessary for 90% of guilds. Keep in mind that fury tanks only generate more threat than prot tanks if they are dual-wielding while doing it, and logs tell us that dual-wield tanks take ~40% more damage over the course of a fight. That's a pretty big burden to put on your healers. A couple of dps having to back off so not to pull threat is not enough to justify fury tanking in raids. If you find that a considerable number of dps are starting to cap out, your first solution should be to get more threat gear before turning to fury.
---
Also, a lot of people overlook that Impale kind of sucks for raid tanking. First off, deep wounds is basically negligible, you won't have very high crit, or weapon damage, and the debuff will likely be bumped off very quickly. Impale might seem good, but keep in mind it is only a +20% damage BONUS to ABILITIES. From a threat perspective, that means it's +20% of the base (non-crit) threat from DAMAGE on your shield slam, revenge, and heroic strike. I emphasize damage because all of these abilities generate bonus threat that does not benefit from impale. Even if you are somehow crit capped the total TPS increase of impale is less that 1% per talent point, and you have to take improved rend and deep wounds to get to it. Just not worth it.
---
Druids got flying at 68 in Outland :)
---
Paid heavily under the table but yeah, I get what you're saying
---
I was checking that website earlier and it showed me 28/72 A:H the last 7 days. Now it shows me something totally different. It seems like a scuffed source. Other people seem to share my thoughts.
---
Sorry I'm having too much fun lmfao.
---
Winterspring, Burning Steppes, Eastern Plaguelands only IIRC.
---
make sure you watch the youtube vid about it too, covers off alot of the benifits/drawbacks of each build and playstyles etc.
---
Back in 2004 when first starting out i scammed a dude out of wool cloth by saying i could make bags.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
He ticketed.  I got the cloth removed and a 3 day ban.  Person got his cloth back.
---
This was within 2 weeks of launch, btw.  in 2004.   
---
This is blizzard using an excuse to cut back on CS workloads so they don't have to employ more people to actually support the games they have.   It really is as simple as that.
---
Yeah that’s a dick move. I’d be pissed as hell being dragged from questing or somewhere else, specifically called out to assist in a group. Then kicked on the way over.
---
lots of time to read that thesaurus in between res timers.
---
Fair enough, each to their own.
---
I was playing City of Heroes way back and a guy left our group because his wife was giving birth.  We were all nice fellas wishing him luck and all.
---
Then we found him at the slightly higher level spot.
---
I felt betrayed.
---
\&gt;guy gets a bunch of people to help him, probably for free, and proceeds to brag about how cool he is while offering no credit or gratitude at all
---
Thoroughly unimpressed.
---
Oh snap!
---
*Classic wow was a failure*
---
This guy sounds like a hardcore negative ninny. 
---
*I'm Having a Great Time*
---
This guy sounds like a casual who is playing the game correctly.
---
Thats what i used back in the day
---
I bought a Blackstone ring as a warrior. I just had to stand in a certain spot near the waterfall and they could transfer the loot with Master loot.
---
Not sure if it would work for Rotgrip or the Goblin though.
---
care to explain?  genuinely curious.
---
Gandling has been good to me and I still find myself frustrated by alliance ganking. Seems pretty even.
---
&lt;Goldshire Inn Staff&gt;
---
Oh god... 
---
These poor people, the amount of shit they must put up with...
---
At least as Tauren. They are barely sentient as it is, it would be a waste. Something like mining seems fitting, the ability to hit a rock is there.
---
Eh, yea that's pretty much how I feel about them now at least. I guess it depends when you started. For example I only became interested in mount collecting at the end of WoD and had some fun with it in Legion and some of BfA, so maybe it's just one of those things that's fun for a couple years but then loses its novelty.
---
I do agree the mounts in BfA look shite tho. All of it is reskins, and the real kick in the balls is the coolest looking mounts are the ones hidden behind a paywall
---
That's true, but in your case the dude told you he didn't have any money problems and had bars lying around. Even if that means he just has say 200 gold, you can always ask him to borrow money from people who trust him. It's a bit much to ask but what else can you do if Blizzard won't do anything.
---
Thanks for the warning though if I'm ever in your situation I will definitely ask a collateral.
---
That's not something Blizzard has ever fixed. The item theft, however, was something they would have addressed in Vanilla.
---
Brb gotta comb my lobster
---
Maelkor was one of the biggest cunts around.  He was kind of like having a douche bag drill sergeant as a raid leader.  Had a lot of friends between GS/Aeternus/EJ back then - good times.
---
This does not work in dire maul.
---
Most people are having great time or so many servers wouldn't be full during work days.
---
Ofc only really really small percentage of people posts on Reddit and most do it to complain about P2 despite everyone knowing it will be like this in advance on PvP servers
---
I meant specifically in between pulls. If I finish with 35 rage, especially if I have Enrage, I’m not popping out to heal lol
---
All aboard the Shoe-Shoe train!
---
arent you the guy that compared getting ganked/ganking to actual abuse?
---
not sure you have much to laugh about my friend :(
---
Add up the pieces that have hit on them, or download something like dejastats
---
Faction specific queues may or may not be an answer to the problem, but it is pointless asking for it because Blizzard will never do it. They have said so many times that they don't want to keep people from playing the game and this would only make more people unable to play, so it will never happen.  
---
Honestly there just isn't anything to do really other than release BG's early (as they've announced already). This is how vanilla works. Of course this isn't exactly like it was in vanilla, but people anecdotal "I played in vanilla and it was like this" or "I played in vanilla and it was nothing like this" doesn't really mean anything because this isn't vanilla, this is classic. After 15 years of retail WoW, the players are different, the meta is different, the server pop is different etc and thats just one of the fundamental problems with #nochanges that were bound to happen. This is the price we have to pay. In vanilla Blizzard would've adapted with a change (because thats how retail WoW works), but with Classic, that is not an option. Therefore nothing is really gonna fix this.
---
Furthermore I feel like faction specific queues would help very little. More horde PvP than Alliance (therefore still more horde PvP'ing with faction specific queues). People will still only notice when the hordes are camping and not when the alliance controls the area and the alliance will still sit in Ironforge all day, because thats what they've accustomed to in the last few weeks with phase 2.  
---
Anything other than changing the games (honor/pvp system) would not really solve the core issue)
---
SGC is bis for tank warrior for threat generation. So wouldn't be a OS.
---
I hate loot whores. I get wanting loot, but a lot of people just turn into douches. I have no problems rolling against someone if it's a legit upgrade for both of us. Rather do the dungeon and have a chance at it then spend another hour looking for the perfect group where I have no competition for my precious blue Strat piece
---
[deleted]
---
There was a guy in tibia who collected red apples hahaha, he had a tibiawikia page and everything. This ss made me remember.
---
You're fine with paying 13$ per month to have a game that's literally near unplayable ? That doesn't bother you ?
---
someone has to give all the alliance women affection.  alliance too busy waiting on res timers and saltposting on reddit :)))
---
Destromath and most pvp server were alliance dominated from what I remembered.
---
Working on it.  Already have the mats saved up for the AQ mount too.
---
Why even bother removing the items from the scammer if you're not gonna restore them? How do you manage to go halfway on an issue like this, either allow it or don't
---
They're all Horde dominated.  I'm not even exaggerating.  All of them are imbalanced in Horde's favor.
---
I hellfire a lot and always have pots on deck. THE DEEPS!
---
This clearly upsets you so I’m gonna keep it brief, I’ve played both pretty extensively and lock has far more options and far more to do in pvp than shadow priest, shadow priest just isn’t very fun unless you’re not good enough to play a class that actually takes skill so you need a spec that’s impossible to be bad at.
---
This would work just fine for PvE servers, you'd just have the choice to participate or not.
---
But honestly, there's SO MUCH game design potential untapped in WoW, it's amazing. So much things you could do with Contested Zones, a real Honor system, Reputation, etc, the possibilities are endless!
---
it doesnt require 5, but we will use 5 to make it take 1 second instead of 3.  that is two seconds we can use to gank even more alliance!
---
So there’s no reason to go higher? I’ve got muggers belt and the talent points. Been trying for the DMW dagger but it won’t drop. Should I just buy a scarlet kris?
---
Play a different game. This game was not made for folks like you.
---
Yeah, but the only people who actually bitch about raid loggers are the lifers.
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/ check faerlina, it's swapped over :-/
---
&gt; This guy sounds like a casual who is playing the game correctly.
---
Or he's playing Horde on Skeram.
---
I had guildies CoD me Runecloth because our AH is so sparse that I bought all of the Runecloth for sale on the entire server 10+ times.
---
I didn't save much money by asking for their help, mostly time, and they got to sell their increasingly useless Runecloth.
---
Also I thanked them repeatedly, including in this thread, before you made this post.
---
Nah, too many times getting rolled off. Group went to heck
---
Was the tea bagging necessary?
---
Enha yes, Ele/Resto no.
---
You're right, and nowadays people whine because there is too much hand holding.
---
I’ve been told it’s 9%. 3% for Bow Specialisation. 3% from surefooted. Then I need 3% from gear. 
---
Sound right?
---
And people didn't believe me that you were being ripped off... ROFL!   So, what pray tell does your $15 go for?  In the past you got top of the line servers, amazing customer support,  bug and exploit patches, and TONS Of new content.   Now, you get what?!?  Nothing...
---
Solid argument bud, get back to me when you feel like having a real discussion.
---
Ty for the reply
---
So since soc is worth it, should I drop 5/5 imp Seal of righteousness? I am planning to use a 1h and shield mostly, and I see what you are saying about going ret, but one thing i didnt mention is that I would like to be able to tank, heal or deal somewhat decent dps whenever I need to. Which is another reason leveling in holy while focusing on the dmg aspect appealed to me. Basically my mindset is to make a paladin where I widdle my opponents down (but actually killing them in the end) instead of trying to burst them down in 1 glorious soc proc
---
Benediction, not as populated at the big servers but that is a plus in my book.
---
Felt the same after camping Prince Nazjak all my spare time for 2 months. Trinket finally dropped after a couple kills.
---
Background: Back in vanilla people would put this item along with others like Teebu's Longsword and Pendulum of Doom as: 'once in a lifetime drops' or 'essentially unfarmable' because of how obscenely rare they are. Not only is it a collector's item but either currently or in the future (stat changes in burning crusade) they are the best in slot 29 twink caster gloves. As far as I remember, all spellcaster twinks consider these an upgrade with varying levels of disagreement over whether 'of the Shadow/Frozen' wrath are better. Either way I'm glad I got the drop and my exhausted screaming recorded. I've never had anything even remotely close to this rare drop for me in my ten+ years of playing both vanilla &amp; private servers.
---
Here's the [Wowhead page](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9491/hotshot-pilots-gloves#comments)
---
What’s your main hand dagger? Or are you with no daggers currently?
---
From my understanding the benefit after 308 isn’t nearly as impactful so going for +dagger skills over other stats isn’t optimal.
---
Vulpera
---
Heartseeker is alliance dominated
---
Phase 2 =/= first patch  
---
    
---
Phase 3 =/= first patch  
---
It'll come when it comes.
---
I see Horde doing this on Benediction so it goes both ways.
---
They usually do waves of bans.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well 🤓
---
Must be nice being on the side of the majority, eh?
---
No need to be skilled at pvp or use your brain, just call for the next pvp raid group who's around the corner when you're worried that you only out-number the opponent slightly. Mmmhhhh so goooood at this game!
---
Warriors can tank dungeons in DPS spec AND its a very good chest for tanks going for a threat set.  War wouldn't need to respec.  Ele and resto WOULD need to respec.
---
There is a minor difference between getting hacked and losing your items and getting scammed and losing your items.
---
My soul is ready..
---
My toon is not.
---
What does a cutting edge achievement look like?
---
sap, CS for combo points, expose armor, re-stealth and attack
---
This is why I have weapon chain on my tank weapon. If you have another enchant on your wep already get the disarm gloves from strath.
---
Shield slam costs less rage than MS and BT and probably generates more threat. That's the advantage if you ask me =]
---
THAT'S SOME COP OUT BULLSHIT AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT
---
Have you tried throwing out your Mac and getting a PC?
---
Yeah this is just a quality of life fix that prevents accidentally getting saved. I don't see any problem with it. I remember getting mega pissed in BC when one of our healers got saved to the other group's ZA group on accident. I almost flipped on everyone for being so dumb to screw the other group out of a healer. But then I got stoned and played call of duty.
---
Cool anime.
---
Guards in retail are incredibly hard to beat. They spawn randomly and dismount you, etc. Honestly, it fucking blows. I’d much rather have the guards in classic. Yeah you’re not entirely safe but it’s much more realistic. In retail it’s basically once you’re in combat, you’ll never get out of it because guards keep spawning. Dumb imo
---
This is always been their stance on scamming. yeah you're going to get someone that said they got their items back that one time but the other like a hundred thousand people they are the rule not the exception.
---
What exactly did you want to restore? Was it in classic? Coz they refusing to restore my quest item, i made 3 tickets already
---
The real kicker is Alliance docks to the boats.  Horde on my server just recently discovered that the guards don't spawn when killing people on the docks on Menithil Harbour, however Alliance can't do the same b/c guards patrol close to all the zeppelin areas.
---
Who gives a shit?  It's mostly semantics, and I was scammed as well.   The point is the people saying this was the norm are talking out of their ass.
---
hear yelling, find cops in your house someone was trying to break in, cop smells weed finds your stash you left on the table.
---
gg no re.
---
I mean, there's nothing else for me to do right now other than raid. I'm a healer so my only consumable is major mana potions, of which I have plenty. I have plenty of gold too, so I don't need to farm gold. I've got full preraid BIS for both tank and heal specs, so there's no dungeons I need to run.
---
There's nothing for me to "farm" or progress towards, other than raiding MC/Ony. So yeah, that's why I raidlog right now. I'm not a bad player for raidlogging, there's just not much for me to do outside of raids right now. Once AV comes out I'll farm that until I'm Exalted, and maybe outside of that, do WSG once in a while for fun.
---
I am leveling an alt though, just for fun.
---
I mean, Skeram is proper fucked for Alliance, as are numerous other servers with massive imbalances. If you think it's imaginary then you are probably just ignorant of the situation.
---
It is not worth rerolling just to use it no. Just sell.
---
&gt; Blizzard has shown that outcry like this works in the past.
---
What are they gonna do? Remove PvP?
---
Shower them with farm content loot
---
You know what sucks? Being dominated lol. Picture dying 5-10x on a good day to get into DM or brm
---
And silithus.
---
What’s the point? Build combo points while keeping them CC’d?
---
Did around 30 runs for my star of mystaria(last boss in the dungeon btw), made sure I was the only one who needed it when I made the groups. Can only imagine my pain if I had had competition during that grind.
---
As 60 you can avoid everything
---
Yeah, it does that, but it also tells you when your poisons are going to expire (both in time left, and in stacks left), and which weapon(s) it is expiring on. It also has some advanced things that I don't use, like auto-buying mats.
---
Oh yeah, he was tightly wound and seemingly obsessed with rivaling EJ, which leads a man down dark roads, but I was part of the original founders so they let me get away with whatever (I had like 20 fire resist when we took down rag the first time, which was about 100 short of 'mandatory' lol). Good times indeed
---
Can someone explain to a noob why people would pay that much gold for these gloves? Is it just due to the rarity, that they are essentially a collectors item or is there more to it?
---
Let me just say that as a druid in Vanilla and a druid in Classic I am very happy with the current state of affairs.
---
Not yet
---
Loot council leads to favoritism which leads to drama which leads to your ppl leaving.  That’s just my opinion and personal experience tho
---
&gt;in a kind of hardcore guild people won't just need you to do 3 craft during the week.
---
?
---
How many healers are in your "hardcore guild" that you're needing to craft more than 3 hide of the wilds per week?
---
Even so, at some point every healer is going to have it, so you're not going to need to craft them every week anymore.
---
You can do that with 2h fury
---
See! Fucking look at them! This is the level of stupidity we priests have to deal with!
---
Hit is not better than crit once you have hit yellow hitcap(6% with 305 weapon skill, 9% with 300). After that all your hit only helps auto attacks, which is still good, but crit affects all attacks(well until you hit critcap at which it stops affecting melee hits, but that's hard to hit).

Dont blame us when blizzard obviously fucked everyone.  As actually get to world pvp now.
---
I dont even play wow and I'm scrolling through popular and IM SO GLAD SOMEONE ELSE THOUGHT THIS
---
Yeah, people just round up and say 9% but it's technically a bit less. Obviously not worth trying to reach that exact percent though since most gear has a round +%. And I dont know if bow specialization is technically an exact 3% either. It's too complicated to worry about... just go for 9%
---
Considering they've handled it both ways, it would only make sense that that would be the case.
---
Do you know the water essence? Did you tried that one ? Cause those goes for 20G on my realm and wanted to know how many fo those ppl get per hour.
---
Borrow gold from a buddy and pay it back when you're higher level and gold is easier to come by.
---
Found the guy that's salty he never played vanilla
---
So the BOEs within the raid?
---
We had 5 guildies get feared into Mc. They contacted support and got unlocked
---
The only things that I've heard about game play in classic that I would deem as "terrible" is the absurdity of the horde on PvP servers. I for one am for the Horde, however I chose to play on a PvE server because of my casual play style. I just hit 59, I really enjoy getting home from work, cracking open a cold one and doing some fishing or laid back questing. I like being able to level without getting ganked. 
---
One of my favorite past-times right now is going onto reddit and make fun of people who are crying about PvP on a pvp server. Yeah sure I know its unbearable but I knew this was going to happen, we knew the servers were gonna be huge and Battlegrounds weren't gonna be out till phase 3 (2.5) now. If you didn't want to deal with this there was an obvious solution. People keep downvoting me but I am having fun making fun of people, and I'm also having fun PvPing when I can on a PvE server.
---
Add EPGP as a tool for your loot council decisions.
---
&gt;so blizz knows how serious we are about deserving support?
---
PEtitions don't do anything...  Never have, and never will.  Even if you quit the game, they won't care.  They'll just assume they were right about it not working.
---
So saying nothing and stay quiet would be a good thing ? If humans had stick with this mentality , we wouldn't evolved at all . People believed that Classic will never come out , and today it is , but seriously need changes and asap otherwise  the knowledge already acqueried by players will cause the game to eat himself to death , and thats what it is , and i do agree with you that it wont change cuz blizz dont seems to care that much....
---
It's an investment. By sticking out for a trial period with no loot, or only loot nobody else wants they get an invite to the same group of people every week- meaning eventually their name comes up and they're guaranteed to get a particular item.
---
If you pug every week you might see your item drop multiple times, and have to roll against 5+ people every time. If you run with any kind of guild the pool of people eligible for that item decreases in size every time it drops (ideally).
---
The Banana is so strong here, his latency cannot handle it.

Unless you are nightfall
---
19 agi = 38 ap + some crit &lt; 48 ap.
---
So ill take the 48 ap.
---
Ran a mc pug with a tankadin and ret pally.
---
They did their best.
---
The one time someone actually posts an unpopular opinion, they don't say it in the title. 
---
Raid logging is lame because they don't put their gear to use and don't contribute anything to the guild aside from a warm body during raid time. I would much rather gear up people that want to go out to PvP and participate in things with the guild.
---
Yes
---
Sounds like you’ve finally gotten over it /s
---
Nothing new. We had the same thing happen with 10,000g of materials for a Hand of Ragnaros over a month ago. Dozens of tickets and a whole heap of "well, that's classic!" responses from GMs later, nothing was recovered.
---
I’m currently sitting on 10% but chasing some more gold for bizniks scope. Which means I can drop surefooted.
---
raid explanations for the kaelthas fight in BC felt like being in a lecture hall
---
Twinking.
---
It depends on how you look at it. 
---
Launch was a disaster and I knew it would be so I waited a month to join. I wasnt surprised by the 60s.
---
The grind is real and I loved that. Over all. Meh
---
Do you even realize that you don't need to install anything to play on most private servers? You can play with a non modified client
---
You sound like an insane person, if you have actual proof of servers setting up something to mine crypto while installing their client go ahead and send it, but don't tell me that bs "do you read through their terms and conditions" as if they would say "oh btw we're gonna mine crypto on your computer, hope you don't mind"
---
INB4 rule 7
---
Eh who gives a shit, lvl 29 trash
---
Nah. Character Stats Classic is a good addon. But for warriors with no fancy hit talent it’s just adding up the hit you get from items. 
---
Remember it’s 9% hit at 300 weapon skill and 6% hit at 305, so racial weapon skill is HUGE or get edgemasters.
---
308 and 6% hit are the magic numbers for raids. However you have to shift your gear to make that happen is worth it, beyond that you want to start stacking crit % and then agility.
---
Yeah I had that memorized a few weeks back, almost done with the Encyclopedia now
---
Stop using the god awful loot distribution method known as loot council.
---
Yeah that sounds like a sex thing...
---
Hint hint: No you don't get more aggro for pulling. 
---
You're literally talking about pull aggro, which is a token amount (1 point of threat) of aggro given to you so the monsters are attacking anyone at all. 
---
Don't downvote me because I solved your fucking problem with one handy hint. Buff anyone, cast an instant speed heal, or do anything at all that gains threat, and you pull it away from the puller. You don't get more aggro for pulling.
---
Ganking is part of the game, you even get rewarded for it, nothing wrong with that. but MC'ing people off the boat just to steal 10 mins of their life is pretty scummy IMO, I would rather be corpse camped ;)
---
The very maximum you can go is 0 to 4, then 4 to 6, then 6 to 8, and after that it is only ever possible to get 1 or less rank ups.
---
The system is quite complicated, I'd say its better to take the time to fully understand how it works, and then use that to figure out any pvp questions you have for yourself. There's plenty of youtube guides that cover it quite well.
---
I had a extremly wholesome experience I want to share:
---
Im a warlock and was in Scholomance when actually Headmaster's Charge dropped. I got really excited but also was aware that the mage would probably go for it too.  Its not BIS for anyone except if you do some crazy science so it was mainly for style wars BUT if there ever was a staff yelling warlock it is this one. So I need and wait... everybody greeds except for the mage and I wonder whats the issue. In the end he passes and I literally jumped up my chair in ecstasy. I danced and thanked everyone and expressed my gratitude. Later on the tank /w me that the mage (who he knew) actually wanted to roll but he talked him out of it because he was a warlock in vanilla and thought of it as a WL only item. 
---
Thanks mage&amp;tank duo. Ive actually got it with me at any time and make sure to use it while idleing, dungeoning and pvping. Until today it definately has been my highlight wow classic experience.
---
I concur I've had materials &amp; gold returned to me after not receiving stated service.
---
Is this any faster than just stripping down and getting yourself killed?
---
Great feedback, and very true
---
I’m in a guild but I just get ignored when I ask to group. I guess I’ll try finding a new one that’s not full of dead beats lol.
---
All I have to say is that if one person "trying to play their way" means that they're simply not allowing other players to play AT ALL then they do not deserve to be part of the community. That person that is being a dick wouldn't have a game to play at all if the rest of the community played similarly as the game would die. Everybody that is part of the community has a responsibility to not be a dick. 
---
Anyways, thanks for your constructive conversation. Not trying to be all righteous just hoping to share an opposing opinion, as you have yours. Cheers,
---
By PVE you mean raids? Then no.
---
For dungeons and shit everything goes.
---
The best is Zandalar tribe if you're ok with RP PvP. If not Ashbringer seems balanced imo (my choice) and I've heard Mograine is kinda balanced (compared to Shazz, Gehennas, Firemaw at least).
---
I think some of the med pop realms are good as well, I'm not sure about specifics though.
---
Nope, Battlegrounds are gonna be cross realm so everything is going to be just fine. Sorry you picked a PvP server that has PvP on it though, that must be rough and unexpected for you.
---
That sucks a whole bunch. Wish there was something that could be done.
---
no, rag won't come up they all die, people banish them so that everyone can regen and use bandages, let cooldowns come back up and let the melee and tanks back into position before they kill the final add
---
&gt;For premades though, shadow priest is the worst spec to bring. 
---
Why?
---
People waiting for phase 2 be like
---
If that's your argument, should probably be taxed by guild and tax should go into raid funds.  Raid funds will definitely help everyone progress more,  as opposed to someone who might buy BiS or might buy 300 noggenfogger and a tuxedo set.
---
You really do not need macros what so ever except for canceling heroic/cleave.
---
&gt; **I made this thread not out of frustration, because I play both sides on different servers, but to contribute/start a constructive discussion to attempt to solve the current system and its issues. Please respect others and their opinion.**
---
&gt;Next time, try to put your tinfoil hat on before you comment. Cheers.
---
/thread
---
What does adding quests have anything to do with it?
---
Lmao such an edge master. God forbid someone wants to turn a quest in or have wpvp. 
---
This is just honor farm in a Zerg toxic ass fashion
---
Like your UI setup, what are some of the addons/settings?
---
Classic is abandoned by blizzard GMs. They are incredibly useless, i was shocked seeing the difference after leaving in wrath.
---
If you want to do loot council and still incentivize new guildies, make specific loot (brutality blade, perdition's blade) only for the long time - always there members and the smaller upgrades free roll. You can even let each (1 or 2 from each class) reserve 1 drop each run so they end up getting the piece they really want, but all other members can free roll.
---
Earthfury is ally heavy.  Kinda sucks but it's nowhere near the worst
---
I wouldnt ask them to pass. Just to roll off if other people also need it for an OS.
---

---
I can't believe there are any alliance left on herod... They're all going to cry so hard when BG queues are 4-5 hours.
---
Please tell me you're not serious i'm laughing hard atm. I wasn't talking about more hides to fucking craft.
---
Very true. I'd probably regret the decision if nobody else faction changed as well
---
Fury/Prot is more of a main tank thing, not really an offtank thing. You go fury/Prot when your DPS are capping out on threat and unable to go all-out. Deep Prot is better for offtanking and dungeons.
---
What about Sylvanas Windrunner? Forsaken High Elf, disproves the whole 'human only' thing there.
---
The best way to avoid it is logging in and out.  If you do random shit like walk jump etc. and then every 30 mins relog you are safe from DC's. IF y ou are using remote log in, make a macro to log out to make it easier.
---
Lol you riled up the small minded and selfish with this post.
---
Lol, WHY ARE YOU PLAYING A MMORPG THAT HAS WORLD PVP ASPECTS SOLO?  your own dammed fault. Join a Pve server.
---
This is 100% a whiny post from an OP looking for attention. Proof: OP of the thread getting super defensive towards anyone disagreeing with them.
---
This would make me quit the game.
---
The response from Blizzard is both pathetic and disappointing.
---
What happened to #nochanges? Non-existent GM support is a change.
---
He did get it.
---
A different time Truestrike shoulders dropped and out of 2 rogues 2 warriors and a hunter the hunter got them. The rogues flipped, but it was a definite upgrade for that hunter. I felt pretty neutral about that also.
---
Like I said really depends on ur class. Some classes get more ap/crit from agi then others...plus the dodge.
---
Ignore all the muppets saying “you can’t play arms in mc”. The fact that ms is a prio debuff is true, and it’s not a good thing to use in raids when your progress or if you’re struggling with a boss. I’ve been doing it all along though, and with the help of a wf totem you can achieve 4-600 dps depending on buffs/gear. Don’t do this in bwl and higher tiers, but in mc there is no need to tryhard when you have rag on farm and kill him before submerge.
---
Always dislike Arathi Basin. WG is a lot of fun, though.
---
I'm currently suffering this purple demon in my guild.
---
The guild leader is a DPS warrior and rolled on might gloves and won. He never tanks, and if he is forced too you'd find a target dummy would hold better threat than him.
---
The offtank had T1 helm.  T2 helm drops.  HE wins and needs over others who are still prebis or worse.  Rather than distribute the loot around for the guild,  he chose to vendor his T1 helm and take the T2 helm.
---
I have now crafted more purples for myself than i have received from raiding as main tank for my guild in these past two months  both due to shitty rolls,  and purple demons making people need things they really dont while fucking over other guildies in the process. 
---
IT sucks balls.
---
I mean, I suppose I could heal in a 0/30/21 enhance resto spec with the right gear and not have to respec. So the same could be said for shamans.
---
It basically compares the attacker's weapon skill the the defender's defense, and either adds or removes 0.04% hit, crit, dodge, block, or parry to the relevant character. Stunned players have zero dodge/block/parry, so in this case the only effect would be that the level 36 would have 4.8% increased miss chance and 4.8% lower crit. I forget how spells work but it's not that different from this.
---
There was a time in the WoW beta where level differences had much more severe hit penalties in PvP, but never in the live game.
---
I don't know why do many people in this thread have false memories of how PvP worked in Vanilla. Maybe broken private servers? Maybe they thought a skull level NPC was a player 15 years ago? Who knows.
---
Those are the players who get ignored forever.  No time for nonsense
---
80-20
---
I feel accomplished.
---
Join the alliance gang bang in searing gorge.
---
i find it disgusting to look at ingame retail tbh. i know this is pretentious but like...there's *so much* gaudy, overdone shit that people are wearing or riding around on. classic has some measure of relative groundedness. not everyone is riding around on sparkling flaming unicorn phoenixes. a collection of players jsut looks kinda absurd to me now.
---
Fact of the matter is, as others have said, it is Main Spec BiS tank piece for threat. It is also good for DPS, but good tanks know threat is kind of classic, and will wear SGC until AQ, I think. Enhance shamans will use it, too, but in a MS rolling situation it is 100% MS item for tank warriors, no question.
---
I have working macros for this:
---
Cheapshot:
---
\#showtooltip Cheap Shot
---
/cast Cheap Shot
---
/cleartarget
---
/stopattack
---
Expose armor: 
---
\#showtooltip Expose Armor
---
/cast \[@target,harm,nodead\]\[harm,nodead\] Expose Armor
---
These work EVERY time, no strafe or escape or any shit like that, just press the keybind and you will use ability without attacks.
---
but guards in towns need to be a threat, otherwise we have what we have now, they arent and horde are free to camp FPs with no consequence
---
The RP guilds tell the map mapper where their base is and they stick the label on the map. Whether there is any pvp or rp around it is up to the guilds and players to make happen.
---
the other photoshpped wow bit is Anathema, the shadow version of the Benediction which is the epic questline from MC, if you see a shadowpriest with that thing on their back, its too late you're probably already dead
---
Oof
---
Did you just assume his class?!
---
Gutgore ripper
---
absolutely
---
only old cishet dads play classic
---
yep was waiting for the boat to theramore and 12 horde were on the boat just killing anyone that was waiting for the boats on either side
---
Locks can Dispel and will pretty much always have Felhunter out in organized BGs.
---
[removed]
---
It was completely accidental too. Was running some guildies through BRD for their MC attune and before the lava jump I asked if we could try the arena. Was ECSTATIC
---
On my server there is a rolling alliance deathball that does. not. go. offline.
---
Always the same people 10v1ing. One of them streams (he gets like 3 viewers on average) and his last VOD was over 16 hours long, of continuous streaming. And its like this every day.
---
Definitely not a faction-specific issue.
---
I had a great laugh, one of my favourite scenes from a movie.
---
But it is not a os, its bis for a tank.
---
Basically an awkward bit of trying to find out what happens with a dead end questline with old Blizz posts and forum comments lead me on to it.
---
So in-game right now there's a seemingly unfinished questline regarding Eranikus. 
---
So most people know you can get the [Chained Essence of Eranikus](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Chained_Essence_of_Eranikus) trinket which poisons enemies around you.
---
Well there is a follow up quest to that. In the SW area of Swamp of Sorrows is a NPC called Ithatius just hanging out there. At level 55+ he has a second dialogue choice which ends up with him giving you [The Oathstone of Ysera's Dragonflight](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Oathstone_of_Ysera%27s_Dragonflight) which on interaction starts the quest [Essence of Eranikus](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:The_Essence_of_Eranikus_(2\)) but it's a SECOND QUEST by the same name so that's where it gets frickin awkward on google. You just bring the Oathstone and Trinket to to finish this quest. This does result in losing the trinket forever, a bit of trivia you may have heard about. 
---
You then get a third and final quest called [In Eranikus' Own Words](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:In_Eranikus%27_Own_Words) which basically has you talk  to a lady in Winterspring and the questline stops here. 
---
The WoWWiki link of that final quest actually summed up all the forum posts and says "This quest chain seems to end very abruptly here. Blizzard representatives had hinted that the quest chain was not complete and would be extended later. They still haven't changed that, but they continued the story with Green Scepter Shard questline for the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj, for redeeming Eranikus." and provides links to [Green Scepter Shard](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Green_Scepter_Shard) which is one of the three pieces needed for [The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj).
---
You need to complete [The Nightmare's Corruption](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:The_Nightmare%27s_Corruption) which is getting items from the corrupted dragonkin at the dream portals around the world and is a raid quest because one of the Dragons of Nightmare was tuned for 40 players. 
---
Those fragments are needed to save Eranikus in [The Nightmare Manifests](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Quest:The_Nightmare_Manifests) which is a raid quest in Moonglade to basically keep Keeper Remulos (Cenarius' son and who you turn that Maraudon quest into) and Eranikus alive until Tyrande arrives.
---
After this you are rewarded the Green Scepter Shard for the Scepter of the Shifting Sands.
---
Most are clothy too
---
He probably didn't have that much time to play after becoming a father.
---
I love Flying but hate to grind rep for it. Doing wq on foot vs Doing them with Flying? I did only about 10 wqs in 2 months after launch and i did 100 in 2 weeks after i got Flying. It is time for Flying since launch or 1 month after
---
usually it's to apply a big expose armor to get a big ambush crit off.
---
Like I'm fighting a mage, I get him blinded without his iceblock being up(usually i use blind just after iceblock), then I stealth, sap, cheapshot for combo, then expose and start bandage. When I get out of combat I can ambush with the mage having essentially zero armor.
---
There ya go. Yes scarlet Kris would work and it’s easy to get.
---
I’ve been saying this on this sub for weeks. The amount of greedy players is shocking when you consider how most are in their 30s and supposedly full grown adults.
---
I think some of the med pop realms are good as well, "lower" populations seem better for healthier wpvp realms, but i'm not sure about specifics.
---
Lol this site is just wrong. I don't know where they get their data from.
---
I had to put my cat to sleep today...this gave me some smiles.
---
So since I have muggers belt and talens that puts me at 310. I got like 10% hit with talents. Need and offhand for my gutgore. Sounds like I chills but scarlet kris instead of farming for distracting dagger cause it ain’t dropping for me haha
---
it still costs a decent amount.  If I remember right it was 600 something gold.
---
Yeeee
---
Ran Strath love yesterday with my friend who is a ret pally, the warrior tank won mask of the unforgiven... Friend claimed his PC exploded and rage quit,  we then didn't have the scarlet key to complete the rest of the dungeon, I skipped onyxia to run it with him....

I did around 550 dps on Golemagg with wf/regular buffs/mongoose as arms last raid. I got OEB, you’re saying that damage is a joke in mc?

I would say hes pretty fly

To post on world chat that im selling Tribute items so i can get faster buyers so i have 0 downtime finding buyers.Same goes for Leaf macro ppl buying demon heads LULW

“You want transparency? Here’s your f*cking transparency!” * doesn’t say a single true word in the whole post while continuing the fraudulent activity. *
---
Yeah I’m glad we’re not on private servers anymore, lol.
---
I would swap from horde to ally right now if I could.
---
Got it my first try
---
Love Kromcrush! It is wild right now with all the horde though. Hoping to hit 60 soon. I’ll wave if I see ya. 
---

Legitimate cringe post

No, it would make sense that the policy changed.

57 war here.
---
Was asked, some would say begged, to tank brd. I said sure. Got into a party and instead of zep / fly to kag I just said hey I'm going to get an Uber and reinvite in 2 mins.
---
I got my Uber, paid 3g and whispered the party lead for him to say "yeah the party agreed you were too low, we found another tank"....wtf
---
Hi, did you mention the transaction in game chat at any point, even a PM / whisper etc.
---
Reach out to a GM, scamming is not permitted in this game, they will not be able to keep anything, and you should be able to get your items back.
---
if you are hard casting shadowbolt in pvp often, your opponents are garbage, and as best practices you shouldnt even be doing it, unless you are conflag spec and are trying to bait out a silence on your shadow tree so that you can free cast your fire side.
---
IF you know what you are doing you can prevent most of it, too bad the zerg doesn't know what they are doing.
---
It was like this back in real vanilla.
---
&gt;because the raid leader was a dunce 
---
So why are you blaming blizzard? Why is this dunce leading your raids?
---
I thought it was based on duration of buffs, shortest buff timers go first
---
How long it last.
---
Yes please. I'd change in a heartbeat to get away from this animal faction and actually have decent 1v1-1v2-1v3 fights instead of this spawn kill shit.
---
Great movie.
---
Yes but that's just mobs outside the portals, not the dragons themselves.
---
Hey I use this one too 
---
&gt;"omg my mom fell down the stairs and I gotta go take her to the hospital" 
---
&gt;byho has logged off.
---
Unlucky I say. My guild we kills it in there
---
&gt; the skill required to perform just isn’t there
---
hahahahahaha
---
He's playing Horde on Bigglesworth.
---
But the "negative ninny" is playing alliance on Heartseeker.
---
My server hasn't been that bad, but I would have loved a server that didn't have honour in wpvp. Phase 1 PvP involved much more choice and nuance whether I would attack or be attacked with many variables to consider, it was much more engaging and felt more natural, "organic" and sandboxy. Also, city raids are great! 
---
Put simply, I feel in phase 1 PvP added a lot to the game, but it phase 2 it has taken away from the game and has made it a shallower experience for me.
---
I'm still glad I went PvP (for now), I just hope it calms down a bit after Bags are launched.
---
Because businesses want to minimize costs wherever they can. People just let Blizz continually reduce the scope of GM support without any complaints. This is how master loot got removed, so GMs didn't have to deal with loot fraud.
---
Deviate Delight is this server.
---
Horde can just jump on the piers anyway to deaggro. Also the guards arent  threat.
---
Wait, I got scammed in WotLK and got all my items restored. So it has indeed changed at some point.
---
Actually I was sarcastically pointing out 2 different things people take for granted. Do you really think the third party clients have terms and conditions at all?....
---
There is plenty of proof all over the internet of my first point, the fact that it may or may not happen with WoW 3rd party clients is irrelevant. Trusting an unverified web site out to make money is not a good idea, especially if they are operating in shady legal grounds against a massive company. 
---
This entire thread is a dumpster fire
---
Yea op is an idiot.
---
+1 for EF. Latest manual census shows 45 Horde to 55 Ally. Come here and roll Horde. No zergs, small group fights throughout contested zones.
---
57 isn't even too low for full run bed lol
---
It's rep you need for the mount, not honor.
---
No life's on both sides. Though my bias says more roll horde.
---
That GM response is bullshit. It's taking "No Changes" to the extreme just so Blizzard can be lazy.
---
&gt; My question is: would it have been ethical in your opinion for the shamans to roll on the glad chain
---
Fuck no
---
Truestrike is BiS for Hunters too, no reason he shouldn't have gotten them.
---
I just fly from orgrimmar while brewing some tea. Definitely worth the tradeoff. Goblin forever!
---
Hobre tetas
---
I had to afk a couple of years ago because some drugged up guys walked into my house to steal stuff. I heard noise and assumed it was a drunken housemate coming home. Wasn't until they attacked a housemate outside my door that I realised it had kicked off
---
and if i don't get that detect invis and underwater breathing you better believe i'm coming back to give them a rank 1 fort
---
I am surprised as well. Reading reddit you often get the sense that everyone knows all and min/maxes for that 15yo game.
---
I guess the majority is still pretty newbie and figures out keybinds.
---
Think we may have a winner! 
---
Thank you!!
---
Gnome obviously. I'd get all the ladies.
---
changed... how?
---
On retail both cases occur, just like in classic lol
---
&gt; that 1600 is a little harder to create though
---
Take one screenshot having 20 in your bags. Delete 4 bananas and you'll have 16 left. Cut out the number 16 from the second screenshot and paste it to your other screenshots layer. Then all you need to do is press left until the spacing is correct and bam you'll have your 50x50 icon. Then simply duplicate that and shift it over to each action bar slot. Since they are evenly spaced, you only need to do this manually a few times, since you can copy two in a row and after a shift you'd have four in a row, then eight, etc.
---
Why ruin the economy of a server because people didn't read what a PVP server was......
---
My biggest gripe: 1.12 itemization. Totally destroyed MC and dungeons.
---
Actually had to say "living room on fire got to go" once. The dvd player had burst into flames while on standbye. No idea how the pug went, but I was the healer and the boyfriend helping me put it out was dps.... so.... it probably didn't go great. 
---
Always wonder if they thought we were having them on.
---
You son of a bitch, I’m in!
---
hunter2, actually, but all I see when you type it is *******
---
I shoulda done that, but logged for a bit after that so I could get my hearth back
---
"Yeah it's my birthday too."
---
Idk if I just feel like I’m getting killed more but grobbulus is pretty even but I feel like alliance are more dominant. Being 52 when p2 came out has been rough. But it seems like every other server is horde dominated. 
---
I’m having a rough time but i like the more even server split once I actually hit 60
---
I think you forgot your tinfoil hat.
---
Is this 2 macros or just one that can be copy and pasted?
---
Boooo, hand of rag on a warrior ;(.
---
Smh
---
I’m about to hit level 45 as an Arms warrior, and I’m getting a bit restless. I leveled to 60 as one in vanilla so I know what I was getting myself into.
---
I’m thinking about switching to Fury, and most guides seem to say this is very suboptimal. If I switch will it just be a miserable experience at this level?
---
Have you read the Hunter class pre raid BiS list in wowhead? There are hunters out there nicking Dal Rends from melee classes.
---
who wants to play "spot the Horde"
---
&gt;could you imagine the QQ when there is nobody to 10v1 or people flying in to flight paths to camp. 
---
It's almost as bad as the QQ from threads like these.
---
I play alliance on a 2:1 horde imbalanced server, it's nowhere near as bad as people make out if you use your brain instead of throwing your body at BRM every second.
---
The thing is, leveling in phase 1 on a PvP server was one of my best gaming experiences ever. I would not have had that experience had I gone PvE. 
---
So I'm kinda at a loss.
---
Like many said. just keep making tickets. and / or ask for Senior GM (or how he was called)
---
I don't think that happens a lot but sorry that it did.
---
It’s called sharding and it’s in retail. No one wants that
---
Ummm, grind?
---
Every item benefit the community if it's given to someone present. From the sound of it just look for a guild that don't want to go that hard on the game and you'll do fine. But don't expect to be treated as a dedicated raider in a good guild, for those guys you'll be second classs because of your behavior. Just don't play with them but it's kinda dumb to ask them to value someone they don't. 
---
And for your last point doing jump runs isn't binary with succes/failure, there are efficient and not efficient jump runs. Or just change healer with tank in that sentence, works the same.
---
I always say I shit my pants due to Arby's related diarrhea.
---
What about the people who only have an hour to play and that hour is spent on corpse runs?
---
You realize spending at least an hour to get into a dungeon is worse than entering a queue  and watch netflix right?
---
I know that. Was just more curious if it was the guild im in.
---
You being full of shit.
---
Raid logging is for people who don’t really enjoy the game - there I said it 🤭
---
Invisibility and stealth are two very different things.
---
So instead of making it figuratively unplayable for some we need to make it literally unplayable for others? This goes back to the "should have rolled PvE". It's not just WoW but nearly every game with open world PvP has this issue, that's why historically speaking world PvP games have been so unpopular compared to heavily regulate PvP games. Everyone thinks it'll be fun because they'll be the one crushing it, when reality hits and they are getting stomped, for whatever reasons peopel start to complain.
---
I don't think you understand math.
---

I'll follow them around, if they're the dumb bots like they sound that dont react and only follow a very limited script...
---
let them aggro a mob.  dps them down low.  Let the mob kill them.  Repeat.   Move in and repeat with the next bot after about 10 kills when you see them pull then get wrecked by the mob cuz all their gear is broke. 
---
They will literally keep running all day - rez,  rebuff / mana.   start attacking mob. die to mob because everything red.  repeat. untill the owner checks on them and realises they've just wasted 12hrs essentially doing nothing.
---
That sucks, but that's a little different than someone scamming you
---
For Junction1313, if they said it was misuse, I'd send the developers a letter and then go to the news about it if they don't give in.
---
Blizzard is already in hot shit for China stuff, I'm sure some small time news station would love a dumb hook like that.
---
Hit the question mark in the bottom of your UI. Open a ticket.
---
No its not. You are very obviously not playing as a minority on a pvp server.
---
Most definitely. It’s got some agi on it too. You’ll be in good shape with that and gutgore
---
Why don't you just transfer to a Horde majority server and help out your fellow Alliance?
---
Lol, go ahead and try it.
---
You would know if it was in your guild. We've been talking about this.
---
Yes and no.  If you like interactions, I suggest rolling on an rp server.  You'll find guilds and players that get together or organize fun events just because.  If you dont want to be on an rp server, find one with a good population and find a good guild.
---
Good guild = good time
---
its 3% drop chance. Out of 100 ores, youll get 3 crystals. 
---
Out of 30, youll get 1
---
I provided screenshots of the whispers and party chat between the individual and myself.
---
You've learned a valuable lesson on what collateral is.
---
Ark had this problem. They nerfed flying mounts but it's still a large issue. It made large maps that took hours to cross a couple minute trip.
---
There is a formula between your weapon skill vs the opponent's defense (enemy level for npcs), as a druid in form, you're not using a weapon, your weapon skill is considered max for your level (300 at 60) and can't be increased.
---
You need a different amount of +hit for different level mobs, so you need less +hit for dungeon mobs that are lvl 56, more hit for dungeon bosses at lvl 60, and even more for dungeon bosses at lvl 63.
---
It ALL depends on what you're fighting to find out how much +hit you need.
---
I think you use this sentence too much without understanding what it actually describes.
---
Usually you only need it for main tanks. Rest shouldn’t be taking too much fire damage that a greater fire pot won’t deal with.
---
My personal best (and real) is, "Gotta go! Kid broke his arm"
---
&gt; seeing the purple made him Instinctively want it.
---
If an epic drops that does nothing for you and your natural instinct is to need on it just so the other guy who needs it won't get it? That's fucking retarded.
---
Anything else you’d like to disagree with?
---
So quit, or go to a different server.  No one is forcing you to stay on a server *you chose*.  Some hair-brained idea of how you think they should punish the other faction isn't the solution to the world's problems.
---
so what if everyone used critical thinking and there was only 1 faction?
---
would you still feel like a super smarty critical thinkerer?
---
:thinking:
---
I don't even care about the the guy who took my items. I just want my stuff back. I worked hard for those materials.
---
I’m not playing at all. I haven’t been subbed since September due to other obligations. Im just thinking logically. I really don’t understand how you can say that playing is worse than not playing. That doesn’t make sense to me.
---
It does in a standard auto attack yes. But the question/post is that it does not do so as part of a reck bomb specifically. In other words it doesn't proc off the stacked autos or SoR procs that come from them
---
This is despicable.
---
9 minutes is a flat lie.  or are you just saying from start to finish?
---
Because a full loop of finished run to finished run is like 12-14 minutes.
---
Stop being so salty.
---
&gt; wotlk zones were awful to navigate and hardly connected with each other in a meaningful way
---
There's good opinions and then there's this opinion
---
I take it your guide on what to do so "it's nowhere near as bad as people make out if you use your brain" 
---
is detailed that it's taking you a while to write everything down right?
---
Will be much better after bgs launch on the 10th.
---
Go on, show me the math then for 11 people split evenly across six layers.  Now explain to me how this solves the issue of people quitting because it's not fun to play.
---
I main horde and was enjoying the video until that happened. That was trashy.
---
Before or After you go AFK? :P
---
Someone else said it in another comment, you can have them "buy" the mats off of you and then you buy the crafted goods off of them. That's really the only way you can do it 100% safe.
---
They restored items in vanilla. They were not new to the guild. He had been raiding with the guild since they started and was pretty geared out from the guild raids/crafting. I had been apart of the guild for 2 weeks or so. I had spoken with the person in question multiple times and helped him in BRD.
---
That source seems really unreliable I've had myself and others search the same parameters and get different outcomes from each other. From what I've heard Faerlina is quite balanced though.
---
I hope there's no flying in Shadowlands
---
Yeah, I don't understand this either.
---
It really is a bummer.
---
Because it’s not a healthy distribution? Some servers are 75/25. 
---
Which means that you will probably never get an AV running. 
---
Or you’ll play the same 10 people each time, where they get instant queue and you get 45 minute queue.
---
Its extremely easy to count how much +hit you have, its extremely hard to tell how much +hit you need, depending on what level mob you're fighting. That you will have to look up. You should be able to look up a +hit table for mob level vs your level.
---
its that dipshit allen brack
---
hes getting petty revenge for being wrong
---
"Liking to play the game on ez mode, knowing that you choose the safe faction with OP racials and go around griefing that you call PvP" 
---
How about yes
---
Go back to retail.
---
&gt;  e
---
Do you happen to have any vids/vods of your rag kills by any chance?
---
Practice.
---
I have stream proof of it happening on 11/9 after one of our Ony splits failed and we joined together for MC, so it at least wasn't fixed by then.
---
All 3 classes have good claim to those shoulders, so that seems fine to me. It’s just painful because they drop so rarely. 
---
And grats to the warrior... I still haven’t gotten my SGC.
---
Love horde thinking. 
---
Do something constantly to the point some servers are borderline unplayable? "this is fine alliance needs to stop whining! its called a PVP server noob!"
---
Alliance does the same thing back a few times? "HOW COULD THEY DO THIS!!!!! THIS ISN'T FAIR QQ"
---
Really appreciate that 2 horde druids came out of the woodwork to say this.
---
Yours truly,   
---
The 3rd Druid
---
I got people who won't let me run UBRS in a 10 man if I'm not 60. I'm also trying to progress in the game. Seeing as I'm 2 months behind.. yeah I'm playing catch up.
---
thank you.
---
I hate that little cute shitter.
---
I wanted a series about mandalorians or q mandalorian bounty hunter, not some fucking cute baby yoda created for the sol purpose of selling $50 stuffed animal toys.
---
Thank you for actually describing the problem.
---
My solution was in context to the proposed faction que. it will DEFINITELY not be fun for all the horde stuck on a horde only layer due to over population, if they where looking to "PvP (lol)" but they could still play the game. 
---
or they could sit in 2-3 hour faction based ques instead as the counter proposal to mine.
---
u cant just cut out the 16, you see the banana through the characters, its not that simple.
---
Let me spell this out for you:
---
WHEN WOW RELEASED IN 2004
---
THERE WAS NO PVP SYSTEM AT ALL
---
THE ONLY REASON TO KILL AN ENEMY FACTION PLAYER
---
WAS JUST FOR THE HELL OF IT
---
THAT'S how much of an afterthought PvP was.
---
How can that happen if the server transfers are free and we don't have his name? How does this help the victim in this situation?
---
basically.
---
Sorry man. Some people suck. If you happen to be on heartseeker, lemme know ide like to help you out some.
---
Summon Available? No? Nah, I'm good.
---
I get that by why can’t they change it by server?
---
Or have battle groups like I said.
---
He said he wouldn't do much PvP and only raid. LH makes sense in this scenario
---
Or people will just unsub from a game they can't enjoy. Too bad, so sad on your part. Something needs to be done.
---
I already quit yes. And a lot is doing the same as me. What are you doing when your Serv will be 90-10 ? So fun huh ?it's not punishment, it's about balance. If you have too much Q for you just swap faction or change server.
---
Praise the sun!
---
Dude wtf is wrong with you? OP is saying that he's new at the game and everyone is expecting him to lead when clearly he's still in the learning phase both in terms of his own role and navigating dungeons/boss fights.
---
And your response? "Omg you're so bad at this game L2P".
---
You seem like the typical asshole that very quickly gets on my ignore list (THANK GOD for being able to ignore people). 
---
Here's a secret for you: It's a game. Chill out. People are allowed to be new and learn and enjoy it without some douchebag (hint hint) yelling at them because they don't magically know everything when they're still new to the game.
---
Fucking gratz man. I had one drop way early in classic, then just a week ago I bought one off the neutral ah for 20g LOL. This reason alone is why you always check the neutral ah every now and then.
---
Honestly, I was thinking about keeping just one but I might keep both for two separate twinks. 
---
I also bought the PoD for 350g and sold it for 1.2k to I’m assuming a shaman. Then another popped up for 500g but I hesitated and couldn’t grab it in time.
---
That’s what cross realm is. You won’t be queuing with OCE servers without being on a OCE. Server.
---
Arcane Crystals. Thorium. I got +10 mining as earlier as I could. I saved up every bit of ore I mined and sold it all at materials or as grenades when phase 2 hit. I got lucky with some drops here and there. I also played the market early well before phase 2 on ore.
---
Idk doing 1k dps is fun to me. I dont do dungeons cause I respec herp derp
---
Good luck chuck?
---
So your solution to a problem is stop people from playing the game? Yeah horse shit solution at best.
---
I am going to. I opened up another ticket when I got home.
---
Bags are the most important thing starting fresh. Just dump a mageweave bag on every nub you see
---
Im the one who he tried to PM this LMAO. I was waiting for him to run DME
---
Heard 2 gunshots next door past midnight.(turned out they were having a party and shot in the air to celebrate..)
---
I was late game in a battle royale and just turned off the lights and kept playing for that chicken dinner. 
---
We got second but it was another level being afraid of getting shot in a game and rl at the same time.
---
good response for a retard.
---
the best part about /bonk is that if you don't have a target you bonk yourself
---
Cant fault yourself for trusting a guildie. Blizzard, on the other hand, should get their shit together.
---
There shouldn't have been layers in the first place, literally go back to retail.
---
Blizzard should have just launched Classic with a lot more realms, with restrictions to preserve some faction balance.
---
Overpopulation, the number of servers that had to be popped up after the fact because of the massive queues.
---
He didn't even have the pattern. It's really unfortunate because he was a big part of the raid and our guild is fairly successful in PVE and PVP.
---
I really, really hope they'll work around flying for anything that comes after classic. Bc would be ruined with flying. I'd rather play classic forever than bc with flying, but if they do bc without flying I'd play bc over classic any day.
---
cool
---
Hope this happens for me eventually.
---
And you are a god player, go ahead in hard mode : chose alliance.
---
You can farm them more easily probably too.
---
How would factions Qs make it literally unplayable? I'd rather wait a minute to log in than have to corpse run an hour just to get in BRM.
---
Guards are a threat to single players individually. But if the guards are chasing one player and that frees up an area for another player to then gank essentially without consequences, that’s all fair. Like that’s the game man, that’s PvP servers...
---
It's Blizzard. Classic to them is a mark of failure. The fact that a 15-year-old game has gained more traction than their polished and "perfected" retail WoW is a constant reminder to their devs that they have not been successful in the direction they took with their game. 
---
They will happily take your money (in the form of a general subscription), but they'll never give you more than a bare minimum of service as long as they don't absolutely have to.
---
Neither here nor there at this point dontcha think
---
Why are you guys just typing asterisks?
---
lmao, no my solution was litteraly to allow people to continue playing the game instead. can you fucking read you dimwit.
---
Lvl 54 paladin ripping a place appart? So you guys are doing Deadmines?
---
Thank you! I actually got it all in a ui package so it was very easy to set up
---
The amount of Mages that suddenly have spouse aggro after killing Jed Runewatcher is crazy high. I don't know what it is about Mage players that have aggressive partners but it's getting to be suspicious.
---
He explains the ending of it in the most recent podcast at the beginning
---
&gt; "Liking to play the game on ez mode, knowing that you choose the safe zerg faction,
---
  
---
 1. No one knew when they picked a server at the start that it would be dominant in one faction.  When you decided you were completely outnumbered, you should have moved servers.
---
&gt; with OP racials
---
 2.  Racials have nothing at all to do with this discussion.  I did pick my NE for their racials, but not because the world decide they were OP.
---
&gt; and go around griefing players that you call PvP"
---
 3. Griefing players comes with the territory on PVP servers and happens on every single one of them.
---
Go to a PvE server if you’re unhappy, idk what to tell you. And this is coming from an Alliance player, who’s been playing since Vanilla.
---
so you propose we go back in time instead? 
---
GeNiUS! durrp
---
We need paid character transfers like original classic. Only pvp to other pvp or pve servers with a month cd.
---
Blizz sucks at server management, let us decide.
---
I mean I can understand not letting in people who aren't 60 to UBRS (esp non-healers), but no ones gonna decline you from a raid because you don't have LHH.
---
You should of picked mount over helmet anyway.
---
If they are under 48 and don’t /spit or /lol at me I leave them alone but 48+ they getting the fat Swanton Bomb
---
I had a guild hunter take a second pair of giant stalker boots for a different enchant over my alt hunter (we run two raids a week)
---
So +7 stamina on second pair = 70hp, vs me getting 3pc giant stalker bonus which would have sped up my DMT solo runs considerably
---
all i see is lazy casuals who want loot without effort sorry not sorry
---
I bet you have a tiny penis =)
---
This is why I always have discord so if people need something crafted I get them to message me and let them know when/if I can get on for them usually can jump on for a few to help them out.
---
You also get rep
---
Gotcha. Didn’t think about it as I’m leveling combat but I assume you’re sub. Makes sense
---
threads like these is why pvp servers were removed in retail.
---
When the game forst popped there were so many try hard enhance shammys, i remember i put together a SMCath, it had warlock mage and 3 shammys. 2 enhance and 1 healer, the enhance guys had ravager and we were SMASHING this place. Honestly most ive ever ran with one group was that one, ran csth like 4 times and armory 3 times. Got me to 40
---
I do play on Earthfury. I just checked WoWHead's and another site's stats, one says there are slightly more horde, the other says it has slightly more alliance. Bottom line, it's not ALLY HEAVY like you pretend it is.
---
Well if hes gonna start grinding gold now hes not gonna be able to rank well. Spent all that time getn the offhand.
---
Question: since I’ve seen a lot of people talking about how regular dispels are in bg-pvp. As a warlock I’ve been doing open world pvp content as Soul Link. For BGs should I be soul link or deep destro, for more burst and less dots/durability.
---
I've run scans for like 15 mins and gotten nothing. Perhaps I am using parameters wrong, but I have literally found nothing using bid/buy out sniper
---
Armor isnt part of item budget. There's no reason you couldnt have plate shoulders with exactly the same hit/AP as Truestrike. Look at Lionheart Helm. Issue is that most plate is designed with a mindset that it needs to be "tanky" in some way, either by being an actual tank piece or having a bunch of stamina.
---
There are plenty of pieces of leather with high stamina or dodge that noone looks at (bar ferals) but there's just MORE pieces of leather that spend all their item budget on dps stats and dont waste points on excessive stamina or defense.
---
**Need before Greed**
---
&amp;
---
**BiS before Need**
---
It's very simple.
---
For starters there are a lot more possible variations. Besides people being able to wear more armor classes, which increases the pool of items, there are strength, agi, int, spirit and stamina on the pieces. A lot of classes have one main stat, but would be also quite interested in other stats - int for hunter, strength for rogues or warriors, stamina depending if you want PvP or not, and so on. Then you have all the resistances: Quite important in PvE, and if you watch the dueling tournament right now, some people assembled sets that have a high amount of let's say shadow resistance to have a better fighting chance against warlocks or shadows. If you look at 2hand weapons intended for melee dps, ~75% of them have some kind of unique effect. Then the trinkets, mainly engineering, that go beyond the simple "do more damage or deal damage"-effects of 95% of retail's trinkets.
---
You just have so many more options to customize your character's equipment because Classic's loot is more interesting.
---
you just helped raise his self-esteem
---
Good thing you aren't a dev. Your clownshoe approach would cost a lot of money to the business.
---
I couldn’t 2 man arena until I started using both of those so maybe
---
This sounds like way more work than just getting 1600 bananas.
---
My interactions with gms back in the day was a very noteworthy positive experience. They used to seem like a friendly wisecracking acquaintance who would go really far to right a wrong.
---
You have to pray to RNGesus. Didn’t you listen to the OP?
---
Pray to him and he shall deliver unto thee a bountiful harvest. With full faith one should divulge into honoring worship of RNGesus.
---
now do enhancement shamans :D
---
I was trying to do the helmet then farm up the rest of the gold for the mount. which wouldnt have taken THAT long.
---
And the vicious cycle continues.
---
I feel like a lot of horde players who are against this are people that dont want to sit in even greater queue for something they might not even be much interested in. 
---
Like if someone plays on a pvp server because he likes the concept of a pvp server but doesn't wanna go around open world pvp 24/7 but just wants to farm and do other pve stuff of course that person will not enjoy being put in a extra queue.
---
I have no idea how to properly fix this issue but i feel like faction queues are just a bandage fix that will upset a lot of people.
---
Remove it or put a 24 hour cd on it or something. Flying mounts killed the world and its one of the major reasons retail is so horrible.
---
I agree that you should try to continue escalating this, citing the obvious detriment this has to the overall health of the game, where community is everything.  
---
Sorry this happened to you.  I'm glad you shared and people can take measures to prevent more of this bullshit.
---
Depends a bit on what the players are asking for tbh. Players asking to fundamentally change the game probably won’t get very far; whereas, those asking to change the phase or content release schedule may.
---
He is great at 1v1 and cc though
---
Stay the fuck away from my Perditions Blade.
---
You call that pvp idiot ?
---
Get got
---
You're the only one that isn't laughing, including even the guy that got the belt
---
For the current content (MC/Ony) it's pointless
---
For later content (BWL) it's gonna be very very good as most guildies (20+ people) will be running this flask
---
But by then most guildie alchemist would have this so probably just sell it.
---
Kingkong.wmv
---
Wait, what?  My approach?  What is it you think I've cooked up for this?  All I've done is to dismantle your post point by point.  I didn't make some proposal on how things should be.
---
It's not an option in the default UI. You need to type:
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
What’s this from?
---
This completely ruins the fun of pally tanking. People who don't aoe on my pulls make me sad.
---
Come mister tally man tally me banana!
---
Shadow priest is bad in battlegrounds but good for solo world pvp, so if anything the time of shadow is now.
---
Gz on the mounts. Just wondering how the runecloth is increasingly useless? If anything I feel its more useful now on a pvp server, used for bandages and nades.
---
It's not that detailed.
---
I'm lvl32 right now I don't know anything about biS  but I went and bought the bloodrazor and the gut ripper dagger. Will I be ok if those two weapon to do casual pvp?
---
Ty
---
I hope some rogue ganks him and ye doesn't respawn.
---
That sucks man; I grounded the lion heart materials already as well. Non warriors won’t understand that brutal grind as one of the shittiest gold making classes. I can’t imagine being ripped off and being forced to do it again.
---
Not to derail your thread, but I just found Spellshock Leggings for 100 gold. WTF DO I DO NOW! I feel like I have to hold these for like a year or two
---
I could've guessed that you were an alliance player without the flair
---
you're a fucking momo
---
One post wanted oomkin buffs to make them viable.
---
Another guy wanted Tauren Paladin and Dwarf Shaman playable in Classic.
---
Right on, thanks man. Looks great!
---
Yeah I don't get why people are bashing it, they just didn't understand that invisibility is not stealth I guess?
---
Haha 10/10
---
You didn't dismantle anything. If you think you have you're a just confirming you're not a good thinker. 
---
"Just transfer over if you're outnumbered!" 
---
That's actually a suggestion from you like that devs (or players for that matter) would want faction imbalances that bad on any server.
---
I don't know what your talking about. All I see is fury warriors never getting invited to dungeons for competing with tank gear. No problems here
---
What do they do when Paladin/Shaman gear drops and your faction doesn't have one of those?
---
Sure kid.
---
&gt;Please understand though that direct support for Classic is limited
---
The fuck did I just read?! Can't make this shit up...
---
In shazzrah, it's the horde dominating and there are at least 4x the number of enemies constantly. Your server seems desert lol.
---
Interesting. Trying to imagine this one, they got feared out the window? Why were they in a raid?
---
Yeah that item is absolutely absurdly hard to farm. Hard to say though if classic will have a booming 49 twink community. I'd probably hold onto those until battlegrounds come out, then give it like a month or two after that.
---
nice cop out you dumb fuck lmfao. So you actually have nothing short of "don't go there" 
---
Obviously I haven't read any of the "thousands of posts on the subject" 
---
And since you mentioned it, if you actually had anything, you'd say it. but you don't.
---
fucking loser
---
"I gotta go cook, my wife's boyfriend is hungry"
---
You can have duplicate pet names.
---
I actually rerolled horde to play with friends but I havent changed my flair. But whys that?
---
Yep, as Shadow Priest it's a great dungeon item for most dungeons. A good Mp5 set helps you keep up with the rest of the group.
---
1 of 2 locks??Fuuck i lost T2 helmet 3 times
---
Seems very odd Blizzard won't get the mats back. They most certainly have logs of all of this taking place. The conversation between you two, the trading of the items, the server transfer.  
---
The game purposely makes recipes like this difficult to find, ensuring only a small hand full of people on a server have it. And they provide ZERO means for trading this many items to the crafter in any way that could be considered safe. Unless you craft these items for yourself, you will have to trade them 100s of G worth of items. It's borderline bullshit that they won't do anything to help people that get scammed by this.
---
Don't listen to the other idiots who don't know what they're talking about.
---
Holy reckoning only sacrifices 5% crit on heals and holy shock, appart from that you get the EXACT same utility of a dedicated healer build.
---
People hate paladins so much they call anything that deviates 6 points from a standard healing spec  a "meme" spec.
---
Jelly. Rerolling mage lol
---
Ok spectrum kid
---
Like some people said you got fucked but honestly you should have just let it be sharded. Because one your not healing atm two Druid gear will drop again and be sharded just a matter of when. If it had been me I’d have let them shard the piece to have a chance at the weapon because of this. But I’m glad you brought this up now so I can address how we should handle it in the future for my own guild. Personally I’m of the opinion hording PR just for a weapon drops hurts overall raid performance in the long run but I do get every players want for weapons. But in your case you literally only have a small selection of gear that also overlaps with mages,warlocks so even if you had gotten the staff I think you’d be dealing with drama. Because people are hungry for their upgrades now and they don’t understand that they will be waiting for upgrades for a while. The top two mage dps in our raid have not gotten a single drop in about 6 weeks of raiding. Granted they’re both at the top of PR because of this.
---
I remember one time on pservers, a level 30-ish bot somehow found its way into Burning Steppes, and it kept trying to go after a Mithril vein over and over, running right into a bunch of elites and dying, then respawning and immediately running at it again and dying to the elites again.
---
I even tried rezzing it, and it would immediately take the rez, only to run right into the elites and die again. Silly bot.
---
How much was it sold for? Do you know that? I just had the recipe drop and put it on AH for 10k just to see if someone buys it.
---
Came in expecting to be told not to life tap, got told to life tap instead, 10/10 would Comm you if this was FFXIV

---
What is fun and what is upsetting is literally subjective.  Some people think putting 420 in all their usernames because weed is cool mang is "fun".
---
Some people have more wit than that.
---
I swear horde players really do attract the more stupid of the population with comments like these.
---
I quit a month into cata. That's the most recent experience of retail I have. Just a troll :P
---
The mana regen only works while the shield is up, so it's terrible for pvp imo.
---
Sucs to suck.
---
and I thought two arcane crystals from one node were special.
---
You should, this is absolutely unreasonable and they will continue to make shitty decisions.
---
In the past week I've seen many players asking if **X** dungeon farming method was nerfed. I multibox and I'm certain they reduced the amount of Stratholme supply crates.
---
&gt; no people are going to transfer off a server that they are on the more popular faction to a server where it’s the opposite scenario
---
I think a lot of people would actually, the problem is just how imbalanced servers are. Nobody wants to be the 30% on a 70:30 server but sign me the fuck up for the 45% on a 55:45 server
---
If Blizzard sticks with #NoChanges: They'll be in BGs and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it, because #NoChAnGeS - that's how it was in Vanilla. Brace for just as many multiboxer bitch posts as there are P2 bitch posts.
---
If Blizzard changes this, then that begins the slippery slope of non-Vanilla changes.
---
This.Kills interaction world pvp etc..only thing i would hate if they relaunch TBC servers
---
&gt;nice cop out you dumb fuck lmfao. So you actually have nothing short of "don't go there" 
---
There was no cop out because I never said I would do anything, you're the one that asked for it and I have no obligation to do anything when there's literally hundreds of posts on it on this subreddit.
---
&gt;Obviously I haven't read any of the "thousands of posts on the subject" 
---
Considering you made yet another thread about the exact same issue, sounds about right.
---
&gt;And since you mentioned it, if you actually had anything, you'd say it. but you don't.
---
I have no intention to spoonfeed people when the information is on this subreddit and readily available with detailed guides that go into far more depth than I'd go into. 
---
&gt;fucking loser
---
QQ more buddy
---
Two different macros. One for cheapshot and one for expose. Macro starts at the #showtooltip of course.
---
The follow disable wasn't until MUCH later expansions; boxers could BG and Arena just fine throughout BC and Wrath, and I think Cata too. Beyond that I can't confirm.
---
NICE! Such a super late reply.  Enjoying our desimation by the horde?
---
I’m curious if people could do this to complete the Thrash Blade quest too, just requires Princess’s death to complete it.
---
I take it you've never seen a travel form druid do a 180 and run back into the enemy team.
---
I GOT THE BLACK LUNG POP
---
The warrior was probably tanking the run specifically for sgc
---
The recipe sold for 2.25 - 2.5 k on our AH on alliance in Bigglesworth.
---
Thats the thing about MMOs, you deal with people, and sometimes people can be very shitty.
---
Sorry this happened to you, and I think Blizzard's stance is probably justified. They don't want to deal with the he said/she said of a trade deal gone wrong. It isn't worth their time.
---
Hard not to trust someone in your guild. I would have fallen for it too. I would just sing your story to Trade chat for a few days just in case they didn't transfer. If you can send them mail, then they didn't transfer yet, and won't be able to. If your guild gets on board with you, have them send mail to him.
---
It's not "vanilla", but it would be great if items in a trade window could temporarily count towards a crafted item's requirements.  
---
So the buyer puts all the mats in the trade window, the crafter selects the recipe in their crafting window, the crafted item shows up in the crafter's side of the trade window. If both parties click "Accept", the item is crafted, the crafting materials are consumed, and the trade completes.
---
Never heard of this BFA you speak of.
---
Yes I'm taking things very literal since it makes a huge difference if youre talking about stealth or invisibility which is the exact reason for this thread in the first place. 
---
Also I'm a native German (read: precise/nit-picky) where "Heimlichkeit" is definitive not "Unsichtbarkeit", same for other combinations in english. You can have stealth taxes but they wont ever be invisible so it's just straight up wrong calling them synonyms which is the reason why I even made the effort of writing such a huge post.
---
Every one of your comments comes off as asshole ish, like you just want to argue over something stupid.
---
&gt;if you don't spend hours and hours and hours "helping people" for no benefit, you are a WARM BODY!
---
Nice.
---
You can't down rank dispels but you can down rank buffs/debuffs.
---
Literally will be farming just to pay Respec costs. I agree.
---
I’ve only removed 1 dps to make room for a guildie and I felt so bad I added the dude and tanked the dungeon for him the next day. It feels like shit when it’s done to you and it sucks to feel obligated to do it to someone. I have quit responding to tank request because I only get them when I’m actually in the open world trying to accomplish something. But yeh with travel times what they are if I’m to far away close to bed just not in the mood I don’t tank it.
---
I...I AM the banana king!!
---
Like this place is any better. We're like one content cycle drought away from posting pictures of warcraft cakes and macrame.
---
What you have against more people to play it in a rbg? Just curious.
---
Before the honor system I killed people because they were there.  I'm not going to stop just because they aren't worth honor.
---
I didnt knownpeople could play the game whole stuck behind a 3 hour que. I did read you dimwit and your solution is to prevent people from playing the game. Stop trying to play mr technicality you dimwit.
---
Its been this way since day 1. Blizzard has been consistent in allowing this to happen and not discouraging it.
---
GMs can look at chat logs. A screenshot doesn't really help any more than a date and time it all took place.
---
Grats on hotshots btw!
---
If I had to do 30 jumping jacks every time I was spat on in Searing Gorge on ONE death last week, I'd still be doing jumping jacks today.
---
Idk if you joined fight club yet but be sure and read the faq before asking basic questions.
---
I had this exact same thing happen to me on Sunday just gone.
---
GM said it's not normal practice unless a large number of people are affected.  But seeing as they could tell I hadn't taken part in a single boss or trash fight, they removed the lockout.
---
Had a guy leave raid and never logged on again. His excuse, “O shit cats on fire I gotta go!”.
---
All I see is *******************.
---
Yeah tbh = Fuck SGC
---
How is it hear say when I have screenshot of the conversation, screenshots of the items in my bags, screenshots of the 3 trades it took to transfer the items, and on top of this they have logs of it all? Seems pretty objective. 
---
They transferred within 10-20 minutes of the ordeal. I waited about 15 minutes so I wasn't "overreacting"
---
You could be so fit.
---
Also release faster, it makes it hurt a little less
---
Grey zones is definitely an asshole move but if you’re green, that’s fair game and easy honor. There’s nothing wrong with that.
---
Of course I'd be salty if one of the players contributing to our run being 2.5-3 hours rather than 1.5h gets loot over me. Literally wasting everyones time because you're too stuck up to respec. MC is piss easy and sitting in there for twice as long as you need to is not fun. Your reward should be more or less proportionate to the work you put in. Getting medals for attendence is what they do with the special needs kids.
---
On the upside shadow is amazing at farming!
---
...depending on spec.  Ugh.
---
Says the faction that has 3/4 male races hunched to the point of sucking their own weens
---
&gt; Standard 17/3/31
---
What kind of "standard" spec would that be? Impale as Deep Prot is an awful TPS increase.
---
The amount of bad advice in these threads is enormous, jesus
---
As a Druid tank I pay full price for my off spec peices which I only use for PvP. That goes for everyone, off spec or main spec, if you want it you pay full price or it gets disenchanted. Sometimes it isn't even off spec, there are items that I will only ever use for supression room in BWL. End of the day this boils down to the guild having loot rules and you either accept and respect them or move on. There are plenty of guilds that run loot council or something else. 
---
Just be mindful that by running a meme spec you need to manage your guild rep well and arguing with officers is not a good idea.
---
Noggenfogge works too
---
I’ve had to check my ego multiple times I’m usually glad I did
---
go arms for slice and dice
---
The funny question here is: what are you doing in wie Monday morning 8:45? 😉
---
To be honest that would be an insta black list for me and kick if I'm the raid lead. Could even talk to the person's GL if they are in one.
---
They just want to use you for your tanking akillz
---
This is the way it should be.
---
Bro... 
---
59.5 int = 1% crit. 1% crit does NOT equal 59.5 int. You implying archmage belt has 60 int due to the crit % is your own falsely made up logic.
---
you actually fucking idiot, read the post. faction balanced layers would mean you can STILL play the game and this post was in proposal TO faction based ques, where you couldn't. 
---
You only read my COMMENT about someone complaining about the fucking economy of layers, so I said, ok then sit in a que *instead* 
---
You're actually so stupid it fucking hurts.
---
legit fuck off now.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. There are many minor tweaks such as this that should be added and only have a minimal risk of causing harm to the game. I love classic, but we shouldn't be puritanical about no changes. 
---
It is my expectation that the sheer popularity of wow classic leads to classic+. I don't mind if it's new content, tweaks such as you suggest, or improved versions of tbc/wotlk. But I reckon we'll get something because of how many of us want it :). 
---
It's important we keep asking!
---
I imagine heart of fire increases somewhat, but fire resistance potions will no longer be as demanded by P5.
---
Because this is classic and we are behind the curve. You shouldn’t be anywhere near WPL at 51 at this stage in my opinion. You want to aim to be over levelled for every zone. When a 60 wants me dead I still die, but by being slightly over levelled for the zones I can avoid the roads as much as possible and everything becomes much smoother.
---
Yep. Retail looks like a god dang jrpg now
---
Holy shit see a therapist. This game shouldnt make someone so upset like this.
---
Always goes like this lmao
---
Netherwind is pretty awesome imo.
---
If you can't see your target when they die, you get no honor. Whether they vanish/stealth or just run out of your render distance.
---
I'm a warlock and I was chasing down a rogue ganking at the FP in Menethil Harbor. I dotted him up and gave chase. The chase lasted long enough that he left combat. Dude simply stealthed before the final killing tick of the DoT and denied me any honor. 
---
Another time there was a similar situation when I was partying with a rogue. Enemy rogue stealthed before the kill, and my friend had perception up. I got no honor, but he got the full amount for seeing the death as though it were a solo kill.
---
This is how it seems to work to me. And yeah it sort of blows.
---
Ahkey, so i may have overpriced it slightly\^\^ Thx for the response tho that gives me an idea atleast.
---
+1 for conroc, great for new warriors
---
If I was making an excuse I always went with something obviously false because I'd feel bad lying. I think my most common was "AFK my cats on fire"
---
Calm down, Debbie Downer
---
Incendius is amazing
---
that's fine, but I better expect help/tips/support to be the next words out of your mouth lol.
---
There isa fine line between a joke, and being a complete asshole.
---
if and when some new good quality private server comes out i'll be switching in an instant.
---
-huge faction imbalance due to blizzard's mismanagement of the servers and refusal to do anything to prevent/correct it like faction specific queues
---
-unplayable lag in large scale wpvp
---
-less customer service than they had in vanila because they fired so many of their employees to save $
---
-bugs that don't get fixed or get fixed slower than some of the better pservers were able to
---
and we're paying $15 for the priviledge
---
i had a massively better experience playing on nostalrius than classic.
---
If they’ve farmed up previously and have their stuff in order, they are raid loggers. Having previously farmed doesn’t negate current status.
---
Yeah getting corpse camped 10v1 as a level 54 rogue in felwood is the pvp that I was hoping for
---
&gt;  is that there is basically no reason to roll Alliance.
---
Paladins.
---
ok
---
I could give a shit less about my reputation in a guild that doesn't care about me after 2 months. The officers are almost all full geared, one of them is the resto druid. Said resto druid also paid nothing for his gear under the new system.
---
Duel 20 mages in one night.  You need to know what they are trying to do before you have a chance to counter it.  Practice
---
“Taking grandma to her BJJ class”
---
Definitely not my experience; for the most part people roll on the items that are upgrades for them (even if PreBiS for another party member).
---
Some examples that stuck out to me: I (rogue) lost a HoJ to a Hunter who didn't have a second trinket (nevermind that Blackhand's Breadth and the hunter class trinket are both much better).
---
A bear tank I PUGed with lost Frostbite Girdle to a different hunter who then proceeded to win a Cadaverous Belt later in the instance over myself.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is fucking hunters
---
&gt; Look at aggregate data combined for both factions on all servers. In general there isn’t that many more horde players then alliance overall when you consider every server combined holistically. And the bg’s are cross realm. If you’re thinking you’re going to get some sort of divine retribution for being camped in the form bg que times then you’re likely to be disappointed. 
---
Lol, look at this Horde player whose fucking delusional about queue times.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure Horde players are gonna get instant queues into BG's and everything is gonna be just fine friend. You're totally *not* gonna be stuck in 30 minute queues ever. /s 
---
L.O.L.
---
Nobody? I'm playing with like-minded players that think sitting 3 hours through something that doesn't need to take more than 1-1.5h or even less is stupid. You should play as good as you can out of respect to your guild mates. Intentionally playing something that will slow everyone down is a dick move. Especially since a lot of people have limited time to play. Some people actually want to get shit done in a timely manner and progress their character.
---
When I call out of work just cause I want a day, off (when I know it's going to be slow anyway) I usually come up with dumb excuses.  
---
 "My roommates cat needs a bath. I cant come in today"  
---
"I've forgotten how doorknobs work. I'm trapped in my house. Calling out."   
---
"I cant figure out which shoe goes on which foot. Stuck at home."   
---
 
---
Etcetera. He weirdly appreciates it as most people just lie or come "sick" the day after a holiday or three day weekend. Gunna have to start stealing some of these wow excuses people use.
---
I usually grab the boss, have a dps war tank first add, other pally tank takes 2nd add. If i get conflag i just cleanse it with bubble, click bubble off, then divine favor / holy shock / judgement. Never needed to kite boss.
---
Sorry, are you arguing that OS should just never cost anything for anyone? Or are you saying that you should get a special exemption? Because special exemptions are bad ideas. 
---
Anyways this is a classic issue with DKP systems. You just kind of have to play the system, and in this case that means letting the boots get sharded. I'm not sure why you put 'guild bank' in quotes, if it's anything like my guild it has basically no money that either went to tank stuff like Rag FR, raidwide buffs like Annihilator, or simply saving up for when content is like actually hard.
---
Not unpopular when literally everyone who played on private servers agrees with you.
---
Gotta use that Paranoia on your Felhunter son!
---
I mean if you had solid arguments it would but all it’s been so far is why do people who put more time and effort into the guild get better picks for loot.
---
Let's be honest guys, this is the truee vanilla experience. How could we be truly re-emmersed in vanilla wow's gameplay without having the doomsayers and people constantly demanding change and improvements. Not even having the availability of retail, readily available, can quench their un-ending thirst.
---
I genuinely do have a question, are people demanding classic wow be changed because they think its shit unlike retail, or do people say its a failure, and also hate retail
---
In a similar vein, I'd love to see the option to skin a mob IN the loot window. So I loot it and I get a chance to skin it, all while staying engaged with the mob. Because fuck you if you're a devilsaur skin thief. That shit ain't cool.
---
&gt; We're like one content cycle drought away from posting pictures of warcraft cakes and macrame.
---
Preferable to all the whining IMO.
---
It's just whichever faction is dominant. I can't leave any major cities as a horde player on Heartseeker right now. There's alliance players in gank squads and camping fps 24/7
---
You have buffs in beginning of a bg's and if you die once and lose them all, so that scenario every fight is unlikely. Good players will just see a dot tic for no damage and not dispel it. No one dispels just shadow weaving...Paladins never go oom and healing priest have good mana pools. You just stated you use rank 1 forts in fights, why? You either don't have normal fort up cause you died and didn't put it back on or it got dispelled...By yourself you have shadow protection, inner fire, fort, and fearward (ally)/Touch of weakness (horde). That's 2 priest/shaman dispels. Every two hand warrior with a pocket healer will crush you. You aren't a hero class. You're useless compared a mage that could fill your slot. Been playing a shadow priest since retail and like 6 private servers. We excel in 1v1 and against decent premades we're worthless. Spriest just waste a spot, sorry.
---
Absolutely, I'd say this phase has been very, very detrimental to the health of the game.  I'm finding myself quite bored at the moment because I cant PVP effectively and cant farm.  I don't need gear from any 60 dungeons and running them for fun can only go so far.
---
I mean, it's an RPG. I respect what this guy did to OP. Sorry for your loss, but you played yourself.
---
At least we both agree on something
---
you stupid fuck the faction que is NOT MY suggestion I only gave reference to " you can have this instead then" so shut the fuck up you actual moron.
---
Holy crap why do people like you exist, I fucking hate idiots like the plague
---
I do mess FRESH!
---
Cool, I get to be a sheep for 30 seconds before I die now!
---
You’re the extreme minority
---
Ditto bud
---
Schwabing?
---
That’s a load of piss, I’ve gotten items returned to me in Vanilla when someone scammed me. 
---
So no, that’s not always been the result of these kinds of situations.
---
That came later, bg doesn’t give Xp in classic.
---
How would faction based queuing work? Lock out factions based on the logged-in population at the time? Also a horrible idea.
---
is the horde way :)
---
Ya it only took 10 hours to queue in, very smooth launch
---
Blizzard saw profits and went for it
---
It happened in early vanilla, but not in patch 1.12 which classic is based from. In patch 2.0 they brought it back as a feature for BC release, a month or so before bc actually released, so those last couple raids in vanilla were back to potentially dropping useless gear.
---
Mara waterfall run is one of the best 5mans in the game what are you talking about
---
This wont happen now. In vanilla I could 1v3 rogues. Everyone knows how to play know. Only class that really counters me is rogue and if the rogue has shadow reflector its just gg.
---
Wow what a great post.  Never seen this before
---
SPriest is a good flag room guard. Plenty good at pealing for the flag carrier, as well; fear bomb and spam rank 1 swp for stuns. Nothing wrong with dropping shadow to heal, either.
---
This is literally not #nOcHaNgEs - I’ve had something similar happen to me back in vanilla - got all my items back.
---
I never understood making an argument out of nothing.
---
Nobody is arguing against you. At all.
---
Classic is not trying to be like private servers. Classic is emulating what the game was really like in Vanilla.
---
Classic is not comparable to private servers at all, and vice versa. They’re quite literally different games. 
---
They’re as comparable as Dota and League of Legends, or CoD and Overwatch.
---
Some fundamental similarities in gameplay, but vastly different application.
---
It's not about raid logging, it's about being prepared. I have enough consumables to raidlog into AQ so I could do that, but if you don't have 10k gold worth of items you will be worse than someone that prepares for a raid every week.
---
No. If that name is already taken or they reserve it on a separate account they get a free name change. If you have them on Bnet you can follow them however.
---
CS on private servers was very sketchy.
---
You dont seem the type of person to give person sage advice on mental health tbh.
---
Or just let ppl pay half dkp or roll for off spec/pvp?
---
Ret is ok until max level when gear does so much more for everyone else than it does for you.
---
More specifically, the period between honor introduction and bgs did not age well.
---
Everyone welcomes this aspect of battleground release! A non-frustrating outlet of PVP.
---
If you find one please PM me.
---
What is this pathfinder version you speak of?
---
not really a scam, he just took your stuff
---
Good.
---
Hunting solo players is more of a Horde thing since you run into Horde groups every 30 seconds if you do PvP as Alliance in EPL/WPL.
---
Thanks for the chuckle
---
You can make a case for any class being boring. There are bread and butter abilities, and then there are the nuances. The skill and effort lies in timing and strategy.
---
It hasnt been that long and [just because people are playing, it doesnt mean they necessarily enjoy it] . I'm mostly raid logging because i still have fun in raids and i'll come back for BGs but i've a friend who's farming honor like crazy and hating it, he only does it ''to have fun later'' by having the PVP gear.
---
What server you on?
---
Soo the question is: Wich caster class do your GM Play?
---
you can't even use a boat on my server. there's a horde raid team on every single one of them. portals are the only way across the atm.
---
How does that work
---
"Then the past couple weeks, they started enforcing 50% cost on OS rolls, even if nobody else can equip it".
---
I can see where you're coming from but this sentence stands out for me. You agreed to those rules by not leaving, and you can't expect that because you play a low slot number class you wouldn't be affected by it.
---
I also feel like you maybe underestimated how hard it would be to gear a spec like Moonkin. 
---
I know I did with my SP: my guild is using ms&gt;os roll with a 1 loot per id rule AND I am allowed to roll on anything I need no prio even for Benediction or Toep. As you can guess I felt this was really fair.. Except now after 7 weeks of raiding I lost every roll, which is RNG except I am now rolling against guildies that have looted 3-5 pieces from their tier. Add to that new recruits and am starting to realise that I might go months without seeing a piece while everyone else is getting stuff. It's frustrating because I feel like I can't progress the character but that's the nature of the spec under any other loot rule than loot council. (And even a loot council would only give something to the shadow as a reward for attendance).
---
&gt;supports it
---
is this what support looks like?
---
I expected a full wipe not barely 1/4 dying total. Meh..
---
Don’t worry about BIS till you hit 54+ unless you’re going to stop lvling at 39 for pvp
---
All the edgy kinds and the ones who think they're hardcore rolled Horde. Most plebs rolled Alliance, but also the real hardcore players rolled Alliance because they want a target rich environment for easy honor and short BG queues.
---
Wow lol, it’s like being a kid and caught red handed in the act of doing something bad at your moms house, Your mom catches u off guard and you shoot upright and she’s like “what r you doing Johnny?” and your like “nothing, I was doing nothing, I won’t do it anymore I swear!”
---
While in a duel, a fellow faction member is hostile to you. You can mind control the other faction and hit the person you're dueling to remove honorless target from the person that just landed. Then you can kill them for full honor.
---
Hi, just recently found a recipe for swiftness potions, what would be a good price for the AH? Or would I be better off learning alchemy and selling them myself?
---
I know what he hopes for, but it's just not realistic.
---
Sure you've made the :1 happy because they get instantly into the game whenever they want (which is what he's asking for - let me in, and make all the horde wait in line so I don't have to be ganked), but now the 10: horde all quit. 
---
You can't guarantee that chunks of a faction don't quit a server and leave the balance out of wack.  That's why they have cross-realm BGs, so that everyone has a better chance (in theory) of getting a game.
---
If it turns out that over the entire population of Classic, that it's not even close to being balanced, well nothing fixes that.  You can't force people to the other faction.
---
Cross realm bg’s means we probably won’t see one hour queues. Unless blizzard fucks that up... which is completely possible.
---
I got a Helm of Narv I sold for 6 gold after it wouldn't sell for 3 weeks.
---
WTF?  I never heard about anything like this back in the day.  What is with people now?  After Jokerd acting like Ninja looting is okay and then bullshit like this.  I've killed off mobs around a chest just to have some asshole run in and steal it from me.  That shit never happened during Vanilla days.  You should always be able to trust a guild member.  Blizzs' response is completely unacceptable.
---
What does BIS stand for?
---
More like why Arbys gotta do him dirty like that
---
This, I purposefully choose the underdog side of the server.
---
If you feel like you are rushing to 60, min/maxing all the time, you won't have fun.
---
If you engage with the feel of being mobbed / camped and plotting your revenge on those same people, fun.
---
Most 2h warriors will still do fury for lvling I’m fairly certain not sure why the guides advise you not to
---
Do you have any idea how much that would cost
---
Great post but unfortunately it will be removed for low effort by some mod.
---
Shame.
---
Yup. Had the epic caster robe AND THE RING drop in Scholo and I passed them all to our warlock (I am a healer) and he's like but the robe is better for healers... and I had to tell him that I was literally one orb away from truefaith and I wouldn't need it.
---
He sent me the damn orb. 
---
What a champ.
---
Thunderfury
---
Then why don’t people do it? And yeah a 55:45 server wouldn’t be considered that unbalanced at all
---
Its possible.
---
How’s the horde to alliance ratio?
---
Better than landing into 10 horde camping Morgan’s Vigil.
---
Play a horde on west fall it’s about 75% ally 25% horde.
---
If you want changes your a fucking idiot and don't understand the point of classic.
---
Go play retail.
---
&gt; The ~~Horde~~ *Forsaken* have a quest that makes them kill an innocent puppy.
---
&gt; So, yes, we are at war with those monsters.
---
As a tauren, there are a handful of quests that I will simply never do. And almost all of them give Undercity rep.
---
Melting faces!You can dispel in shadowform and good ones will do it.AoE instant fear can be clutch in many situations,crazy buffing for locks,silence/mana burn 
---
Shield on flag carier ,buffs ,etc etc.A good shadowpriest can be tremendous force to dominate Bgs and i hope i get to play with some.On my server in vanilla a priest named Theplague dominated got to HW rank
---
The nochanges crowd is gonna be real sad in a year or two when they don't have a game to play when a few objectively good adjustments could easily ensure the longevity of the game.
---
&gt; “nothing, I was doing nothing, I won’t do it anymore I swear!”
---
Wat? Dude didn't deny it. It was a "Hey, I said no cookies before dinner." "Aight."
---
Please help, I’m addicted to multi boxing &amp; now I can only pay half my rent because I used $300 on WoW subs.
---
Which side did you roll? Sucks to be horde I’m sure.
---
First of all I wasn't the one that downvoted you, and two, aggro starting on the tank vs a non tank is beneficial regardless. There's almost no benefit to having a hunter pull over a tank unless he's doing some feign death bullshit to pull fewer mobs.
---
Raid logging is taking PVE to the point where it is as close to a single player game as possible.
---
Casual players accidentally locking themselves (even if it's their own fault) just means they don't play for a week though, it's almost like people don't want classic to succeed sometimes.
---
Interesting. It doesn’t seem like it’s breaking any rules. Do they expect priests to just not use mind control then?
---
It didn't start until we were worth honor so your point is invalid.
---
&gt;People keep downvoting me but I am having fun making fun of people, 
---
Prick
---
I’m just sharing my experience and knowledge having played both classes.
---
&gt; Then why don’t people do it? 
---
Because faction transfers don't exist, and nobody wants to reroll from a geared 60
---
No.
---
This has been my experience for the past 3 days its putting me off the game. I wanna PvP but not while im level 53 and against a full group of 60 horde myself, getting really frustrating I just log and go back to overwatch now.
---
Whaddya mean?
---
bind ur spells
---
I’m planning to stop lvling at 49 so I can use my blood razor.
---
Yes and no. I think Alchemy is hands down the best profession in the game, but not as an addition to Herbalism. I mean, I don't know about you, but I can't even remember the last time I farmed herbs myself. Everything is absolutely overfarmed on my server. I just buy herbs whenever they're low, craft pots and sell them when they're high.
---
Maybe you had more luck farming yourself.
---
all i see are two melons
---
I completely understand you
---
For invisibility, there is only Lesser Invisibility Potions (and the Succubus pet Lesser Invisibility) and Invisibility Potions. The former lasts 15 seconds (5 min for Succubus pet); the latter lasts 18 seconds.
---
For detection, there is Lesser Invisibility (both a warlock ability and an elixir), Invisibility (warlock only), and Greater Invisibility (also warlock only). I suspect that Lesser Invisibility cannot detect someone using Invisibility potions. I don't think there's a difference in Detect Invisibility and Detect Greater Invisibility. It might be a relic from a plan to give mages an Invisibility spell and a Greater Invisibility spell.
---
You're alliance, your buffs are getting dispelled by shamans and priests within the first 5 minutes of a game. What you're left with is a dot that gets dispelled, a short range low dps channeled slow that leaves you susceptible to interrupts and a 1.5s cast nuke with 42.85% spell power coefficient and a cooldown.
---
When you're playing against opponents who know what they're doing one of three things are going to happen. Dispels go out, you get CC'd and ignored, or you get mana drained and ignored.
---
Found the horde
---
I'm not sure you understand, he'd have access to the entire resto tree for raiding...
---
And the entire balance tree for /dancing.

Incendius have an amazing Horde/Alliance balance.  I get a queue like once a week for 20 minutes.  If you start on incendius I'll hook you up with some bags.  I'm also due to level another alt if you are looking for a partner.  Good luck !
---
They might be called out on it, but it doesn’t stop the proliferation of the use, obviously. 
---
Plenty of other YouTube videos market these types of ideas as a one shot. People wouldn’t do this were it not working and, to some extent, sticking.
---
I’d again AGREE it’s a misuse of the term, but just because it’s a misuse doesn’t mean it will stop the term from be using differently until it’s normalized and it’s underlying meaning changed, amended, or added to.
---
All because you couldn't be bothered to wait 20 seconds to kill someone.
---
They don't even get sharded because the vendor price is higher than the cost of a large brilliant shard on the AH

*broken mechanic

Rip monitor
---
So...in short.....people you meet online are assholes and scam you. But for reals though I feel for you buddy. I hope they give you your stuff back and ban him for that.
---
not on the micro level.  He's not answering CS tickets and being a dick.  But he gets briefed on this kind of shit. He knows what level of support he is giving.  He can say fix it, or he can say fuck it.  He's playing Warcraft 3 with us and we're the little fwd base with only 3 little peons harvesting shit with one Grunt on D, while all his time is invested working on the games he likes.
---
Yeah. Fuck the 3+ months you’ve invested in your character!
---
What a shit guild leader.
---
Clever use of in game mechanics, be more careful.
---
There's nothing stopping you! Come on over to the dark side, we have cookies
---
If you are on a pvp server and can only dungeon to level right now you should stick to wind fury and sweeping strikes. Don’t hit fury till you are 60 pal.
---
Still not convinced Death Grips exist. Haven't seen them drop a single time yet. Farmed 10 abomination stitchings this Sunday for my carapace breastplate. Still no gloves. Getting close to exalted with AD. Send help.
---
Poor choice, movement speed is bis stat and you chose helmet instead
---
Fury to level 40 then swap to arms
---
So what are you supposed to do if you see someone with the honorless target buff? Just wait for it to fall off and then kill them? 
---
This way seems faster
---
It's not broken and doesn't need to be fixed. People need to adapt
---
The other points I can certainly understand but...
---
&gt;• Gold selling is potentially even worse
---
How is this possibly the case? Every pserver I played on had way, way, WAY more gold spam than I see in Classic. In my entire time playing Classic, I think I've seen maybe 20 gold spam messages in total. That's less than I'd see stepping inside a city one time on a particularly populated pserver.
---
ok boomer
---
It's 3% so I always wondered, is it 3% per tap or 3% per vein? 3% per tap makes more sense right.
---
It's not terrible, but except for BOP drops you can just mail any BoE's to an alt with 1 disenchanting and disenchant even MC epics to achieve the same result.
---
Having it on your main means you can DE any BOP items from dungeons which can be really good, but if you don't dungeon too much or don't get many BoP drops, I wouldn't say it's too worth it.
---
Dude you're fighting a combat cleared up 15 years ago, deal with it.no changes or back to retail!
---
You logged into a game to stare at you char at bank? You have seriuous problems dude; you realize you can be “done” with this game as you will eventuwlly do whole content and move on right?
---
Yeah I agree actually.
---
This is how it feels when I play against Diddy in Smash
---
Bank'thok provides a lot more DPS but archmage is superior for PvP
---
It's almost like the honorless target buff has a purpose or something...
---
NAH
---
Rolling need on an item because you COULD use it one day when someone in the group will use it right now is pretty much the definition of loot whoring
---
Unfortunately you cannot.
---
People have PM'd Blizzard and their general response is that they won't perform any switch-backs.
---
.... They're honorless. That's the point. 
---
Wait. Or kill them and don't get honor.
---
Yea, the argument of "you only want wpvp to kill lower levels that cant fight back" - will become our only source of honor farming effectively. 
---
I will also take a step back on my crying about it being released "too soon" since i looked and its only 2 weeks sooner than retail vanilla did it which has about the same impact as DM being released 2 weeks early (like they did). 
---
Either way, those crying because they cant level anymore... better get your ass in gear cause soon you wont even have people to help you - which were the ones i primarily looked for.
---
Mate back off i’m level 45 warlock and am still using the ring from dead mines (level 17 dungeon).
---
So, it’s pretty obvious here that you had an agenda coming into this post. 🤷‍♀️
---
&gt;I know what he hopes for, but it's just not realistic.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Sure you've made the :1 happy because they get instantly into the game whenever they want (which is what he's asking for - let me in, and make all the horde wait in line so I don't have to be ganked), but now the 10: horde all quit. 
---
&gt;You can't guarantee that chunks of a faction don't quit a server and leave the balance out of wack.  That's why they have cross-realm BGs, so that everyone has a better chance (in theory) of getting a game.
---
I mean most of the Horde dominated servers have free server transfers no? I could be mistaken on that. Same with Alliance on Heartseeker. I didnt know Faerlina was a streamer server till I made it to 24 and there were still massive queues so I could have either transferred off or rolled Alliance which I chose the latter.   
---
I dont believe theres an easy simple solution like OP is suggesting, but I do think it would mitigate some of the more drastically unbalanced servers.   
---
I have heard but havent seen proof (and I haven't looked for any to be honest) that overall populations for each server far outweigh the populations in original Wow. Maybe if that was addressed by releasing more servers? I'm not really sure. Again, I'm on a somewhat Horde favored server (Incendius) trying to make the final push to 60. I get ganked a fair amount which is part of the game, but I cant fathom how difficult it has to be for Alliance on other servers or Horde on Heartseeker
---
Yes you're supposed to wait. This was intentional to make it not so lucrative to kill people who only just landed.
---
Valid points but even the outdated data shows overall it’s not horde favored by 60/40. It’s pretty close to 50/50 overall. Granted this is all based around how they do cross realm bg’s. 20-25 minute queues I wouldn’t be surprised by. &gt;30 I would.
---
so herb it is then:, i dont do many dungs on rogue
---
You know you get xp based on dmg dealt to the mob right?
---
Eh I'm happy with mine.
---
&gt; It's not the "Developer's fault" but they are the arbiters in this situation and it costs them very little to restore these items - they are virtual items.
---
I am just guessing here, but suppose Blizzard did restore items lost to scams and "scams".
---
If they did that then I could get a couple thousand gold worth of mats together and arrange for my buddy to "scam" them from me. Then my buddy sells the mats cheap, launders the gold to make it hard to track who benefited from it and passes it back to me via a cutout account or two.
---
Then a couple of days later I report the "scam" to Blizzard and ask for my mats back.
---
The person-hours required to analyse all the transactions involved, flag ones that seemed unusual, check to see if the accounts had common histories and so on would be significant, to say the least.
---
Basically it would either enable mass duping of mats, or it would involve a really major amount of serious effort by competent investigators to sort out each time. The path of least hassle for Blizzard is to never dupe mats, just restore deleted ones and delete stolen ones.
---
Note: he is a YELLOW npc - so he will not auto aggro you. He is usually located in the middle of the instance between live and dead side, or on the way to live strat.
---
I will agree that spell batching is crap, it’s fucked me numerous times in dungeons as a healer and it’s something I wish they would take a poll on with classic players because I bet a majority of us would vote it out.
---
I say the same about the pirated server community currently destroying the game with "wpvp".
---
OK, keep corpse walking solo, like a fucking driod. Jesus this sub is hopeless.
---
The mob's level isn't necessarily the skinning difficulty though is it?
---
The honorless target buff seems kinda pointless. The level 48 doesn’t stand a chance so it’s better to just die as fast as possible to save time.
---
Well I don’t know how long the honorless target buff lasts but I know that if I land from a flight and there’s a lvl 60 waiting for me I’d rather it be over with as fast as possible and not have him stalk me until the buff wears off
---
Come to think of it, I think they must have changed chat messages, because I no longer keep getting "You were invited to &lt;channel&gt; and you have it blocked."
---
&gt;Why would blizzard deal with something like this? Isn't it just part of playing an MMO?
---
That might make sense, IF they couldn't just xfer servers.
---
&gt;or improved versions of tbc/wotlk
---
It's just gonna be the same old TBC no improvements is my guess. It's the easiest thing for them to do with the least likelihood of pissing people off
---
&gt; Traveling in wow was so fun in vanilla
---
Yet r/classicwow wants to be able to get teleported to the instant without travel, lol.
---
2.7 million tons of ordinance was dropped on Germany during the war. This was spread over around 1.3 million bombs of various sizes. Around 10% did not explode.
---
The Kampfmittelbeseitigungsdienst (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Service) deactivates an unexploded bomb around once every 2 weeks on average.
---
Some of he larger British and American bombs uncovered require mass evacuation of tens of thousands of people. While these are rare in terms of total number of deactivations, they still happen fairly often. Recent mass evacuations occurred in 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. You can read about them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance#Germany).
---

Not op and not related to ops post but this is actually quite common in Germany. Enjoy the drunk reading of the article.
---
Weak auras is the answer.
---
For a hunter strikers mark gets replaced in a month tops. For melee it won't likely be replaced until aq. Tiny difference, but fuck everyone that isn't me, right?
---
Frankly, I think its just too late for them to do faction based queues. If they had done that at the beginning, yeah it would have been fine, but at this point its just as likely to make someone quit then transfer.
---
There isn't a great solution. We could merge mismatched servers, but overcrowding is already an issue. They could offer Horde the ability to faction change to Alliance, but Paladins/Shamans cause issues.
---
I think the most likely solution is Blizzard just offers Alliance on unbalanced servers a transfer to a PvE server and accept that world PvP failed on those realms.
---
That's funny considering my raid's impale prot tank has 41% crit, 43 if given lotp.
---
Look I get #nochanges but I’m behind the players deciding by a large majority what should be and shouldn’t be implemented. Just my opinion.
---
This is not a ninja, it's a scam.
---
You don’t FAP? Warriors are op and go arms with a HOJ. Fury is only viable for raids.
---
Lame
---
And yet, if current activity on PvP servers is any judge, most PvPers are rolling Horde.  Most people either don't know or don't care, and it remains to be seen if having paladins in BGs will swing people towards Alliance.  I highly doubt that'll happen.
---
Thank you for your feedback
---
Well you can think it's a good idea to vote on all the stuff you want, but that doesn't really make even that a good idea.
---
What you're saying is that huge streamers with loads of followers could dictate how the game changes and there's nothing you could do about it if they want some change you hate, other than to just stop playing.
---
Ya, it's meant to be a cold war with isolated border skirmishes/proxy battles (BGs) until Varian declares war on the Horde after discovering the Forsaken had been developing blight and performing horrific experiments for years at the end of Battle for the Undercity.
---
Listen to old episodes of countdown to classic which is not only a great wow classic podcast but one of the best podcast I've ever listened to. Very sad to see it ending.
---
Yeah then u can take turns at rich thorium veins
---
Two episodes,not 3.
---
It's not about "things happening out in the world". It's about griefing by abusing a mechanic to destroy others experiences.
---
You might be right, but I have my hopes!
---
I'm most optimistic about our chances for small changes, such as 'warning you are about to get locked to this raid ID', which I think we have good odds ot getting :). Even the order we've received content in is an improvement over vanilla in my opinion - such as getting dire maul already. I'd prefer bigger changes, such as tbc redesigned without flying mounts, but agree that the odds for those are lower.
---
Still, if we want bigger changes making that demand known is the best way to maximize our odds! We also get to have some fun discussions along the way :)
---
"I've lost that sense of community!"  hahah
---
And then you res right at the flight point where they're camping and they kill you again?
---
A 20 second head start is a hell of a nice thing to have if you're trying to get to a destination or turn in quests etc.
---
The ol' they cannot afford it without microtransaction excuse eh?!   What a crock of shit...  They're taking $15 a month from us, and giving NOTHING in return.
---
Good
---
If pallys got crusader strike youd see their population explode.
---
What
---
Im already playing the server minority lmao
---
Seems like he is a warrior
---
That's how it works lol. You don't get 1 skill-up after the first maybe 150 points. 299-300 needs like 10 skins of "orange" skins.
---
Had someone did this for me, like how to tank Scholomance properly. I appreciate it, you guys are the MVPs!
---
Blizzard will not support victims of scams or ninjas. They made this pretty clear after many posts that were made here. They said to name and shame on your server and set up black lists, because they will not intervene for such things.
---
It'd certainly help.  Spiritual Attunment and the reverse taunt would also help, because it'd make paladins more than boring heal/cleanse/buff bots.  But that's \#changes and we can't have that.
---
Dang did the horde farm them into extinction?

It legit happened to me when I was 20: parents on holiday, had a party night beforre and at 5 am burglars try to get into my house but they set off my door alarm and ran away. Was so smashed I did not notice, but my neighbours did and called the police. Was woken up by 2 policemen asking if I was the legal resident of my home, got my bong and stash on the table but I was half naked/baked and the situation was so awkward they just looked away and went downstairs. Ended up paying a fine for disturbance of peace because my alarm was ringing for like 3 hours XD

I had a similar experience . During my usual strat UD farm runs for rep barons epic sword drop . 3/5 was guild and so myself being a hunter and another hunter passed on it so our main tank could have it to himself . I assumed it could be useful to our warrior guildie in PvP or something . Anyways come to find out it’s purely cosmetic and people only use it for the speed boost which apparently is a major increase I was a bit sad/salty  I didn’t atleast roll on it . However everything made it better when we all meet in org to see him use it . The excitement in my guild mates voice and those around us  in discord who at first didn’t even believe it dropped , it was a cool experience and Us 5 could quit possibly the first people on the server to witness that drop . I sat back and thought this is just a game and I’m happy for my guild mate , and that’s one of the things I love about classic .
---
Dude today both ah and flight master were chain killed on EU Morgraine alliance couldn't go anywhere couldn't do anything.
---
Loot council rewarding people for out of raid performance. Yikes that's a shit use of loot council.
---
Hello Mr Molten Core Hardcore Professional can you please teach us how to get that “skill” you write about??
---
There isn’t any skill in 90% of vanilla or classic besides the actual problem of getting 40 people together. That’s why LFR is literally the best thing Blizzard created, and no I don’t want to listen to mouth breathers telling me what to do.
---
You wanna do your skill raid go do them and avoid LFR, you don’t need to use it.
---
You do realize there are high-skill opportunities that existed in Vanilla because of spell-batching, right?
---
They aren't keeping this shit around just cuz, lol. It's here because it completely alters the way the game is played.
---
If someone has the ability to craft Lionheart's Helm, trust me, they are LOADED. Ask them to come back to you when they have the money. They should have it in AT MOST 1 week. People with the recipe ask for a ton of gold in tips.
---
&gt; the Honor system is probably the most poorly designed PvP reward structure I've ever seen,
---
I prefer it over the BC honor system, here people just afked at spawn points until they got enough honor.
---
At least with WPvP, you have to be at your keyboard pressing buttons, and people who press buttons better or going to rank faster.
---
My momma always said to not take free server transfers from strangers
---
What's that green dotted line you got going there on your monitor?
---
You guys are so deluded if you think this is a good system.
---
I've never bothered with collateral or even worrying about trades because I assumed Blizz would actually do the right thing in this situation.
---
It's beyond depressing that this is the official stance, too bad so sad, now fuck off and farm the mats and hope it doesn't happen again.
---
I'm not subbed anymore but this would make me want to unsub, shithouse policy.
---
One of ours does this too but with full world buffs and consumables (yes, our guild does that stuff, don't judge us)
---
Love it

Good to know.

I usually just look up the epic because there is some overlap. If you look up freezing band you'll see it's basically any mob from 50-54.
---
He won it and kept his green +24 ish stam chest on for the rest of the run.
---
If it's an OS item that 2 people want making the winner pay makes sense, if it's an item only 1 person can use or disenchant he shouldn't have to pay...
---
Yeah, I'll still kill you.
---
I was looking at AQ and Naxx gear last night and it's insane how much more damage is on gear/weapons while the stamina on items really doesn't go up that much. Phase4+ PvP is going to be a little yikes.
---
Wondering the same thing mate
---
Dude that sucks.
---
It'd be like a weird kind of in-game closure
---
-_-
---
It’s just how skinning works. Otherwise it would only take 300 mobs to get to 300 skinning
---
Can be the same for herbalism/mining too 250+. Very rare but can happen
---
What does this mean? Something about how his mechanic works?
---
A steel weapon chain at low level is a small price to pay to be the best tank at high level.

---
Imagine posting a video of yourself using botting software
---
We did but it's far more active now.
---
State that up front in dungeons and see how much harder it is to find a tank or healer.
---
Half the tanks and healers are dps who just want to find a group faster.
---
Huh?
---
If your guild gears officers first it is a shit guild.
---
Except he very clearly doesn't understand the mechanics behind it. Crit&gt;hit once you're at the yellow cap, and the bis list reflects this because it you are in full pre raid bis you're obviously at the yellow hit cap.
---
I'm terrible at pvp but I just destroy almost everyone in my guild when they duel me because shadow priests are just too insane right now.
---
Lol where are you getting 100g an hour  aoe farming?
---
Yeah position on aggro list really depends on your raids DPS in phase 2 though.
---
Sharding. Look it up. It’s a code feature of retail and it’s what you’re asking for
---
Straw here, more shiny straws there.. folks running around in fears. Oh honors !!
---
And without it that server is eventually going to lose all their alliance players but hey at least you’ll be able to log into your 95/5 horde dominated pvp serv.
---
Can't have the horde griefing each other. That would be to toxic.
---
Pre-made ques were always very long, which means most people will solo que. They’re not going to want to wait an hour or more for a pop when they can play in 10 minutes. 
---
That means going into capitals to que and zoning back into capitals when you’re out. 
---
The PvP heavy spots will be those close to the capitals. Plague lands will be rough, so will Azshara. 
---
Blasted Lands, STV, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes, Un’Goro, etc should be a little less packed with 60s. The farther away from the battle masters, the fewer people camping you. 
---
Also, most people know by know not to Rez if they’re camping gy or turtling. Sure, you can follow our wisps around, but you’re not going to rack up honor when everyone stays dead.
---
Long story short, people are idiots, and they can't do much more than read bis lists.    +int is actually stupidly overpowered right now, and no sees it.   If a fight lasts a few seconds, then your regen is a joke, and +int is stupidly powerful.    
---
For instance, 60 second fight.  1 int is 15 mana.  15 mana over 60 seconds = 0.25 mana per second = 1.25 mp5
---
Get that?  1 int = 1.25 mp5
---
Now compare that to the item budget cost of actual mp5.   It's insane.
---
The benefit here being there's a lot of casuals/scrubs around unlike say private servers. It should reduce the hardcore aspect of BGs, and that should make premades rarer at least.
---
It was a pug, MS &gt; OS +1. I won and apparently it makes people upset.
---
You will not be effective using this build until you are at a higher level, because you won't have cold snap to get an eviscerate crit.  You are FAR better off using a combat swords build until you are a higher level.
---
I know that might not be exciting, but you need to trust me on this.  Having Blade Flurry and Adrenaline Rush is sooooo good for leveling, and tbh, most of the PvP at your level will be getting ganked by higher level players, so it doesn't really matter what build you have.
---
Regarding improved ambush, you'll need daggers for that spec, and it's much easier to get good swords at your level instead of good daggers.
---
That would be cool
---
It’s possible to get 2 or more crystals from a single vein. So it has to be 3% per tap.
---
The exploit isn't that *you are removing honorless target*.
---
The exploit is that you are *preventing other players on your faction from splitting the honor with you*.
---
You're right, I should have just played horde like everyone else. Lol
---
Any priest that spams flash heals on raids is bad, or just was never taught how to properly play.
---
90% of the time you’re spam healing a tank you want to use Heal, the highest rank level 40 something spell. It is low mana cost and gets the most out of your +healing gear for the cost of mana.
---
That said, i think more priests should value stamina over int/spirit. Im tired of watching priests in my guild die on stuff they shouldnt be since they have such low health. cant heal anyone if you’re dead all the time...
---
depends.. Personally, if someone is going to equip the item I have no problem letting them have it.  I don't care if it's an upgrade or w/e.  Gold is easy to get, that guy will be telling his friend about this amazing gun he got and be super happy and hyped to play the game.. I have no problem with it at all.  That being said, if someone is rolling need against them I'll have to also roll need.
---
When someone rolls greed and others greed roll need and I win it I'll also let them roll against my winning roll.  There doesn't have to be drama here.
---
He did when he offered suggested topics for people to discuss on said thread. Are you dull?
---
Seems like but actually.
---
I have a ton of “lock/spriest items” on my Mage.... because there was no lock or spriest in the group and I won the greed roll. Sometimes I throw em on because I like the look.
---
How is this hard to understand?
---
Knowing it triggers weirdos is kinda cool though, will enjoy the sperg.
---
He's still getting the same utility out of it though, even if there's no competition. You're going to upset people if someone is getting geared for 'free' while they have to pay. So better to not have exceptions. You're going to have cases in the future where everyone in a more populated class has an item and the last guy gets it for free? How is that going to make the people who paid feel?
---
Ahh, a man of culture I see.
---
I don’t understand what’s the point of allowing pvp servers to eventually turn entirely horde, making the server trash. 
---
Seems like both factions should want servers to prosper. But for some reason the horde are self destructive and want to continue this course.
---
I think more importantly, only the duelers get the mana

You might want to look into item restoration. I’m not 100% sure if recipes can be recovered but it wouldn’t hurt to look. Item restoration can be found in battle.net. Another route if the self serve item restoration does not work could be to submit a ticket with a game master
---
Let's be honest, you want easy money, which unfortunately not even crafting professions can provide you. If you're an enchanter you're going to need recipes from raids to make any real money, and then you're gonna be spamming trade chat from org bank LFW. If you don't have the rare recipes, then it's trawling the AH for cheap crafting mats to turn into potions or w/e and resell. Honestly with herbing you just walk around and pick herbs off the ground and AH them, it's easily the most chill profession there is imo.
---
I just rerolled on a pve server for the same reason I was 52 and couldn’t do a damn thing - even take a boat or flight path - without being ganked. I’m so much happier on a PVE server. It’s sad, I liked world pvp generally, but the nonstop ganking was ridiculous.
---
For me, its more that it changes the focus from the group to the individual.
---
It doesn't feel like gearing up my guild anymore. It feels like individuals just gearing up themselves.
---
Had a hunter in BFD complain about getting salv instead of might. His argument was "this is BFD not MC". I then proceeded to point out that blessing of might only gives *melee* attack power and it shut him right up.
---
How anyone even complains about getting buffs is beyond me, much less a buff that reduces the chances of them dying due to taking aggro. When I played my mage main I practically begged pallies to keep blessing of salvation on me at all times.
---
Lol this is the dumbest, most deluded comment. Im coming back to your posts on 12/11 when it dawns on you that horde have 30-40 min queues on NA for BGs and its no longer "fine" lmao
---
I just find it funny how the thread was about someone who got scammed on classic and by some magic it became "retail bad classic good" for no real reason lol
---
If he can drop 15g whenever he wants to respec, it's absolutely *not* hard to get daggers.  I had the best non-epic dagger the AH had the entire way to 60.
---
SAD.
---
20 points gets you all the major mitigation talents and defiance.
---
It's really only worth going past that if you plan to get shield slam.
---
But 20/31/0 is just a dps build wearing a shield and plate, really.
---
I’m curious what his spec build and rotation is?
---
Yet they won't do anything about duel honor trading.
---
See now, that same scenario in Canada wouldn't even be a problem.
---
I mean I literally said I was in my other comment.
---
But glad to know you have no counterargument and are just insulting me instead. :)
---
Sorry I just read your first sentence.  The answer is yes.
---
How is this faster than standard leveling if both are assisting each other while only one gets the exP?
---
as a horde player on a horde majority pvp server i agree 100%
---
This is one slippery post
---
For raid gear I can agree with that, but for dungeons.. if you need the item you roll need on it.  It's really that simple.  MS &gt; OS means nothing in dungeons.
---
thanks man
---
Raiding in retail is certainly more difficult.
---
PvP is just as difficult in both, but in different ways.
---
It would take a full weekend of steady wins to get to exalted. Nobody is getting exalted in 6 hours let alone one game.
---
yeah ok retail boy. and yes all the complainers are retail boys but dont seem to know it.
---
On one hand it would fall to balance, those players stay. 
---
On the other hand, alliance leave, horde have nothing to fight, horde leave, and now everyone loses. 
---
I pick the first option.
---
Do you have one of those mouses with only 1 button?
---
&gt;Most people are having great time or so many servers wouldn't be full during work days.
---
People absolutely hated the thought of dailies but millions logged in every day just to do them then complain about them.
---
that's really fucking good, if you can make 50g an hour you just got each month of game time for 2 hours of grinding.  
---
I used to grind out in an hour every day just to pay for a month of game time.
---
Think of it as Space John Wick. Except his dog isn’t dead, and it can use space magic.
---
When most fights last 30sec-1min, it doesn’t matter what spells you use. You often just spam flash heal because you’re just looking to snipe heals as best you can.
---
Many realize why they are healing in this fashion. It’s when they don’t understand this that they are actually bad.
---
Yeah I think I tend to agree with you actually...if you're able to explain yourself and show there's justification and logic behind a decision most people will accept it.
---
LMFTFY: Feral druid ravage's defenseless lizard to death.
---
Reminds me of [this](https://imgur.com/upFdXSR)
---
Very horde dominated. Every FP camped and IF constantly attacked.
---
The problem isn’t that people disnt consent to PvP, it’s that they didn’t consent to being 1/3 of the population on a server with way higher densities than vanilla.
---
I loved through the first P2 as Horde, when we were the minority faction. This is fucking insane compared to it.
---
There are just fucking Horde *everywhere*. I ran out to grind in south Azshara. That naga temple in BFE with shit drops you have to run through all the elites to get to.
---
Within 5 mins of grinding a bank squad started camping me.
---
I just went to one of the 3 locations out of ~40 in the middle of nowhere I know that you can grind to level in peace left.
---
The map was literally not designed for this kind of imbalance. It’s untennable. I’m fine, Inlike to grind and still have some places no one would even think to do so - but holy shit.
---
Get the rank10 set
---
If you want balanced and fun you need an alliance character. Come join us on Incendius we could use more people to balance out the population.
---
Hipsters gonna hipster.
---
Out of curiousity, what does your spec look like?
---

---
Loot council funneling gear to warriors... boooooo
---
...but there wouldn't be 1,000 people camping flight paths if Priests were allowed to do this Mind Control thing. People on the same faction as the Priests would naturally go somewhere else to find honor. Which means less people at flight masters, which should be *good* for the game IMO.
---
I thought you came here looking for a private server, judging by the title. "Fun servers" used to be private servers where they had added alot of stuff.
---
Benediction seems like server for you! Very balanced in terms of pop, plenty of opportunities of getting into shenanigans without the worry of being camped for hours on end, and is a high pop server with.. get this... NO QUEUES!
---
Back in vinilla I had a buddy who called me and told me he just lost a bg for me...a few weeks prior I had crashed at his appartment complex and my car got towed out costing me hundreds of dollars. So he took it upon himself, upon seeing the same tow tow again to ninja him way to it and slash their tires while they were checking peoples tags. That's a true friend.
---
I just did a full Emp Run and then finished jail break with a 54 warrior and 54 priest.
---
You lucked out that group sucked if they think 57 is too low lol
---
My 22 year old cat named Cali passed this week. Seeing this warms my heart.
---
Main tank in Molton core ... before team speak and vent... types “ bear” and goes motionless while on baron.., we wipe and sit around waiting on him to take the Rez. Comes back and says a bear tried to get in his house thru his kitchen door.
---
You missed the point.
---
For any one in the guild if an OS piece drops and no one else wants it then they shouldn't have to bid on it either.
---
If more populated classes have to roll then so be it, that's literally how all loot works you can then have them complain why do they have to pay more for mainspec because 8 mages are bidding on an item where as the 2 druids pay less because they only bid vs each other.
---
Useast.
---
6:45 where'd that warrior learn to flicker strike :o
---
Gave that little guy 10s yesterday for his weapon training when he jumped out on me in an alley IF (and asked politely).
---
I feel like you're confused about what's happening in these situations.
---
Camp Mojache, Feralas. Ez 300 fishing on horde.
---
This is an empowering post, but I find it funny this whole sub seems to think that only Alliance are getting camped.
---
I just spent an hour getting into LBRS.
---
Bigger question is why he has kick and orc racial not on a keybind
---
I was invited to the cat funeral as well, but I had to mow the lawn that day.
---
It was nerfed recently, buff only works around prison area in brd now
---
No, but giant growth makes you very slightly bigger than fire water
---
The show has been dope so far.
---
Pally tank in Strat/Scholo is even better due to being able to use Exorcism and Holy Wrath. It boosts damage and generates massive threat thanks to righteous fury.
---
Where did it drop for you?
---
Pretty sure it's weapon imbues. You have to type the poison into the what to track section or it won't show anything. 
---
I had a hell of a time with weapon enchants with my shaman. However, I figured it out by typing in the EXACT spell(s) to track. 
---
Create a separate icon for each imbue on main hand. Then separate ones for off hand. Make sure to put every rank in these icons (ex. Deadly Poison II, III, etc)
---
You have to use a custom texture too or they will all look the same. i.e. type in crippling poison in the custom texture box for crippling poison and so on.
---
Is enhance shm a meme spec? I have guildies reaching out to my 59 shm all the time for dungeons. Decent dps, great group buffs and damage mitigation depending on the situation (like +60 resist). I can offtank or completely shut down a caster mob. 1500 instant heal has saved us from wipe a few times. And off healing for tough bosses when healer goes oom so they can get a few spirit ticks.
---
Not sure anyone would mind if shamans became paladins, and paladins became shamans, on transfer. 
---
But I'm not speculating on if blizzard will or will not do this. Just if they should. 
---
I don't see them offering transfers.
---
Top post is horde and people on pve servers. Bottom post is alliance on pvp servers.
---
Not enough to get exalted in one weekend
---
Had a hunter need roll HoJ 2 days ago when everyone else passed on it for me a rogue.  Everyone yelled at the guy but I said it is what it is. It’s just a game and didn’t let it bother me.  Ended up getting it to drop again the next day in my angerforge duo farm with my buddy.
---
Please... If anything, it's gotten a lot cheaper.   You are talking out of your ass mate.
---
I want no cross realm pvp.  Fuck this, let the horde stew in 30-45-1 hour long queues.  #nochanges
---
How does wanting maybe, just maybe, the ability to actually land mean they want to be "untouchable". I wish you clowns would stop dismissing every discussion about this with your "go to a PvE server idiocy.
---
I feel like it actually goes the other way.
---
With personal loot, you aren't hoarding dkp for a drop or hoping the lc pick you or hoping your roll Is the highest.
---
It basically takes loot out of the equation so now all that is left is you and your team working together to down the boss.
---
Keep in mind you need to queue at the battlemaster.  So it will only be really prevalent in queue zones or near queue zones.
---
Wait - I don't follow the reset method. If you reset all instances on your alt it resets on your main??
---
Also, do books drop from the lashers?
---
Not to self: never group with this guy
---
Which guilds transferred?
---
&gt; The world PvP is going to be insane for like a week or two, and then it'll die down a bit.
---
hello it's day 11 and it's still horrible.
---
Heartseeker
---
you just posted your char name and a bannable program.. why bro
---
I think you're supposed to make it a raid, then make someone leader. Not sure about them being offline tho. Thought you log out and they reset
---
also from destromath, weird to see it mentioned (not a very popular server). I played horde and never experienced anything like I am today.
---
how does it not make sense? are you dense?
---
&gt;You realize spending at least an hour to get into a dungeon is worse than entering a queue and watch netflix right?
---
you really think it's preferable to have to corpse hop for an hour to get into any dungeon for alliance, than it is for horde to have to wait in queue for an hour? and they can do other things while they wait, watch shows, browse the internet, be productive irl, whatever.
---
i think if you'd prefer corpse running for an hour to get anything done vs waiting an hour to get in the game you're in the minority. both options you're not getting anything done, but at least one you're not putting in effort to get nothing done. not sure how that doesn't make sense for you. who in their right mind enjoys corpse running besides masochists?
---
Imagine thinking WoW Classic pvp takes skill. It doesn’t, it’s just a fucking Zerg. You shitty ass players would be begging for help if it was 1v1. Don’t try to pretend it’s fun being 5-10 deep against 1 - 4 people.
---
Not really - most pvp squads have a warlock. Just have the leader queue up and summon him to wherever you're ganking.
---
Arms/Fury Warriors one of my favourites as a bear :)

SWP r1 shouldn't be used unless your oom or you're chasing a FC. I've had times where I casted it 10-15 times and get one blackout proc. Spriest suck solo flag guarding. They just get cc'd. Rogue comes in sap (you use trinket), he opens stuns and you die. Sheep polys, you silence, then he ice blocks/counterspell then does it again. Hunter comes in...lays trap/vipersting. Druid comes in gets past main room puts hots up on him lives through dots runs with flag. Literally so many scenarios where they suck flag room, especially now that the shadow reflector is meta. If you're going to be doing something you stay midfield / offense. You should be picking off the solos going that try to help flag carrier. You should be mind visioning FC on their side and providing intel (which a disc priest can do).
---
You should be able to murder level 1s with infernals and be fine. They nerfed it to the ground in classic because fun detected fun removed policy, but it is still possible to do and I never even got a warning for it.
---
&gt; For any one in the guild if an OS piece drops and no one else wants it then they shouldn't have to bid on it either.
---
Think about this situation: you have 3 warlocks, A B C. They all kind of want a piece of Felheart gear which is PvP offspec. Week 1 warlock A gets it and pays. Week 2 warlock B gets it and pays. Week 3 warlock C gets it for free automatically? Giving warlock C an leg up on the other two for mageblade? From the perspective of warlocks A and B that is some unfair horseshit.
---
Gtg toilet bowl is on fire.
---
Yes. You're right. I never said they shouldn't do anything. I said they shouldn't do faction queues.
---
engineers are gotten a lot cheaper? what are you even on about. We are going through one of the biggest tech boom in history, salary for comp-sci have absolutely skyrocket.
---
Just a few years ago FB was paying 100k right out of college, now they're paying 140k (including bonus/stock) based for newb with zero experience. Anyone with experience is getting 200k+
---
That's not exactly helpful.
---
You can put it on a skinning knife for a home made heirloom.
---
This is my absolute least favorite form of pvp. Trapping people where they can’t even leave to go do something. Just forcing people to log off.
---
3 rogues and nothing else. With 3 saps, 3 blinds, 3 cheap shots, 3 kidney shots, 3 gouges, and 3 evasions, nothing is impossible.
---
No, sorry, this was in Bochum back in 2006 or something. Been a while.
---
Bochum in 2005/6
---
They nerfed it either right before bc or right after. Hunters are op right now lol.
---
Quality content, OP.
---
Yeah, the place I was staying was just outside of the radius, but they informed us anyway. As I recall I said "thanks" and went back to LBRS &gt;\_&gt;
---
Even if they're 10g you've had like 2 months to do nothing but farm and make money lol. Spend it on consumes or spend it on repairs... tough call...
---
Then you get cc'd until the buff is gone, and now you'll spend an extra 40 seconds or whatever every runback. Congratulations
---
Here’s what it’s going to be like.
---
BGs are going to be flooded with tryhards in full / near full raid gear, engineering, pots and a 10+ trinket set. The fact that so many people will be running with so many trinkets and bombs, deflectors and nets will alter BGs in such a way that it just won’t be a fun experience and certainly nothing like it was before.
---
&gt; but the fact that Blizzard's CS team said they don't support classic is the much bigger issue here. 
---
That's not at all what they said... They said classic items are unsupported by CS, which we already knew. Blizzard said long before Classic release that they will NOT be taking actions in helping people who lost and/or miss-looted items in Classic.
---
Lol. I was with him. Thank you by the way.
---
Op was warned for Mindcorlling and forcing them to hit a duel person.
---
I guess if by efficient you mean the dungeon is going to take 8 years longer because you're doing no real damage
---
Co-sign. P2 is miserable, classic world PvP is absolutely terrible. I’m very excited to grind the AV mount though.
---
Subarashi.
---
if only you knew the original comment was a funny RP post
---
What spec allows you to 1v40 the Zerg guild cancer? Asking so I can swap to it
---
LMAOOOO OP delete !
---
Yea, but these fury prots always assume they are in a guild that will push DPS. Im sure plenty of people on reddit will claim they are in such a guild, but Im willing to bet more people are in regular guilds where such threat just isnt needed right now (and possibly ever).
---
you farmed up over 700 gold worth of mats and you're not even 60? LOL you deserve to get scammed
---
someone has been pickpocketing brd
---
you never cut engineers unless you have to, they are your bloodline. what you are implying goes against basic supply and demand. Salary dont balloon because companies are hirong fewer people, there is a severe shortage of people with comp sci degree atm
---
Besides employee counts are available for many tech firms. Easily checkable
---
I see, the ping is better from US East then West right? I mean geographically, that makes sense but who bloody knows.
---
As for raid times, I'm pretty flexible.. i'm sure I could find something if needed.
---
15 sp for 1 hit seems way overvalued
---
I do not, but I can take on next Sunday if you want.
---
Lol rolled your ass
---
By master loot do u mean them adding the 2 hour trade window to raid gear?  Master loot is still around
---
people want to moan about everything, sad that blizzard is so willing to cave in
---
Here's the problem with that. When fights last a few seconds, you probably aren't even going to use all your mana so the extra INT is as redundant (marginal crit gains aside) as regen. The breakpoint for when regen beats out raw stats and becomes valuable is very early and not too far removed from the point at which both are redundant.
---
The truth is that at the low end, Truefaith and some comparable blue gear (like Exalted) are very close, with Truefaith being a marginal gain. However, Truefaith still has benefits on several levels (inc giving you extra safety margins when the math isn't as simple as just idealized statweighting) , and they only grow as content progresses.
---
The takeaway should be: Is Truefaith good, yes. Are Robes of the Exalted and similar items good, yes. Should you pass up the latter for the former, no, they are still worth getting. Should you pass up the former if you have the latter, no, Truefaith is still something that should be on your radar as an upgrade. People who go to the trouble of getting it are not idiots.
---
Also Truefaith just looks better. Fite me.
---
That being said, there are still many situations where people need to stop looking at the BiS lists and think about what they need to accomplish a task. There are several areas (like solo farming) where raw stats shine, and you should endeavour to maintain a decent choice of gear to apply as necessity demands.
---
Im sincerely upset a giant kodo didnt flop down rjght as the cast finished ruining this video.
---
No lmao
---
Thank you. I needed to hear this. 
---

A rogue who keeps losing leather rolls to DPS warriors
---
&gt;  When fights last a few seconds, you probably aren't even going to use all your mana so the extra INT is as redundant
---
That's even more true of your regen.
---
Your friends the problem of this game right now
---
i raid log and i enjoy the game. theres just nothing to do right now except farm gold or run around in a pvp zerg, neither of those options are fun to me. i just like to raid man.
---
Just fucking ban anything to do with this shit, who cares
---
There's no way to remove the honorless target buff on another player.
---
Had another hunter quit a WC group before it even started because neither of us had Venomstrike and he didn't want to risk losing the roll to me IF it dropped.
---
Oh man I'm saving this one
---
Oh please.  You could say that about any class in PVP.
---
How do you plan on transferring it when you get back?
---
From my experience pugs will always need healers. They are more beneficial to the battleground than spriest. Usually the team with better healers for pugs wins. I hate healing in raids but in BG's is super fun to me. If I join a pug as shadow and it seems were getting stomped due to lack of healing, I will swap to my healing gear and stay on a geared warrior. So its situational. If i see a team just dispelling my dots over and over I just heal and CC.
---
Ok boomer
---
Why?  Shadow dominates in BGs.
---
If your tryin to make gold u might as well go to zf btw
---
Nope. Skinning is way worse money.
---
Just flip between the two modes, or use the appropriate one for the zone you're in.
---
So what do you do once all servers have a horde (slight) majority, and all of them have a horde queue ?  
---
Annoyingly, the horde is the majority of playerbase, from a business perspective implementing a faction queue is screwing over your majority... so why would you do it ?  
---
Who is going to transfer to the 'weaker' side, the side that doesn't fight back, the side that gets ridiculed at Blizzard's largest event, remember the pve battleground announcement and 'You're welcome Alliance' at Blizzcon ?  
---
\#nochanges needs to stop, and for the game to truly balance itself out without screwing over people who just want to play with friends, humans and night elves need to get their wotlk racials (emfh and combat shadowmeld) to stand a fighting chance.
---
Theres waaaay more tryhards in classic. Virtually every person is twinked out now.
---
PvP? Benediction!!
---
Im not really a fan of asmon anyway, he so dry and doesnt really make OC anymore. He even said in one his reaction vids something along the lines of "i hate people that enjoy the game"
---
im already level 60, so i should clarify i don't care as much about how easy it works with leveling, just the moneymaking + how chill it is. so for example, for tailoring, i care less about how well it scales with leveling and i already have decent gear from raiding a bit. in that sense, would you still recommend the profession?
---
&gt; farming as a mage is probably better.
---
farming what? 
---
&gt; The other option is Fishing
---
btw isn't fishing a 'third' profession like first aid?
---
It's just skinning being special, it doesn't follow the rule of the other profressions
---
I love this guy
---
Screenshot or it didn't happen.
---
Yes! and hes profession vids
---
Also, /who &lt;level range&gt;.
---
Pay particular attention to hybrids - prot or ret paladins, bear druids, shamans of any stripe bring a lot of utility.
---
Sugoi
---
&gt; So? That's true of your spirit and mp5 as well. Int basically is regen.
---
That's the point... With short fights and popping mana pots and runes you don't need spirit, int or mp5. That's why +healing and truefaith are so good.
---
I had my felhunter out and pissed off a rogue who was stealthing around Everlook by following him around and emoting at him. Pissed him off so bad he attacked me and I sat there and laughed as he got netted and killed by the guards. It was hilarious.
---
Still bis for them. Just don’t take other melee dps in your groups
---
Tried it, deleted everything after what you suggested didn't work. Giant red border still there

The hand of Ragnaros or whatever his punt is called, targets the characters whose names were created first on the server, it’s some weird mechanic yeah

Lmao, that's for people who believe they have spirit animals or whatever
---
If you're on the original 4 servers sure. But there are 2-3x that many servers filled with people who are significantly less hardcore about the game.
---
Important to realize server culture exists and it's not the same for everyone.

Maybe you should take [these](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08aeebf8d1ad435b08e2ccec0416a0b542fb2ca/607_336_2552_1531/master/2552.png?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5444f3971e4391b3f26b7160e4a47b6e) off.
---
And what do you do with more +healing?   You downrank to conserve mana, even if you don't really need to.
---
Makes sense
---
Lol
---
 DR. That's cute.
---
ok sounds good :)
---
You might check your servers forum, discord or see if they have a subreddit
---
That's hilarious
---
I did transfer. I transfered to a alliance heavy server as horde. And im loving it. You guys bitch and moan about everything.
---
They do, but ally on PVE won't pvp in the same percentage as horde on PVP servers. Queue times will vary depending on battlegroups, but there WILL be queues. Only question is how bad they will be.
---
Joining and starting are vastly different things.
---
" Edit: My first Reddit silver! Thank you random stranger! I am really  happy everyone is enjoying the post. It’s nice reading other people’s  stories and experiences. I hope everyone has a great week and the the  rng gods favor them! "

Why do people lose their shit when they get Silvered, as if some random stranger agreeing with your opinion should have any merit whatsoever...
---
&gt;Freezing band is never bis, if you want to run frozen wrath set and freezing band your gonna run into trouble at ragnaros where you have 0 mana where the alternative rings give a lot of int and stam and similar sp so you can actually finish the fight.
---
That's not how bis works, it's all about damage. Mage has about a thousand ways to supplement mana expenditure, so you won't run out of mana on any fight in MC at least. Additionally, mage is also extremely survivable on rag with gfpp + fire ward
---
This is pretty nuts, he actually spent REAL money to steal ingame mats and transfer off server to sell them?
---
There's clever uses of mechanics, and then there's exploits that break the rules of the game.
---
Sounds like a shit guild
---
Yeah
---
Yea that's not how it works when you are paying for access to a service. But I'm sure you feel good talking to your fifth graders that way.
---
Curious about the MT drama &gt;:)
---
&gt;Artificial insemination works for every sexual orientation.
---
a lesbian woman cannot provide her lesbian partner 1/2 of the genetics needed to create human life. A man's sperm is needed. In the example of a lesbian couple going to a sperm bank. the woman that is not impregnated has zero genetic influence on the offspring.   
---
In the case with 2 gay men. Neither of the gay men can provide the other half of the genetic material needed to create human life. A woman's egg is needed. This means that 1 of the guys will have zero genetic influence on the offspring.   
---
Gay people have been around since the dawn of mankind. Technology that is needed to let them procreate does not even exist. Artificial insemination and test tube babies only let 1/2 of the gay people pass on their DNA to their children.
---
You mean Anathema!!
---
You're missing the point. Mages and Rogues literally can't get honor at a flight path if there is a Priest abusing this. Only the Priest and his party can.
---
I cringe and say I agree a little. Capped at 5g is waaaay too low though.
---
First respec is 1g? Then 5g per each next respec up to a maximum of 50g per repsec. After a month of no respec it goes down 5g (if this is true for classic). So basically you have to respec 10 times before you cap.  
---
The monthly depreciation respec cost could be changed to biweekly or could be adjusted to /2. Or the cap could be adjusted to 30g.  
---
Switching specs should not cost less then repairing gear.
---
DR in Classic wut
---
You ever watch the dueling tournaments? Mages cast 40 second long sheeps multiple times on the same person to reset the duel, it's insane.
---
That site shows Incendius as 52-48 in favor of Alliance at 60 but [this is what it looked like trying to get to BRD today](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/513350069).  So yeah, no.
---
...
---
This is what you had to do if you were trying to rank outside of the 'big boy premade' group that controls the upper ranks. Every minute you're not getting honor is a minute that you fell behind.
---
The grind has a reputation of being soul draining for a reason.
---
Yeah they did, my guild had terrible luck and could never get a thunderfury despite running multiple MC's a week for nearly the entire expansion. We ended up recruiting a warrior from a different server for naxx 40 when we were on 4H.
---
I just give water for free, same with portals and stuff. I used to sit in Org and hand out free waters while I'm stocking up for dungeons. 20 silver is 2 mobs of grinding but doing something nice for someone else is priceless. Good way to make friends and I have a lot of healers on my friend list now. The only downside is that the only horde with Crusader sits in Org and also offers tips/water/enchanting 8 hours a day so he got mad at me and told my GM to make me stop advertising free waters and ports lest we lose his enchants. Doesn't matter, made friends!
---
The insult was in discounting a lot of people's painful experience with a trite "...it's usually not too hard to corpse run into BRM..." 
---
I'm saying that those people, the very people suffering the issues the OP is proposing to change the game to help, stop listening right there. So if your point was to convey information to them about the upcoming BGs you failed.
---
I dont see how using class spells can break any rules.
---
&gt; Shit like this, and the gold trading between classic and retail being "unsupported"
---
what do you want them to do? ban it? This is a transaction that takes place outside of the game's systems. It's like streamers complaining about getting stream sniped.
---
I am an alliance on fairbanks, but I dun think faction queue is the solution. It's unfair to hordes player that they have to pay the price for blizzards' poor decision.
---
They should have never allowed alliance to transfer and I think the best solution is to let hordes transfer to alliance as a one time thing, but it's probably bad for lore and stuff.
---
Seems to working fine with scatter and trap smh...
---
Raid logging precludes getting ony/trib buffs.  If you want those sub 1 hour raids, you need to do that shit
---
Yeah that's what I thought
---
It's Blizzards IP. You agreed to their ToS. It's exactly how it works.
---
Why not go for Dal’Rend’s?
---
lol, fuck off.  If you beg me to come your shitty ass in a dungeon I'll roll for both the healing loot that drops as I'm actively healing AND any melee dps gear my main spec needs.  If you don't like it tough, we'll replace your ass in half a second.
---
But people can't inspect your inventory and see how much gold you have while you are afking in undercity. People can inspect you and see your drakestone, and then they feel like a fucking dumb idiot with their aquamentas standing next to you. 
---
That's why you farm shit like that, to flex on other people
---
&gt;Why should I have to spend 100g a week just to play different specs? 
---
It's a gold sink, plain and simple. The idea is to a) limit effective farming by keeping at least part of the playerbase somewhat restricted to a spec that isn't all that great at farming and b) have a somewhat reliable way to take money out of the game even for people who already bought the really expensive stuff. 
---
Personally I feel it's a bit too high, too, and it certainly discourages experimenting with different specs, but I suspect changing it might create some issues with the economy. In the end it's one of the few things you're gonna consistently spend money on, if you switch specs a lot, so it's a reliable way to take money out of the economy, which (somewhat) halts inflation.
---
I could always try but it would take far too long and then I have to battle against other melees in the group.. seems faster to farm 300gold, get krol blade than farming for Dal’Rend’s
---
um... absolutely. Gold for real money through third party sites is banned, and if they cared about the classic economy being anything like the economy they're trying to recreate then they would ban garbage like that.
---
ill check it out. thanks
---
That doesn't give random GMs/customer service reps/Blizzard employees unlimited power. Punishment has to be grounded by a rule, if it's not it will just be overturned.
---
Why are we having such a redundant conversation? Holy shit, I'm done.
---
Hey this might be a silly question, but I’m a new player. How do you get your buffs and food and stuff ABOVE the skill bar??? I have no idea how to do that and my skill bar is crammed.
---
Two questions sort of related.
---
I have a macro of the following and it works fine.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cancelform
---
    /cast Superior Healing Potion
---
    /cast Greater Healing Potion
---
    /cast Healing Potion
---
    /cast Minor Healing Potion
---
However whenever I enter the line for the Major Healing Potion above the Superior one it just breaks. The icon goes to the ? and the tooltip is empty.
---
Why and how do I fix this? 
---
Second question is is it possible that when I have no Major, Superior or Greater hp pots it shows the icon for the Healing Potion and amount I have?
---
Resto druid paid for exactly 0 of his pieces.
---
Literally not raidlogging if you’re on an alt
---
Not all situations are equal my friend.  I'm on a horde heavy server and it's not nearly as bad as some of them.  But it's bad enough that I get the frustration if it was any worse.
---
You are completely misinformed. Then it would be more logical to call it Role&gt;MS. It makes no sense that your off spec suddenly is your main spec. And if that was the case, good luck finding any tanks to join lol
---
Where do you get that much mana and health? Im at 2200hp and 4863 mana at the moment
---
I've gotten 150% rested EXP.
---
You may be thinking of the exploit that changed layers mid-run to allow for boss farming.
---
We AoE but anything you can fear you can kite so you have better gold farming, probably only second to hunter because you can solo instanced bosses better than mages.
---
ZF farming is so boring but it's 50-60 gold an hour... I already got 2 epic mounts and gold for consumables so I can raidlog till Naxx. 80 hours of my life, gone in that instance. Fuck those zombies!!!
---
Final Update: I got a warning for putting in another ticket requesting to speak to a manager. https://imgur.com/gallery/iLQgQA0
---
That's the point of a hybrid.  To never be top of any role, but able to perform well enough at all the fill all.
---
This MS/OS bullshit was created by people playing classes with one spec wanting an advantage over others playing classes able to perform multiple roles.
---
He wasn't even melee at the time; he was invited as a healer.
---
And I love that about classic. The epic battles with 40 people coming together from all over the world to accomplish a shared goal.  That's the fun for me, not even so much the mechanics or complexity of a fight but the social aspect.
---
It was sold. New discord is  https://discord.gg/cnXgWVc 
---
" Will post here for clarity   The last discord owner who was neither a mod or had the admin role like 'Takes' did  The owner has given his owner to someone else who has then removed all us mods and said he has plans for the server etc etc  It sounded dodgey af and me, michee, cola etc agreed it was best to make a new server with no dodgey intentions.  We hope to have it back to how it was shortly  "
---
Raidlogging on my main character.
---
Doesn't seem accurate at all, even to classic wow population graph standards. Check Herod and Skeram.
---
Do you add ketchup before you lick boots?
---
Enjoy your silly dots, shadow person.  I'll be in the warrior's pocket spamming dispel, nets, and nades.    
---
and getting sheeped. I'm gonna be sheeped alot.  Please help me with that lol.
---
instead of just fixing it, they are making GMs waste their time issuing warnings LOL.
---
prevention is the key. people will still do it regardless
---
Twist : because mom’s done and you need to get in before the water’s cold...based on real life, my batshit crazy aunt would make her kids do this, aunt first...each kid in succession afterwards...7 of them.
---
You can believe what you want, why don't you join a guild where you believe all loot should go to you, then get 39 other people to agree.
---
Get the twitch app and use that for your add ons. I had a bunch of issues until I reinstalled them all through that and now they work perfectly!
---
Or it would encourage them to quit the game. Speaking from experience on Faerlina, people get stubborn on queues. Many will unsub before they transfer.
---
It might just be better to offer a carrot instead of a stick. What if Level 60 Horde who transferred off were given 200 gold? Not game changing, but might do the trick.
---
Awww he deleted it RIP
---
You are indeed full of shit. Literally everything you said is wrong, out of context and or shows zero awareness or understanding of healing, mana regeneration and drinking as a healer.
---
Bien
---
They are in Phase 3 with 15 agility enchants.
---
they actually do, and the people in this sub apparently agree lmfao
---
ElvUI has some great options. Most of it is now pretty easy to setup and the newest versions even have great out of the box melee profiles with combo points and weapon swing trackers.
---
Just search for ElvUI Classic and use their desktop client for downloading and updating.
---
It’d be /use right?
---
&gt; just means they don't play for a week
---
Losing a week sucks.  You never really get it back.
---
The future is now, old man
---
I meant only when healer is drinking anyway. Don’t be the reason the next pull isn’t happening
---
I agree there are risks, but think the benefits stand to outweigh them :). 
---
I mean, the release of diremaul in the order they released it in is a minor change that I'm already happy they did! They also utilised layering and raised the server cap significantly. We also get cross realm battlegrounds as soon as they launch. Oh and a two hour trade window on raid items. I think it's already clear that blizzard aren't being *completely* puritanical in their implementation of classic. 
---
I don't want to deny that there are risks that any changes could be poorly received. I just reckon the demand is sufficient to warrant taking the risk. I know one mate who isn't keen for classic but is considering coming back for tbc and would be a lot more likely to do so if he heard it was going to be tbc+. 
---
Ultimately I guess what we're disagreeing about is our gauge of the communities demand for particular  things and how blizzard is perceiving the communities demand. I see a community that is crying out for classic+ and reckon there is a good chance blizzard will listen on *at least* minor issues. After all, they have *already* made minor tweaks! But whether they would be willing to make any more is up in the air - on the one hand its risky, on the other hand it has worked for runescape and wow classic is much more successful than they thought. 
---
You very well might be right that they'll be too risk averse, but I've got my fingers crossed anyway!!
---
Post this on the official Kromcrush server forums.

I don’t kill alliance for honour lol, it’s just a nice bonus. I kill them to ruin their day
---
I'm a Mage. When the Paladin gives me Wisdom, I politely but firmly correct them. I've got gems, I've got evocation, I've got a robe of the archmage, and when all else fails I've got water. Give me that sweet, sweet Salvation.
---
"Sorry, guys. I gtg, it seems there's a problem involving a ww2 bomb. Gl and see ya!"
---
Yeah dude just won the lottery.
---
Yeah but only the rogues and warriors will use them after getting tier gear. The hunter replaces it this phase. Warriors don’t replace until BWL.
---
Should follow pservers and cap it at 25g.
---
This is what people asked for.  I think a there's quite a bit of general naivety when you start seeing the complaints with regards to what classic is and is not. 
---
It's 15 years of game design polish removed. Some love it, some won't.
---
Battlegrounds come out dec 10. It might get better by then. I am bothered on a daily basis by horde whether I'm farming, questing, or just trying to take a boat.
---
Crutches will let you walk when you otherwise couldn't. Salv lets you exceed what would normally be possible, at any level of skill. It's more of a jetpack than a crutch.
---
Warlock, releasing wastes my Soulstone. Waited a couple mins for them to leave, 3 more raids run by and a few spit, waited until the original gankers come back to see if I soulstoned, they leave again assuming I'm alt-tabbed writing a rage post(nope just patient) then finally rez and gtfo.
---
And you could do that just fine. Now everybody HAS to use it. Even if all members want to use loot council
---
Also on Kromcrush alliance - you got fucked. Join a loot council guild
---
What alternate reality are you from, sir?
---
No, I have tried that to no avail.
---
from my understanding you could steal mats, sell them real quick before they catch on like on an alt on the neutral AH or something, catch a short ban, and you're free.
---
Definitely. Barbarous is going to be bis until phase 3.
---
A gay man can donate sperm to a lesbian for her to conceive a child. Neither parent has to be straight. The person to whom I replied wrote that gay people can't conceive children without straight people in the mix. It's obviously untrue.
---
It’s funny because you know you couldn’t even make it past lvl 50 w/o a massive numbers advantage.
---
More than a little!
---
The imbalance isnt something new, could have easily switched sides long before investing 3 months into a character
---
Zandalar Tribe if you want to roll horde.
---
Meh, not hunters
---
What you don't see is how annoying tanking for random groups can be.
---
Are fury warriors hard to gear? I know they have a hard time leveling, but it seems that they have an easy time getting groups in dungeons. I'm not sure whether it's the same with raids.
---
I want to level a warrior as I like the idea of dual wield DPS, but if they're harder to gear then I might just stick with my warlock.
---
Counter spell
---
I’m Horde on Bigglesworth and there is basically a line of horde from thorium point to BRD ever 20 feet.
---
I would say as soon as your 49 if BGs are not out stop playing and wait.  
---
However the faction balance maybe so bad that horse ques are 30-40 minutes if that’s the cause all wow PvP servers will basically be Horde only PVE lol
---
Yes, ganking happens on ganking servers.

The spell isn't the primary offender, exploiting dueling is. Dueling allows you to a) kill someone that's mind controlled and b) remove honorless target because the MC'd player "attacks" the person in the duel.

Honorless target is a rule of the game and removing it this way is an exploit.

Aw, man. You’re the perfect specimen to gkick. If anyone is being a loser here, it’s you. 
---
Do you see how all of your comments are downvoted? You should consider leaving your little bubble of entitlement and try being a little self-aware. I’m sure the whole reason for this post is due to you being booted from a guild, and I’m sure your performance in raid is as shitty as your attitude.   
---
Grow the fuck up, and quit being a whiney little bitch.
---
Feel for ya. BRD I get though, it was like that in vanilla. Middle of nowhere fucking Azshara or feralas though? The fuck.
---
Alright, I'll take the bait.
---
Instead of looking for help where you can't succeed alone, instead of utilizing your class cooldowns, instead of using bandages and maybe a potion, you expect your faction to finish your quests and deck you with rare quality gear.
---
If this is a *"how to not play Classic WoW"* type character you're RP'ing on here as, hats off to you man. I love the dedication and level to detail.
---
Mega huge
---
why do you want to pay for it?
---
You would be crazy to use an axe when you get sword skill for free. 
---
Keep in mind that UBRS also has true strike which is bis, pain weaver band which is bis and few others good things to have like shoulders of valor, eye of rend and a few tanking items that would be great for off tanking in MC. 
---
If you really hate UBRS you could run Strath Baron and get skull forge reaver, it’s not quite dal rends but it’s close and you’d be farming cape of black baron at the same time. You could get lucky and get the epic sword which isn’t great but it would do alright pre raid for slam spec.
---
I’m so tempted to just re roll horde after hearing this but it would be a lot. I may just try and deal with it until bgs
---
Yeah thats an old trick, as is the last second hearth cancel (though observant enemies can notice that one).

It lasts them both the same time, but enhance shamans are typically non existence further down the line. We have one per raid group and it will drop to zero for the progression group and then go back to one when the content is on farm.
---
Because everyone knows it doesn’t matter if you have 5 people vrs 20?
---
Like, dude. Yeah, when you are vastly outnumbered and literally can not pull together groups to overcome a massive raw numbers imbalance... you stop putting effort into the futile thing...
---
No. 15 more people aren’t going to randomly stop getting what little they are able to do to advance to come give some 5man group a fair shot before 30 more horde fly in because the 20 started spamming /4 that there’s honor to be farmed.
---
There are not intrinsic player differences between Horde an Alliance. There is not some magical thing about liking Orcs that makes you more cooperative.
---
You just have the numbers and it’s easier to get more people for anything if you have numbers.
---
This all happened in vanilla during P1, just way way less extreme because severs were smaller and the imbalance less extreme, but with Horde and Allies reversed. Allies used to say the same weird things to us to act as if it were anything but that it is- a raw numbers advantage.
---
i'm with you on this, wpvp is the best fun i had since classic launched. there are always roaming bands of horde to kill or get killed by, you just have to know where to look.
---
I'm gonna be very sad when it's gone in 15 days.
---
Honestly it is. Repeatable + usable in combat.
---
Yeah that's pretty wild.
---
no gnomes nor dwarfs 😘
---
&gt;This is why BIS healer lists are bullshit. There's too many variables at play, and it list literally changes with what you are doing.
---
They're not bullshit. They are targeted assessments for a specific utility, and are aimed at people doing upper end group content, both now and as content progresses.
---
There's literally no argument here. Your personal assessment is that because in this phase and in most ideal circumstances, Truefaith is only a marginal upgrade, people should ignore it and not bother.
---
It's literally in their ToS as the others have said. They can, and will ban at anytime for any reason at all as it is up to them. Sure there are policies that specify what not to do, but this is a general rule that acts as an umbrella over all of them: Blizzard employees can ban for any reason as they see fit.

---
Yeah so much of it is a personality thing to. I feel like some healers hold these bizarre grudges where, as a warlock, I feel like I'm already hated. I'll bring my own consumes, use my best manners both in game mechanics and communication, perform above average on dps, and STILL get the rank 1 rez if we wipe. 
---
Like god damn that's literally a 72 silver accept rez button u just made me click. Super petty ik but still haha

Had a warlock whinge the druid won a epic dagger. The irony of the situation was, I the only rogue would of been the only one to use it, and the lock was first to need???
---
&gt; They're not bullshit. They are targeted assessments for a specific utility, and are aimed at people doing upper end group content, both now and as content progresses.
---
No one looks at it like that though, and even then the list would change based on what you are doing.
---
I've accepted that phase 2 is horrible right now and I'm willing to wait a few weeks. What I'm REALLY worried about is that nothing will change once bgs come. With long ques and only one in the party needing to que, what in God's name is stopping the rest of the people in the party to fly 5 min from undercity to WPL/EPL and keep flightpoint ganking?
---
Nothing as I see it. They will need honor, they don't sit afk. If nothing changes in p3 i really think the majority of alliance players will straight up quit
---
that's racis
---
Hunter Quest in Silithus
---
Someone left our group once because "my dog is having a seizure"
---
I see warlocks spam detect invis and waterbreathing to screw with shaman purge all the time.
---
They did make changes.
---
They massively increased the size of the servers, which is like a multiplicative effect on faction imbalances because the world is the same size, so density shoots through the roof. Creating a feedback effect.
---
It becomes really clear to any ally the second you hit STV - if you don’t want to corpse run constantly, reroll Horde now.
---
Yeah I can and have done all that. Here's the thing, I never asked for help. The point is if I walked by someone outside sepulcher who was about to die, depending on my class I would heal or help fight. That's the way most horde has always been. It has been a very alliance thing to just walk by someone dying.
---
Heart seeker is the third server I'm on.  I asked for someone to make me linen bags and offered mats including the threads and 5s because it's all I had, and still had people telling me the tip wasn't enough. 
---
The horde side as of right now is not impressive and based on interactions with other players and the AH, there's a reason the horde sucks on it.
---
&gt; And what do you do with more +healing? You downrank to conserve mana.
---
That's only one singular aspect. The other thing you do with +healing is use it to boost raw HPS, mana be damned.
---
In dungeons I'm fine with people needing on stuff they only *kind of* need, as long as no one else needs it. When I'm in that spot I usually ask, and people say yes 100% of the time. I don't see how this is different. If anything they should be more accommodating in this case because they're a guild and will benefit from people having better gear, not to mention the social aspects of what this attitude does to moral.

Why does no one run Gorillas as their hunter pet? The only pet that has +dmg as well as health bonus and can deal with multiple big pulls with Thunderstomp ability. 
---
Is it bc it can pull unwanted stuff with thunderclap or what? Why do I never hear anyone talk about it on best leveling pet forums or see anyone have them?
---
You don’t? You split a few layers 50/50 and then overflow Horde into their own little purgatory until people log out or hit an instance, etc...
---
You don't own your account or the characters. Blizzard can terminate your account for any reason.
---
I just kill them anyway.  I especially kill them if they're grey, because they aren't worth honor anyway!
---
Wrong.
---
As an undead i type /lick to most ally i pass or meet. I've helped some. Hurt some.
---
And this is like vodkaz at the Silithus farm spot - what’s your point?
---
I mean I'm horde and it's not fun at all. I'm leveling my rogue and I would love to do some PVP but....in all of the last 4 days, I've seen about 8 alliance total in the mid-30s. Even in STV I only ever saw one. It sucks. The two I found in Arathi seemed to be bots or something. They didn't even move or react when I started attacking them. I just want some honor and it's impossible :(
---
I'd kill for some balance.
---
Still trying to strawman emotion.
---
You really want to make your point, don't you?
---
If the guild bank is really what's important here, why not offer to sell the item for vendor price?
---
If your loot rules cause situations like this, you have shit rules.
---
"Waaaaah!  Horde can farm five times the mats as Alliance!"
---
Tukui
---
&gt; No one looks at it like that though
---
*He says talking to all the people telling him that's how they should be used.*
---
Give it a rest, mate.
---
Same, so why would the majority want to subject themselves to being the minority on an extremely unbalanced server lok
---
I can do that by just sniping with flash heal.
---
Good UI is relative. But check willitclassic.com and search for 'ui'.
---
You could easily have thresholds and minimums and an allowable % difference based off total active pop and shit. It’s definitely doable
---
Obviously that means virtually no one, not literally no one.   Very few people look at these BIS lists, and think to themselves, this is BIS if I spam every consumable on CD.
---
I yell wtb port and i get an invite instantly.
---
Or cut to go around the pillars?
---
That's not always true, I recall oneshotting carriers in eve with fleets of alpha strike battleships.
---
Simultaneous strikes / multiple abilities hitting before your opponent can react all fit into oneshotting.
---
Go to an cathedral, I had that theory but it doesn't seem like it
---
or another server. then the horde will have peace, by themselves
---
Haha I see my guild mate in that pic, deadlyvixen diciples of keanu represent.

[Thunderstomp](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=26090/thunderstomp) costs 60 focus and has a 1 minute cooldown.

If you want to deal with groups of enemies, owls/bats/vultures are the way to go. They also can learn [Dive](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23148/dive) while gorillas don't have access to a sprint ability.

just get +int and +stam green gear, being a gnome is a masssive help ofc. but with int buff, you should be closer. there is some pieces of cloth with insane amount of int on from dungeons you should get
---
This isn't really a scam you just got robbed by someone who threw away creditibility for some internet game items. Coming from years of EVE online, I'm very familiar with this kind of stuff and scammier tactics to the point where if I can't physically meet the person I don't trust them with anything I can't accept losing.
---
This is a meme. I don't think it's sincere

20-0-31 is the big brain build. You can still heal effectively AND you sacrifice nothing in the ret tree.
---
They're paying amazon a few thousand bucks for the servers.  They're paying some foreign company to do the Customer Service, if you can even call it that.  There's no one developing new content.   No one, or virtually no one working on bug/exploit fixes.    Who the fuck are they paying these increased wages to work on the game?!?
---
Read any of the number of posts on it
---
And Flash Heal gains HPS with +healing the same as every other spell.
---
Are you dense?
---
That sucks.  Since Heatseeker is so imbalanced in favor of Alliance, I doubt Blizzard will open Earthfury up again for the Horde-only transfers from servers like Herod and Skeram.  Hopefully you can get some Horde to balance it out.
---
I don't think Blizzard deals with trade scams like this in retail either, and they even put out disclaimers saying this (unless your account was breached for sure), but to say, "Classic is unsupported" sounds like a bit of a stretch. Wasn't there just a post about a guy doing the FM/MC honor farm that got chewed out by a GM because people were reporting tickets?
---
I feel like people are missing the obvious, it’s not so much the population balance causing the problem it’s the server sizes, the game wasn’t designed for this many people and a 70/30 balance on a 3-5k pop server is way less relevant than a 70/30 split on a 15-20k pop server. 
---
It’s an issue of a few dozen extra horde/alliance being put in the world vs a few thousand extra being pushed into the same size world.
---
Yes.  It's extremely OP when it lands but it doesn't land more often than it does, something like 20% at best.  When it doesn't land you just auto attack for 90% of the time and then get kited to death.
---
There's a reason Enh and Ele shaman pvp videos are 1v1 with all CDs/procs, it's the only time they can kill anyone.
---
It's why this video also shows him nailing mages b/c he can purge them and then hit the squishiest class in the game.
---
There are vidz on YouTube on farming them
---
That's not what we're talking about here. We're talking HoJ and Dal'rends.
---
You mean like how the other side of it can't leave town?
---
NTA. That shit doesn't even shard into purples yet. Tell him to either be happy with the vendor money or reroll a new loot distribution system.
---
EP/GP and DKP were two of the worst loot ideas ever. There's a reason they didn't stick around.
---
I read somewhere that owls/boars aren't that great for horde players just because in order to get some of the higher ranks you have to go on suicide missions to go tame a pet in Alli heavy zones
---
Blizzard's actual response is "Direct support for WoW Classic is limited"....So millions of us are paying $15 a month and we can't get any more than "limited support" - what a joke of a company Blizzard is
---
Lol you're completely missing what everyone is complaining about. No one gives a fuck about the people splitting or not splitting the honor. They care about being able to bypass the honorless timer.
---
Stratholme, i was super surprised, we all were. I thought it only dropped in MC.
---
Yeah it worked in the start, but they made the window smaller after a while
---
Can we not turn this sub into AITA
---
Is krol blade a better offhand than miras song?
---
I think ill farm brd pickpocket for krolblade at the weekend because im not interested in the rend Grind.
---
However, we raid with lootcouncil and im getting the next Vis or Brut blade.
---
However, depending on the drop luck it can take some weeks to get one of these.
---
Tldr id bite myself in the ass if i spend 300g on Krol and vendor it 1 ID after, if i cant even use it in the OH.
---
Obvs. Im Combat sword rogue.
---
ur gonna regret that when mages can get it in a few hours of turning off their brain and doing easy as fuck zf farm.
---
They share a lot of gear with other classes.
---
I've seen three epics drop there so far (farmed like 1200g total), one of those staves and two hammers of the northern wind... Not the biggest moneymakers, at least the maces might as well be vendor trash.
---
They’ve never done anything about this going all the way back to vanilla.
---
If the removal of honorless target buff is the bug then the boat from menethil to theramore loading screen instant resurrection not giving honorless target buff would be considered a bug as well.
---
Ya they do make me jealous as a rogue in dungeons.
---
Ive never felt that way when i saw anyone with a drakestone
---
 Ive only ever though they mustve gotten rly lucky or spent way too much time. Imagine flexing on someone about 7 extra spell damage that gets replaced in p3.
---
Hmm, could you send me the link you used to download it? I've tried from twitch and from their site, and I've reinstalled WoW a couple times for it but so far no dice.
---
#NoChanges, and this is coming from a warrior who has to shell out 100g a week on respecs. I raid as prot but then swap back to arms/fury for pvp.
---
I'll give that a try, thanks :)
---
I cast curse of exhaustion!
---
Maybe not the case for everyone but im sitting on 1k+ gold after getting a non starting faction mount and helping three other people buy epic mounts.
---
100g a week doesnt feel like a stretch with even low tier farming of dungeons.
---
The game needs gold sinks to keep the world populated.
---
Okay well if that's not fine then 60:40 is the way to go for the 80:20 servers... like I said before. I get that you want a permanent fix. However a bandaid fix for the short-term/until a better solution is found (if there is one) is so much better than just leaving the game as is. You keep saying you want a solution that fully fixes the problem. A lot of people, myself included, haven't seen a single legit solution that would fully fix the problem with no downsides. If you're just saying, no- Blizzard must fully fix the problem and not just partially fix it, and you're not offering a better solution, then you're just shooting down ideas that can be beneficial for no reason.
---
By your words every bug and exploit are clever use of game mechanics simply, because they do work. Honor less target debuff is there for the reasons and overriding it is an exploit.
---
&gt; Those are basically the same.
---
No they aren't! Dear Jesus.
---
It's clear you're not interested in a discussion. It's clear you're to busy whining about how people look at lists from a narrow standpoint and don't stop to consider different applications, while looking at things from a narrow standpoint and not stopping to look at different applications.
---
Go away.
---
It's clear you are wrong, and cannot come up with a real rebuttal.
---
How does one achieve 1.4k healing! D:
---
I'm at around +507, and I'm pretty sure the best possible is +688.
---
Does that include talents?
---
The truth is 90% of the tanks you are playing with arent tanking because he likes to do it or this is his main spec, he does because there is no tanks and someone have to do it. And if you want to force them into their main spec then you will never find a tank.
---
On low pop servers the gates get opened during WotLK.
---
Being a furry should be a reportable offense.
---
By mass reporting him for some bs
---
&gt;In that case, why isn't using Polymorph on someone and waiting until the honorless target buff expires "exploiting"? Or just simply holding the Mind Control and waiting until the buff expires?
---
Because you're technically following the established rules of the game. You're not using an exploit to remove a ruleset. 
---
I don't understand how this is confusing
---
Could you please explain the benefit to charging points for offspec stuff no one else wants? I mean, if 2 players want it they have to use points sure but if you are just DEing it, why not let raiders buy it with gold? 
---
I would really appreciate it. I have a basic understanding of DKP but I don't see the benefit to the guild here.
---
Honestly just be Petty as fuck. Wait till someone from their guild needs a tank or specifically that person. Say you will tank and continue doing whatever it is you are doing. Do it till they ask, then tell them you just gotta turn in a quest real fast. When they ask again tell them you are on the way and start heading there, make sure you tell them you AFK on the flight path. AFK when you land until someone says something, wait a min and tell them you just landed and on your way. Make sure you die a few times on the way and say something a long the lines of "damn asshole horde/alliance". Once in ghost form take your time. When you finally make it to the instance make sure everyone is buffed up then tell them you gotta AFK real fast since your dog needs to go out to do his business, if you have a dog then go play with him for 10 or so mins. Come back in and tell them you are ready to go, then close the game window after a few trash pulls and go do something for 30 mins. When you log back in message them about how sorry you are and that your router was acting up.
---
Says the warlock.
---
What you are forgetting is that The Horde of Classic is like The Alliance of Vanilla. 50% of it is compromised of 15 year old meme Lords who will quit BGs after the first hour of getting their asses handed to them because they don't have a 40 man gank squad backing them up, and then there will be balance.
---
by endgame i mean naxx BiS
---
Not the worst idea, but that might take a decent bit to put in, since it probably requires code that isn't in the game yet. 
---
Honestly, I'd just wish there was a confirmation button before accepting your talents, instead of just slotting them in the moment you click, I've run with a few somewhat strange specs because I accidentally misclicked and didn't want to spend money just to correct that mistake :P
---
If you got your fair share of kills on the guy sounds like some good ol fashioned world pvp.
---
Yeah blizzard isn't gonna do shit about that from what I hear on this subreddit
---
OP in this thread, holy shit.
---
Anyone know if bananabar addon is in the works yet?
---
(Serious question, its a great raid targeting addon from private servers)
---
People just want flying so they can get their daily quests done more quickly. Daily quests are the true cancer killing retail. You get rid of those and suddenly a whole world of design options opens back up.
---
With a 36 being able to macro a 100-0 sequence on a 60 you never know.
---
&gt; you're not getting nothing either..
---
So, what are you getting?  You are saying wages have gone up, which might be true, at least compared to everyone else getting fucked, but there's no one being hired to work on the game.
---
yea heartseeker horde suck. their fastest mc clear is like 1:15 lol
---
I had to afk once guarding a flag in AB cause there was a raid next door, my neighbor was a drug dealer. I got yelled at and called names by the group leader who was also in my guild. When I told him what happened he called me stupid, kicked me out of the guild and blocked me. Haven't really felt comfortable grouping with folks since that day. I did move a few weeks after to a safer place. Being poor sucked lol.
---
it’s honor farming on a toxic level. There is no more pvp it’s raids vs 1 person on a bunch of realms
---
1st topic is from PvE real player or from dominating faction player on PvP realm.
---
2nd topic written by 30:70 PvP realm player loosing their interest in the game when dying 5+ times is routine to be able to get to BRM instances.
---
Thank you ambassador, for sharing your deep insights with the wider community. Your information shall prove vital in fixing this bug.
---
Kreygasm
---
I’m having a good time when I’m not being bent over the barrel by Horde deathsquads. 
---
I just wanna quest you bastards, I don’t even give you honor anyways
---
Lesson learned, don’t stay in shitty guilds
---
In this thread: Alliance saying Horde should quit the game/reroll on another server so they don't have to change anything.
---
when u see a warlock casting shadow bolt
---
They're all cancerous now.  Just quit the game.
---
You son of a bitch, I’m in.
---
Your Dps will get left in the dust as everyone else keeps going up and up. But shamans are great and bring awesome utility.
---
&gt; Tanksinatra
---
Fucking amazing
---
Also ayy Rattlegang
---
Obviously but it might annoy him, I ment bs as in faking him spamming some translate addon
---
Are you a ZTer? The server is perfect, I wish EU and US servers weren't disconnected :(
---
come get camped with us, it's loads of fun....
---
Kinda of a
---
I actually just joined a new guild. Messaged one of my friends in game and he hooked me up with his guild which after talking to them seem pretty cool and they called my old guild stupid for making that rule.
---
It's not my job to come up with solutions. I'm just using logic to argue why it won't work. 
---
Similarly, me shooting down ideas is also meaningless. This is just a discussion. Neither of us are responsible for changes that will happen. This isn't a vote.
---
And to the 80:20-60:40 thing. this is the last time I'll say it because you seem to be ignoring it.
---
i) People on 60:40 servers are complaining because it is unplayable. 
---
ii) Making 80:20 servers will help the imbalance but it will not help with the complaining, because it will remain unplayable. 
---
iii) people will continue to complain because helping with the problem does nothing to solve what they are complaining about
---
iv) therefore, making the server 60:40 does not help.
---
Merely helping is not enough, not even close, because even at one of the smallest levels of imbalance, people are complaining that it is unplayable.
---
Being an anarchist an playing on a PVE server is like being a socialist and living in Vermont.
---
Surely restoring lost items is a quick and easy process and would take a lot less time than dealing with back and forth ticketing like what happened here.
---
Terms of service/ToU don't mean anything - they aren't legally binding contracts.
---
But that's irrelevant.
---
State statute and consumer protection acts override Blizzard's legalese - and these make it abundantly clear a party cannot make unilateral decisions about the continuance of the contract, nor of service.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Because it's not about farming the fp, it's that if you play a mage and do that try to wait out the honorless target buff with poly, your honor can be stolen by the priest and his group exploiting duels.
---
Yeah but you guys own LHC. Today there was around 40 alliance camping FP
---
Mad respect, you’re the real Horde. These guys rolling 40 deep on 70:30 servers are just The Herd.
---
If you ever want to swap low key grind spots (diff faction and server) HMU. A lot of mine have gone to shit since the pop density is so much higher, but I still have a couple decent ones.
---
Stop using your spells to your advantage or we'll ban you!
---
"I just came to wow from Tara online"
---
just disenchant the item then :)
---
I know this feeling, coming from alliance PvP server haha.
---
Best possible is not 688
---
GMs at that time didn't directly respond to people that much, and even if they did, you wouldn't know about it.
---
No, he won't and he didnt... we killed him 5 or 6 times without us dying, we camped him and he just kept coming back. In higher locations where there were elite mobs that we couldn't risk aggroing.
---
u/Paddlemar
---
Zt is 60/40 for alliance if you haven't been told yet
---
Well like 1/2 of their coworkers got fired to increase shareholder profits, i don't blame them for not giving a fuck.
---
Probably to give Mages/locks a chance since they are spending on all of their other gear.
---
Everyone knows both sides do it?
---
It’s just that when one side is 70% of the server and the other 30%, the size and frequency of the Deathballs are wildly different?
---
For every one you encounter, I  encounter three. Same with rogue pairs, roaming groups and gankers.
---
Flash of Light come and me want to Hearth
---
I live in Japan temporarily and found out the server I started on is US East. I average around 170 ping. It’s completely playable. Sometime my latency spikes or averages higher, but using a VPN and selecting an East coast IP keeps the latency around 150.
---
complaining about server balance is one thing, but complaining about being 5v1'd? just lol
---
This is correct. Unless he prepped, but why would you prep for a kidney when you can blind/gouge and just reset into stealth.
---
what does "call out of" mean? Like calling in sick?
---
These still don't fix a major faction imbalances on pvp servers. A huge problem a lot of people don't seem to think are the faction wide requirements for AQ global events. if Imbalances aren't sorted out somehow you're going to have servers where AQ won't ever happen.
---
Paid transfers between pvp and pve didn't come out till quite a bit later, no?
---
This is only true if you are in a guild where you take breaks after fights to drink to regain mana. Int does not give regen for priest in vanilla. So int (except for some crit) does litte for you if you are constantly pulling. 
---
Any guilds that clear molten core in less than 1 hour will not have many breaks for you to drink making +int close to useless stat. Mp5, spirit and healing will be much more beneficial.
---
No dude. I get it 80:20 is more imbalanced than 60:40. I get it. Literally the fifth time I've said it. I get it. I comprehend it.
---
I'm saying it does not help because people on the servers with 60:40 say its unplayable. so how does making something remain unplayable help with the problem of unplayable servers.
---
I haven't once been rude to you. I don't understand why you're being rude.
---
My argument is logical. I literally showed you the logic in my last comment. Literally. I don't think you understand what logic is.
---
60:40 is not helping because 60:40 is unplayable.
---
Blizzard will never fix these types of things because they want you to get frustrated and play retail.
---
&gt;They might be called out on it, but it doesn’t stop the proliferation of the use, obviously.
---
Except it isn't common to refer to globaling someone as a one-shot and everytime someone does they get criticized for it.
---
&gt;Plenty of other YouTube videos market these types of ideas as a one shot. People wouldn’t do this were it not working and, to some extent, sticking.
---
Again, no they don't. They do not refer to a situation that takes several seconds of slow combat as 'one-shots' stop with this attempt at cherry picking.
---
&gt;I’d again AGREE it’s a misuse of the term, but just because it’s a misuse doesn’t mean it will stop the term from be using differently until it’s normalized and it’s underlying meaning changed, amended, or added to.
---
Funny cause its been 20 years since this argument of globaling/extremely fast kills/taking most of someone's hp in a single hit, all of them have existed for decades and people haven't accepted it when people misuse the term. This will never be normalized...
---
Back in TBC my graphics card overheated when tanking Nightbane in Karazhan. Efter reboot and pointing a big table fan into my open PC I logged in and found nightbane to be dead. Worked out in the end.
---
You pirated server players are something else....   Nothing is an exploit, as long as it benefits you, is it?
---
I just see it as a challenge and kill them
---
Also down load weakaruas they can tell you when cds up, how much left in your timer. Can set up a screen for wenn kidney is ready and you have 5 stars during a cheap shot. Lots of stuff
---
I was a raid officer for many years and we used dkp with silent bids so if no one else wanted it you essentially got the item for free. Most of the time we encouraged people to gear an off spec as this made the members more versatile.
---
I got ill from reading this.
---
80:20 is more unplayable than 60:40. "Unplayable" does not literally mean it is impossible to log into the game and play the game. Technically 99:1 is "playable." 60:40 is more playable than 80:20 is.
---
&gt; This is only true if you are in a guild where you take breaks after fights to drink to regain mana. 
---
so 99,9999% of guilds.
---
pepelaugh he is unaware
---
He’s not doing that though? He’s. Or saying it’s unfair, he’s just saying Alliance do it to - because of course we do.
---
Doesn’t change the fact it’s still completely different when it’s 30% vrs 70% and it happens to you a few times a day instead of several an hour.
---
This is why I'm thinking about just quitting Classic.
---
It simply is not and will never be the same - everything is ultra min/max to the extreme, and the servers haven't developed any community yet so everyone acts like they are anonymous like they do on a PTR server
---
lifes motto
---
Warrior+Paladin= Warrior Archangel
---
Unstoppable holy killing machine.
---
The fact that my account is permanent and will not get shut down is enough for me.
---
Paladin Druid=cant kill me
---
Good ol' organized pvp in classic wow.. You mean the premade bgs versus some pugging random players?
---
&gt; You agreed to the faulty loot system when you continued to raid with them.
---
According to the story paying for OS is a new thing. They were handed out for free in the beginning.
---
Anyway, a guild that disenchants items rather than giving them to people that could potentially use them is a shitty guild. Better leave now than lose more time with them.
---
I doubt Blizzard would skip on AQ on any realm.  
---
I remember reading somewhere (can't cite any sources) that even in vanilla requirements were sometimes artificially filled up to get the event going.
---
&gt; That is your $15 /month. 
---
Ohh wow, I get to play a remastered game that should have cost like $30 tops.
---
Okay man. I'm done talking to you. You've continuously been rude to me. When I point out your rudeness, you ignore it. You tell me I'm being illogical when I literally spelled out the logic for you with premises and a conclusion. When I point this out, you ignore it.
---
You're not here for discussion, you're here to argue. Good night.
---
This is true dude.
---
ok boomers
---
Wow, props for being able to be honest with yourself man. A lot of people can't do the same. It doesn't matter what role you are or how luck y you get...the vast majority of gear you see in the game will not be going to you. If you only get happy when you get loot you won't be happy that often. If you can change your perspective and actually be happy for other people when they get loot you will be happy all the time.
---
You don't. You abandon the quests and come back after they quit. Then you wonder why you still bother playing on a "PVP" realm.
---
Until you are the guy that at 60 runs into a pack of 29 twinks farming their honor and get pulled down like a buffalo to a pack of wolves.  I can’t imagine that guy came on here to bitch about the kill teams roaming duskwood.
---
There's a BDE on my server....
---
I'm on sulfuras too, was interested in doing this for classic gold. Is there a discord or something where these trades can be set up? are you still trading?
---
Well it would be completely unfair to everyone else who paid for that item, why should you get it for free just because you're the last person to need it? And offspec/PvP items are of no real benefit to the guild (Tanks being the exception, we give two of our DPS Warriors free tank gear), so it's no real loss to the guild if an item gets sharded. We do actually allow people to buy BoEs with gold at a 10% discount, but if someone wants to buy them with DKP they get prio.
---
War+ rogue.. blade master class
---
I'm lv60 and have mained lock since WLK and had no idea
---
Honor is honor to those types. This the new reality for PVP servers.
---
Spooky if it is.
---
But given it's a decent sized guild, it wouldn't surprise me if something similar has been posted on the past.
---
Yeah, I purposefully choose the less dominant side :)
---
More 1/3 warrior, 1/3 warlock, 1/3 paladin.
---
Legit clever use of mechanics. They consider it an exploit abuse when theres no way for the opposite faction to counter it
---
Does that mean that as a human rogue I will only need 1% hit at 60 using swords? 5% from talents and 305 from racial?
---
Are daggers or swords considered BiS for raiding at 60?
---
15 levels below doesn't give honor
---
Took me a minute to realize the thumbnail is a dwarf with it's mouth open instead of a gaping chicken butt.
---
I do recall another post with this message about a month ago but not the same response lol
---
Well I never said that it was convenient solution, I just said it was 100% safe. With high value items I suppose you could just take whatever gold they do have on them and some other items to make up the difference. It would be a pain in the ass most likely but with such a big trade it would be worth it just to be safe.
---
Some of us aren't wildly shortsighted and actually have *gasp* other tanks. We literally rotate on bosses, dps is a non issue. They can play whatever spec they want, they'll get some time with bosses. I'm there when shit needs to get done and direct all of them. 
---
We're gonna need other people to tank later, they want to be tanks not just random dps that might tank sometimes.
---
Attacking me as a person instead of my argument. Nice.
---
Very cringe my D U D E
---
All our priests went from 800-1000 hp down to 500-600
---
In most RPG games you can scam people.
---
It was fun the first week. I'm not doing this anymore
---
It costs 800g but you get 10% discount for exalted and 10% discount for being sergeant so it's only 640g. Much cheaper than the regular epic mounts.
---
it reverts to the intended value after you log out
---
And they did do that during a large part of the game's early life, because they understood that trading is a core part of an MMO.
---
For instance, the Arcanite cooldown is clearly designed such that one player could never make the amount he needs for prestige items on his own. He has to rely on others, most probably outside his guild too. That system does not work if every time you open that trade window to have the Arcanite made, you become paranoid that you'll get scammed at no cost to the scammer.
---
They also explicitly have trade and mail logs. Logs for everything mind you, not just suspicious trades. There really is no reason for them to exist if they just raise their hands at the prospect of complicated laundering and saying "can't do it, sorry".
---
They have the tools and they had the people. This is clearly the outcome of them not having enough faith in classic and thus not devoting enough manpower into it. That's why they don't offer services like trading soulbound items between players in cases of accidents, like they used to. They are cutting costs, it's not like they can't afford to or they don't think it's important - they know how vital the trading system is to their MMO.
---
640g with sergeant discount.
---
u sound like a genuine ape
---
I suggest you to change server then. When stuff like this happens, alliance builds counteroffensive raids
---
I don't mean the best possible value for that stat, rather the value you get with the best possible gear and enchants.
---
I see something like 714-730 depending on enchants otherwise.
---
Game is literally near unplayable because there's a delay in the drivel people type into chat appearing?
---
Get Dal'rends, Do Jed/Rend or only Rend runs and reserve the swords. You can do it with 5-6 people. If you have friends that can tank heal it will be even easier, or tank yourself.
---
That's idiotic, you and your wife's arrangement seems more than acceptable.
---
more like "stop using bugs in our spaghetti code to subvert an intended mechanic" but ok
---
My man, I have indeed, you still don't get insane crits. You only get 43% coefficient for mind blast. Having 300 +dmg means I get 130 more damage added to my mind blast. Add that to 570 max rank mind blast and you get 700, add 15% for shadowform gets you 800. Add another 15% for shadow debuff if it's stacked up to 5x is 925 damage. Crit is 1.5 so average of 1387 damage on crits with max stacks. But for sure my man, it's the fact that I didn't buy max rank mind blast.
---
Realistically, when are you gonna use all 3 specs as a shaman and raid with? Collecting gear for all 3, taking truestrike, HOJ, SGC etc and let it rot in the bank for when you feel like switching spec for fun for a few days until raid comes around and you respec resto anyway?
---
Youd make a million enemies on the way by doing that.
---
Bro. Literally the original post said forsaken.
---
i mean, chances are you're not in danger of being so overrun on threat that missing a revenge is going to matter threat wise, so better to hit shield block on CD to lower the chances you get crit and take unnecessary dmg. imo.
---
wasting Your own Time to do this childish shit, nah thanks
---
This debuff was implemented for the reason to stop griefing. Finding an exploit for a fix is not ‘clever use of fame mechanics’
---
Happens all the time on the PvP servers.
---
I agree with the OP
---
....a little more gold might be a good thing for the game
---
because classic players are bad.  
---
classic pvp is the new twink bracket.
---
You can interpret that as my way of not giving your argument very much weight...
---
It reduces the incentive for players to cooperate on not needing on an item that they actually need so that they can roll on it for free and keep hoarding their GP for that one item they really want.
---
I'd like it to be even more costly. It encourages people to level alts and run dungeons again, keeps the world busy. Also your spec is your identity. I'd rather it be impossible to respec more than once a month period. This coming from a healer main... though I just dinged 60 on a farmer alt Sunday.
---
Alliance outnumber the horde on my server and they are ruthless. Basically have to quit until they allow us to transfer to a PvE servers. 
---
To those that think BGs will change this. I honestly think these people get some sick pleasure from wasting people's time. Which is the most valuable asset any of us have. I don't think ruthless body camping is going to stop.
---
I'm not arguing anything. Simply explaining the situation, which is:
---
Priests are using Mind Control to ensure that their party gets honor at flight paths and instance portals.
---
that's a fairly defensive response
---
there is interface options in the menu. click the boxes to enable bottom &amp; side action bars. there are 4 more you can place on the hud. you can also keybind in another menu.
---
Yeah I noticed the similarity too, it is great!
---
Enhancement shaman + combat rogue (particularly swords) = insane flurry machine
---
typical \~\~rogue\~\~ horde
---
How did you find the crafter? Did he know him by reputation? Was he recommended by others? etc. I would do my due dilligence when finding a crafter för Hand of Rag. If you did all this and stil lwas scammed, then I feel sorry for you.
---
It's both - stuff like Poly doesn't remove honorless target, it forces it to be waited out.
---
Obviously, I want 50/50 balanced servers, and alliance to actually have fun on balanced servers (like on the one which I play on now).
---
I just think faction queue is a too radical of a solution, especally on the servers which are already doomed anyways. It will create a massive community backlash and just make even more people quit the game.
---
There has to be other solutions, or they have to open new servers with that system from day 1 (and advertised).
---
Yeah, these things depend on your current stats and raid buffs. You won't find just one "correct" answer unless you have very specific conditions.
---
Join a smaller server. The one I am on feels like classic to me because it isn't crazy over populated.

I would guess you are horde. Just wait man. You are a lot more players than Alliance
---
I am rolling an alt on bene, level 26 pally. How is the faction balance?
---
Shaman. All day I get stun locked from rogues, if they get the jump the best I can do is hope I can get a war stomp off in time to pop a heal off and flame shock them so they can’t vanish. I can hold my own against a bad rogue till they vanish. But most will kill me before kidney shot falls off. I can spec into armor and dodge and that’ll get me to 50% before the stuns fall off, but even best case scenario and I line up some wndfurry strikes they usually vanish. That’s also at the cost of a lot of pve versatility like improved hit, cheap totems, increased range totems, or cheaper spells. 
---
But at the same time shaman has some really op burst if you get lucky, but all of your procs have to line up, which they do once in a while. 
---
Weapon swing + wF proc, immediate stormstike +wf proc, earthshock, weaponswing wf proc. 
---
So weapon attack x 3, storm strike, weapon attack x 2 earth shock, weapon attack x 3 you can potentially crit off all those swings. That’ll pretty much one shot to 30% anyone. But that doesn’t happen that much. 
---
Plus evasion makes that impossible, instead it would be dodge, dodge, earthshock. Dodge. So you do about 400 damage vs 3000.
---
Elemental is different beast but then interrupt comes into play to further fuck you up. Maybe resto ele wins for having strong heals, an interruption resist.
---
That's just some of that good ole Classic WoW world PvP so fondly remembered!
---
As dps not awesome.   Very viable healers tho, and tanks for 5mans, not so much raids
---
"zomg cat on fire g2g"
---
It sounds like you should join a guild with a loot council next. Subjectivity and fixed cost systems do not mix together at all. You're basically asking a guild that uses a DKP-type system to make exceptions for certain people. That's a horrible position for officers to be put into and yours wisely did not go into that position.
---
Omfg asmongold is quitting classic?!??!!! 
---
Who fucking cares
---
Hunters actually scale quite badly in pve. It's a shame.
---
Paladins are great healers and in some occasions can be great tanks (mainly 5man content). Ret on the other hand is pretty much a meme spec.
---
Dismissive AND insulting! Now that is a recipe for a healthy discussion.
---
There's alot of cool ones. But honestly if I had only one, it would probably be the Archmage Bishop. Mage + priest.
---
I've never played either class yet, but being able to AOE, single target nukes, cc, dispells, buffs, food + water, portals, fat heals, dots, fear, mind control, multiple shields. Probably more that I can't think of. But that sounds like an unstoppable class imo. 
---
I have a rogue and it's super fun, but the only thing it lacks is ranged damage. If a hunter and rogue were put together it would be pretty insane too. Have a pet roll up while your blasting, then disappear only to cheap shot and burst, then disappear and pop up blasting again.
---
I was partial to "Sorry I have to go, I'm being drafted for the army"
---
You get honor for killing anyone that's within 12 levels; so 60s can kill 48s and get honor. Skulls are 10+ levels above you.
---
From the logs it seems like they were talking privately and the GM took it to public channel.
---
Also disenchanting gear rather than giving it to people is completely illogical. Way to make your guild weaker for no good reason and waste the drops.
---
&gt; There really is no reason for them to exist if they just raise their hands at the prospect of complicated laundering and saying "can't do it, sorry".
---
This seems like a weird argument. "You have automated logs of stuff. That means you *must* pay to have humans spend hours going through those logs analysing them because someone got scammed out of pixels".
---
&gt; They have the tools and they had the people. This is clearly the outcome of them not having enough faith in classic and thus not devoting enough manpower into it. That's why they don't offer services like trading soulbound items between players in cases of accidents, like they used to. They are cutting costs, it's not like they can't afford to or they don't think it's important - they know how vital the trading system is to their MMO.
---
This also seems weird. "They aren't doing it, but they used to do it, which proves they ought to do it now". It seems at least possible that somewhere along the line they realised it wasn't worth doing, so now they don't do it.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would prefer it if scam victims could somehow be reimbursed without giving rise to millions of duping scams, and playing forensic WoW accountant seems like it would be a very fun job, but I can see how it could well be not worth the hassle. Any system will have unintended consequences, and the consequence of allowing mass duping by exploiting the scam-reimbursement system seems potentially quite significant.
---
Manors?
---
You’re kind of a dick.
---
I actually have never eaten Arby's in my life, but since my toon name is an Arby's reference I RP as having Arbys diarrhea all the time
---
These comments hurt my brain
---
They are good.
---
The game is still in the early stages. Gold circulating in the economy will only increase in number, the further along the game gets. Changes to the formula know may have unforeseen consequences in the future. (That's not me shooting down the OPs idea, as a somewhat casual player I, too, feel the price for respecs is too high. Just explaining the potential issues with such a change). 
---
Less gold sinks means more money even faster, which will devalue the gold. This sounds great for casual players on first glance - respecs will be cheaper, after all, so you'll have to spend less and it'll be easier to keep your gold. But it also means that AH prices will likely go up. An item going for 10g is expensive if everybody has only a hundred gold, but peanuts if everybody has a thousand.
---
Thats a really good point! I hadnt even thought about that.
---
Yeah, I too think priests, warriors and druids should have to deal with 100g goldsinks. They can easily grind that gold! 
---
I do that in 2 hours of ZF grinding. - How frost mages sees things.
---
and you know, if not nost we would never have classic. I also can't understand people who don't want to progress in that game, you'll be cannon fodder if you don't do stuff or you'll do molten core for 5 hours without consumes.
---
That's why people keep doing it. No one wants take time to deter these people.
---
The Retakin.  An armor-capped thunder turkey that can root you in place and gently tickle you with Ashkandi.
---
You dont. Non of our mages do.
---
Do you hit p2?
---
I had the same in RFC.... An agi item dropped the rogue needed on it, the druid too but he was heale in this dungeon even though he plays feral while leveling.
---
 the rogue got really mad and quit we finished it as 4.
---
Lol but you realize if you are rolling on 3 different gear sets you could literally fuck an entire group over? The point of a hybrid is not to take every piece of gear.
---
I wish we could clone our chars to retail and get these tmogs.
---
I had a great time,but damm its a failure. Lso,phasing is bad for classic,let me go experience the other raids already.
---
Call in for reinforcements. Use World or Lookingforgroup, or guildies.
---
That's what you get if you rush through the content with streamer entitlement.
---
agree agree agree
---
&gt; came out of the woodwork
---
Unstealthed?
---
I love killing that Hylinth kid
---
Anyone green yes. 
---
Grey no
---
You are not even playing the game and telling corpse runs are not worse lol. Go and join one of this 70:30 servers and tell this again
---
Armored warbear! :D
---
Sounds like you would fit right in with OP's former guild.
---
it doesn't work like that
---
Best healers in the game.
---
What server do you play on? And if you can think of a solution I’d love to hear it. People already have quit the game because of faction imbalances.
---
Nah lmao not in dungeons, cause for me it’s PvP gear&gt; PVE set, thru both dungeons and raids, I get gear for PvP
---
Kicking a pug for a guildie once you've thrown out a line and invited someone to your party is one of the biggest no-nos in my guild.  Like, this is a bigger rule than any of our raid rules actually lol. 
---
Sucks for the pug, and looks bad on us.  We don't tolerate that shit and I'm sure a lot of other guild leadership feels the same.
---
He was our guild master.  He disbanded the guild, nuked the discord and then posted slander about us all over the internet. It was the ultimate betrayal. Google Medellín Hand of Rag Arugal and I'm sure you'll get some history.
---
There are people who don't close vendor windows by walking away from the npc?
---
Here, let me pass my prebis shoulder off to some random rogue. After all I can just roll into mc and loot a pair of giantstalker whenever I feel like it.
---
I always enjoyed being dps, never really got into tanking or healing
---
lol imagine min maxing like this in Classic
---
I transmute Undeath &gt; Water every day for 20g, and buy the mats for fire prot potions and sell the pots.  From the transmute alone I make more than enough to pay for my sub, I just have to build up enough to be worth trading.
---
Walt a minute, Alliance can now transfer server?
---
depends on how fast your guild can kill rag.
---
I think leveling as fury is fun. Actually doing it right now.
---
Suboptimal? Maybe a bit. Miserable? Not at all.
---
It's OS, he's not going to use it. It doesn't make the guild weaker at all and can be turned into a nexus crystal when they come out.
---
He sounds like he has some developmental disabilities
---
You paid 3g for a mage portal? Jeeeez
---
Future internet points.
---
Even in guilds that do drink to regain mana, int only has a value if you end the fight oom. If you are not oom, the extra int does nothing in the fight (except a tiny bit of +crit). Some fights +int is very good (like chromaggus in bwl, where all you do is dispelling), but not really any fights in molten core.
---
Like him or not losing him isnt good for the game. If all the top tier streamers (top tier as in view counts) leave, it definently makes classic look less lucrative to Activison and Amazon (owner of twitch)
---
Damn how is horde gonna get any HKs now? All they can do is exploit and camp and now you’re taking one thing away
---
It's a ring, not a trinket. Can you name a single utility ring?
---
If you roll and that and not on their Dal Rend’s they’ll probably have no idea with it.
---
With the world PvP being as harsh as it is currently I also tend to rely more on summons as a tank.
---
What measures is the GM referring to when he says players can mediate this themselves??
---
Do you enjoy tanking though?
---
Dude yes thank you! It’s awesome
---
1.12 talents and abilities are way more powerful than 1.12 itemization.
---
i.e. Warlocks can get 3% spell hit from 1.12 items when they couldn't get any spell hit from gear at original vanilla launch. Big deal. That's not killing Rag for you.
---
But Druid tanks that have 12,000 armor, baseline Hurricane, and baseline Innervate? Those Druids would have had 6,000 armor, no Hurricane, and no Innervate if we used launch abilities and talents. Paladin's Blessing of Kings would have been the 31-point talent in Retribution instead of the 11-point talent in Protection. And so on...
---
this guy knows what’s up, blizzzard is just a small indie company stop pressuring them
---
The guild better hope they never need more backup healers then. Which was already stated that he does heal dungeons for them.
---
Nope.
---
UD Rogue in vanilla for PvP since was overpopulated alliance and wanted to be able to pick my fights, but never ganked without waiting for them to finish the mob and/ or warning.
---
Warrior and Druid alts to 60 to raid.
---
Played a Hunter on a pserver just because it was a solo thing so it was that or lock.
---
Mage In classic just to farm gold, warrior or pally will become main. 
---
All pragmatic choices.
---
&gt;Attacking me as a person instead of my argument. Nice.
---
You don't have an argument. Either you're being deliberately obtuse you're you're actually just an idiot. Choose one.
---
I did a 2 pack pull, the ones at the big tree. Was very intense, had to health pot :p need more hp to do that one properly.
---
&gt;Even with a catseye potion you have to be literally standing right on someone to detect them,
---
with my felhunter out (paranoia buff) and no other stealth detect buffs I see rogues pretty reliably in a 10m radius
---
Or, you don't use lionheart helm as a ret paladin and instead use T2?
---
Lionheart isn't the end all, be all answer like it is for warriors. The 2% hit is quite awkward and you have an equivalent option with T2 and better options with T2.5 and R13. None of those other options has hit. Replacing Lionheart requires a lot of shuffling around, which you can avoid by just not taking it in the first place.
---
Oh, and that 1% hit from dragonscale with lionheart? Well, what when you get ony neck and onslaught girdle? That's already 2% hit on there. Now, you are already overcapped and must either replace your bds or your expensive lionheart helm.
---
&gt;This was one hundred percent enforced by GM's during vanilla retail. Just had to have chat proof which they get from their log
---
Yeah, it was. 
---
I got a 30 day ban and most of my gold removed for a CoD scam I ran back then (sending random 50-60 characters "Krol Blades" in giftwrap for 50g CoD). 
---
They refunded every bit I made to the buyers.
---
Yeah paranoia is the only reliable buff for this, it's true.
---
If we take my guild as an example, and I assume most guilds are like this: I have maybe 6-7 people in my guild I tolerate and actually like to play with. The rest are ass-hats who I dont like and dont like to play with, but I manage since raiding is still pretty fun.
---
If anyone in my guild scammed you, I'd probably kick him from the guild, tell him to eat dirt, but I would never ever pay you back for whatever that pos did to you. Thats his problem. So he really should not expect anything, so his outlook is fine at least.
---
So that the server you just left has even less alliance player, great idea.
---
&gt; Frankly the sad part is we can all calculate active PvP population very easily. No one's bothered to try lol.
---
How? I am interested. There is no website for honor ladder like we had in vanilla.
---
Tell that to people in Laos...
---
wow indeed, that is the ultimate betrayal, holy shit.
---
You would hope, but its sadly about a 50/50 chance of being legit
---
So many people breaking the god damn rules...  :(
---
Just that. 
---
You are far away from efficient healing. Thats Not bc you dont know, its bc if you Wanna See yourself in healmeter you have to Flash Heal. MC is like Zero dmg income raid. Its all about Heal sniping. You just bring so many Healers to rescue World Buffs from over aggroing meeles..
---
let me guess. you’re horde
---
Bonus healing did exist. "Spell damage and healing" did not exist though. You could only get bonus damage to a specific school of spells.
---
Different scale too - 40m raids are fun!
---
Had this happen to one of our healers whos from lithuania right before an mc raid, makes me think this isnt an uncommon ocurrance, does this kind of thing happen on a daily basis or is it really rare in germany?
---
*Metal Gear Solid 4 intro starts playing*
---
If only I could be so grossly incandescent.
---
Losing a bunch of immature players because their "god" left isn't bad for the game.
---
You're delusional if you think this will affect classic's bottomline.
---
Let’s say it’s 60/40 horde to ally across all servers. If an average WSG match takes 20 min mutes then allys will queue up pretty much instantly and horde will get to play 2/3 games meaning 10 min queues on average. Could easily be up to 15 minutes given other factors but 1 hour queues don’t seem very likely.
---
I'm having a blast. I've been taking my sweet time enjoying the experience so far instead of rushing my way through everything with the idea that "it will get fun later."
---
A lot of warriors are toxic  primadonas who chain pull we. Healer is oom and freak when they die, try to reserve everything, etc...
---
Plenty of mages just pop open trade windows and drop water and offer multiple ports at the end.
---
It’s just random and your sample size is small.
---
That's true of regen in general.  Also, you can use higher rank heals to go OOM faster.
---
More insults. Reddit is at its peak this evening.
---
Heavens forbid that they have to leave cruise control for a second.
---
Probably because they didn't have 50000 people online at once.
---
Shaman all the way. Much more to micromanage, especially if we are talking battlegrounds as resto/ele
---
Hopefully you're right. But it's just not him leaving. Alot of players are falling off. The buzz about the game is dying and I fear what Activision will do if it becomes significantly less profitable.
---
Have to disagree. The sheer amount of offensive/defensive spells as well as a huge amount of situational totems that have to be used perfectly timed to achieve the necessary effects + no room for failure due to no hard cc and low mobility make shamans easily the considerably harder class to play well in pvp and to master.
---
Having more than twice the population of the alliance will probably help.
---
Was 2/49 runs for me.
---
Luckily he dropped it second go.
---
Holy nova your way through SFK. One Shadowfang or assassins blade and you are set!
---
It's funny that MC to remove the debuff is forbidden but sheep is not, while actually doing the same thing kinda.
---
It should still be allowed to MC the target for 20s to wait the debuff to go away right? And if the target breaks the CC then I dont really think the preist is to blame.
---
Looking for a Horde guild for me and 4-5 friends on Bigglesworth NA. We're nerds but none of us have played much WoW in the past so I'm looking for semi-casual friendly guild to explore all the brand new (to us) end game content with :D Just hit level 58, though it has been hard when friends aren't online to get a group together for anything as a PUG, and getting ganked by roving 10+ gangs of allies has made questing frustrating to say the least. Cheers!
---
It's a very expensive exploit for very questionable benefit. If it affected spell damage it would've been patched in a heartbeat, but healing? Meh, unless someone drops 1k gold to become a pvp god for a day, they won't notice it.
---
    /run print(GetHitModifier())
---
***
---
Will show you an integer in your chat window in-game with the value of your hit-rating
---
+ Yes it is that simple
---
Earthfury has been super balanced. Like 50.1/49.9. A few alliance guilds just transferred from the streamer server, so a few more horde players to recover the balance would be welcome.
---
Just give us the GM name and we'll add it to the Global Kromcrush Horde KoS list.
---
He’s pointing out if you’re farming and down health and mana and have a mob on you and turn a gank - even though this is much more skillful the honor system doesn’t reward it as much as just running around ganking easy 0 skill kills.
---
That it rewards quantity and not quality which was a common complaint when it was released in vanilla.
---
So literally the opposite. All half health/mana Hanks are welfare kills and we all know it.
---
Seems you are misunderstanding. 
---
In the OPs example, do you really think he would be on Reddit complaining if the Enh shammy said at the start "yo i am happy to heal, but I am rolling on Enh gear". No, its pretty obvious the shammy healed the dungeon then out of no where rolled on HoJ and then said "oh I main Enh".
---
Thrash Blade is a very good mainhand for a human warrior. It is better than the sword of zeal for a warrior, so that's not really an option. You basically have three good options:
---
1) show up to raid with thrash / mirah's until you get a sword from MC or Ony
---
2) farm UBRS until you get dal rend swords 
---
3) buy a krol blade 
---
4) if you're nuts, go for Ironfoe
---
They're all good options, just depends on what you are prioritizing.
---
so fake.
---
gms never write like this
---
Yeah we've been down this exact road before. Downvoted and tagged.
---
Seems pretty good
---
Holy Restoration - no one will die ever again.
---
Having the same problem atm.
---
I'd recommend the disarm immune gloves from Strath UD.
---
That way you can enchant your ravager (lol) if you want.
---
Pretty sure taurens beat orcs in strength
---
Someone else will repost it as their own for said future karma.
---
It's not a mage portal, it's a warlock summon straight in to BRM.
---
Sword of zeal is good for rogues but is bad for warriors, who get more rage from the extra attack on the thrash blade, which sims higher than sword of zeal
---
I thought MLP fandom was just for the meme. Until I met one in real life. His car was full of MLP plushies. He even flew to the US for a MLP convention. Yuck.
---
[quote]Annoyingly, the horde is the majority of playerbase, from a business perspective implementing a faction queue is screwing over your majority... so why would you do it ?[/quote]
---
Because not doing so will lead the minority to quit, leaving the majority with fewer targets, leading to boredom, so they quit eventually anyway. Better to fix it quick than lose everything later.
---
Why do I want you to ask me questions about the high elves?
---
Fine, I'll humor you then. Getting paladin buffs through mind control is not an exploit. Casting spells with mind control is an intended game mechanic. 
---
If a horde guild used a paladin alt and mind controlled him to buff a raid to push content, that would be a clever use of mechanics. 
---
And it is incomprehensible to me as to how you don't understand this which is why people are calling you an idiot.
---
Yikes
---
if money is instant why don't i have mine yet i just sent it
---
PVP rank gear.  Rough life ahead.
---
Absolutely shitty and you dodged a bullet by leaving the guild.
---
Ah sweet innocence
---
It doesn’t. I’ve never seen anyone punished from scamming in trade either... have you?
---
It's called a guild and people sometimes whisper others, it's called "social interaction"
---
It shouldn't be used, because it's awkward to upgrade and at best equivalent to compositions, which don't use it.
---
E.g. if you use a non-set composition, which is equivalent, you can upgrade right away andnow have better items than with bds. With bds, you can't really upgrade, as you either have to wait for another upgrade, which may take weeks to arrive or replace your set with the other equivalent options you could have used before.
---
Yes, that was sarcasm.
---
Obviously Paladin buffs with Mind Control are NOT an exploit. And neither is attacking someone in PvP combat after you Mind Control them.
---
I'm in a hc guild(fighting between first and second spot on our server), we just send mats to the crafter and they craft it when they feel like it. If you REALLY want it immediately, get it from /trade for a fee. Stop being an ass making your guild mates who have lives feel bad simply because you are cheap.
---
I never advertise, I just stand still on a convenient spot.
---
In Orgrimmar maybe 3-5 gold an hour if Im the fastest to invite a /yell LF portal. Lots of competition to be the first one to invite a dude.
---
Im kargath around raid times there are to many mages. And every raid group has its own mages so close to nothing.
---
Kargath during offtimes can be 10-30g depents on the amound of mages there.
---
Undercity is a good spot with 10-20g an hour.
---
Fishing in Ferales can also give 5-20g an hour ON TOP of your fishing income. Lots of people want water here and 6 stacks gives you 2-3g sometimes.
---
It’s definitely not just an honor thing because there are lvl 60s that corpse camp my alt in his low 40s...
---
You need to relax. Your entire post history is just you going off raging at people. That level of stress isnt healthy.
---
I respec back and forth between tanky feral and swiftmend resto. None of those specs are ideal for farming.
---
What warrior wears bds, when truestrike shoulders exist? I've never ever seen any warrior even considering bds.
---
It's fine, if WW3 ever happens and bombs are used, there won't be any great grandchildren to clean things up.
---
“sorry m8 you can’t roll on gear if there is a theoretical replacement from mc”
---
i don't even know how tu fucking post or reply on the blizzard forums
---
I agree with this except I'd say ZF until 53. ZF is insanely nice xp
---
Imo this really depends on how much gold you'll get from tribute VS how much you can make from herbs OR from potions. I think once you get the tribute down its actually insane gold so what I would suggest is probably dropping herb and getting engi and then you can slowly get your druid leveled as your farmer. It also depends imo if you have any nice potions for alch, flasks or anything like that you'll obviously want to have a character that can craft those.
---
Doing so on onyxia reset day is a doubly bold move.
---
I think Mirah's song from the scholomance quest if I'm not mistaken.
---
That guy really doesn't like Gamon
---
Was his name Howard Wolowitz?
---
This GM is full of shit. One of my first learning experiences in this game (I was a dumb 12 year old) was stealing someone's mats. My account was stripped of the mats, returned to the player, and I got suspended. This is a direct violation of the ToS.
---
You're absolutely right, attacking someone in PvP after you mind control them is not an exploit. 
---
But doing it while you're dueling someone to remove the honorless target debuff and prevent other players from gaining honor on him is.
---
Impossible to quest from 50-60 right now as a horde. I imagine it’s the same for ally. Server is pretty balanced. Usually when running brd it’s a coin flip on whether I’ll die once or seven times.
---
Surely.
---
yep.. 100g a week suckkssss
---
This one is not BoP and the recipe has been selling on the AH regularly on my server.

You’re not wrong

I am not sure.

Think about actually using their free transfers so they don’t end up killing the entire server and have to move anyways.
---
A couple hints for the demons:
---
* Winterspring: You have to kite it at very max distance (&gt;30yards). I got an addon to tell me if I was above 30 yards. You need to use Concussive Shot and Arcane Shot Rank 1 on cooldown and just keep Serpent Sting up all the time, then it is just a matter of time. The video guides show you where the best place is to start the battle and which route to take. Also, bring a couple friends. one to clear mobs behind you so you dont aggro into them while kiting, and a priest for when you fail and get the debuff. If you get the debuff just FD and have the priest dispell the curse. Also, bring some mana potions.
---
* Un'Goro: Some video strategies tell you that you can separate Precious and Simone. This is not true anymore. Some strategies tell you to kite Precious and kill Simone at the same time. I would say that it is infinitely easier to just kill Precious first and then Simone. There is a way to stop Simone from casting by using Viper Sting, but just run out of range of her attack. Only use Concussive Shot on Precious when it is far ahead of Simone. You do NOT want her to overtake Precious, as it will become really hard to outrange her attacks while still keeping aggro. Use Concussive Shot, Serpent Sting and Auto Attack with a couple of Multi Shots weaved in. Maybe bring a friend to clear mobs around the thing you are kiting. You can use the lake in west Un'Goro, but there is also a giant tree to the very south at the start of her route that is very good!
---
* Silithis: Honestly this demon can be cheesed by bringing a Warlock. Near the place you fight the demon, duel the Warlock and have it cast Curse of Recklessness on you. While in the duel, start fightning the demon and use Wingclip to immobilize it. With the curse on you cannot be feared which makes you able to get several Aimed Shots while still kite the small beetles it spawn. 
---
* Burning Steppes: Good luck avoiding being ganked. It's so close to Blackrock Mountain that there are a ton of people coming through! This demon takes a lot of patience, and I have not beaten it yet, but are pretty close. Scorpid Sting when (and only when) he enrages. Go melee and get off a melee swing then Wingclip, go in range and auto attack. Get a good distance if the wing clip stops before he enrages again. Have Concussive Shot and Scatter Shot ready if you mess up. Here you should just bring friends for protection/ress, but this (and somewhat Simone) can be soloed. 
---
For all the demons it is nice to bring several stacks of water and some food, so meet up with a mage friend beforehand and get them to conjure some of that good stuff! 
---
Wow this got long. :P Good luck!
---
Because it doesn't.
---
The crafter would take a wash on the mats. They're also hard to farm.
---
hybrid spec 
---
effective spec 
---
pick 1
---
maybe if you only play the game with one spec and don't pvp or have the free time to spend hours every day farming gold to afford the respec costs then i can see why you wouldn't want dual spec but otherwise i can't
---
You can't summon inside of DM for some reason.
---
I'm honestly sad. 
---
Have we all forgotten World of Roguecraft?
---
The naked undead rogue with a rusty dagger running around killing.... anyone he wanted?
---
This debate was settled over a decade ago, the production credit on the video is literally, "Rogues Take Zero Skill - Proudly Presents" hosted by all Rogues......
---
We need a Shame Nun.
---
I think it comes down to three elements. Both classes have fairly expansive kits, but there are some important differences.
---
Shamans are vulnerable to being school silenced, and they can't cleanse it. This is a huge avenue of skill, because you have to know the conditions when each silencing class will do its thing and you need to try to juke or bait it.
---
Shamans have no mobility. Ghostwolf talen only works for enhance shaman, which is generally agreed to be a pretty bad pvp class at anything other than duels. Your positioning is more important, and your ability to disengage or avoid a fight are severely hurt.
---
Rogues have escape/fight reset mechanics. Stealth lets rogues decide when to fight, and when to run. It gives them chance against many classes to restart a stun combo. It's not infallible, but the shaman just doesn't have this. This means being lower skill will result in more deaths, instead of just popping invisible and walking away.
---
So yeah. Shamans just have a couple of extra dimensions on them the rogues don't need to worry about.
---
What the fuck is " &gt;w&lt; " supposed to mean?
---
Axe from ud strat
---
The first full MC clear was done with a raid of mostly 56-59 people in blue gear. Back in vanilla at least 10 people were routinely afk (or focusing so little they might as well have been) and we still cleared MC.
---
I don't care how 'bad' moonkins are, MC really isn't the content where you need to be min maxing to the extend of not taking a loyal raider with you just because of his spec.
---
Thrash blade is better for fury warrior DPS than the sword of zeal. Whatever you do, don't buy a sword of zeal for a warrior.

Yes it is rude to camp fp I agree.

This guy quotes.

As far as I understand, all of this information is private. You'd have to ask around, and trust people's estimate of their rank points (it's not given as a number, just a bar).
---
A data collecting addon could easily do this, and estimate the bar accurately too.
---
This is what we call arguing in bad faith. Arguing without any intention to consider the other point of view, and when you run out of any kind of defense you say "well it's not up for us to decide anyway"

As a rogue I want this so bad....but also as a rogue if it drops I'd let the tank have it if he wants it....but I want it so bad. Aside from how nicely painful it is on foes....it also translates what you say into dwarven for a few seconds after proccing.

What a dumbass he is then.

Sorry for your loss.

Fuck blizzard would take them 5 min to look into this and restore your shit.  Lazy ass gma, wtf do they even get paid to do.

I've lost count how many barb blades I've vendored))
---
Technically you can do it for a week if you prevent logging out and DCs
---
Sounds like some mage/lock made a fuss about how the moonkin was goin to get some bis gear over them.  Its prolly a blessing in disguise that you got kicked.  I play a ret pally, so i know the road to becoming a respected raider is tough.  Its important to keep in mind, that loot doesnt matter for the first couple months of wow, its more about finding a home and helping the guild progress, even when you personally have to sacrifice.  Find a group where you dont care about some dkp points and its all gravy.  Youll get the staff eventually
---
It would be better if the guards weren't there tbh.  Also don't worry I'm not complaining, I one shotted your shit toons with an aimed shot crit and didn't even aggro the guards.  Also killed the 3 guys camping me after I finally got a 1v1 in.  I'm happy with the results.

There is no point. Just like there's no point in logging in if you're alliance.
---
It's almost like you were a subscriber to [every single pop culture sub ever].
---
My argument has not changed. I don't think it should be an exploit. I've never said anything more or less.
---
You are saying it IS an exploit. That is very different.
---
'It's the burglars stash I swear, I'll keep it in case they want it back'
---
I feel like many people felt peer pressured into playing pvp servers from the “pvp is the true classic experience” crowd. This is what you signed up for...
---
&gt;w&lt;
---
you cant expect just as good support on a game thats both generating less revenue and an ever shrinking matgin than from 15 years ago is the point.
---
Nice. I wasn’t actually aware of this. We did the GUID trick on Onyxia. I wonder if it’ll get changed for Rag too.
---
I’d argue that running in and out is a lot less to coordinate too.
---
Exactly this. I'm on a server, which is maybe 60/40. I like the "balance" of the server and would wish this (or rather 50/50) for all the servers.
---
But don't for a minute think the balance would solve most of the problems you are stating in the post. On my server you are  not safe to quest as either alliance or horde. Everywhere gank squads. I am lucky I'm 60 already, but guildies are unable to quest, even tho we are outnumbering the alliance. EVERY time I go to EPL or WPL I encounter a PVP group of 5-10 people which instantly kill me (if they catch me (which they usually do because of paladins)). BRM is sometimes controlled by Horde, some times by Alliance. So far every time I've been to DM, it was controlled by Alliance. 
---
I  for one don't have problem with the ganking and the state of the world. But I'm on a close to balanced server, and level 60. If I was 48+ or on an unbalanced server, I would probably also dislike it. But I LIKE the sense of danger, being on the edge of the seat and never knowing whom I will encounter in the next few yards. Before the patch most of the interaction with alliance were friendly and people weren't even bother ot attack you. But nowadays its action as soon as you see opposite faction (which I prefer to the previous state of world). 
---
I think things will get alot easier for leveling after the BG introduction, but some highly populated servers will probably still have problems leveling due to the sheer number of poeple playing.
---
Mine was the classic: AGHHHH HOLY FUCK CORKFM3IFEMMRKGM2 I BIT INTO MY HOT POCKET AND THE FILLING SHOT OUT THE BACK AND INTO THE OPEN HOLE OF MY BOXERS"

Nobody ever asked for more details.

I think it might be eyes and a nose? Or mouth?
---
In P1 its surprisingly good, actually.
---
:)
---
Jaina was though so...
---
That's true. Although I didn't sign up to get killed every 5 minutes. Like I said there definitely needs to be more pve servers.
---
imagine being the last one. i understand why some children go crazy and stab their parents
---
The thing with epgp is that it heavily discourages people bidding offspec. It's also a really bad idea to transition to a system like this partway through a raid tier, especially then making more changes (OS is free -&gt; OS costs half) partway through.
---
I agree that you got fucked here, but I don't think that the system itself is bad, just that it should be applied evenly across the board.
---
No it wasn't. 
---
Oh, so you're changing your original point then?
---
Or Alliance in ZT
---
Imagine you picked horde on the single Alliance dominated PVP server
---
Then go PvE or go Horde 😅
---
You didn’t HAVE TO start on a pvp server
---
Clearly during my weed days I was doing it all wrong :o
---
Make one of your party member the unwitting offtank by just ignoring the skull mob. It's really difficult to hold on to multiple.mobs especially at low levels so it's fine to let your party nuke down one mob while you build up threat on the rest.
---
in europe we have 3 non-rp no-pvp server out of 30. doing launch pretty much all server was quene. i picked the server my retail guild went to.

---
They are the hardest class to gear I believe because of the random drops. You need Dal rends which is 2.5%, HoJ which is like 3% and the chest from arena which is also a couple of % only. Then you need the lionheart helm which is like a couple hundred gold and edgemasters too.
---
Their preraid bis is a nightmare imho.
---
They wouldn't as far as I can tell. I've not used it at all but I'm prot so that might be why
---
Omg I didn’t know you could do this! :D
---
Don't worry, as a Horde player on a Horde dominated server, I spend more time dead than alive when I visit any 50+ zone.  I spent most of 58-60 grinding level 47-50 mobs.  Trying to do anything else was exactly how you described.
---
Paranoia is the insane; it's like +100, the only thing stronger is perception which is like +300
---
The mind control method is to force their hand at attacking your friend you are dueling, so that honorless target is removed since "they" performed a hostile action. Sheeping and waiting is still waiting, the mind control method specifically bypasses the honorless target buff and is the crux of the issue here.  
---
TLDR: Not the same
---
Loool
---
If you get to be the best tank, the best dps and one of the best group  pvpers - there is a cost.  
---
No changes means no changes. Be glad you rolled the best class and had the perseverance to reach 60.  
---
Get your guild to pay your respec costs.
---
Felhunter is invaluable in a group since paranoia is applied to your entire party.
---
Big risk nothing will change, lhc is 5 min away from undercity. They don't sit afk in que.

Pretty sad that Blizzard just doesn't fix this themselves in the back-end.
---
Can’t wait till I can mind control! :D
---
&gt;  I'm expecting to start making bank really soon
---
Don't get your hopes up too much.  A lot of people don't want to pay for enchants.
---
They'll only tip 1-5g for things like crusader or superior striking.  It's totally not worth it for that kind of money as you don't sell enchants that often and the good recipes are hard or time consuming to farm.
---
I've made decent money from it (as in, broken even factoring in arcanite rod and levelling costs) because I have a spell power enchant from molten core and could demand high prices for from non guild members. (only one other person on the server had it at the time).  Soon the enchant will become common enough that it's not worth much.
---
I tend set prices and if people don't want to pay I don't do the enchant.  I get some salt because "lol why should I pay for you to click a button".  I always respond with something like "because you can't click the button yourself".
---
Don't pay 500g for a recipe.  You will not earn your money back.
---
All things considered, I'd probably do alchemy so I can make my own consumables.
---
Regarding the details change, that was to reflect vanilla capability.
---
I did it as horde on Heartseeker. Just be prepared to move to the next demon if the spot is too busy. In winterspring I had to camp another hunter till he left so I could do it. Burning steppes I eventually caught the demon by the hill and brought him up out of the way. Ungoro should be fine mostly lowbies in that zone now that DS leather lost value, I still did it on the southern edge and kited up a hill like burning steppes. Silithus should be the least contested but my first attempt spiraled into a big party v party pvp battle. GL.
---
Make a lvl 1 orc or troll. Run north of Durotar to the river beside org. Swim north and drown yourself once you reach Azshara. Take the spirit Rez and spend ~15 minutes getting to the boss location.  
---
Alliance version is make a night elf and would be longer, maybe an hour?
---
Finally. A horde that gave an intelligent response.
---
Now you gotta kill them, then kill them again, or just wait and kill them.   This sucks.
---
Shaman because you can't hide like a coward
---
Wow okay, so scamming with professions/trades is now legal? Thx Blizz, gonna go make some money for that sweet epic mount /s
---
blizzard support sucks right now
---
I am looking forward to it. Did my first dungeon yesterday and it was a blast! Not a single wipe on deadmine, but it still was hard to maintain aggro on 3 mobs at the same time :) Luckily, last boss managed to drop a sword for me :)
---
Good lord.  It's amazing these dumbass guilds are even conceived, let alone large enough to raid.  I guess some people like this form, but it is just super ridiculous and unnecessarily complex.

Because then it leads to posts like these.

---
12345qerzxcv~fg and both shift and alt modifiers for everything.  Only aspects I bind are hawk monkey cheetah, mongoose raptor and melee macro'd on one button together. Pet attack and passive macro'd into other abilities.
---
Even with those 45 keys you're still going to be moving things back and forth for raids vs PvP. Just the cost of doing business.
---
Any horde : "pvp happened on a pvp server you should just get better scrub or reroll it was like this in vanilla herp derp"
---
Thats on the individual playing imo.  There were plenty of guides listing the difference between servers pre launch, and very clear signs that the priv server crowd were going to be pushing hard to make their marks.  Hell apes members leveled a char 0-60 weekly for months in prep for launch.  The issue is I think is in vanilla when 90% the players didn't expect anything.  The game was how it shld be because it was all we knew.  Now people are returning with rose tinted goggles, and new players with false expectation.  Now blizz cld have made servers with advisory skill/effort levels.  But we all know that if there was a 'noob' server it wld be under populated as no one wld roll there.  The issues in Wpvp come from this split I think.  You have a grp.of players on both side who are min/maxing hard.  And one of these areas is honour.  People will farm as fast and efficiently as they can, regardless of faction.  No different to seeing capped ppl in T2 by second week.  Some people will always go bigger than you in wow, and they will norm have a clear advantage over you due to this, either by gear, skill or consumables.  This is and always was at the the heart of vanilla/classic.  Not everyone can be in the top 10%.   Some of us need to be fodder.

Coming from a scrub trying to claw his was into mid tier x

Same thing.

wait we make videos? :o

Things can be both funny and sad
---
the code would be extremely simple leave the respec costs in the way they are now, but before you respec you do a level check, if level &lt; 60 then free respec, if level &gt; 60 then payed respec
---
just a simple if then else statement
---
I am not sure the person you are replying to understands that you don't grind honor ranks like experience, and that your rank is based on a comparison to other players of your faction on your server. So farming honor like this while also depriving people of your own faction of gaining honor is akin to double dipping for each kill.
---
Yeah that's pretty much how I feel. I leveled my first character on herod horde, and I do like wpvp to some extent (mostly contesting the opposing faction for mobs/resources) idgaf about the wpvp zergs/flightpoint ganking. I am interested in doing bgs when they do come in, but the queues will likely suck. I have however rerolled an alliance toon on remulos because I work pretty late and even herod doesn't have much activity at 3-4 am server time. The problem is that players choose their realms based on friends/what thr majority faction is. When the first couple rounds of server transfers opened up the minority faction left creating a gigantic server imbalance, why should I be punished with a super long log in queue to play because all the alliance left herod? While leveling I'd say horde was probably the majority, but I did see a lot of alliance running around the first month, but I stopped seeing them so much aside from maybe outside of instances after that.
---
The need for everyone in classic to min max is honestly exhausting and unnecessary. If respeccing is too expensive, don't do it. There is a cost to it, this is it.
---
Oh honey...

The &gt;&lt; are the eyes. The w is a pulled up mouth.

I've a lot of DKP and I took the T2 helm from Ony the other day. It was just a stat upgrade and an iconic item I thought, and I still remained the highest dkp mage. Then I realized the item I need most (Azuresong Mageblade - I know you're out there!) will be needed by our paladins as well and I genuinely started to feel down for taking an item, since there's a pally with higher dkp right now.
---
Then after some thime I realized it's a game and who cares. I don't actually "need" anything, it's just supposed to be fun. Funny how a game has such an effect on one's mental state.
---
that might be a bit too much though ;)
---
Please can you make an update post at lvl 42? Thx
---
It is vastly different - by doing the duel/MC thing, you also makes it so only you two can get the honor, everyone else cant. You guarantee full honor for yourself aswell as removing the honorless debuff AND you can kill them while they are cc'd.
---
I'm still using my true shot shoulders as a hunter after 15 MC.
---
So no, you don't necessarily change them quickly. It depends on the amont of other hunters in your raid and luck ofc.
---
Nonetheless these drop in the first boss fight of UBRS. Actually rogues and warriors shouldn't feel in a hurry  to get them since they should also be after dal'rend anyway.
---
It's about having to make choices. When you can do everything nothing means anything. It's changes like this that resulted in the bland and meaningless experience of retail.
---
Of course the church guy wants to get the children
---
yup seems fair imo
---
Do you maybe have discord invite for warrior discord?
---
Actually i was thinking if I can wear one... Do I need to go to ranged/hunter trainer to get the skill to wear one?
---
Also, that's true that 2lv's higher helps a lot! Although, i managed to do my first deadmine run and got tons of new equipment along with the BiS 19lv sword for me so I am looking forward to it!
---
Also, i am not sure where to look for some guilds... Should I look on the chat in Stormwind or there is some specific discord for my world :)
---
Get fucked, cunt

Was wondering if it's worth to download it, since last time I was using any addons was back in WoTLK.

Seriously what does 60 matter? What do you do at 60? Try to do dungeons. Is that possible? Nope

---
Found the zoomer
---
I agree with you that something needs to be done but transfer is an uncharted territory in classic/vanilla. 
---
How do you deal with shamans/paladins? What about faction specific gear? 
---
I’m sure there is many more issues that I haven’t thought about. 
---
I think the faction specific queues would be a nice none intrusive approach but limiting players ability to play even though the server has the capacity is going to create a lot of sour faces. 
---
I think the we have to see how BGs change up the state of the game. That’s the initial “fix” they have decide to roll out. If it doesn’t help then blizzard has to start looking at other things
---
The margin on transmute recipes is however very good imho. If you plan to play for more than 2-3 months they are worth.
---
Buy 4 bottomless bags if you're a true memer.

Cool man! Yeah it's a mix of two runs. We've killed Rag in phase 1 mostly so I had to use the footage I had for the sons :P I think it turned out nice still.

Elvui as other have said

And try weakauras for buff, debuff and general UI enhancement
---
I solo'd the sfk part at lvl 22. Pull the packs of two and drag them to the dungeon entrance. Kill one mob, leave, drink up, repeat. The elite jail warden mob was painful since theres two wolves so close by. Took a couple tries to only get him and one wolf to aggro me. Again, kite to entrance and then leave. Kill both wolfs and then solo the big boi. The courtyard part is the easiest. Just hug the wall and clear one mob at a time :)

That link should be good.

Yeah that is what I thought at first you can for sure. I just happened to learn gun ( in ironforge)  first. I am pretty sure you can learn bow as well. There are specific trainers who you can learn the skill from just simple search you should be able to find.  
---
Nice nice good! I found random leveling guilds through /1 chat in cities or starting areas or /4 chat is also a place people will advertise. I met some cool people when running dungeons and what not and stayed in contact and found a good guild that way. Just talk to people and have a good Time then everything will fall into place as long as an effort is being made. There should be a discord server for your server just search on the subreddit and the official forums.

I also don’t think it’s split. So both get full honor.

God damn

Check out the comments my guy, it's "The Official World of Warcraft Cookbook" and I posted a link to it on Amazon too. It's awesome!

I love the whining.
---
Horde not finding alliance is pretty hillarious. I pvp in group every night and if we find a horde group its basicly kill and move on. If we find a horde group that's bigger than us-&gt; prepare to get camped for the next hour, even if you dont res.
---
I couldn't imagine us ever really 'camping' a group of hordes (and mock their stupidity for doing it) cuz its horribly honor efficient. But I guess i can understand it now. I wonder what their top honor earners honor standings are compare to ours.

The duality of man.
---
This sub hate rogues so there's a pretty obvious bias here.
---
But you need to clarify what you mean by "hard to play".
---
The skillcap is way way higher on rogue than shaman. Shaman does have fairly high entry to play skill with all their abilities and such you need to know when and how to use. They are quite versatile so that takes a bit.
---
One can pvp wtih a shaman for a month and know pretty much all the stuff there is to know, but mastering a rogue takes years.
---
You can sell tanking services though, some income.

* Join or raid guild or convince your guild to raid on tuesday/wednesday (last day before reset and right after reset). Then you have a 2 week window without raids going on. Maybe Ony but Ony is easy.
---
* Raid in PvP specc for now. MC is very easy and in my guild people raid in PvP specc if they want. Shouldn't be an issue for any decent guild.
---
* Reroll an alt. Our guild leader is our MT but he also has an alt he plays as fury.
---
The first two require only a bit of effort. Instead of demanding the game to change for your every need just adapt.
---
Well careful to not be suspended apparently.... Its funny how for gamebreaking bugs they are like "tHiS wAs In VaNiLlA sO nO fIx" but then gets involved in other things that ALSO were present in vanilla..
---
Maybe you should use toilet paper AND wash your hands, Quote Man.
---
Sweeping strikes is you bread and butter for questing. Plus it's also a bit easier to tank in dungeons. 
---
Or go for gold and just do melee cleaves for dungeons, it's so much fun. 3-4 arms specced warriors with a shaman. Having a priest or the shaman as healer. (Given you are horde ofcourse)
---
That too
---
They dont fix gamebreaking bugs because #nOcHaNgEs but then get involved in a bunch of other things that were present in vanilla..
---
Ya
---
But then I wouldn’t have time to quote you “man who quoted quote man”
---
This hasnt been an issue on my server at all and Im on a decent sized server. Im starting to wonder if all you guys are Asmonboys or Asmonhaters
---
Mouth and whiskers? Bloody furries!
---
he wants you to level up 48 faster
---
Mate, tank the runs yourself and reserve them. Will take a day tops to get both
---
Dunno wat you talking about got all the best shit while fury warriors can suck it.. BTW keep equipping leather I'm loving it in pvp you die so fast..
---
This... Exactly this
---
Many Local Pedos
---
The ques might be long and the no lifer already shown they take every chance they can to grief people so yeah there will be griefers, not as much maybe
---
We did that, but the Horde obviously start screeching in chat as they suddenly have another raid form and we get stomped.
---
SC destroys in pvp
---
I don't care if it was 4.13r9281mdoa version
---
Show me a Shaman killing any geared 60 while naked. I'll wait.
---
))&lt;&gt;((
---
The way I  handled this when I needed some armor crafted for me was to find someone who HAD the items crafted for them and to contact the crafters (after I knew for certain they could make it). Admittedly the guy in this story was probably ALSO able to make the helm, but this was one safeguard I had to fall back on.
---
I'm actually surprised the guy went to the trouble of switching servers for the sake of 700g worth of items. Yeah it's a lot, but that's kind of taking it a bit far (although the theft is also going a bit far).
---
So? I think this is hillariously clever, i would laugh my asss off if someone did that to me. Peoples attitude are so annoying nowdays, whining about every single thing, not able to handle ANY SORT OF obstacles or negative situation.
---
I had the same problem back in the day.  The heirlooms system were  encouraging me to do se after i've gathered them all.  Now  i have atleast 2 characters for every BG bracket or any instance role i want.   It-s really bice that i can login on retail and do whatever instance i want as whatever role i want to do it as.    So my advice is keep playing them as your heart desires.   When you finally coma back to them you would have allredy made progress. ( bgs are also comeung and friends to lvlup with  will apear i  the future.   Is this a problem tho?
---
Wat a douche
---
So it would be okay for the priest to simply MC for 20 seconds and then kill him, you do realize what you complaing about right, or does blizzard realize what they are whining about?
---
“AFK my city is getting bombed”, happened to me when I was in group with a guy from Ukraine 2-3 years ago. He was living in the war zone between Russia and Ukraine and he said whenever he hear explodes he was running to the bathroom to hide, he said that’s the most safest spot in his apartments. I asked him him why he didn’t left the war zone and he said that he has no money and everything’s around is pretty much destroyed and only that left to do is to play WoW. I was shocked
---
Nice counter argument smartass
---
The daughter played rogue, apparently.
---
New to reddit? Do this while you're shitting. I am pretty sure 90% of reddit is on the toilet at the time of most of their comments.
---
Lol, try again. Priest main here and I'm vehemently opposed to lowering respec costs. You're lucky I don't have my way because I'd make respeccing *much* more difficult. Not impossible, but also not exactly feasible to do often.
---
Eh, I've crafted stuff for people before (TBC, the motorcycle) but absolutely did not have the funds to make ANOTHER one (I'd made one for myself because *of course I did*). Someone may know for example how to make the Sulfuras epic hammer that BECOMES the actual Sulfuras (because he has thorium brotherhood rep + gold for the recipe), but not have the mats to make it (because it's crazy expensive to make).
---
Screenshot?
---
It's an MMORPG, not a moba.
---
If you don't want to spend 100g every week respecing - don't.
---
&gt;of the time we encouraged people to gear an off spec as this made the members more versatile. You should have told them to share it then refuse to heal if they ever asked you imo your probably better off
---
So in my guild us shamans have to pay for our tier gear. I understand some priest stuff isnt great but they originally were getting it all for free. So when a healing ring drops, all the shamans were bottom of the stack and all the priests had basically spent nothing and still got 4 pieces. So no it should have a cost, 25% sounds a great value.
---
Even then peacemaker from strat ud is better and easier to get.
---
This is the answer. It costs a lot for a bunch of reasons, but it makes the choice matter. "I want to have easy and quick access to dungeons/raids so Ill be a tank. But I also want to be able to do pvp." Ok, sure. But the cost of having that versatility over other classes is you will have to farm up 100g to respec. That seems fair. Meanwhile dps classes can only dps, and will have harder times finding dungeon groups, but Ill never really need to respec. Thats the choice I made. There are frustrating decisions in this game, but making those choices makes the game rewarding, and the classes feel different.
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
wtf does this have to do with anything!!?
---
In chat.
---
On a new fetish of course!
---
&gt;You have no rights to get gear if your guild is remotely serious
---
We're talking about classic? The game won't get hard before AQ40 and even then it's not worth min-maxing
---
Yea because its only kids who enjoy to do PVP on a PVP server? God forbid playing the game.
---
20g per hour very consistently for the past week. 
---
Coldshoulder on Grobbulus /wave
---
The GM's are to busy policing people that are safe spotting on buildings and camping flight paths to worry about this nonsense.
---
Mastering a class, that has almost always the opener and also most of the time controls the fights does not takes 'years' of practice. Calling others biased btw smh.
---
There's a ton more to play rogue, and shaman is quite literally killing people who is vulnerable and sometimes healing how can you call rogue simple but not shaman?
---
If it's different patch mechanics it may as well be a diff game.  Apples and oranges
---
Yeah, legit. I still find it funny though
---
I do, went to tank from caster dps and i finally feel like Im doing something in dungeons instead of farming tougher mobs. Being in middle of priority chain is also a big plus
---
Its like 3-5 minutes most, you open portal to the city pick that amulet and summon him back.
---
Julie on Grobbulus
---
Nice to use a serious disease and mental issue as a joke, you alliance players are just truly aweasome arent you?
---
NO SHIT
---
He won't reply after this for sure ;)
---
Lol. You have alot of issues man. Hopefully you can learn to be more humble. You talk about needing entire rewrites. You have no idea how assembly code/Binaries work. And you bring up python. One of the most abstracted languages. 
---
I bring up comp sci, since you seem to lack even a basic grasp of how internals work. I'm sorry it's beyond you to understand assembly. I guess those lua functions work with magic. Man, if we go by your logic, even all of Wow must be in Lua on your computer. Not that stupid compiled stuff!
---
I really like this idea. However, before they do this, they should try and restore the max. player count of the servers back to what it was in vanilla.
---
Transfers are open :) Who the fuck buys that overpriced food loool
---
Probably because he was tanking at the time.
---
And I slaughtered them like animals!
---
You're driving me bananas!
---
You're probably right, that polearm har like 4 less AP then the blade.
---
BUT MUH HÖNÖR
---
Oh no you got killed again 4 hours later, how is that possible on a PVP server???
---
They are saying if you scam someone, don't get caught.
---
Our MT finished his FR gear last week, so he should be fine. I'm not sure about our OT. But the tanks dying wasn't our problem. I found a thread on here about the Ragnaros fight that was very helpful and will help a lot on our next try. :)
---
When they have extra rage using a twohanded weapon just after landing a hit with the weapon.
---
Yes I suppose this is how it works.
---
So maybe blizz does not like either part of this. The fact that the dueling effectively circumvents the splitting of honor with all people that attack the target and that it circumvents the point of MC'd people being friendly and unable to attack your faction.
---
I think it makes sense.
---
Alliance is boring, im gonna be a HUMAN PERSON. Also your dueling area is trash, orgrimmar yard all the way :D
---
But 10m is melee radius anyway
---
Found the furry 😉
---
&gt; The problem is that it's a piece of gear that literally no one else out of that 40 man raid could possibly use, the DE is essentially worthless, you can't claim "guild bank mat" for something like that since nexus crystals don't exist yet
---
This is completely wrong, you can easily give the item to your enchanter and he can save it until nexus are in the game and disenchant it at that point.
---
At the point where you open an option to get something for free people will exploit the system and figure out a way where you get items for free because you communicate.
---
If you sugar coat people who get the item last, its unfair for people who first got it and had to pay for it.
---
At this point people will start trying to get items last and this will hurt your overall raid performance if people purposely avoid getting items they could use because they way to save their points and make a rotation with their fellow class partners so every raid only a single person needs on it and because there is only a single need they get it for free.
---
You gotta have rules and be consistent or else people will undermine the entire system and you can go back to just rolling items off and save the effort to keep the point system clean for everyone.
---
Insomnia strikes again!
---
Still waiting, any version will do.
---
Yeah I'd think this'd be an easy fix on Blizz's end. If you attack/spellcast against a player outside of the duel, just end the duel.  I'd understand if you could MC mobs or NPCs during a duel because that seems like the natural mechanic, but this just looks like a glaring bug that maybe they don't have time or are too lazy to fix.  I wonder if they actually issue bug tickets based on game exploits like these or just  go ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ and hassle the players that find em.
---
6 piece SC exists in that neat theorycraft space where it's pre-BiS on paper, but practically useless. Outperforms the other standard prebis options, but once you pick up a single piece of raidloot it turns into garbage. 
---
Guessing you're not grouping with many fully raidgeared players, because they outperform the SC 6pc by far.
---
I want to know this also.
---
Yes, free for all works. Have 3 stacks of corruptors from multiboxing on my warrior.
---
That's not a legal document, and no you didn't agree to it.
---
The governance for contracts is the contract law of your state, and no state allows unilateral cessation of service or termination of the contract.
---
You can believe what you want, but that's the law, in every jurisdiction in the USA.
---
ToS/ToU for using a product you already bought are unenforceable through out the EU.
---
You can believe whatever you want, but is the reality of life in 2019.
---
Stop exagerating you whiners. I get plenty and plenty of 1v1's. HOly shit you guys are so fuckin pathetic, just transfer to a PVE server and stop crying.
---
Ya, come to Heartseeker. I just transferred myself. Horde are the underdog. Its fun!! But get ready for alliance everywhere (even in the capital cities)
---
Found the shadow priest
---
&gt;And even with enchant the difference is so minor: 5agi vs 10 ap. Not worth the drama.
---
Well, not until phase 5 when the two handed enchants actually come out. 
---
That's not to say I would roll against a warrior, of course. But in Phase 3, Rend Set will be pretty good for Hunters.
---
Maybe just fucking release battlegrounds. 
---
No ones happy with this bullshit.
---
Paragraphs.
---
We have better things to do that camping zones for 500 honor / hour
---
For sure dont post your personal PVP video's here, otherwise everyone else will to.
---
That is awesome. I wanna see his first horde encounter.
---
This one right here OP.
---
But OP probs doesnt have the gear right now to even think about having to much rage.
---
Aka just make every fp like the goblin ones
---
The thing is, in vanilla, the GMs would've dealt with this for you.
---
Gamers like collecting stuff. How many novelty things do you have in your bank right now, that you will never use, but is just cool to have?
---
Yeah that is a bug. And they cant punish people for killing someone when they didnt cause the bug.
---
The MC thing is done whilst dueling someone on your faction so that your friend is the only one able to kill the target, and both of you get full Honor for some reason.
---
Aka Bug exploit
---
\*tips fedora\*
---
If only there were servers they could play on where none if this is an issue
---
Rank 6 gets you into the hall, but rank 7 is the first 2 pieces of the blue set. Rank 6 you can buy cheap superior potions
---
it didn't.
---
They generally keep it to RP realms where people know what they signed up for.
---
So hold on, you make an entire thread complaining just because you got killed 5 times on a PVP server? Specially LHC where the walk back to corpse is literally 7 seconds. 
---
This is the level of whine we have, people get killed 5 times and make a whine thread on a subreddit, jesus fuckin christ these new kids are weak minded.
---
You can't farm the scales yet, you need a special item to be able to loot them
---
Loot competition sounds harsh. Not wanting the, mostly shitty, DPS warrior to win stuff while you did all the work sounds less harsh :)
---
do rhok is atm very hard. since all demon zone are heavy pvp zones right now
---
https://youtu.be/WQiBexvbLeY A shaman on kirtonos with multiple 1v3 and some 1v5s. Not saying you're point is wrong, just pointing out you can still do well vs multiple. Granted this guy has been playing and very high ranked pvp for 15 years.
---
The flying mount is IMO the single biggest mistake the wow devs made with the game.
---
Thing is, probably not many people have the Lionheart Recipe, so the guy buying the helmet from the ah, doesnt have to come to OP's guildie to get his helmet crafted, which in return is a loss for OP's guildie, because he misses out on this crafting fee.
---
The Mage in question (who had the item taken from him) was not a tailor.
---
Its not "Clever use of game mechanics tho. By doing the duel/MC thing, you also makes it so only you two can get the honor, everyone else cant. You guarantee full honor for yourself aswell as removing the honorless debuff AND you can kill them while they are cc'd.
---
Meme spec feeling bad for not ninjalooting a main heale item, perfect.
---
They sure do that.
---
I think it's overall a flaw in zone design. I don't have specfic timings but traveling through Addon-Zones by ground mount takes roughly as long as traveling through any classic zone by foot.
---
great reply. this is poor play to be honest, and if the guild is reputable at all, the guild leader would have a word with players.
---
Wtf Richard?
---
Holypaladin + Retpaladin = Still useless damage Paladin (im a holypaladin myself ...)
---
Serious though:
---
Arcane Boomy to actually have a viable arcane spec in classic
---
My favorite:
---
Firemage and prot or ret Pally for the Fire Paladin! Burn the unworthy ones with glorious fire!
---
That depends, if OP's guildie knows hes gonna sell it and crafts it for free, there is no problem.
---
But if the guildie thinks he is crafting it for free for OP to wear, and OP sells it, its a different story :D
---
You're competing against the entirety of the Horde on your server. It is going to constantly change. If you look at the math it pretty much requires non stop play of farming Honor to get close to rank 10+ and with how heavily the population is favored for the Horde in Classic just imagine how much worse it is.
---
Get an auction / tool tip addon (auctioneer, auctionator, tsm) that tells you the average gold you get from disenchanting. Then compare it with the vendor price.
---
AH prices can change so no list you would get here will ever be fixed.
---
Everyone feeling even remotely starved for honor will do this all the time. Especially if horde has queues at 15+ minutes, which I believe they will.
---
It's never been bout the raciales, because paladins &gt; shaman by far. It's about retail habit (retail is now 90% horde at max level) and state of mind. Ally players don't care as much about pvp.
---
This. Plus leather is on average more specialized in terms if the direction its statted to than mail. More dps, less allroundyness.
---
As a geared rogue, the only reason I would run Strat Live is Orbs. Therefore I would never group with anyone reserving all the orbs. Neither would anyone else geared. SO by reserving all the orbs, you catch 22 yourself into a situation where you are ONLY going to be undergeared people farming their pre-BIS
---
We might have started on the wrong foot. Hello my name is Richard, from England. I am 18 years old and i have not paid for this discord server, my intentions are to keep it the same way if that's what everyone wants, if you have any suggestions though i am glad to take it and try to make this an even better place for the people playing wow. I am sorry again and hope we can start fresh. Thank you for your understanding.
---
Richard,
---
Mobile is the simple editor so you need 2 times enter for one additional line.
---
Like this.
---
Shamans, hunters and warriors are legit for rolling on this item afaik.
---
You can't pass on items such as the Savage chain, you might never see them drop again.
---
&gt;In classic your spec is your identity, that’s what the game is Build around  
---
Oh, yes? This is why rogues and warriors respec as soon as they get new item from raids?) from dagger to swords, from Fury to Arms)
---
100% agreed!!! Guild tag reputation means a lot. No way would I or anyone in our guild do this. If they did, the GM would be rightfully angry.
---
It sure is. Mechagon however is pretty fun. I like traveling by ground here. Mostly because of all the clear and straight paths. That being said: Flying makes it much easier to farm all the rarespawns.
---
Crusader. 39 twinks are tough because they take a lot more time investment than a level 19 so it's hard to find guides for them.
---
Yes but you can check if it's available at rank 6. Hence op asking about it
---
https://youtu.be/WQiBexvbLeY
---
is there a site with up-to-date server population? all the info i can find is a bit older. only lv 39 on current server so woudnt mind switching to a 50/50 horde/ally server. currently on Ashbringer(EU)
---
But what are you going to do with it once you've reserved? eBay. Some kind of real world trade? All against the ToS.
---
Blizzard shouldnt do anything about it. You didnt get hacked you got scammed.
---
How are the most uninformed people always the most vocal ones?..  
---
Rank 4 was the maximum for week one that only 2% of all players were able to get.  
---
Rank 6 is the maximum for this week and only 0.8% of those 2% of last week are able to get it.
---
just wait
---
Ya, no. All week alliance have been controlling it and using the duel+mc trick to kill horde when they land
---
yes this - because one is red to the other.
---
I'm sure they'll be fixing this sometime soon but until then warnings seem good.
---
There's nothing to really care about at exalted though is there?
---
Dreadmist EU... pretty common to have people camping menethil. I get ganked more thatn 50% of the time running to the boat since the start of phase 2.
---
Run up the mountains on the left side and you can get over and under the instance also
---
Fiery starts being useless around level 50 or something. While obviously its not devastating at 40 like it is at 10, it helps out so much. Feeding your alt gear makes leveling one a much better experience and imo its worth putting fiery on both weapons every time, like just get weapons youll upgrade every 7 levels or so. Farm a few elemental fires, buy up the shards and just get em enchanted.  
---
I did it for my warrior. I was basically playing a twink warrior all the way up to 55 and it was fun all the way through because of it.
---
When you overpull and want AoE threat quickly.
---
Or when soloing and you just want to YOLO to the quest boss without clearing the area around him.
---
In bg's/large scale pvp, whenever it's on CD and when locks start dotting you.  You'll be switching trinkets a lot anyway.  
---
In duels, see it as a 3 seconds shadow school silence, and if he still casts then he'll get his own dots.  Or use defensively, if you have full dots and nothing to interrupt a lock casting fear, using it means you buy a few seconds to cleanse dots/apply pressure since he can't cast fears.  If you're quick, you can technically reactive to his nightfall-procced shadow bolts or death coil (same animation, both instant casts)
---
No idea, I never actually looked at what's available at exalted, I'm following the TBC+ method of rep by assuming all the good stuff's at exalted :p
---
Private servers capped it at 5g.
---
Personally i dont sway to either side. Both have good and bad effects on the game.
---
Are people still hating on private servers?
---
pvp brings out the worst in people (like war).
---
Carebear
---
either the expression of barely being able to contain excitement or getting assfucked
---
Honest question: do you know of any court cases of this?
---
Back to insults!
---
The blue PvP set is actually pretty decent for warrior PvP.
---
Herbalism.
---
Download GatherMate2 and just go to an easy-to-navigate zone (like burning steppes) and just follow the markers in the add-on.
---
You should easily spot mines or herbs. Track whichever one is harder for you to spot (mines are usually super obvious).
---
Hey stupid, I just got here. I'm a different person entirely than you were arguing with before. Quit playing the victim and actually read. I was agreeing with them that you're an idiot though.
---
Of course it is a gnome
---
It's not a popular narrative here.
---
Clearly the honor system is clearly responsible, it incentice people to farm honor. 
---
So the min max guys are camping fly path all day everyday except rogue that hunt in enemy capitals. 
---
People are defending this like it was the perfect system, when it's just a grind fest that will probably make the population balence even worse. 
---
The only responses you will get here are obnoxious comment from people that are short sighted and only think about their fun.
---
I hope the minority faction haven't vanish before the 10th December.
---
Pvp
---
But my mum has been having a great time on her pve server.
---
Naxx
---
You are already on a very nicely balanced server. For more realm info tho you can check out  [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/)   
---
it gets it's info from players using the census addon and uploading
---
no population info is 100% accurate tho take these as rough approximations :D cheers
---
Wow, that’s awful :( if I see anyone 47 or lower the only thing I hit em with is a /wave
---
Sure! Anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, white supremacists, there's lots of groups with problematic stances that deserve ridicule and more. MLP is just like... being really into a kid's cartoon though. If that's enough to get your hate your emotions come cheap.
---
Sending unsolicited messages and then getting your feelings hurt when people don't drop everything to reply to you is just about the most entitled thing I've read today
---
What's a motto?
---
Dobrze
---
Does flask of purification have any real use in regards to PvE, raids, or farming?
---
Rogue. Mainly because the class has so many tools that you need to know how to use them properly. Like rogue is a class that can beat its own hard counter if you know what to use and when.  
---
Shaman, while yes they have a ton of tools in the form of totems, isnt really that complicated. Like I think the biggest play you can make is properly eating an ability with grounding totem, Id argue its not that impressive since it takes a little bit of luck since you need to guess right. People will say that baiting a cs/kick is impressive but it truly isnt, its one of the most basic skills you learn if you play a caster in pvp.  
---
With rogue I suppose its harder to get good though since you have the ability to blow people up real easy, there isnt much skill required to kill someone with ambush after all.
---
Speak for yourself lol. I'm a deep prot tank. Since getting LH/Epic mount and my librams I have been steadily below 100g for like 2 weeks lol.
---
Debating with you is like playing chess with a pigeon. You shit all over the board and then strut around like you won. Present a compelling argument instead of playing dumb and maybe people won't call you dumb.
---
It's great in Stratholme and DM west to reveal those invisible patrols that can quite easily fuck up your run.
---
Or just say, "I don't tank for your guild because X". 
---
Puts the ball in their court, way more direct, and you might actually get a conversation that moves to a place of remediation.
---
Gm are sending out warnings to people who use mind control
---
That might be possible for some servers. I would be surprised if I could get more than 25g though tbh. And Idt I could even start with that offer
---
Also, taurens didn't fit through the window.
---
Yeh it's not easy being Tauren mate. I know you can barely read this.
---
Nope. If everyone in your group is 48-50+ and you go through pulls at a decent rate, it's almost stupid how fast you go through 50-53
---
While I agree it's a game breaking bug....I can't imagine there's a lot of folks, or even entire guilds, willing to sink that kind of gold even into 1 person's respecc costs to raise healing to insane levels. Even if they run raids back to back, that's literally too much investment for a single day, or even two days if they're willing to straddle the lockout period.
---
Just level 2 characters
---
I prefer scorched Earth policy
---
Yeah, the fun of classic raids was always jumping into a massive murder ball to go and piss about all evening, with half the raid drunk, a third of the raid stoned and whoever's left desperately trying to carry them. It was about the people, not the challenge.
---
Dont take me wrong, engi is definitely the most fun profession out there, but hardly a money maker (atleast i dont view it as such), i view it more like a complement to melt faces in pvp :D
---
Good man
---
I dont hate people that like mlp, but i also dont hate people that hate people that like mlp
---
&gt; "Honorless target must expire naturally" - says who?
---
Cool story. Now address the rest of my points. You're really bad at this.
---
I dunno. What's a motto with you?
---
I really hope these casual-friendly ideas doesent happen. Would ruin the game.
---
If you want to be able to enjoy two specs it should come at a cost. Or just level up another warrior.
---
While I know what you’re trying to say, in this case we’re being very literal in describing the game version we’re discussing. Even in game files they are identified as classic and retail. But I think you know this already and missed at making some point.
---
It didn't prevent inflation as people just level an alt eventually.
---
But the mobs are walking to the random person that pulled and not the tank.
---
I mean, mograine is 45/55 or so and high pop (sometimes small queues in peak time like 300-1k)
---
Does Light of Elune potion protect also from non damaging crowd control? So basically a level 30 can drink it and freely run through the greatest battlefield no matter what, right?
---
Blizzard had their own concerns about classic popularity, looks like it came true and most people are more suited for retail version.
---
This, a shaman needed on cloth bracers. Healer got mad and took tank with him. Wasting everybodies time over a green lol. Some people man.
---
Yes, you are right.
---
No, you won that one.
---
My mind control case was fun. No one ought to get suspension for that.
---
We appreciate you taking the time to flag this as an underrated comment.
---
However, this appears to be in error and the comment is already rated according to its quality.

I can somehow not understand this, i had scams like your two times now and i always received my items back and the scammer being banned. why does the support act in a completely different way here?
---
Got ya
---
It actually is. Skill to skin is mob lvl * 5, meaning a lvl 63 boss (e.g. Onyxia) needs 315 to skin.
---
Your skinning cap is also capped by your level * 5, so if you're lvl 50 you cannot skin a lvl 60 mob.
---
Irony is strong here.
---
Thanks!!
---
Everyone of these threads starts with “I played in vanilla etc etc” if you did you wouldn’t be so naive in thinking classic would the same as vanilla
---
Run DM with 60 guilde from level 15 onward. It will give you pretty good xp.
---
Inner fire, self bubble and shadow form makes shadow priests tankier than warriors I swear to god
---
as an ele shaman that loves killing melee i dont agree. Engineering would make fights quicker sure but i win regardless unless the war pops wreck then i would think damn wish i had tidal charm. Most of the time If im fighting a melee i keep up frost brand and lightning shield bait the kick and heal then if its a ms war then I may need to health pot too but usually i just melee + shock + LS them to death

FFXIV refugee spotted.
---
You realise there's more to this then just removing the buff right? 
---
Or are you also mentally challenged?
---
Why is the fact it’s a pug matter?
---
you can enter naxx for free and get access to a lot of reputational items and recipees in phase 5 and onwards, like frost reists gear
---
God damn! You are so obsessed with honour and what you think you're missing out on that you can't see past the clear exploit of a mechanic intended to prevent honour gain. It's not about you... It's about lowering the fuckery around camping a flight master as a meta for world pvp honour farming.
---
I mean, this was quite obviously meant satirically right? It's a meme.
---
You could have missed out on a guild that likes memes and to joke around. If that's what your looking for, that is.
---
Mb then, thought it was a guild run since you drop their name
---
Definitely not accurate. I know several horde guilds who raid and do not use it.
---
Maybe so but leveling beyond 50 might still be a pain
---
TIL two handed fury exists. Thank you!
---
Only real benefit would be that your Naxx atunement is free at exalted.

You had to have played during the Halloween event to get the tauren mask, then you would be set :)
---
Thank you!
---
Seems odd to threaten someone over this.
---
I havnt had a single 1v1 since phase 2 started. Every single questingzone from 48-60 is full of 5-40 man ganksquads that just lap the zone and kill everything worth honor. 
---
Thats not fun, thats doesnt make the world "dangerous".. It makes it unplayable.
---
Was it you who stabbed the room mate? 🤔
---
Or... they just dont care and kill you because its fun? The only thing they lose is a little mana
---
It was broken on the 1st week for me, displaying wrong honor for everyone, but now it's seems pretty good.
---
Your standing must chance according on the number of people scanned, if your database is new or not updated, you must need some time to gather enough information for people on your server
---
It's BIS for warrior tank also, on his behalf I thank you :)
---
Not last night, I missed 2 Qs so had to go back, my guildie &amp; I couldn't even get there - Alliance death squads camping BVP FP again.
---
Lol yeah wpvp should be great for him. Your already starting off strategically and intelligently by not rolling alliance. You should be fine from here on. You are also at a great time for dungeon leveling if that’s what you want because there are a lot of people trying to do dungeons on pvp servers on both factions because they didn’t realize the gravity of their decision when choosing a pvp server.
---
I never said I can't afford it, I said they're far from cheap.
---
priests make 40-50g per hour doing lashers
---
Yeah by wasted I mean diminishing returns on the stat. I should've worded it differently
---
Who the hell throws a funeral for their cat?
---
Sweet. You can’t get in until 15 can you?
---
If only you have the commission trinket equiped, you can loot all the stones, similar to how quest items can be looted from other players mobs.
---
Yea i know, but it much worse than r14. i have a feeling that tons of ppl will run with r14 gear, and i will get ass beaten due to gear.... even when i will face against a "not so pro" player.
---
There is always the other side of the story. But Alliance are statistically in the minority, so you won't be getting much sympathy here.
---
Basically in each expansion now flying is disabled in new zones. In a couple of patches there's a pathfinder achievement that involves completing story quests, earning rep and exploring, rewarding you with the ability to fly. They introduced this for the first time in wod
---
Right now its terrible, on my Server Horde rogues are just camping pretty much every flightpoint. Yesterday I just wanted to make some mooncloth and got ganked 4 times until I was in SW (including once at the SW Flightmaster).
---
Quite a few alliance guilds came from the 81% horde dominated bigglesworth
---
Quite minor compared to other bugs we’re waiting a fix:
---
[list of Druid bugs](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-big-druid-bug-list/299227)
---
&gt; This must be a server by server thing
---
Probably, yes. It takes some time to get an understanding of how the market reacts to certain things, however Alchemy is kinda straightforward and predictable. Certain pots sell extremely fast on raid days, some even for twice as much as what they're worth.
---
Pots like Elixir of Shadow Power, Elixir of the Mongoose and the smaller Fire Prot potion are the fastest movers for me.
---
Then there are the more volatile ones like the Invisibility Potion or the Limited Invulnerability Potion for example. Potential profit here might be even bigger at times, but it's a bit of a risk and requires more attention. It's situational, really, but I tend to buy the odd cheap stacks of raw mats throughout the week and use them to either craft or resell directly, depending on what's more profitable.
---
Oh, yeah, and a prime example of how not to do it would be the Free Action Potion on my server. People wanted to make easy money, so they did what every other goldmaking guide told them they should do, and stockpiled thousands upon thousands of these for P2 and P3. Now everyone is panic-dumping them on the AH for like &lt;50% of the price because they're constantly undercutting eachother. Can't complain though, I'll buy and hold them for the moment.
---
&gt; nothing on my server really makes a profit, other than flasks which make 20g profit each.
---
That's interesting, because on my server it's near impossible to make a profit on flasks.
---
It's really fascinating how much you can learn about economic mechanisms just by using and watching the AH. 
---
You'll have default suppliers, buyers and even big competitors becoming rivals trying to force you out of their markets. It's basically like playing a game within a game. Also, huge plus if you enjoy statistics.
---
My auction house character has 2 days /played, maybe I should rethink some priorities, lmao.
---
Blizzard is always watching.
---
Getting scammed is awful. But, should blizzard punish the scammer? 
---
What if his goal is to level a toon whose main characteristic is to be a scammer? We could also argue if this only counts on rp servers and so on...
---
In my opinion, after some months of classic, both scammers and ninjas get the hate and punishment they deserve at last.
---
Server discord
---
I just don’t want to have to buy a shit ton of enchants but I don’t mind 100-200 for a major ease of leveling if it helps that much. By reading the other post it looks like every 10 levels I’m going to be enchanting at least 1 weapon which isn’t bad.
---
Human fury warrior + combat swords rogue for the ultimate god-tier pve dps!
---
If we're going to be pedantic, then why spend a sprint or two trying to fix something instead of throwing more resources at it?  
---
Realistically it's because they don't want to change much from vanilla, at the time being.
---
I was in a guild with a zero sum system at some point in vanilla. It was a guild on a newly launched server, with everybody being people who'd raided previously. Everybody knew what they wanted, and what wasn't priority.
---
The guild ran with a zero sum DKP system, where every item had a fixed cost. E.g. OEB could cost 1000 DKP. When somebody got it, that person went -1000 in DKP, and those 1000 points were distributed to everybody else.
---
When an item dropped, the person with the highest DKP would get it.
---
We had 5\~6 rogue armor pieces drop during our very first MC run. They all got sharded because all 7 (!) attending rogues wanted to hoard points for weapons.
---
I’m not saying hunters shouldn’t get them or roll against other classes for them, I’m merely stating the reason warriors in particular would be annoyed is that they last for much much longer. And even then good luck getting the ones in BWL as those are plate and have 1% dodge (tanks like them) instead of 2% hit and even then you can’t use them for DW fury unless you can make the hit up elsewhere.
---
Also Dal Rends are only really for alliance warriors unless you have edgemasters which are pretty unaffordable for warriors (700g on my server). I saw a pair drop in ST and lost them to a hunter too haha.
---
Some people are not understanding what a game is.   
---
Last Raid we had a warrior ragequit because a few other warriors had the audacity to roll for Bonereaver's Edge too and he lost the roll. He completly left the raids Discord and we think he even deleted his character (has not been seen again and can't put it on friend list).
---
I am pretty sure reason is simply fact that they have much less customer support than what they used to have. It's easier for them just to tell "watch out who you are trusting" than actually doing anything. I bet policy with this is changed purely so they don't need to hire more customer service. If they would actually look into these things, it would consume a lot of their time because a lot of these things are not always black and white.
---
flightmasters can't be killed
---
People tip that much every so often.
---
Got a 5 g tip once for 6 stacks of 55 water.
---
Really!? I wasn't aware of this one!
---
I only speak for my self but as someone who want to get rank 8 ASAP you don't have much of a choice because your are against your own faction.
---
It feel terrible to kill some green but the honor incentive is too strong. I won't camp because it's not worth to demoralize people and get less honor in the process. 
---
I feel that the system is the major issue here, maybe honorless should be updated, maybe the system need to change, or maybe they need to release WSG tomorrow.
---
But hating on the player won't change the fact that they want their loot ASAP and don't give a crap about people feeling, its still the internet after all :(.
---
Flask of Petrification or Purification Potion?
---
Both are kinda useless in general.
---
You must be in one of those semi hc guilds but rly want to be in APES and get salty because not everyone is dedicating their entire life to wow.
---
We have a few of those in our guild as well....
---
The point YOU seem to be missing is that some people have lives and responsibilities and other priorities other then wow, and that is completely fine and doesn't affect you or your guild in any meaningful way.
---
If you have to persuade your GM to give you a weapon you spent the most DKP for, you're in a retarded guild. Gear is not awarded to the person who will use it the most, but to the person who saved DKP for it.
---
Zandalar tribe eu high pop no ques
---
Yes, it was like this in original vanilla WoW too, it's just how the models work, does the same with Gnome beards as well, and even Orc ones.
---
I have seen pictures on 4chan of people masturbating to mlp statues. That's not being into a kids cartoon, that's is a psychological problem
---
That was already a thing in 2004. If you want to get something expensive crafted, make sure you find someone form a reputable guild to craft it for you. 
---
On our Server we have a "Trusted Crafters"-List.
---
Yeah but some still do.. 
---
So strategically as a hunter you’d say “passing on dal Rends but need truestrike” and most people would find that perfectly acceptable.
---
I was figuring there would be a higher chance to drop if more people in the instance had the trinket equipped, but I guess your right I don’t think it matters if they equip or not he could still loot the stones from their mobs. Just make sure to tell everyone to take their trinkets off and make sure they loot their mobs so you can loot the stones after. 
---
Either way there is really no way to see the drop rate with them using the trinket and not looting compared to just you wearing the trinket. I think the big thing is I people not looting the mobs for you to have access to the stone as it appears to be displayed as a quest item.
---
You may be the one that only whispers 1 person at a time, but there are plenty of people that just whisper every available player with a preset message they just copy and paste. There is nothing social about this and it's why I don't feel bad at all about not responding.
---
Combat log radius.
---
Yup, got slaughtered by Allie desthballs constantly while trying to farm satyr in Felwood for the past week. 
---
That’s fine, contrary to many people I knew what I got myself into when I rolled on a pvp server.
---
People have a hard time realizing that it’s not the pvp servers that are wrong but it’s their mistake to think pvp servers are right for them even though they are obv. not judging by the amount of whine on here.
---
That's what I'm hoping for I like world pvp breaks up questing a bit. Any advice you can give me? Is mining and herb the best way to go?
---
I personally like the dwarf female 2h attack the best.  Their 1h attack is alright. Look decent in plate. 
---
Human male 2h attack is ok too. The human male look better in plate though. Just cant stand the noises they make when getting hit or when they crit. 
---
Gnomes are ok as well. Acquired taste though with gnomes.
---
Last Aid is more like it.
---
Is this a new change? I was almost sure before the pvp patch people were killing them, might be wrong tho!
---
The warrior in R14 gear will win by a longshot.
---
yep, our feral druid tanks whole MC and Onyx
---
Stop posting false information
---
Yeah man it's not like she needs stuff every five minutes it's more like hey its dinner time and I'm hungry. So I go get us food or cook
---
Only having one skeleton per player.
---
Inflation hurts the casual players far more than the hardcore players.
---
There’s a human paladin on my server that bots.
---
I tag it, which causes it to attack me, but thankfully due to ms on boots I can consistently kite it into the nearest town with regularity. It’s like a piñata of honor for all the idiots LFG PVP which stops it from farming my spot for a bit.
---
Forgot about that one! Actually a pretty significant change in terms of how we can use addons
---
Threat plates are great, just some info to people who prefer the default look : if you use classic threat meter it allows you to colour the default name plates like threat plates.
---
I call BS. If you didn’t have a single 1v1 you clearly avoid them which is a clear sign your on the wrong server type if you don’t actually want to pvp.
---
Nah... You are fine.
---
The good thing about Classic content is that it doesnt really get outdated. 
---
Sure some dungeons becomes less popular, but still reputation, quests, buffs and so on keep groups going.
---
Just to be safe you might want to stay in low level areas untill december 10, if you are in pvp server.
---
IT'S NOT JUST A GAME!!! It's the World .... of Warcraft!
---
What population does skull flame have
---
Nah but week 2 and 3 of wow release was a bit sketchy. Rag was hard when people were semi bis. Few wipes on rag but we got him down. These days we blast him now we got a proper core.
---
He's lying lol
---
Such and similar scenes are the real vanilla experience. It is something you remember, camping flight paths or the rank 13/14 gear (if you ever get it) is something you also remember but just as a single scene (not worth it IMO).
---
That's like a warrior asking if he should enchant his BRE
---
Flask of Petrification was used for some extreme speed runs on pservers in like BWL. Could see similar use in Classic. Usually rogue pushes trash, pops it and gives time for raid to pass. But that's super niche use.
---
Are you horde? If so, you can translate some text into “makgora”. 
---
Honor guaranteed, no hard feelings after the duel (post Rez gank much less likely) and very thematic and cool. Made a lot of friends this way
---
It was pretty early in the server. Every guild was running MC with pugs at the time because they couldn't field a full 40 man guild raid.
---
*local orc* not if you play certain eu servers
---
In the current content phase +5 all res shoulder enchant at exalted reputation.
---
Later, when Naxxramas comes out there're [epic quest rewards](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=9228/epic-armaments-of-battle-exalted-amongst-the-dawn).
---
Yeah totally depends when you play pre bis was important in October but not as much now because people have a decent amount of mc gear.
---
Ah, I should have figured given wintersprings perpetual lack of an alliance flight master :p. I was on an alt today though so figured it could have been quite new
---
And then you regret it when you want to play a bit in a couple of months
---
It's like 55-60% horde if that's what you mean
---
1) Respec cost (dual spec - I wouldn't mind)
---
2) PvP rewards/scaling. No honor for targets 3 or more levels below player. Significantly decreased honor when ganking in larger numbers. Ie. 1v1 would  yield full honor. 2v1 would yield 1/8 of the honor. Ganking 1v3 would yield 1/27 of honor and so on. 2v2 would yield normal honor, 2v3 would yield 1/8 and so on. Dishonorable kills for killing grey targets.
---
3) The absolute shitshow that world bosses lagfests are.
---
4) Adjusting spawns based on server/area population. From Black Lotuses, to world bosses, to Rare Mobs and Quest mobs etc. Servers were never designed for such numbers.
---
5) Tweaking relative class/spec balance without changing identity. That means just tweaking numbers, but not how things work.
---
6) Finishing unfinished zones.
---
Show me a video of a rogue in 1.12 doing that, I will wait.
---
It would barely do anything to the economy the good farming classes dont need to respec.   All it does is make life a bit easier for tanks and healers. 
---
Free respecs when they came in didn't kill the economy
---
I don't care either. I love wpvp with all of it's aspects.
---
inb4: I'm alliance on a 70% Horde dominated server
---
One guy is circlejerking the whole "Classic = best thing on earth" that's become a meme at this point.
---
And the other is probably just venting.
---
Everything doesn't habe to be classic vs retail or "hardcore" vs "casual". But it seems to inevitably devolve into it, so ofc we get these hyperbole threads.
---
as if any part of classic requires a brain anyway
---
*sad tauren noises*
---
No like high medium full ques etc
---
That's also not quite correct. The Scarlet Crusade are remnants of the Order of the Silver Hand, which was an order of Paladins in service to the Kingdom of Lordaeron. Most Forsaken are undead former citizens of that kingdom, and the Undercity is beneath that kingdom's former capital city.
---
Won't work for all instances, and not all people.
---
Some people would rather look for a tank for 2 hours then pay a good geared one and be done with it.
---
I specifically mention UBRS and Scholo, as they both have gear people farm for, and the tanks usually get their gear very fast and will "finish" these dungeons after 1 or 2 runs.
---
Thing is that a lot of people have realized that for dungeons specifically, tanks get geared pretty much before they even hit 60. They find groups instantly and to exactly the place they need gear from, finding a group as a tank simply isn't an issue.
---
Once you realize this, you also realize that the only time you will ever find a tank is by lucking out and searching for the exact same thing some random newly leveled tank needs.
---
LF tank for Strat  UD paying 25g, you will find a tank pretty much instantly and it's like 5-6 gold per person. Something you can grind in a fraction of the time it takes to find a tank who needs the exact same dungeon you do.
---
TLDR; people who aren't willing to pay a geared tank simply haven't realized how quickly tanks get full prebis and no longer need dungeons. There are plenty of them, but there are also plenty of players who know better.
---
MC only removes the debuff because he attacks another player(forced to through duel).
---
If you MC someone without the duel, the honorless stays.
---

---
Are they supporting classic?
---
I like how in classic having 4 unique mounts is more meaningful than having 200 in retail.
---
Warlock already in full T1, just like in 2005!
---
Rofl I always liked the gnome. Small little guy with a super huge weapon dragging behind him. And their dances are outlandish. But really depends what you want to do. 
---
I would imagine gnomes than dwarfs are the best for pvp due to escape artisan and stoneform. But for raw damage I’m not sure. I do like the idea of night elf. Rofl just shadowmeld by a heavily traveled road and then bam out of nowhere charge hamstring and rape the unsuspecting horde just to go hide behind another tree and repeat lol. 
---
Bottom line though is it’s up to what you are happy looking at for an extremely extended period of time. If you change your mind and decide to go off best for minmaxing I’d read into it more. I know for rogues humans are the better choice for pve whereas gnomes are better for pvp. Next In line for pvp would be dwarf. Not quite sure for a warrior but check and see which class might have a better +weapon skill. 
---
Happy hunting!
---
Spell batching
---
Regarding nexus crystals, it won't work like that. I believe it's confirmed that gear that drops BEFORE nexus crystals comes out CANNOT be DE'd into nexus crystals AFTER they are released into the game.
---
Where do I find a group/player to level with?
---
Where is your name
---
Does not surprise me they are PVP focued, but can't even clear this AFK content.
---
I think it's a high pop realm I've only made a character on it I haven't played it yet as I dont have time till this evening so I'm not 100% sure tbh
---
Same for me as horde. Getting slaughtered by ally deathballs non stop
---
I dualwield tank onyxia so no shieldblock used at all during that fight. Same with many other bosses.
---
Use commas
---
They're rogues, go figure.
---
How exactly is it Blizzards that fault you got scammed?
---
Human warriors are chad in every gear, especially in the scarlet crusader things.
---
If all the players colluded to pretend the items are their OS and therefore not subject to spending points on it would be 
---
A: easily disproven because it’s their MS
---
B: a major sign the entire guild wants to roll MS/OS in the first place
---
C: a loot conspiracy that would crumble into drama immediately
---
D: all of the above
---
You can go the middle route. 17/3/31 impale prot. Well suited for threat but also defensive purposes. Infact, this is the spec I'd recommend for most content if you wish to be prot spec.
---
0/31/20 is amazing aswell if/when you get the gear/worldbuffs/consumables for it.
---
what r best goldmaking strategies atm ?
---
and what r best classes for it?
---
Pretty sure this is popular opinion.
---
Classic is good because its official release.
---
Honorless target is defeated with MC, not dueling. You can use MC to hit anything else for the same effect. Dueling just makes it more convenient (and prevents others from sharing honor).
---
There is just one answer to this: Dwarves.
---
Humans are boring and NE/Gnomes look way outta propotion with gear.
---
Totem use and purges are the big things that set good shamans apart from bad ones. It takes a lot of PvP knowledge to know when to use grounding/tremor/slow and what/when to purge. Rogues have some tricks that only good players know how to do as well, but most of it is very formulaic and once you know how to do it you can execute it pretty consistently.
---
I'd say shamans have a slight edge when it comes to how difficult they are to play at a high level. Neither shaman nor rogue comes close to the big brain warlock PvP though, the class that the real 200iq PvP Chads play.
---
some stuff does
---
warriors do
---
managing stances (because youre the squishiest class in the game already against most things if youre dps, and going berserker stance REALLY makes you the squishiest to literally everything), managing rage, having long ass cooldowns, etc
---
rogues at least require some skill but have overloaded kits
---
mages by contrast are just brain dead easy to play and incredibly powerful on top of that
---
most casters are kind of easy mode. I think blizzard made them to good back in the day to counter the fact everything backpeddled and clicked and shit but modernly theyre way overtuned. Also because spell power didnt exist in the game for a long time so most pvp content doesnt consider the ignore armor for no apparent reason.
---
Unless your mmo is everyone against everyone, the game isn’t “unplayable”
---
He doesn’t really get logic. It’s ok
---
I had a situation last week where I joined a group for UBRS - They were at the beast and people had left after Rend. I really needed Rend, but figured I'd help them out and then see if anyone was interested in another run after.
---
Well, it took me my sweet time to get in, with the other faction holding down BRM, and when i finally got there they had already wiped once on the beast. We killed him the second attempt, and made our way to the boss. Wiped on a pack on the way there because of bad target focus. 
---
The last boss was a clown fiesta, we had no hunter to kite and we just took too much damage tanking them all for the healers to keep up. After 3 attempts a couple had to go, and we agreed to find refills and restart the dungeon.
---
Well, another guy got leadership and we managed to get together a full group in short order. When exiting the instance to reset (Other faction was periodically holding down the balcony) i got disconnected from the server. Immediately logged back in, only to find that I was no longer in a group.
---
Whispered the leader, he replied with "Sorry, you logged out so i found another one. Group is full". So i spent 2 hours traveling there, wiping on the last boss, and then looking for replacements for the group, only to be kicked for being logged out for 20 seconds. Pissed? You bet.
---
&gt;  they could easily claim they don't have the liquidity to support such a trade.
---
Then go to someone else.. that's the point.
---
"Got summon?"
---
Indeed. He's still alive. So he must know a thing or two about putting a bandage on a gaping wound.
---
No you don't.
---
Gz you did something that every pug group was able to do 2 weeks after release in green gear and 10+ people not even lvl 60.
---
What the guy that downvoted you (which I have corrected) fails to understand is that without a threat set, fights like Onyxia (threat loss mechanic) and Vaelestrasz (dps race) are much much more difficult for the whole raid. So whilst having 2% crit on you increases your personal Max dps, you are still threat capped if your tank doesn’t have a threat set and you cannot dps at your potential without pulling threat. The 2% crit in your tank allows all the dps to have an additional 2% too before they’ll pull aggro.
---
It will however make the total amount of players out in the world smaller though.
---
Specifically at FPs to grief.  This isn't that.
---
What does that have to do with anything?
---
Seeing that video of 37 lvl warrior killing 60s really makes me put greys on kill list
---
1 preist 4 mages. Super rare. Try it out guys.
---
Yes you can. But most of the time the only random dude nearby is the flightmaster, and you don't really want to whack it.
---
Loads of new folk and ALTs always being leveled :)  I'm alliance on skull flame, never struggled to get a grp
---
This is a game theorycrafted to death. There won't be any meaningful questions that don't already have optimal answers.
---
Even the future content is known to us. Nothing will surprise us aside from the release date announcements for that content.
---
You're only left with people sharing their own experiences and goals. Wasn't that the whole point of Classic? To experience a great world and share that with a community?
---
&gt;What exactly constitutes "thoughtful content" is obviously subjective and impossible to define,
---
You said everything you hate, but I didn't really see you point out what you'd like to see on this sub as content. Care to at least give us YOUR definition of "thoughtful content"?
---
&gt;drawings of your characters, your struggle to 40 and getting the gold for the mount, your Hand of Ragnaros (we agree there) and whatever it might be etc.
---
These are all great posts that facilitate entertaining discussions. People telling their own stories, sharing their experiences and tips, having fun together as a part of a community.
---
Reaching a target you set for yourself and wanting to share that is a natural thing. You can simply ignore these posts.
---
&gt;I simply do not care about you, your struggles, your wins, your family, your friends or any part of your personal life. It really is that simple.

Not sure about healing outside of the group, but anyone in the group close will get it. Hopefully you team people with something like this addon, or that know how to spot them.

* Get aggro
---
This might work fine if theres 1 or 2 mobs, not if there's 3-4+ mobs.
---
Think about that from the perspective of a traditional warrior tank, it'll take him at at least 4 GCDs and/or weapon speeds to even hit each of them and gain some threat. 
---
And if unlucky, the mobs avoid an attack or two from the tank as well. 
---
So just as the tank hit/sunder/shieldslammed the primary target, you've WW'ed 4 of them - at best the tank can taunt/mocking blow 2 of them back. At worst that misses too, and the tank stands there like a fool not getting hit, not getting any rage to tank, while the primary target is running after a caster and and it goes further downhill.
---
I.e. wait 4-5 seconds with WW if there's 3-4+ mobs..
---
Why don't they just fix it? Patch it.
---
Faction specific free transfer is already live since 1-2 weeks.
---
This - almost equal with a slight majority ally side
---
Genuinely curious, how do faction queues work? Are horde just gonna be locked out after the mass logins during prime time? Or is there something I’m missing here? I feel like alliance and horde log out and in proportionally, so any faction queue ratio is gonna block out people once alliance and horde stop logging more frequently than logging out
---
Mage
---
Blessing of Wisdom, Blessing of Salvation and Illuminated Healing. 
---
Sure horde might compile more melee DPS with WF.  But then those healers gotta drink up.  Paladins just keep going.
---
It's evily depends on the number of player your Add-on have scanned.
---
On my server I got what the Add-on told me with a pool of 4.5k players.
---
15k does seem enough to still gain rank, but again it depends on the server.
---
You will loose at minimum 1000 ranking and max 1800 depending where you are on the third rank.
---
1000 is what you earn with the minimum HK, I would be highly surprise that you loose rank.
---
Consider something like [this build.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExu0gkxZVbhtb)
---
Seal of Command is very important for leveling, as is Pursuit if Justice. Fill out Ret first and then go down the Holy tree. You'll be an amazing healer all the way through, and quest about as fast as a paladin can.
---
Why would you use an ability that increase the time it takes for the raid to kill a boss?????
---
alliance flightmasters are always dead
---
Yet they have no problem with "fixing" goblin guards, making them completely un-vanilla-like just so their GMs don't have to spend time banning roof abusers.
---
You just add up the +hit on your gear. Some addons do this for you. How much hit you need to cap depends on the level difference between you &amp; your target; at level 60, you need 5% against a 60, 6% against a 62, and 9% against a 63.
---
Mad respect for dealing with this dude in such a calm fashion.
---
Warcraft tavern is a good place to go IMHO.
---
Don't fix the unplayable state the game is in, nope let's warn people.
---
cuz I was giving him a good whooping and his bear druid friend decided to start spamming moonfire
---
panick prep likely, but the lack of DR was clearly helpful for him
---
i been leveling lock but i actually have no idea what stats i should be focusing on. please help me because i am a big dummy.
---
Leveled prot paladin to 60, I've found the thing that made groups miserable the most for me was healers who where trying to hard to conserve mana. 
---
Was in an lbrs, I got 5k hp and this paladin is healing me for 350 a pop and I end up dying while he has full mana still. Every time.
---
cheaped, into kidney, trinket, into another kidney
---
prob cast prep cuz he was getting fucked. Then I was in CC for an eternity
---
What server do you play on?
---
Dying 15 times to get to a dungeon would qualify as unplayable.
---
12 weeks is not that much, i know atleast 20 player from my guild who is online 16hr/day... i think this case is same as the Molten core one, everyone though Mc will be realy hard, and yet everyone can farm it, also the "legendaries" i saw more hand of ragna than bre/obsidian... I think the r14 will be the same case, we except that only few ppl will have it,  yet few months later every 2nd player will be in r14 gear.  
---
Ps: sorry for my terrible english.
---
Horde numbers are growing and it is still heavily alliance. I play alliance but horde always put up a good fight
---
Ret / frost
---
I relate strongly to both of these.
---
Theres a point to be made here about decisions. If theres no cost, or negligible cost, to respeccing then your decisions about talents become less important; you can just change it again at will so it doesnt matter. Imposing a cost on respeccing makes you actually have to think about what you're doing, and it opens the possibility for making either good decisions or bad decisions.
---
The retail game did away with this sort of thing over the expansions, making every class and spec viable, removing the possibility of making bad decisions so as to be more casual friendly. This meant it was also no longer possible to make *good* decisions to the same extent, and what happened over time is that people who were *good* at the game stopped playing, because there was no longer a way to properly demonstrate their mastery of a class or spec or role.
---
Bit wordy, i could probably tighten that up a bit. But i hope I've made a valid suggestion at least.
---
you only need some FR for Rags, and even then it is not mandatory. Get a Greater Fire pot, and pop it before the fight, and then you can drop another one during the fight. Should be enough as most guilds are killing rags now before 1st sub.
---
Or just suck it up and find another group.
---
I ment for the wpvp but see the lack of elaboration. Sorry 'bout that.
---
of the Eagle stuff. Int and stam.
---
All I have to say is when my alliance rogue on stalagg hits 60 I probably won’t leave the 10-30 areas for the horde. I don’t even care about dishonorable kills or ranking up honor anymore. These fucking guys almost made me quit 100 times, I’m going to make 100 players quit. Grey is the new dead. Fuck red
---
I for one, adore the PvP chaos as an under-60. I was 51 when it started and am sitting at 57 right now. It brings a level of challenge to the game that I love. I do my best to join in on the shenanigans when I’m outside of a dungeon, but truth be told, I’m not the best PvPer so I lose a lot of the time. I’m probably the best in the world at corpse-running though.
---
fair enough him saying he wanted to roll on it.....but no way should a healer be passing to him. You're there for the same reasons!
---
The only issue i have with this is that gold farming as a PVP spec is often a nightmare. E.g. I'm a Warlock and play Conflag spec for PVP, but I can't solo farm any instances or anything in that spec. I have to rely on farming mats from mobs or mining, which is fine but WAY less gold per hour than solo farming in Mara or DM. This makes it kind of a nightmare to keep up with costs of things i need to keep stocked for PVP, ie. consumes, nades, food, etc. which are very important for PVP. So it's not strictly true that speccing for PVP gives me all the advantages in PVP.
---
I don't think respect costs should be 5g or anything, but maybe around 25g. Or if there was simply a way to get a small amount of passive gold income through PVP to help with basic upkeep costs.

If you attack anything with that MC, honorless still goes away.

The website is down, what happened?

Y so mad
---
Yes, I'm aware, fear does though, maybe something wasn't clear in my sentence?
---
not exactly,  i know only a certain % ppl will get 14. But after they got it, they will stop hardcore farming, and a new wave of ppl will get r14 gear.. or am i wrong?
---
Hilarious
---
Not Night Elf Male. They look shit in everything and their animations for everything are shit.
---
Why they are called “normal”
---
More effort than most guild recruitment.
---
His ass
---
I don't find it fun. I'm not a pvper but I rolled PvP because my coworkers (who've all but quit) played there. 
---
It doesn't bother me though. I rolled a healer so when I'm caught alone in the wild (even when fishing..) I'm low hanging fruit. I don't mind. 
---
I don't usually even try to run most times. I give a /sigh or /golfclap and die most times. It's usually a corpse run to dungeons but that's alright because I'm super patient. 
---
It's part of the game and they want honor so I get it. I've not yet been super corpse camped. There's times like on the way into BRM that the same group will get me multiple times but it's still possible to get where I'm going with a handful of respawns and defensive actions. 
---
It's just a game. I don't take it super serious.
---
What the hell do you mean? The horde has zeppelins that arent nearly as accessible for alliance as the boats are for horde, and horde as more and better flightpoints too!
---
Nowadays you can force a name change by asking people to mass report your current one. So if he made them for selling he will make a profit regardless.
---
Man, I remember my first playthrough very fondly. The world felt so vast, every new zone, quest and encounter was so epic. The music, the weather effects. Back then I just could not grasp how big and coherent the world was.

We hope to have it back to how it was shortly "
---
There was a site that displayed each discord for each WoW server, do you happen to know the url?
---
Wait how does only one if the demons have to be done legitimately? please explain. This is the only one you can cheese.
---
This. Used to be that when you opened a ticket, a GM would get in touch with you withing minutes. And the reason is simple and obvious: Blizzard are cutting costs in CS.
---
I think you didn’t get it mate.
---
Rp server most likely, some of us like to get into the game and play around. It’s funny you know
---
Don't be this jealous guy. If other people have nice things, be happy for them. I mean it's  just pixels in a video game, not some billionaire's yacht, which he bought with daddy's money.
---
yes, but all 20 of them are not going to get R14. Its like top 2-3 players per server, per week. If thats just your guild, then there are plenty others in other guilds all doing the same. So no chance all are getting Rank 14! 
---
And thats 3 months Without a break!! I got to Rank 12 back in vanilla as part of a premade....but had to go away for work, and dropped too far back so my grind was over. 
---
People are massively underestimating how many R14;s there will actually be! It'll be even harder due to large population servers and many players going for it.
---
Personally, and people can be offended by this I understand, but being obsessed over a little girls show is a big pedophile red flag to me.
---
I tank so I get whispered all the time.
---
would you say herb+mining generates more cash than herb+alch? and which is more chill?
---
The problem with faction queues alone is that you can't do anything about it. You are horde on your character you invested the last months in and can't play anymore. What do you do? Right, you quit.
---
If you can't escape the queue by transfering over to alliance it's just bullshit.
---
But yeah, faction transfers wouldn't be trivial, but it's not impossible too. You just need to create lists of items and quests that need to change to an alliance version, or won't be available at all after transfer. Shamans are obviously a bit more complicated, but you could "just" make shamans into paladins. It's nothing impossible, just sit a competent dev down and they'll come up with something in a few days.
---
It surely isn't perfect, but seriously, I'd rather have scuffed transfers than 30:70 faction balance.
---
The second part makes no sense to me. If you can forget about 1v1s as alliance that also means there are no 1v1s for horde.. going by logic. I had easily 50+ 1v1 last week alone. That’s why I’m saying, if you have 0 1v1s since Start of phase 2 there’s no other way but if you are actively avoiding them which ofc means the only time you die is when you can’t escape a enemy death squad.
---
Simple yet effective.
---
Somethibg to note, you will always have a 1% chance to miss/resist.
---
I hoped he would have banned you tbh, the whole "pvp" people have going in itsnt really pvp at all, its griefing, and don't even come here with "why roll pvp server then?" well, because I like fighting over worldbosses and gathering nodes, but being camped by an entire raid just isnt fun.
---
How though? If a HK is being contested, the one that deals the most damage gets the most honor.
---
If both get full 200+ honor despite of damage dealt or whatever, then it seems buggy af.
---
Blizzard, what are you doing? This isn't EVE where scamming is considered part of the game.
---
Probably not going to sell the accounts
---
Jokes are suppose to be funny, homie
---
Yes, fuck the streamers, they are all cancer anyway.
---
When I was on Kromcrush (Horde) I would feel bad attacking any alliance player at all. Even if they were the same level as me, because I knew they would get zerged down.
---
Now that I transferred to Heartseeker I have zero problems attacking Alliance younglings. Alliance outnumbers Horde pretty badly over there. I feel no remorse, especially when I save a fellow horde youngling from certain death.
---
Maybe hes just inspired by Kazzak and want to have a 1 man squad of throwing shadowbolts
---
All armor is originally modeled on a human male i believe, so chances are those will look the best.
---
This exact thing happened. I was waiting for 3 hunters to try, none succeeded but i waited patiently. Then one Shaman comes out of nowhere and sees that i am a lone hunter in the middle of 3 hordes and of course starts attacking me. I emoted him to stop but he was feeling really strong. So i shot at Solenor.
---
I've seen 5 shaman before. I guess it means all are keybind together, so 5 casting the same spell etc.
---
&gt; that will still die in a stunlock
---
It's hard to die when a rank 1 renew ticks for \~5000 HP and you have an autoclicker macro that refreshes it every time it expires.
---
Rpm!
---
Probably someone from praxis like dikken, those guys are so hardcore I've seen them multibox to level before
---
Funny but i think having Holy Shock and +5% spell crit is what would make Retri viable in PvE. Reckoning wouldn't be bad either.
---
It is funny, you just have a garbage sense of humor.
---
Purge exists.
---
Ahhh.
---
I basically raid log on my priest.
---
I like raiding but am bored with the character otherwise. I want to PvP, and I don't want to PvP just as a support class, and I'm not paying 50g to respec to shadow every week when I'm not getting shadow raid loot. 
---
So my solution... Rolled an alt! Completely different playstyle and almost 50. It's been fun, and I don't think I'll ever get sick of it cause of the PvP capabilities.
---
Yes, but what are you gonna attack? Without the duel, theres no targets you can attack i believe.
---
&gt;&gt;As a priest you'll mostly be spamming flash heals anyway in raids which don't benefit as much from +healing.
---
&gt;Wut. Why on earth do you think that?
---
Because of spell coefficients?
---
That's why I said queues AND transfers. For queues alone it's probably too late, they'd just make people quit. Especially on really unbalanced servers many horde players simply couldn't play anymore.
---
How much entitle are you to think your experience is the global experience for everyone?
---
You logic doesn't make sense, it's not because every servers as 1v1 that you can ensure that this guy's had one.
---
Could you elaborate on your faction and server?
---
Living essences have dropped a lot in price, I assume because of all the DM farming.
---
Wow I need to go to bed, thanks haj
---
At the very least there's the flightmaster. Usually a bad idea to attack it but hey if you must...
---
How many years of expansions do we have to get through for Classic to turn into retail?
---
Heh, I'm kidding...sorry OP.
---
What exactly do cross realm battlegrounds entail?
---
I'm on an RP server with really low population, and I'm worried we might never get a full group of people doing AV on my faction. 
---
Will my own group be cross realm as well, or will we only face enemy groups from other realms?
---
On Noggenfogger EU last night i was puging Onyxia and a hunter rolled on Vis'Kag the Bloodletter and won it just to sell it for 350gold.. he was blacklisted by evryone but still

takes 2½-3 hours as a holy priest to make that gold back with lasher farming.
---
Yeah no
---
Suck that Blizzard dick harder, you sad fuck. Item restoration was ALWAYS part of the original scamrelated tickets. They are just cheap fucks and you suck that rancid dick like a 5 cent whore craving for the next meth hit. Go jump off a cliff you worthless human shitbag.
---
ok ?
---
Because people keep making excuses for fucking everything, "oh I'm new" "oh I don't know this instace" "oh I don't have gear" "oh dps is too high" all the fucking time. 
---
They don't need to know everything, they need to know the fucking basics. This is classic, mobs are as dumb as possible, they will always run after you if leave their LOS, which makes everything easier.
---
Its not 1 honor per kill though, its can be 10-20-30 or even more.  It may suck, but right now thats the best way to honor grind.  some players are already Rank 6 after 2 weeks, so are already getting a good jump on the race for R14.
---
firstTime?.jpg
---
Dare I even ask why there are so many bananas?
---
Yes, both teams are cross realm.
---
Isnt camping a heavy traffic area to be expected and understandable?
---
After dying 6-10 times just to get to the mountain, all the people killing after that are getting 1 honour per kill
---
The guy that grouped with me got savage gladiator chain. But you do you
---
Because 5 of the same class is easier than 5 different classes?
---
I used to play 5 mages on retail. Slows, rotating frost novas and a ton of aoe was pretty fun.
---
That's not how hybrid classes work though. You don't just mix and match 3 different gear sets so you get a little bit of stats for every role and then you tank, heal and DPS at the same time. I mean you can do that if you want to be terrible at everything.
---
Being a hybrid means that you have more flexibility when it comes to your spells and abilities over pure classes, it has nothing to do with loot rules.
---
The MS / OS was created to distribute loot fairly, so 1 person isn't needing on every single item when most of the time he's not even going to use all of them. If you're advocating that you should be able to need on every item then you're the one trying to gain advantage, no one else. That's just loot whoring.
---
Leaving my 2c at the bottom here. I rolled horde on a near 50/50 server (I think) and have a 60 and a 44. I focused on the 44 for the start of P2 and it has been brutal, corpse running to ZF when they’re controlling gadget, and watching my fellow horde camp when we are. Wah wah I know. 
---
After the first week I rolled alliance on another pvp server just to change it up. Now I have a 27 warrior there and I find myself already losing interest knowing that I’ll have to either head to STV and quest in the off hours, or run dungeons I’ve run 1000x before back to back just to level. 
---
It’s boring right now tbh. I flat out stared at my login screen today, and then shut down my computer. idk the answer, but maybe I should have gone pve. Feels too late now.
---
tl:dr i dont like pvp
---
Man you should have told him to bother someone on a pve server if they cant handle it
---
I farm nowhere else on my mage.Since ive hit 60 i take saturdays for lasher farm and i can say ive made over 2000g there since. Usually i spent about 5 to 6 hours there on saturdays (not 5 to 6 hours straight ofc) and by the end of it i make around 200 to 300g from greys/greens/low lv herbs) and im not even counting with what i make from groomsblood (around 5g per stack on my server) and dreamfoil (around 12g per stack). also not counting the blues and the ocassional epic (got staff (sold for 35g, and stockade pauldrons (sold for 85G)). for the books im not very lucky...the best i sold was warrior one for 12g
---
If your server has a discord you could check on that as well.
---
You know, I think it was a Julie doing that
---
https://youtu.be/sbGAOyeSWF0
---
These are some of the ones we started with.
---
&gt; You have to detect magic and either follow the target until it drops or get him to attack you.
---
Does detect magic count as combat as well? Would it PvP flag me in IF for example?
---
They were a pain before then. Hopefully bear speeds things along
---
I'm playing a female human warrior atm. I enjoy it.
---
Saw a gnome warrior decked out in full SM gear. I normally hate gnomes with a passion.. little ankle biters.. but that guy looked pretty badass.. for a barstool..
---
Just a lil ol dramatic storytelling
---
I agree with the identity part. However I would like to see options for healers and tanks to farm gold that don't require respecs.
---
But there is a lore friendly reason: the horde and alliance do not punish murders perpetrated against the opposite faction. We're allowed to do it.
---
Sell tank services/do strath live runs reserving orbs. I have a guildie that offers tanking services in return for all unwanted blues/greens, and he gets loads of whispers every time he advertises it in chat. There might be some reputation cost if you do it a lot though, we have a warrior on our server that's famous for reserving orbs and people always make jokes about him whenever orbs are mentioned.
---
DM:east jump runs are also pretty good, if you're prot you will need to 3 man it though, which cuts the profits.
---
It could also mean more people will do this now
---
Does salt smells like chicken
---
Theres worse servers out there to be sure
---
There are many factors:
---
-Is your guild clearing the content without issues? Do they do it in one sitting?
---
-your class and spec
---
-How much is expected of you in terms of consummables by your guild.
---
-Does your guild wants to function as a social group or just a bunch of players getting together to get some loot and not really play with each other after that?
---
So it's kinda hard to give you a simple number. As an example am a Shadow priest in a fairly lax guild on world buffs, I just need some pots/runes and two elixirs. I usually add a felwood buff on top of it. No flask/other WB. It takes me 2-3 hours to farm gold/mats for my pots (I do use a lot of them other classes probably gets by with far less). And then the raid takes about 2h30 for Ony+MC. So about 6 hours a week. BUT before getting to that point I spent a lot more time playing to gear up, farm gold for mount and so on.
---
Obviously but they still get ganked all the time
---
Ah, so that's what it is! Couldn't tell where the salty smell comes from.
---
its one thing being really into a kids cartoon and a whole other thing to be REALLY INTO a kids cartoon. I bet you'd change your mind if you actually met someone who was REALLY into it.
---
They are the hardest part for me as well, but here's some advice:
---
If you have Demonic Runes, use one. I use one every run and I think it's absolutely worth it. 
---
Keep them all together, don't have your pet tank one, don't put one into ice trap. Just kite them and always Concussive / Scatter the one closest to you. Kite them to where the pet is usually positioned during the boss fight, jump down at the last moment, then hunt them on their way back. Even with bad gear, one or two should be down at that point. If they're not down, use the plateau to get another round in. 
---
They're a bit terrifying but once you managed to kill them once, each consecutive kill is easy.
---
Make an undead and camp grey
---
Underrated bot.
---
Why, are there other classes that can solo tributes (outside of spending an hour waiting for invis potion cooldowns)?
---
No, only that group do. If there are other groups doing the same, they'll get full honor till they've killed you 4 times too. 
---
I know it sucks, but right now its the only way to get honor. Players are Not counting who it is they are killing, they just see a red nameplate and kill it. 
---
I'm not excusing how crap it is, but until players have a better way of getting honor, it wont go away.
---
Nost had 13k online peak times on one server, not bad from a not multi billion dollar company, but a bunch of people who liked classic.
---
I have 2 screens so I watch a stream on one and play on the other. 
---
Watching streams is enjoyable.
---
Who are you to say what people should and shouldn't enjoy?
---
Probably RP-PVP or one of the transfer target realms, right? Can't imagine any other PvP realm having an alliance majority.
---
Im not super hardcore into pve and will likely pvp a lot once BGs come out, so it definite would have found some use.
---
Tanking has the potential to be the best money maker in the game if you're good enough at it to sell dungeon runs. Either for a flat fee or something like res of all non-needed blues/greens.
---
Tanking Strat Live for 1st orb res or DME Jump Runs Thorium Res are usually the way to go.
---
Just be careful how much you ask for, and be ready to give a cut to the party for things like Arcane crystals.
---
Remember: Tank = bank.
---
Yes.
---
&gt; If you didn't know, spiritual guidance, the priest holy talent, gives about triple the value that it should until you log out. however, if you keep respeccing and spending points in spiritual guidance, this bug actually stacks. you can pretty much gain infinite +healing by respeccing over and over.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/T9crHGm84vJ6kadz#fight=52&amp;type=healing&amp;source=4
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; on this log you can see that Fusar's max renew ticked for about 650. I won't go into specifics, but if you factor in all the beneficial holy talents, power infusion, and one stack of the spiritual guidance bug, there is roughly 1600 +healing unaccounted for on that renew. for some perspective, end game priest builds run about 1.4k +healing.
---
&gt; this bug has been present since the beta, myself and others have reported it countless times, but as far as i know, this is the first time I've seen someone use it to cheese the logs. This absolutely needs to get addressed before BWL drops.
---
oh shoot, I legitimately didn't know about  this. Will definitely tell them about it. sounds very game breaking.
---
Username doesn't check out
---
The bathwater joke is insanely overused on my server and quite frankly getting tedious
---
must be horde
---
If you actually pvp in good honor spots, you obviously see mostly rank 4s. Standing in IF, not so much.
---
Some people are cunts. There’s not much anyone can do. 
---
I hate trying to AOE farm mobs because of the insane amount of competition for it no matter where. 
---
I’d just get back into questing and try to relax. 
---
You’ll get there. Just be patient. It’s not a race.
---
Winterspring's flight master does lose you 25 everlook rep if you kill it.  No idea if that's new or not.
---
Then your definition fits the situation.
---
That's literally what's happening the moment you touch ground to the dungeon.
---
Keep in mind that the difference is not "50k vs 13k" but "a shitload of servers with 15-50k people vs 1 server with 13k people".
---
LOL
---
Wait how did you end up with it?  I'd always thought farming in felwood was the best way to get it?  Still was like a .2% drop rate.  I farmed crusader watching Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood and made it about 40 episodes in before I got it.  So I just went and started leveling fishing because I had to see the ending

No answering anymore to do you want to tank is a bit radical. If you wipe one time, you never do a dungeon again?
---
I mean, your experience was bad and the behavior from their side is shitty but you should not stop grouping because of this, imho
---
I believe it has been confirmed that we are getting the updated version (I read it on wowhead, but the link escapes me). 40AP for Warriors baby! :D
---
People will be shit bags it happens BUT where they there before you?
---
The voice comms chaos when everyone joined the new discord was hilarious.

Does someone have the Richard copy pasta?

Hey man, I am still a hunter noob even though I am lvl 60...how does a hunter solo for HoJ? I mean, it's one thing to get to the boss room, but what then? Do you stand on the left ledge from the staircase and the boss can't get you or what?
---
Thing is being called a casual doesn't mean anything. You think it's offensive that I don't spend 60h/week playing games? I don't give a fuck if you do it, good for you, I don't want to do it. I like playing games, I don't like them absorbing all my life, or being the meaning of life, and I dont even have kids or a really time consuming job, I just have more things in my life than gaming.
---
Not true in my experience. We have one rogue who is foregoing all loot to be the first to get the raggi dagger. He's wearing 6 T0 and does more damage than our rogues with 3-5 t1, which are exactly fits the damage on paper. You just have to have active players who use all the additional energy that the set is generating. 
---
At the end of MC he has generated so much more energy than other rogues, which of course he can invest in SS/EV. Some of our rogues though are not active, don't use that energy, and will do less dmg.
---
It beggars belief how they don't consider faction balance when allowing these transfers. There's loads of massively imbalanced servers. Transfers are an easy way to fix this. Except Blizzard somehow manage to fuck it up even more.
---
I think guards spawn differently, and the number of them.      
---
Also goblin city guards being changed too.
---
You know adults get vacation days, right?
---
Spelldamage is the be all, end all. 
---
Int isn't a great stat, just means you get to drink longer. Sometimes it saves your bacon, but most of the time you'd rather have spell damage.
---
classicdiscord.com ?
---
Om my server it cost me around 1200g to make the helm. There are 4 players who can craft it. This is known from server discord. They are all respected and trusted. Maybe your server could do the same thing.
---
I did not upvote only because you reached 666 upvotes, just so you know.

Won't most of them stop playing anyways?

Take your own advice. It's just a comment, it can't hurt you. Relax.

Dwarf bro
---
Yeah, i doubt blizzard can deal with this as this happens across all servers all day in multiple flightpaths at once.
---
Yojamba? I think I gave a similar response.
---
Well, priest can have like 3-4 selfbuffs, shield and renew on at the same time.Pretty hard to get through all of it and then kill a guy who's stacking EHP in one stunlock.
---
Also, imagine priest like this respeccing to shadow after they get +5 000 000 healing. A priest tank that drops 500k HP shields on people omegalul. World first KelThuzad done by throwing money at chinese farmers.
---
Some, not all servers. And gold was much less valuable on private servers than on classic. You'd see rare epics and recipes at 1k+ gold a month after launch.

Totally not worth it and not constructive at all. This behavior helps ruin the community too. 
---
Behave like an adult maybe and talk to them about that d’ici move they made?
---
Thank fucking god. I can already imagine the people from my server stopping mid way to me emote:
---
/me halts in his tracks. *Is that a an orc warrior I see in the distance?*
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
I hate those questions because I get way too anal(ytical) about them. Like what's the context here? Are we on real life earth or azeroth? If it's earth am i the only wow race or it's common? If so then the world history would be so radically different it would no longer resemble real life earth in any way, and at that point I'm way more interested in the lore and history of that alternative earth than what race would I like to be. 
---
Anyway I would be a goblin, so I get rocket boots and discount at all stores. That's the most useful racial in a modern world. What? You didn't say it has to be a playable race from classic.
---
Maybe you should accept the fact that there is an opportunity cost to specialization and move on with your life.
---
No, I was doing some pulls and out of nowhere they came mounted and stole my current wave, then proceeded to farm everything, and when I tried to do some small pulls with the few mobs left they kept stealing them from me :(
---
Generally when AOE farming, its courtesy to share waves. Not sure how many people care, but that’s how I always knew it.
---
Hol' up

The AoE knockback only targets 4 players, not everyone in melee range?

If a dps warrior is getting T2 helm over tanks maybe you need to find a new guild.

Imagine going back to this level of innocence. Id trade anything for it.

They very well could be working on fixing it...changing code and testing and bug fixing doesn't happen in a day.

you'll be cross realmed, meaning players from other realms will join your AV, and you'll be fighting others from other realms too.
---
I love you guys. Due to me being a compulsive altaholic, having an existential crisis, and work I went from being a head of the curve leveling my rogue to suddenly still not having a single level 60. I picked my rogue back up today, it was my first toon and my OG main from retail days (350 days /played on my original rogue)
---
I went to grinding away in the blasted lands until I got side tracked pvping. Just people around my level first. When that first 60 mage opened up on me though... shit man something just clicked. Poor guy didn't know what hit him. Yeah, I may have blown blind, sprint, and AR to get the kill but  FUCK did it feel good. When that first SS crit landed I knew I could do it.
---
At your level just do BRD prison farm, it's super fast. 70k/h easily
---
plus people end up leveling alts so there should always be groups for every dungeon available. especially on a high pop server
---
For pve sure, but I don't expect the bug to last until we actually get relevant content.
---
In PVP that's just priest life. One step in the wrong direction and there's two warriors charging you, rogue cheap shot, blanket counterspell and a shaman spamming purge.
---
Making a case for abortion at any age.
---
Why is no one asking about the weird question? Is the person calling herself princess as a way to convince someone to join her group? Or is princess a dungeon? Never heard of it and no one made a comment about it.
---
No, your class is your identity. That's why shadow priests can still cast flash heal in classic.  
---
'Your spec is your identity' is a retail philosophy.
---
Depends how long the queues are, if it is ~1 hour I hardly think anyone will quit but combined with faction-only server transfers (which we already have) it might give the incentive to transfer off. You mention it would be an issue with faction queues alone but I believe this will need to be combined with server transfers to work the best.
---
Affliction lock + Shadow priest

Shadow mastery, demonic sacrifice and shadowform. Lots of dots and %'s increasing shadow damage.

Oh, no. No no no.

People who just enjoy a cartoon aren't the problem. People don't *hate* them, although they may get a bit of peripheral scorn if they *identfy* as a member of the 'fandom'.

No, they may be a sub-set, but it's people [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/e0y0tr/god_has_left_the_chat/) (NSFW) who are the problem and we shouldn't make excuses for them.
---
Had to go AFK in MC for a while because my swivel chair had rotated after I stood up and the back of it had come to rest on the lens of my halogen desk lamp. I went for a leak and came back to a room full of smoke. I quickly scrambled to put my chair out and had to open all the windows to vent the place out.
---
When I explained why I was gone, they said I should have just popped a fire resist pot...
---
Nah I still don't attack grey or green players unless they open on me. Be the change you want to see
---
I believe the speed boost doesn’t stack with cheetah.
---
P2 completely changed my play style. Which is now, log on, quest for 2 minutes, killed by a group, run back, see they’ve set up a campfire on my corpse, log off. 
---
It’s not fun. Plain and simple. And I don’t see it changing for multiple phases.
---
I'm a shadow priest, I can't aoe farm lashers and I absolutely suck at grinding out in the world, due to mana issues. I knew what I was getting into of course but not all priests have that opportunity.
---
Ik I have to be patient but like, can't farm during the day because I get ganked too much and the only time I can do it, this guy came and acted like a jerk. I was so frustrated, I still am :(
---
Well then rip
---
Do you use an alt to reset the dungeon? Cutting out the run back saves a lot of time.
---
With a fullsized raid the buddy system for ranged deffo. Much better to have two players standing ontop of eachother, rather than 4 people semi spread and potentially all getting blasted.
---
Make sure your tank stands as close as he can to Rag, seems to be some proximity aggro going on, would lose him randomly from standing at max range after intercepting back from knockback.
---
if you're getting phase 2, have an assigned collapse point where all the healers go, healer in this position starts healing to get aggro on all sons, melee and tanks form a barrier in front of healers, rotate AoE taunts and blow adds up, keep one add banished to regen mana through the entirety of P2, let it drop and kill the son with melees (to avoid mana burning casters by aggro) and then go back on boss.
---
If you have the time to spare in raid using mind controlled spellbinders from UBRS to buff the raid with 83 fire res is godsend, we routinely HS to karg after domo cause it makes rag so much easier with ranged having a chance to resist knockbacks and tanks being fire res capped at 315.
---
thats a bad a solution. no one gonna risk buying 800g worth of mats for 20g or whatever tip people are charging. you could easily use this as a way to offload tons of mats and avoid AH fee
---
It’s a boar in Elwynn Forest.
---
You're absolutely right about the fact that warriors don't have it easy regarding gearing. Fury pve must be the hardest spec to stuff. Unless you're my RL playing war Fury and get all the best goodies (ahem, other topic).
---
I'm alliance biased and didn't know Dal'rend wasn't that good for you horde folks. Forgot that human racial.
---
So a hunter won a pair of edgemasters? That's rude... Feeling bad for you.
---
your reading skills are poor.
---
Repost and eggs?
---
Yup. I'm in the same boat. Went Mage originally and realised my mistake at about L43 and went back to my tried and tested Rogue. 
---
The damage we can put out is great with decent gear even before 60. My Evisc crits over 1k on cloth and switching to my dagger (The Ziggler, still waiting for the ST quest one to be finished) I get about 850 Ambush crits too. I imagine that'll jump to near 1k with the new dagger.
---
Can confirm.
---
Our whole guild got accidentally locked to an MC raid ID last weekend because the raid leader used his alt to invite people to raid (to save DM buffs on his main). While inviting people, someone probably entered MC early, and so when the rest of the raid went to MC we all got locked to the same ID, even when the raid leader was passed back to his main (because probably when raid leader has NO ID yet, it will then take the ID of the first guy who entered MC instead).
---
In the end we figured out that the MC run he did with his alt never killed Majordomo and Rag, so we at least got those done, but it sucked pretty hard, especially when preparing for raid with consumables and world buffs pretty much takes longer than a full MC clear anyway.
---
None of us got any confirmation dialogue for before getting raid locked
---
yeah i agree
---
It's definitely not only 2 to 3 people. For example, Herod alliance (the faction that is the minority faction) had 12 slots for top bracket, this week is looking at 13 minimum. So let's say it keeps up, then that means 13 people could hit r14 at one time.        
---
Yes it can be 2 to 3 on small servers but even then a majority of the servers are a lot bigger, and the pool of players would increase even more with bgs
---
Nothing wrong on either side. It makes sense to charge for OS gear, especially for druids. Don't want to pay the price? Let the item go. People can't have everything. Druids have more or less free loot since there are very few druids.     
---
Imagine getting free druid loot cuz nobody needs it and then use full GP to take BiS piece from the other casters who barely have any loot cuz it's usually much more mages and warlocks than druids (also warlocks don't use many set pieces for PVE).     
---
Btw moonkins should be glad they can raid as balance dps meme spec. Not argue for best loot since they are the worst caster class..  
---
His best choice would be to pass on the OS item, shut up and use his points for the staff. Cuz if there would be loot council, he would have almost no chance to be prioritized.
---
Yeah I'm working on mine through jump runs.
---
Classic wow is a failure in my eyes, blizzard cheesed it hard. It started with aoe mage meta, dumbing down the difficulty of all dungeons, mobs and raids. This was very different in original all up until the very last patch before TBC (ive been there). Dungeons were hard and interesting, CC was a must, which means no dumb aoeing.
---
 Clearing MC before level 60 or with less than 30 people? unheard of in vanilla. Blizzard said no changes but they released the easiest version of vanilla which means that most people will absolutely crush the current content, removing all exclusivity of titles, items or people which was a big part of what made vanilla special. 
---
WPVP in my perspective is fun and i personally love it even if im camped by spergs alot, but i know and read about many people being very frustrated and quitting just because of that which ofcourse is another fail... All my friends either quit or log on once per week. I have no more fun or incentive to play anymore, i also started to play other stuff and only play once every few days for some pvp...
---
 canceled my sub which ends on 22 dec--- i can live with never seeing NAXX in its original form, since it will probably be nerfed no brain shit like mc was...
---
Yes.  People still raid.  If you join now, and play hard, you could feasibly get bis before BWL.
---
Wait, I don't get it. Sims RP in Brood War? What is this and how did it work?
---
Ppl saying dwarf female need to get some glasses
---
&gt; it’s the server sizes
---
WHAT? Few months ago this sub was so hyped about cluster fuck servers of epic proportions. Turns out it was horrible idea after all...
---
Auction of the monkey and of the eagle, vendor weapons, DE everything else.
---
Too late, noone is raiding anymore nor doing any dungeons or PvP
---
I've heard brd, I need to go there for some of my pre raid gear. But is it a dungeon? Ive asked my guild so many times and no one ever respond to me even
---
Thanks!
---
0.3, not 0.1 btw
---
Shamans man... Kinda must heal in raids. Can't farm shit as resto through.
---
I'm on a pve server and I'm happy with all the salty tears from people on pvp servers who can't handle pvp
---
Sure, that's the only situation where I can understand if someone doesn't respond. Whispering people who's currently doing a dungeon or raid is just ... weird. I know it occurs some times as it has happened to me too.
---
[NEDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVBalxt3NEU)
---
Think you are fine. The reddit community seems a bit skewed towards people that started on day 1 and started raiding months ago, but there is really no reason to rush it.
---
Imagine camping flight paths where u actually lose honor.....oh horde you're silly
---
Indeed rip
---
Hey, you should look into AoEing dire maul east plants. Good money and it's exp!
---
For some classes certain PvP pieces are bis even through AQ and naxx iirc
---
Whats min level for it?

Imagine a rogue able to cast warlock dots
---
Can DM:E runs be solod by hunters? I know of tributes but I’m trying to farm a lot of thorium.
---
Probly this.
---
Actually, when I started playing this game in the open beta before vanilla, because my brother introduced me to the game and helped me make a character, I ended up in alliance and had no idea the horde existed. I was closer to level 30 in vanilla (so quite a long while after, I only made it to 20-something in the beta) when a friend had me run with him to Orgrimmar. He didn't tell me beforehand where we were going and I'm quite sure he wasn't entierly certain either, he'd heard something and we were checking it out. That's the first time I saw horde players and horde settlements. We had encountered an orc npc on the way there that we had brutally killed (he might've been a civilian but he was several levels above us and it was a hard fight) but we hadn't thought much about it. I played on an rp server so we got flagged for pvp, which confused us. Nothing else happened, though.
---
So yes. These players exist, and it's kind of jaw-dropping to discover that there is, in fact, more then 1 faction around.
---
He could roll the dwarf off the bat right after downloading this new game for the first time. Really, people can try the old school game they are hearing about, without prior interest in something like LoTR or retail.
---
&gt;I simply do not care about you, your struggles, your wins, your family, your friends or any part of your personal life. It really is that simple.
---
Ok. That's explicit.
---
&gt;Doesn't have to be a meaningful question or theorycrafting, I enjoy the funny stories people tell, be it victories or struggles.
---
Uh...ok. You and I both disagree with you, then.
---
&gt;This is exactly what I would call shit content.
---
Ok, so personal milestones and stories are a no-no.
---
&gt;Another thread that I found interesting: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1iexs/reality_check_in_lbrs/
---
Uh...a personal story is interesting to you?
---
You were right when you said quality content was subjective and impossible to define. You don't even have a criteria for it. Just "*I like what I like even if it looks like what I don't like*".
---
Here's a crazy thought, though: "*others like what they like even if it's what I don't like, and that's okay*".
---
Are you in the LFG channel?
---
That was in vanilla.
---
It's not my question, I'm not a hunter, was wondering if any other class can solo it without too much hassle. On pservers priests and druids did it, but on live too many things turned out different.
---
I don't really understand how this can be true. Priest mind control has to be channelled for the duration, meaning if you stop to cast another spell like stamina buff or shield the target becomes hostile again.
---
I did consider that he could have mind controlled you with engineering mind control cap which basically makes you his pet, and allows you to buff/heal/shield your pet, but this cannot be cast on a target that is in combat. So unfortunately I think this story is fabricated.
---
Anyone interested in the name "Original" on Pyrewood Village EU?
---
You might want to take a break from the game. Crying from anger over someone stealing your mobs, the fuck is up
---
I do it differently, I ask a guild mate to put bank alt and my mage in the group once then once I done farming lasher and stayrs. I can just log on my character to reset. This only require on time helping but it allow you to farm lasher and stayr
---
There is nothing more frustrating than die in hands of a gnome warrior.... even more if you're a tauren
---
Drastically larger guild member cap.
---
If you go through the tunnel with the rich thorium veins in it you come out right near the start of the instance. Might cut 20 seconds off? With doing the reset. But probably not even that.
---
I find it too slow to look for people to group up. And when I ask my guild they straight up ignore me, I think it's because I'm not 69 yet. Still I feel like they have like friend groups inside the guild
---
Did they nerfed Spy??? Oh god!! IS this a dream?!?!
---
2019 my friend. I'd imagine Blizz CSR is like a hydra with many heads having no idea what the others are up to.
---
That's a terrible suggestion. 
---
Let's say I whisper 10 peple "Hey mate, wanna heal X dungeon?" and all of them replies "Sure", but if I only invite the first one who responded I'm going to look like a complete idiot to the rest of the guys. Next time they get a similar whisper they'll be more hesitant to respond, and what if it happens again? They stop responding completely.
---
If someone whisper me if I want to tank some dungeon, and I respond relatively fast (say 15 seconds after I got the whisper) with a "Sure" and the guy goes "Sorry, we're full" or maybe doesn't even respond to me anymore, I'll be like dude wtf? Why the heck did you whisper me then? 
---
Common decency is lacking in this game.
---
Here is just:
---
'haha look at this screenshot of chat in game!'
---
Dog, I was waiting all day to farm them mobs. Literally
---
Ah sorry, thought you were OP. I would look at youtube, there's a bunch of videos with other classes trying/doing it, but i don't know enough about it to really comment on it.
---
With his question - you think hes gonna manage to get to r10, sir?
---
Well the one guy was ugly and kinda looked like a cow, the other was a Tauren.
---
spiders and shit in silithus is perfect for you. Hardly any gankers there.
---
You can cast instant spells on the targets you mind control as a priest, have buffed many questing hordes with it
---
Yea I tried it on the first day as priest, got about halfway through and figured even if I complete it, there is no way this would be profitable.
---
Not only that but the guy acted like a complete jerk, and there was nothing I could do about it
---
We have a similar system in our guild. You have to pay for OS rolls at 50%. We "disenchant" a lot of loot that could be used.
---
Every Onyxia Eskander's Collar drops. Pretty much every time it gets DE'd.
---
However, our rules were established from the start so it is what it is. At the end of the day, if you want gear, pay for it. Don't complain when you don't get it for free.
---
No, don't even think about FR.
---
Hunter here.
---
Never went for dalrends as the polearm from strat and later the barbarous blade is actually better and uncontested.
---
Hoj never dropped but would never have taken it from melee who would really have benefitted from it.
---
Never rolled on mask or truestrike as sooo many others benefitted more than me. Didnt buy the devilsaur set (atrocious prices).
---
Now I have better raid drops in all those armorslots just weeks later. People really need to chill out.
---
Not all hunters are huntards, please the generalization is over the top.
---
Yeah they changed how buffs show up in combat logs so spy isn't that effective anymore.
---
By the way, the mob is there.
---
Nah it's a pvp server. They summon on top of the span when they can.
---
Exactly.
---
&gt; dunno if its exploitable somehow but it would solve a lot of issues with fp camping
---
Could buff the enemy faction, trade with them, etc.
---
Good bot.
---
Oh but he doesn't drop anything?
---
Hmmm, 10/10 will try. Ty
---
There is literally no grind more effective for hunters than DMT at the moment, no matter what you need. It is far more effective to practice and grind DMT and buy thorium off the AH.
---
The main struggle will be finding a guild with a raiding spot, unless you're dead set on pugging BWL in the future, which sounds horrible.
---
god I hate the irl community
---
Fuck you, dont tell us how to hate. loser
---
Both western and Eastern plaguelands have been great with groups of both factions running around battling wherever they meet.
---
Then you have me, mid level 50 skulking around trying to stay out of sight, crossing the damn roads like the hobbits avoiding the ringwraiths.
---
BRM is just chaos however, insta death upon rez etc. So I won't call that fun, but it's not worth a complaint either. Usually get to whatever dungeon I need within 30 minutes so faster than travelling to the other side of the world ;)
---
Somehow one of the people I played with still kept the old combat log functionality and his spy was still working as before after the nerf. No idea how that's even possible &gt;.&gt;
---
How bout the next conflag?
---
&gt;how is it that much? Isn't it 25% of your spirit?
---
&gt; gives about triple the value that it should until you log out
---
It doesn't matter, these people have already made their minds up and will believe what they want.
---
&gt; This is what the game is
---
doesn't mean it can't change
---
and yeah allowing more playstyle variety without having to waste hours of my life farming gold is literally going to ruin the game i'm sure, next thing you know there's going to be flying mounts and a vanilla cash shop with low res textured mounts
---
omg it's that simple... Thanks :)
---
no need to worry, i‘m still level 14 (again) because i‘m unable to choose which class i want to play. i have the tendency to level until 20 and then get the urge feeling to reroll because i‘m afraid of making the wrong choice.
---
Agree. Never been a griefer or anything like that, but damn do they make it seem tempting. I'd corpsecamp all the whining manchilds in this sub into eternity.
---
Not sure if it pvP Flags you, but it doesn't put you in combat and does not make guards attack you.
---
It could actually be the same ppl trying to level their Alts, very unlikely though.
---
Imagine you could damage other peoples mounts in WoW...
---
Well for a rogue/warr there's weapon expertise to worry about too
---
\#1 is diremaul tribute solo by hunters. About 130g per hour when mastered
---
\#2 is DME solo by warlock, not quite sure the exact gold it depends alot but its very close to hunter.
---
\#3 is diremaul tribute 2manned by druid+rogue, or potentially x2 rogue(though druid and rogue is a lot better). 70g per hour.
---
\#4 is DME satyrs as mage about 65-70g per hour.
---
\#5 is fury warrior + healer(preferably shaman or paladin) jump runs DME, about 60-70g per hour depending on prices.
---
Some of them require professions, like DME bosses requires mining, DME satyrs req. herbalism, and eventually all farms that kill bosses you want to have enchanting to DE into shards(right not it's not really worth it) 
---
If you are a priest you are kinda out of luck, you just have to do dme runs with some desperate warrior. But every other class can essentially make a fuck ton of gold right now if they talent and prof properly into it. 
---
There are also other gold making methods like boosting people in ZF or hand of justice runs as mage, but I don't want to count thesse as they require you getting customers in order to do, the rest can literally be done any time as long as you have your partner(if there is one).
---
Find a big guild in your server that hasany leveling characters
---
I hope so, ty
---
Shift clicking mail to get items.
---
I ain’t taking that risk
---
Felwood is fucking painful. Its literally impossible to get to 60 on Zandalar if you dont instance level.
---
I'm having a greatvtime but the imbalance on Fairbanks is a serious issue
---
its to hard to farm for a few hours and be set for a few weeks?
---
There are definitely off-hour raiding guilds. I raid midday Sat / Sun and there are Euro people in the guild. I think there is also an earlier weekday raid for graveyard shift workers on my server. If you are super picky about progression or looking for firsts or record speed runs then obviously you have fewer to choose from. But they are there.
---
Love these type of logic, lets cap respec gold at 1k then. Decision matters after all
---
The horror, the horror....
---
This is how everyone on pvp servers talk, 100% of the time.   So I've heard
---
How does rogue steal honor?
---
When you land at a flight point, youre worth no honor for a moment. People counter this by mind controling them untill they are worth honor, then killing them.
---
+30 spell on a skinning knife is amazing. Every class can wear it at level 1. Doesn't make it souldbound, either. You can use it and resell it.
---
Exactly. This system supports anything But honor
---
As another warrior, here are 2 pieces of advice for levelling.  1. find a healer. Become best friends with that healer, level up with him or her every time they are on. Any dps works really, but healers are best. 
---
2. Every couple levels check the auction house and buy a good weapon. Good weapons are key to warriors having an easier time levelling and you will be surprised at how cheap the weapons you can get are on there.
---
They were two 60s. I tried disrupting their waves but 53 lv mobs weren't much of a problem for them
---
That's because healing works differently.
---
I lost you at “when you are getting corpse camped, you are playing the game, just dislike it”.
---
If you're willing to go to that level of commitment, then you've earned it imo.
---
dk why youre getting downvoted. Just because its using in game mechanic like they should, does not change the fact its scummy as all hell.
---
I explained why I wont and can't.
---
Yeah, allowed and rewarded for it with army ranks meaning they officialy approve of it. Frankly it sounds like open war to me just without large scale operations going on
---
Dont r3call there having cross realm bg in classic, didnt it start later?
---
If I don’t feel like bothering people I end up getting naked, dying, resetting, and running back.
---
I made a generalized statement but then specified and narrowed it down with my elaboration to clear up the inconsistencies. How hard is that to understand?
---
Fill the FP’s with faction friendly merlocs.  The sound alone of 20 merlocs will give them nightmares.
---
Friend of mine was in a hardcore raiding guild. During a run in BWL, while tanking a boss their MT was in the middle of an earthquake and had to run out of the building.
---
He had Thunderfury, and when he got back a couple of minutes later he was still tanking the boss and hadn't lost aggro. Nobody had noticed he was AFK.
---
Honestly what would be cool, some old school MMOs didn't allow respect or cost the equivalent to 1k gold in WoW and when you saw someone with a pvp spec that hard to level with it was a big deal. MMOs now a days need stuff like that again.
---
I would love some screenshots :)
---
Hahahhaha good
---
Identical names, etc
---
I play on earthfury and it seems pretty balanced. I think people say it skews slightly towards the horde.
---
Dwarf and Tauren changes?... I might be ok with that
---
Item rack is fantastic. You can define different gear sets and then switch into them at a click of a button. Or you can conditionally change into and out of them. For example I have certain things I always want to wear on a horse, but not otherwise, and I set that up so I don’t have to think about it. I have certain trinkets I want to wear in certain dungeons and I can define that and not have to think about it. It’s very powerful.
---
You’re not getting bis before BWL unless you’re a Warlock or Druid. I raid every week and as a mage I’m no where close.
---
They need the range, so they shouldn't able to detect you before you see them in range.
---
Could also be the same faction getting honor denied to them. It's very easy to manipulate the honor system in your favour when you can deny people mass amounts of honor.
---
Might as well have listed AQ as well haha
---
lmao
---
If true, awful RP. Using "lol" in RP, lol
---
0/30/21 is a godsend for casual players.
---
Following
---
IIRC it was Wrath that did that. I remember having 70 friends put outrageous leg enchants on my old twinks.
---
The names dude also, nvm
---
&gt; they restored my loot to how it was like a week ago
---
this means they reset your gold to 115g not that they added 115g to you
---
They would still want a fee, which you wouldn't expect from a guildie.
---
The more people you can get the add-on to scan, the better it can accurately place you in the standings. Combine this with how it all depends on how much honor everyone else is currently farming and it's possible that your rank prediction could bounce around for a bit before settling out.
---
My advice would be to go to one of your main cities and try to get as much information for your add-on to scan and update to better reflect the overall picture.
---
honest answer? It's too late, as you seem like the kind of person who is bothered by being behind
---
The real problem is that when you duel, you break the honor distribution, only the 2 people in the duel receive the honor, no matter who else did damage, healed or whatever else you can think of, it is all discarded and only the duelers get points. *That* is the problem part. Everything else is superfluous.
---
Yeahhhhh, you’re a pedo.
---
He clearly planned to leave already, and decided to make some extra buck before doing so. Why else would he advertise crafting lionhearts in trade if he probably didn't even have the pattern?
---
I always gave mine similar names, too 🤷‍♂️
---
LF Fairbanks Horde guild. 
---
A friend me to a guild that's centered around an online community he's involved in but it's basically died out by this point (and the friend stopped playing). 
---
I'm looking for a casual raiding guild or really just any guild large enough where people are around to do dungeons together or whatever at peak times. My main is a feral druid specced for both tanking and DPS. I am located on the east coast on a west coast server so if raid times line up to EST that's just bonus.
---
heheh - I've done 35 clears of Strat, no choker... So yeah - it is what it is (not that I would ever fucking waste points on Choker of the Firelord)... (wait... I guess a robust dkp or EP/GP system solves that then)
---
"Ok I will not do it anymore". Lmao so you knew it was wrong, you scared honorless  scum. Get fucked.
---
It sucks for ally across the board generally, your best bet is to join a PvP guild that has active players. Trying to befriend the 60s that you see out in the world pvping. They'll likely always be up for a fight! :)
---
If you're in level 49-55, you can grind Sunked Temple with relative ease, and it's not camped too often. Another alternative would be to quest in less populated zones. On my server  ( Grobbulus) we will have occasions where horde will come to gank, but it's mainly alliance dominated or a close 50/50. Silithus is usually buzzing with some rogues and mages farming Essences, and Thorium, but it's nothing you and your buddies can't handle!! 
---
I know it's frustrating, but keep grinding! You'll get there!
---
Also try and avoid "Hot Spots" Like BRM
---
Lol, yes it would be bad, since all the item from MC, ony and every donjon are based on 1.12 itemization which is way more optimize gear.
---
It wouldn't make any sense if they don't release the 1.12 blue set but the useless ones.
---
Stop whinning about a whinner please.
---
That is literally one of the biggest reasons FOR loot council. Raid loggers are just that, people who log in once or twice a week and have no reason to stay or help anyone in the guild. Giving priority of items to the people actually showing up outside of raids, pretty much guarantees that the guild won't give people getting bored by the game and quitting. Obviously raid performance plays a part too, but it's to differentiate between the people who show up outside of raids, not pushing raid loggers up in prio.
---
Doesn’t have rondo with entitlement.
---
If you are saying you were looking for 1v1s for 2 weeks now and couldn’t find any that’s just a straight up lie.
---
You either avoided each and everyone of them which makes it highly questionable wether you belong on a pvp server or you straight up lied.
---
Reducing the cost could potentially make it more of a money sink. Those willing to pay will respec no matter what, but reduced cost could bring in many new "customers".
---
Personally, I would respec often on main and alts, if it was capped at like 10g.
---
This, me too. Haven’t ever seen them drop. Wearing the bewbs now and happy for it.
---
I mean, it’s not a God given right to be able to AOE Farm. There is a reason the tagging system works like it does. It wasn’t designed for that.  There are ways to level as the game was intended.
---
Yea i rather be killed right away than CC'ed 30seconds first.
---
They KNEW what they are doing. Punish now!
---
I just wanna have some good ol virtute foreplay without having to get a virtual rabies shot. I member when you could just go to a troll under a bridge and press x.
---
That's as specific as you can get, mate. It's not general.
---
nO cHaNgEs!!
---
"Mommy has tendies gotta go"
---
All the item we have have the 1.12 itemization I would be highly surprised if they release the pre 1.12 blue set.
---
I believe that #nochanges included ~3500-5000 player server populations. 
---
I actually agree that it's unfair to enforce faction queues at this point. I struggle with that, though, because the current situation is basically "The game ended with the release of Phase 2" in a fairly definitive way for Alliance players and so it's a tough question of who to be unfair to and what kind of cosmic balance you strike a year from now. 
---
Faction queues now that piss off mostly Horde players but maintain an Alliance population come AQ40? Some other method of encouraging balance? Or no queues and no Alliance players on most PvP servers at that time?
---
Yup. The same happened on the German "Heartstriker" server. We're overrun by alliance guilds. Questing is impossible. Life is miserable.
---
I played in vanilla and naively thought I’d be playing about the same game now in 2019.
---
Not really, i give my opinion and argument on the topic before i pointed out the dumbass that you ar
---
Ωραία
---
it really depends on what is youre preference.  
---
But have in mind that you will be looking at that butt for a long long time... so having said that i chose female night elf :D
---
Our warlocks are geared too and all our fury wars have nothing...
---
Hah at first I thought funny joke. Then I started thinking about the GMs I’ve encountered lately...
---
It also takes 2 minutes for the leadership of the group to pass to your alt, so that's also slower than having someone reset for you.
---
Teachers are off this week too
---
Oh, so playing classic but wanting features ahead of your time? Nope!
---
Laugh in as a orc warrior, resist stun  auto attack dodge overpower crit,, mortal strike execute, bye
---
Their argument would be that you're not paying for classic wow. You're paying for retail, and from the good graces of their hearts are giving you classic to play around in.
---
That doesn't make anything better, but I'm pretty sure that's their official position.
---
There's a video on Youtube, but I don't think it's efficient at all. 
---
Without Rhok'delar, it takes me 25 minutes for a full run. With ten Thorium hits on average, that comes down to 0.6 Arcane Crystals per run.
---
I'm on a PvP server because that's what my guild back from vanilla picked. Started a little late and haven't had that much gaming time. Level 56 atm.
---
Obviously gave up on all the popular zones. Tried Silithus and Azshara with no luck, got ganked and corpsecamped over and over.
---
Have all the quests for Sunken Temple. Have found a full group twice, and both times given up on getting to the entrance after about an hour of corpse runs.
---
Have most quests for BRD ... uhm. Yeah. I thought we had a clever plan. Planned it for the same night as another guild 's MC run. Wait for them to group as 40 in Kargath, then ride in with them. Sounds good, yeah? 3 deaths later nobody from my 5-man group and nobody from the 40-man raid was even close enough to see Blackrock Mountain.
---
Going PvP was a mistake. PvE reroll time.
---
Most dm farms rely mostly on the Grey vendor trash. Things like essences and other items are just a "nice bonus".
---
Well.....maybe. But it might also feel unnecessarily cumbersome in a way. 
---
I mean. Either just decide to allow it or not. 
---
And if allowed, don’t piss the players off by making it troublesome and non intuitive.
---
Play on Arugal. It's more balanced than any other server I have tried, even with the imbalance, it isn't just a stomp from one side.
---
...crush my balls with a hammer, I must.
---
Extreme pain, I must endure.
---
Not just that, but because feral dps and feral tank share so many talents you're fully capable of filling any role you might need to fill in both pve and pvp so long as you have the gear to do so.
---
I've been trying to get into selling tank runs, I've got a couple t2 head and t1 shoulders as well as drillboarer disk so I look really geared, haven't had any complaints with runs but haven't got the best gph, did two strat ud and an lbrs run which nettet something like 60-70g total
---
It’s way too late now, but were you in a raid when you were feared? If not, then it is YOUR own raid lock, in which you have likely killed nothing, and you might have been able to invite the raid leader into your raid, toss lead to him and proceed as normal. Others in this thread have suggested how to tell which bosses (from Magmadar on) are still up. 
---
(If this worked, and great loot dropped, then people would be praising your loot RNG seed.)
---
Lol teh tuaren xD
---
Get gud. /s
---
In all seriousness find a leveling buddy or two. Will you still get ganked? Probably. But it definitely helps for the random encounters of a similar lvl opponent.
---
Stealth
---
I agree. It’s a chore to log on now. I rerolled. I’ve completely changed how I have to play the game, for the worse, because of the population counts and the camping. 
---
Idgaf if you wah me, it’s not fun. The game isn’t fun in its current state. It’s boring, tedious, and annoying. Haven’t played in a few days, don’t expect to today or tomorrow. Maybe next month.
---
Just curious what peoples thoughts are on bgs coming soon.
---
Do you think pvp will be meaningful and positive or will it mostly be ruined by premades/meta bs, queues, etc. I am hopeful that battlegroups will even out with pvp/pve horde:alli.
---
I'll quit if bgs end up being bad. Wish classic had better endgame. Feels really stale.
---
Heynongman, this is between Blizzard and me.
---
You mean level 48
---
Nobody who's speaking in character cares about that sort of shit. Not all RP has to be about pure 100% speaking style matching and time-based diction.
---
Trade AH then hire bodyguards with the gold farmed from AH to guide you to dungeon.
---
Leveling as a hu warlock made me laugh as I immolate baited kickbots and drain tanked rogues down.
---
You can also delete the character, have someone make a new character with that name, and then recover that deleted character. This will force a name change.
---
Battlegrounds are launching as cross realm? Wtf why??
---
Exactly
---
It's 5 yards :)
---
So you, a person who admits to going through new posts just to downvote and shit talk people posting things you don't like, are unable to cope with someone throwing your own shit back at you?
---
How surprising.
---
&gt;I'm just going to have to block you
---
Ok.
---
Jump runs with a warrior is rather good money as long as one of you is a miner, even more if one is herbalist as well.
---
Get over it. It’s literally 3x to 10x worse for us, depending on which server you’re on. No PvP server has more alliance so take your spiking elsewhere.
---
And the races enhancement are all +5, and +5 is like a bit more than 3%, so you'll need 6% using the appropriate type of weapon.
---
Goodluck with que times at peak time though, got a horde char on this server and have to wait 25+ mins everytime
---
Yeah. My character name is duality and it feels good to be able to do booth. Plus dps if needed. You juat need to be consider when to need or greed. Im so hped for the smoking heart od the mountain and mark of tyrany. I moght evven pick thick hide. Manthat armor will be crazy plus at 60 i can have insta healing touch for that 3k hp hehe. Druids are so fun
---
Remove instance blocking. Let us just run in as a ghost. It was implemented to stop people world traveling as a ghost. That time has passed.
---
There is no gear check
---
That doesn't justify it bro.
---
So one Mage claiming an AoE area as theirs gets upset when another Mage comes along and does the same thing?
---
I'm already trying what you're suggesting and it still is tedious. I know I sound dramatic it's really that awful
---
Also, asking for guild or world channel help is hopeless. Never worked for anyone.
---
Raid logging at level 59 lol
---
Holy altiholic Batman.
---
What's your point?
---
He's kind of a petty troll. Just ignore him.
---
I waited 3 hours in vanilla to play on my original server. 25 aint shit. Take a walk outside and come back.
---
My server is 75/25 Horde dominated. I play Alliance, currently leveling a 53 warrior. You do the math
---
People complained about queues so blizzard have enlarged server sizes. If servers are reduced to 3-3.5 max size now, queues on most servers would be 6-7 hours or more.
---
I do have buddies, we still get rekt.
---
People don’t lack the skill to do normal, they lack the time to organize a 25 or 40 people raid. 
---
There is a reason blizz never went back to 40 people raids.
---
Most people would not go to mythic with or without LFR, LFR in no way affects you or your achievements , it only affects your purple epeen showing and your little girl feelings. Yes no one gives a fuck about you +10 ilvl gear, and I am sorry you need that kind of validation, but at least you were honest about it.
---
Your rep grind example is just a strawman, because they still exist in the same way as in classic.
---
This is a main sub quality post
---
&gt; male human (I really dislike their walking animation)
---
I made a male rogue and this hurts so much.
---
Combat log buff distance detection reduced.
---
You wow economist always baffle me; so far; prices in the ah only went down with the exceptions of few reagents/mats; simply because the ppl who needed those items already have it an dothers dont have g or will to buy it; this projection is what we will see as the future goes on; gold is and still will be the most important resource; changing respec to like 10g would only make that ppl would spend 2 less hours a week grinding gold
---
Isn't RP usually kept to /s (and /y) and without acronyms like lol
---
True enough. All the same with the gold cost and surviving internet/server dc's, especially if you're doing pvp/battlegrounds? I obviously don't think it's right and was just making a joke with my original reply, but I don't see this as a large problem either
---
I feel like half of the problem if your handling of the situation. You could have just gone to some other AOE spot (there are like 10 in WPL) and moved away from them. You could have just put them on ignore as soon as they started being toxic. You could have gone to a new zone. (why arent you farming mobs in Azshara or get a quiet spot in Un'Goro???). Instead the reaction was to cry, which is your choice really, but you could have handled it better. Crying doesnt accomplish anything really.
---
There is a heavy disbalance on most of the servers, either horde or alliance are dominating by a huge margin. Non-cross realm battlegrounds would result in a extremely long bg queues for such servers, so cross-realm thing makes queues shorter.
---
NE female warrior using a staff or spear are the sickest animations in the game
---
Flying mounts was handled very well in TBC.  
---
After you reach level 70, explore all areas on foot, do a lot of grind, and finnaly get this 60% flying mount - you will discover that every location have parts that you couldn't reach on foot. And they have more stuff to do.  
---
in WotLK this was broken because you get flying around 74-76 (?), so you stop walking somewhere mid-leveling and then roads and obstacles have zero meaning.  
---
It disturb quest chains, progression, farming and searching.
---
Half would be pretty bad due to the DR. That said, theres no bug/abuse/exploit/clever game mechanic whatever you wanna call it, that is just them fighting. Thats not stealing at all, you can just fight back.
---
Lol no it isn't.  SG is bugged.  When i found the bug myself, i was getting 100% spirit to +heal conversion.
---
If you can't remember, in the end of vanilla the old pvp gear which required ranks were obtainable through defined amounts of honor and wsg, ab and av marks. That made the whole honor system obsolete in the end.
---
I always walk away when Windows wants to update.
---
Warrior is damage dealer. Druid is rootin tootin flag scootin. Everything else is stand in flag room and win.
---
When did I say it was my spot? Or that he didn't have the right to farm there?
---
All I said was that I was upset at what happened 
---
I never said, I had the right over him to farm there
---
Stop being toxic, your family will be happy if do it
---
I made my post quick and didn’t think about it before hand. 
---
The population unbalanced makes sense.
---
Do we know what the battlegroups will be yet?
---
I, too, wish to hear more of this fantastic sounding tale
---
I am very sad that your server is dead.   
---
F to pay respects
---
Kek
---
You could have let the boots go if you really didnt need/want them. You wanted to get your boots for free, and still be able to get the staff from other casters. Your are a loot whore and an asshole. I would have booted you too. Loot whore drama is cancer.
---
Honor system for wpvp was a mistake, it should have been reduced to bgs and stuff like that.
---
I have both, and since some upgrade, quartz now shows the timer. Before that, I got the inflight taxi timers own bar.
---
Hmm weird, I just smell toast. If thatps nobmal?
---
I am not sure of this particular spot but I am sure there are more mobs than they can handle. Just pull more mobs and train to him while he AOEs so he gets the aggro and dies.
---
Lmao, people say that when they think they have a point but they don't.
---
I honestly don't remember many people complaining about the larger Classic servers prior to launch. The opposite, actually, since the no changes crowd seemed bothered by phasing more than population caps for servers. But now that Honor is live it's apparent how egregious the high server population issues have become with faction imbalance. 
---
So Blizz can either so nothing and piss of Alliance, add queues and piss off Horde, or pull a hail Mary and make balance changes and risk pissing off the no change crowd.
---
Hemp/Cold Blood
---
Not great. No taunt is a huge issue.
---
&gt; What happened
---
IIRC one of the "centus sites" showed that there's much more Horde on Kromcrush for some time. This triggered chain of Alliance players leaving server, actually screwing balance.
---
You can't shield MC target anyway I thought? Don't recall trying it with a shield specifically, I just assumed it wouldn't work.
---
At the very least you'd have to downrank it. If you MC a low level player and try to max rank renew them, it will cancel MC and give you an error saying target is too low level.
---
Gold sinks are fine, but is respecting the place to do it?
---
This is all academic because blizz would never change it and it would mess up the economy too much to change, but as an example you could:
---
- Add a 10g component that has to be bought from vendors for top elixirs and other consumables
---
- Vanity items like the chopper in TBC
---
- Other desirable things from vendors
---
If people with bucket loads of gold can spend 10g to squeeze another couple % out of their DPS, great! More power to them. And it doesn't greatly impact me as someone without a farming class or time to farm. I can play prot in raids and PvP as arms with only a 5g swap each time sounds much fairer. While those who don't mind paying 50g to maximise their effectiveness each week will still do so for the consumables.
---
Imagine being so butthury over rolling on a PvP server and getting killed you ruin a perfectly nice thread with your whining. Lmao @ u
---
Yep. Yellow hit cap really should have a different name, it's the source of the confusion
---
Yeh for BRD it seems wierd. I had a undergeared fury tank who thought it was OK to tank DM north at 55. That's a tad bit to crazy for me hah.
---
Also try to look up some dungeon AOE farm. I think you can still do it in ZF, later move to BRD arena.
---
RemindMe! 4 hours
---
As a warlock i used an Eye of Kilrogg from an UD entrance.
---
Like an idiot I deleted my teleporter....
---
If you're not joking and you're actually an RP elitist, that's not something you should be proud of lol
---
The economy was long fucked by that time lol
---
Night elf druid wet dream
---
I get ganked a /lot/ — routine multiple corpse runs to BRM, unable to level anywhere in the open without a 60 escort, and I still have the self-awareness to know that I’m able to stand this because I’m on a balanced PvP realm as Horde and at least some of the map is still navigable for me, which is not the case for many of the people complaining.
---
How come you're cool with rerolling PVE server but they still want to play on PVP one? Do they have it easier than you? Maybe you can ask them for some tips.
---
Use the class discords, they are the best resources available.
---
I never played wow before classic, when it launched I ended up playing on flame lash eu a human warrior to level 30 and later found out that even though I prefer alliance thematically I'd rather play horde because of the imbalance, and I wanna play on a pvp server not normal or rp, so after a long break yesterday I started playing horde on golemagg eu and found out its a more pleasant experience for me and that I actually like horde, however I only got to level 10 on my orc warrior so that might not tell you much
---
&lt;praxis deposited 1 silver into your account&gt;
---
I could say the exact same for you.
---
In the defence of tanks, to some extent tank gear is dps gear. We're past the days of stacking only defensive stats. After you reach a certain baselevel of gear threat becomes much more limiting than survivability. As such, what tanks tend to do is slowly replace defensive items with 'dps items' as their overall gear level gets better. Savage Gladiator Chain and Lionheart Helm for example are generally considered BiS.
---
Not saying you shouldn't be pissed off to lose 'dps gear' to a tank, but it isn't necessarily a ninja as is being discussed here.
---
Cool for you if you like it, but aren't you complaining about the whinner or am I missing something?
---
So since you like it everyone should be a masochist who like do get camped all day every day?
---
Please explain what else there is. I'd honestly love to hear it because I'm playing a shaman now and love it. Never wanted to play a rogue because they seemed way too confusing. 
---
But I do have to say I am absolutely biased because I hate dealing with rogues, and like many people have ganked at like no health too many times to count. I don't blame them though if I had that opportunity I'd take it too.
---
&gt;Warcraft tavern
---
which redirects you to [https://wowclassicbis.com/](https://wowclassicbis.com/) which is exactly the site that is so shit.
---
Honestly I definitely remember peaceful coexistence being a thing in vanilla on Blackrock, at least at lower levels.
---
Not on the scale it was in phase 1 of classic but it wasn't a universal fact of life that seeing another player always meant mutual combat.
---
Now, if you overpulled or tapped an herb/ore/questmob/rarespawn they wanted then that person you've been peacefully farming/questing beside for the last 30 minutes was most likely gonna stab you in the back over it but for the most part there was a substantial minority that would rather not start shit if they didn't have to because the honor and momentary dominance of their questing spot was less valuable to them than continuing an uneasy truce.
---
Things like sheep-healing, mind-control buffing, and bored-benevolent 60s weren't the norm by any means, but they were absolutely not an oddity either.
---
Doesn't seem to be the case, I'm not getting many stones. Maybe one in six mobs.
---
Exactly this.  The cost feels too high because it is, by design. You should have to choose.  If you can change talents every time you hearth, then talent trees become irrelevant, exactly what happened in retail. Dual spec removed the impact of talent choice so much that blizzard just got rid of talent trees altogether.  Now players can completely redo their talents in between trash packs in retail, and surprise, It's garbage.
---
Yo Sherlock, why are the identical names an indication he is gonna sell it? Literally, why? Its an indication he is gonna KEEP them, not sell them. Personalised names.... just think it through. With maybe one or two brain cells.
---
Noone wants to pay for it but blizz will accept easier this way lol
---
lol why give a warning just ban.
---
good tip &lt;3 , but realistically hard to compete on the aggro table with a lvl 60
---
Night elf
---
Dude all my friends play league, can't make an army for out farm some dude lol.
---
Ik what you said makes sense, not that sure if I can pull it off tho
---
The bigger nerf is buffs not appearing in combat log, so you can't detect players just passing by.
---
Alliance on arugal isnt even that bad tbh, i dont think you would regret rolling there, aside from current queue times on a few days (wednesday and sundays are pretty bad)
---
Hello, sorry could you post the answer here, or in my DM also? I'm also curious, we have a little troubles with rag 3rd week in a row ;_;
---
If you are hyped and are ready to enjoy it, it's not too late.
---
If you are always gonna be worried you are behind or you muck around on different classes until level 10 before rerolling, it is too late.
---
Killed that hunter a few times yesterday, will make sure to corps camp his ass when I see him.

---
Demoralizing roar
---
inb4 you're below lvl 48 or you're 60
---
I think a lot of the top devs want classic to fail.  They would rather say I told you so than admit they are complete failures who have no idea how to build a decent game.
---
Just have someone invite your alt and your mage then leave the group, when you log the alt you get leader after 2 minutes just reset on him and log back to mage.
---
This is what i always do, cba going out each time cuz of pvp
---
These are not random encounters. That was pre-phase 2. There are groups of 5, 10, 125 (seriously) roaming around or blocking entrances to every dungeon and every zone.
---
While it's true that being strong and easy to play is not the same thing, shamans are still way harder to play due to amount of micro management needed to even have a chance. Good shaman will make it hard for you for all those little decisions he makes, bad one will flop and die without getting a cast off.
---
well, I have to agree on that with you
---
Thats not true , we always stay when we get wiped...(thats when the fun starts)  we pvp all over the world but probably most on the boat.  We dont grief we just like pvping :) All alliance welcome to join us on the boat (dont forget your world buffs) &lt;3
---
This also saves you 3 minutes per reset, adds up if you farm for 10-18 hours
---
Premade with a Druid FC or just play solo queue.

---
I normally wouldn't humor you further, but I'll bite.
---
What am I supposed to not be proud of exactly? Because the "no u" doesn't work when I'm not being an RP elitist.
---
If this is just low tier trolling to keep me replying to an internet thread... damn, you got me. Great job. Super effective.
---
That's fair. I was more commenting on how easy it is to pull threat and overall make life difficult as a fury warrior without really intending to. But then again, when I think about it, hunters, mages, and warlocks all have done this to varying degrees. I guess I just notice warriors more, since I am one.
---
With this build you could either go 31 fury / combat orc axes or 23 fury / 28 combat human swords
---
People already ninja everything they want and then just transfer away or didnt even bother at all.  If someone ninja the deathbone set whihc is a 20% drop from scholo bosses thats nothing, the other tmogs that are unable to get on retail are the naxx items ashbringer etc... but for those you have to be really commited to get.
---
If you're getting messages every minute then I understand not replying. Maybe they're just trying to play the game or busy with PvP or just stepped away for a few minutes
---
it wasnt double bold , it was intended ;)
---
You can be proud of whatever you want, I'm not telling you what to do.
---
Ugh. I would've given up completely, but I looked, and it doesn't even get replaced in BWL, and threat is beginning to become an issue, so it's back to the grind for me. But I'm not going at it super hardcore or anything
---
Blackhand and hand of justice yes
---
But its faster than what OP is doing and doesnt require someone else to help you. Which is the point of the thread..
---
We appreciate you taking the time to flag this as an underrated bot.
---
However, this appears to be in error and the bot is already rated according to its quality.
---
Standard. They want BRE and deathbringer tho.
---
The difference is just as huge for someone who dinged 60 playing shaman for the first time in classic and an experienced shaman.
---
Last time it was on wednesday on top of that, and all I saw was them (or whatever guild it was) getting rolled over by alliance raids all day.
---
I played during original classic and rolled on many private servers, always PvP. I've been ganked and camped plenty. But this time around it took me about 2 days to realise how bad P2 would be for someone who plays like I do (slow leveler) so I already re-rolled on PvE. 100% worth.
---
My exp with zandalar tribe were mostly just so fun and good times
---
“I have a weird curved sword shaped like a J”

---
Finally hit STV last night and having a blast. Both group and 1v1 pvp. Yes getting steamrolled by high levels occurs but thats life.
---
Wrong use of inb4
---
I will let you read what gankman100 said. Btw your the first person who cares about waiting for 30 seconds before you get camped. Legit nobody.
---
Theres a multiboxer on shazzrah running around hillsbrad with 20 shamans at lvl \~38. He totally wrecks lvl 60 players in the big pvp zergs by dropping down 20x flame nova totems and casting 20x chain lightning for ridiculous aoe bursts and also dropping 20x grounding totems to practically make them magic immune for some time (except aoe).
---
Of course those 20 little guys also drop incredibly quick if 1 or 2 mages cast blizzard on them because theyre only lvl 38, but now imagine if they were lvl 60.
---
Some really good advice here. And I certainly don't practice this as often as I should! It takes practice and effort to be able to communicate to people effectively. Also, I am reminded of a quote I found hilarious, though I don't know the source:
---
"Diplomacy is the art of telling someone to go to hell in a way that makes them look forward to the journey."
---
You can do a run in under 12 minutes though so you’d get locked out were it not for the 2 minute waits for leader to pass
---
I thought 'honorless' debuff just meant you got no honor; do you get DKs from it?
---
Or they could just put in dual specs and only let you change them at a class trainer.  Raid spec and a solo/PvP spec, but no switching up mid raid like so many people are (for some reason) concerned about.
---
Pointing out your hypocrisy is not being toxic but thanks for your concern for my family.
---
TY OP for writing a better of rendition of irony than Alannis Morisette.
---
Although you aren't "complaining" about it, you still made the effort to make a post about the same issue, so you may as well have been complaining.
---
Is this an insult?
---
All good points, I start to think that Blizzard hates it self....
---
Mages need to respect for raids if they want to perform like they should  .. so the good farming classes do respec
---
Oh God. Where did I put that gasoline?
---
It was 16 minute delay 2 days ago and around 6 min yesterday on Firemaw. Blizzard is just shit.
---
You must be the only virgin at your mom’s basement party!
---
I mean rogue's are really only hard countered by one class, and still it's usually always a close fight. Whereas shamans are at a disadvantage in almost every fight. If I get CC'd at all, I've lost the fight 99.9% of the time.
---
It was pre TBC patch, it was not meant to be part of vanilla, it was just a small thing to prepare to TBC. Also Naxx gear had already made the honor gear and system obsolete
---
I've been needing a reason to reroll Alliance :D
---
You're not wrong but the same can be said for. Rogue too. On top of a higher skill cap.
---
And here I am, 15 years later, multiple lvl 60+ characters.
---
I have yet to see a purple on any characters. (outside of raids)
---
Some people are just lucky.
---
My guild uses EPGP as well. We don't charge for OS at all. Our only stipulation is if we catch you wearing something you got for OS in your MS we retroactively charge you full price of the item (regardless of how it would have decayed) when we find it.
---
It is an exaggeration of the situation. That person with thousands of gold is still losing an amount of time everytime they re-spec. I'm a frost mage if I choose to re-spec I'm still losing an hour inside ZF getting it back regardless of whether I farmed ZF for a few hours to have a bit of pocket change or for weeks at a time to have an obscene amount.
---
Is the current system perfectly balanced? No. Mages can respec easier than other classes, but no mage can respec with less loss than any other mage, that isn't how it works. If you're saying you want to increase the height of the wall for people who effectively 'have infinite specs' sure but that is a completely separate argument.
---
If someone plays a lot to be able to swap specs a lot more power to em, they shouldn't be excessively punished though lol.
---
He doesn’t have 5x the gold nor 5x chance of rares/epics. Gold is split among party members and green+ are simply distributed through the loot system. 
---
However, you can get more gold/rares per hour since you’re killing stuff faster.
---
What a duch, lol. Rest assured, he has irl problems🤪
---
Not wrong seem to have happened here, and you do not own any mob tag or space in wow
---
Grind in north east azshara (east of satyr camps)
---
If a 60 kills you just run back to your body and keep grinding, if they camp you just take a short 5 minute break for them to leave
---
I like that they Care.
---
Yup, this just confirms my theory of Finnish people being the worst cunts in online videogames.
---
He just said they're already 60. He isnt.
---
They most likly either raidlog or they PvP. 
---
You cant do either as a lvl 56 trying to get to 60.
---
The only 1v1 same level I’ve had is when I’m at 25% fighting a mob. When I Rez to find them, they’ve left the area or have a +10 buddy with them.
---
shame his ass on the forum
---
Zevrim is mandatory, you can kill him in his room too.
---
Here's my 12 minute run: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6VzJXIIjFI
---
Hydrospawn in ~3 minutes (about 2:30 kill plus drinking) seems good on paper but at least for me it's riskier than the rest of the run because he sometimes gets too close to the satyr pack on the right.
---
Nothing on Google?
---
I hope my warrior alt gets exalted AV, WSG and the blue set at some point without the matches being to lopsided all the time.
---
I recognized it as well! You can find Flying Circus on Firemaw, although I'm with another guild.
---
Grats man. I don't fault people who are far luckier than I. I am merely envious of their luck.
---
On the bright side, I've gotten every single mage and warlock in my guild their Ban'thok Sash, every healer their Second Wind trinket, and every rogue and warrior their Hand of Justice (including myself actually, so lucky there!).
---
That's actually my problem. I've run out of people in guild to help me do arena/anger/argal runs, because they all have had their gear drop by this point.
---
When I see people MC camping I stand there on my lock and dot the target before it’s mced and I get 89 honor for a level 60. It does split quit spreading fake news.
---
Rogue + SP, the class would be called "Bastard" cus would be such a pain in the ass to deal with..
---
On a serious note, Rogue + Hunter, the Bard!
---
If we take his timeline, he has been raiding for 2 months so 8 raids. 2 of those where under MS/OS roll rule, then they switched to EPGP and he had one or 2 raids without the OS rule. The next 4 raids were under EPGP with the OS rule. So effectively he "wasted" 2 weeks which in classic isn't a lot..
---
Imo that loot system is bad for many reasons mentionned in other comments, I feel like even rolling makes more sense than a system that entice people to avoid small upgrades just so they can get that big upgrade that everyone wants, and it is also warped by the fact that itemization is pretty bad meaning a discrepancy between the classes/specs. 
---
I do agree that not giving him the piece is stupid, but under their loot rules it isn't and he knew the rule. I also agree that the guild has made a couple of mistake: Picking a shit loot system and having to fiddle with it because it's bad, and on top of that they didn't even bother to consider previous raids for the EPGP and on that definitely screwed him.
---
Fucking trash hunter. You should definitely contact their current and future GM and tell them of this and show them the video. That is some serious fucking shit behaviour that any even half-serious guild shouldn't tolerate from their members.
---
It's not just grounding, but tremor and poison cleansing also in terms of using totems reactively.
---
Laughs in Astral Recall!
---
Sure. Staying at the dungeon as a ghost works. But unless everyone you group with does the same you still have to wait 45-60 minutes for everyone to get to the dungeon. And once every 2-3 runs you have to go sell/Repair.  AND you lose out on the rested exp.
---
It doesn’t bother me too much, but it irks me that people dismiss how difficult and time consuming it is.
---
Servers aren't free. 18 months of Dev time blizz paid for up front isnt free. Blizzard is a for profit entity that is legally bound to act in the best interest of the financial interests of shareholders. You really don't understand why we pay $15/month? Why not go back to private servers? Well I for one actually care about IP rights and laws so that's a pretty good reason.
---
I totally agree we should have support for classic. I think that this is something we could get if the community pushes for it enough in the right way. Asking what we are paying for isn't the right way.
---
&gt;Spell batching
---
Not a argument, they could have made ServerName\_1, ServeName\_2 and merge them after curious people leave. And if they don't leave, then just don't merge them.
---
Yeah :/. People act like vanilla was a perfect game and literally nothing good was ever done between it and the current version of WoW.
---
Dual spec, even if it had some restrictions like needing a class trainer to change or a cooldown or whatever else, would be a great improvement to the game. 
---
Personally I don't have time to farm enough gold to change specs as often as I'd want and still be in an effective raid spec... so result? Aspects of the game are less fun for me than they otherwise would be.
---
If you want an easier time finding the location of quests, a lot of people use Questie. You can download the Twitch app onto your pc and browse for adding through that as well. DBM (Deadly Boss Mods) yells at you if you stand in bad things, so it’s a good option to keep you aware. 
---
Honestly there are so many addons out, that it really depends on your play style and what kind you are looking for. I would go and browse curseforge if I were you, to see what the most popular ones are. Just makes sure you look for CLASSIC addons and not RETAIL. 
---
:) good luck!
---
Could be using greens as well. You generally lose +healing as you upgrade to epics with actual stats on them.
---
That’s not an explanation of anything. That doesn’t suggest anything other than they have a theme for that team. 
---
It actually would seem like a contraindication that they’re selling the accounts.
---
Opened about 800 of those so far and saw maybe 4 greens and one tailoring pattern (not a very good one either).
---
Most of my gold in boxes comes from putting Blinding Powder on AH, goes for about 3g/stack and I usually get a stack in less than 10 boxes.
---
Had better drops in BRD coffers to be honest.
---
I get that, simmer. I just don't think it destroyed really MC and dungeons
---
I was wondering if any warriors have tried this or if its even viable. So I am running a fury/prot build for my guild to tank random shit in MC/Ony as needed, but most of the time I am in my fury gear. I've noticed im doing more dmg with my demonshear, even when im specced into the offhand extra dmg talents. However, the rage generation just isnt there. I was wondering if I macro'd my wirlwind and bloodthirst to equip my 2 hander for when they are cast and then have it switch back to my 2 one handers, if that would maximize my dps?
---
How do I delete other peoples posts?
---
They won’t be available for minimum 8 more weeks and a handful of people will have them on any server. 
---
Dumb outrage
---
DC doesn't reset it if you get back into the game within a few minutes.
---
If he continues to escalate he could face a suspension. Already got warned for it.
---
Yeah. The people going "Its not that hard, you should expect getting into fights now and then" obviously dont play on a server where the other faction is dominating.
---
My server is 75/25 horde. And it takes 2-3 hours of ganking and corpsecamping to complete 1 quest.
---
I always check early in the AM. If there’s few things on sale you can set the prices for the day.
---
It’s weird how reactionary people are when they see anything that seems weird to them in this game. It’s like their brains just shut off.
---
Indeed, these rogues wont even have to reset
---
Nice thing is that you actually don't have to make the portal if you're not satisfied with what you're given. You know why? Because there's 5 other mages standing next to you willing to do the same thing for 50s. What you're doing requires almost zero effort, no skill and about 10 seconds of your time, so don't expect to be paid "for a service". The reason why you are given 1g most of the time is because it's easier to write, than to fiddle around writing 50 and because people don't like numbers that aren't round, not because the work you're doing is worth 1g minus resources. Welcome to capitalism.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Multiboxing
---
Pretty sure you get kicked out to login screen with some error eventually if you stay in one place for too long. My bank alt gets booted several times a day despite me regularly checking AH on it.
---
With teeth?
---
Really not comparable. Hockey fans simply watch and have no say on how the sport gets developed and if there are rule changes. These streamers are toxic AF and have more pull than they should to get devs to change mechanics or gameplay to better suit them. They get away with things like stealing items from raids or other toxic behavior and they influence a lot of people watching them to do the same shit. These streamers then blackmail these devs into catering to them because if not they’ll pull all their viewers and clearly devs don’t want that cuz it’s bad for business. Also, it’s rubber not plastic.
---
As a warrior, Can I dot anything against a rogue in a Wpvp 1v1 event ?
---
I'm trying to do 1v1 to play better but rogue are really a problem for me, as soon as I get the upper hand I get blinded and they either run away with sprint, or just wait and sap me (at this point they can set a fire, craft some food, eat, make themself a coffee and reengage if they feel like it). My worst experience was against a rogue gank squad, I charged to try to help some poor guy getting ganked, got blind into blind into sap, by the time I was out of CC there was 5 death on horde side and rogue had started to scattered.
---
i know I can break sap but I need to be in berserker stance fr that and I'm not usually in berserker stance against a rogue
---
I agree, it's not ideal. But it's the best way to work when all the "BiS" lists aren't correct because they're using old data or faulty reasoning.
---
Alright, you go ahead and RP walk from Teldrassil to Dun Morough. Maybe even sit for a bit here and there to rest, since for the sake of accuracy, your character is obviously going to be out of breath and fatigued.
---
If you have mining, mining alone can very VERY lucrative if you sell the ore/bars.
---
Org rogue smh
---
Ah, another member of Westfall server. That's where I am, and I'm having a blast. I do wish there were more horde, so the battles between SS and TM weren't so lopsided, but it's still a lot of fun.
---
Question: if i were to do this build am I still primarily using a 1h and shield or a 2h at this point?
---
There are plenty of gold sinks outside of re-speccing already.
---
Repairs, flights, vials for potions, ah-deposits.
---
Re-specs are a decent mechanism that stay relevant throughout the life of the entire game.  
---
In terms of fairness if you dont have 1-2 hours a week to put into farming then you should probably either stick to raiding or stick to pvp and not do both, you may not feel it being on the time starved side but part of what makes classic greaT is that you have to work for things.
---
As for not having a farming class, every class has farming potential, people just get too caught up on the min maxing thing, ive had a 60 warlock, rogue, warrior and mage before and ive never struggled to have gold if actively putting time in, hell people are sitting on thousands of gold from level 1 AH toons.
---
The thing that makes wow classic great is that classes have defined roles, specs matter and there is weight to decisions, you are rewarded for the time you put in, things like dual specs or cheap re-specs would end up ruining the classic experience.
---
Gold sinks for character customisation (barber shop), new corpse animations, dances ect would be great, but i wouldnt trust acti-blizz to not turn it into micro transactions, or ruin customization by going over the top with their ideas.  I recently watched a retail video that dam near made my eyes bleed, glowing flying pegasus mount with diablo 2 Tyreal wings on the character, absolutely sickening.
---
They deserve for rolling the dominant faction ;).
---
Initiate pvp whenever possible
---
Just the mats you can already get.
---
maybe he's just an attention whore
---
The current system isn't balanced *at all*. For one class it's a minor annoyance not having the spec they want, for others their class is all but unable to solo even higher level quests.
---
Then you have some classes that can easily farm a shitload of gold vs those that can't. 
---
Basically it's *really* easy to say "just respec" when you only need to factor in an hour to make your money back. What it costs you is not what it costs say, a warrior or a rogue.
---
If you are crafting something for a fee, you're providing a service, an equivalent exchange. That's very different from him simply wanting something from you
---
I will do man thanks. Hopefully I can find people in game to play with
---
Some charakters are just blessed. Ran brd with a 52 Rogue yesterday, he already got HoJ. He must have gotten it on his first run in there :D
---
Congrats!
---
You’re fixated on this name thing. Lots of multibox errs pick a theme for their teams.
---
&gt; They really are just a shadow of the company they once were
---
I hate arguing in favor of companies, but that just isn't true at all. Financially they're doing *very* well. 
---
In fact, only the months leading up to BFA were better for Blizzard than it is right now. And even that might've a lot to do with BFA itself, but I don't know.
---
If you want to go down that route, chain lightning and one shotting someone doesn't take much to press either.
---
If we're being realistic, Rogue has a higher skill cap. That's not a debate. Therefore the answer to OPs question is Rogue.
---
My dps is higher with the hand cannon than with the carapace bow as a dwarf.
---
I've done ST over 15 times since I hit 49. Not only does barely noone run it because it has shit gear, people also hate it because its unnecessarly long without that much exp gain. 
---
Getting a group for BRD is all but impossible because the entrance is camped as all hell and people only want to farm certain bosses for gear, and if you're gearfarming you only bring 60s
---
Did you not read what I said? Few people will have this gear, but there's no reason for them to have it when this did not exist in original vanilla!
---
Oh noes
---
Except those aren't particularly great for tanks.
---
Its about 50% as effective as it was before. It's still a cancer addon but not quite as bad.
---
Hopefully they change more things to lower its functionality.
---
Unless it's the pope himself asking me to tank : whispering me out of nowhere such things like "yo tank needed to brd then gtg" while I'm at the other side of the known universe, I will not ever replay to that, sorry.
---
Show helm with that helm mate xD
---
Sounds dumb as fuck.
---
Report it to Warcraft logs as well. They'll remove those parses. If that's the only reason he's doing it, he'll probably stop.
---
So I've done the strat with putting my alt in group with me and resetting it myself.. Does it teleport you to the front regardless after 5 minutes of log out?
---
More content will be coming for end game as new phases are released. There is plenty to do at 60, most involve long grinds though.
---
Well you’re still behind
---
Thumb up for music. &lt;3 Glitch Mob &lt;3
---
Yeah I don’t really get the answers. Shaman having shit tools and being a shit class doesn’t make them harder to play, it just makes them a shit class with shit tools. It’s like saying it’s harder to play warrior at level 1 because all you have is heroic strike. Just no.
---
Dude your comment is so generic I won't even argue with you, look for a similar comment and you fill find my answer to your comment
---
I just know on our server the price has been trending down for a while now.  Without me buying it, Runecloth was down to as low as 1g per stack recently, vs. no lower than 1.4-1.5g a few weeks ago.
---
Just got my mainhand yesterday. Took me 30 days.. ran it almost daily once or twice. Gz!
---
In retail you absolutely get more loot with the way things work now, and lots of boxers make tons of gold in retail so they can just pay for their accounts, which gets them classic as well.
---
Well, that's fair. I lost 3 rolls for tarnished elven ring now against other hunters. Next tribute run, I will be making sure I am the only one needing it.
---
I understand your point as I guess you never played vanilla, but my expectations are different and that is what actually disappointing me. To be honest I play on the horde side and I am not affected by the ganking issue but it still kills the experience for me (as I experienced something else many years earlier). 
---
Expected vanilla, got a new game which looks like vanilla, easy as that. My problem might be solved if they allow to transfer to PvE servers which they don't.
---
99% guilds wont care :D people are overrating all this blacklist, guildmaster stuff
---
Rogue + shaman = spirit walker
---
Ghost wolf gives stealth, can vanish with ghost wolf
---
Shamans that can use sinister strike to proc WF weapon
---
Stuns and cc that normal shamans are totally missing
---
Still has CL and healing.
---
Haha haha, alliance majority... it’s at best 60:40 H/A.
---
Yes there is a million different things on google but I am not sure on the quality of the information.
---
What about blacksmith? Maybe I can drop it to get herbalism and I can swap herbalism to alchemy after i farm all the herbs for alchemy 1-300 ?
---
No. It wasn’t possible back then.
---
This guild invite is a copypasta that I'm almost certain has shown up in this sub before.
---
??????
---
Why do people think it was a failure
---
It ruins the game. It gives the player way too much power. It's like enabling creative mode in Minecraft.
---
I’m looking to come back, but I’m having a lot of internal strife. I’ve got maybe 3 weeks until I won’t be able to log on for 3 months because of work. I feel like by March next year I’ll be so far behind in the dust it won’t even be funny.
---
Thoughts?
---
&gt; you can kill him in his room too.
---
That would be a game changer for me.
---
a true friend is a criminal?
---
This is honestly gonna be my #1 reference when doing this quest. Thank you for the thorough walkthrough man, you're doing gods work.
---
I mean, you should be able to see if they're casting with CoT on them, right?
---
Tried this twice and failed both times... not worth the risk of essentially ending the run
---
Item Restore?
---
If you spent 16 hours a day on wow you deserve to be a god. Shut up
---
Incredible.
---
That's an interesting unbacked statistic and since all guilds I've contacted concerning shitty behaviour from their members they have handled it rather seriously so I am inclined to disagree with you.
---
In the world of RP, players keep track of what information the character knows. If you use ibformationthe player knows for a character that shouldn't know that I formation,it's called meta-gaming, and it's kind of a big no-no.
---
Just started a warlock, lvl 16. Is there any good macros to know?  
---
And what is a good key to bind /pet attack, /pet stay etc?    
---
Tips anyone? Thanks!
---
I'd do it.
---
I love Night Elfs, just because they are huge and armor looks badass on them 
---
For Horde Tauren or female Orc.
---
What in Elune's name are you on about son
---
That means we haven't even finished week 2 yet!
---
They where xrealm in Classic as well (started with patch 1.12 I think)
---
That's fair. I just recognize a reference in there and wanted to pass it on!
---
Putting that Hunter and Mage on our guilds blacklist, dont want anything to do with those two.
---
Shame this post will be taken down, stuff like this really needs to be a conversation within the community as a whole. I feel like the vast majority of peoples problems with the game so far boils down to lack of respect for other players.
---
Noggenfogger! An amazing realm with cool af people. Alliance dominated late night/early morning then it switches. There’s been a lot of big group pvp but in the last few days 5 man squads have been way more common. Shout out to Joblessrogue and the warr Onmeth, they’re ALWAYS around. Little fucker that Onmeth. 😂
---
I’d recommend holding out until bgs on Dec 10. The world will clear up a lot and I think you might regret moving away from a pvp server (if it’s possible).
---
Druids can do solo tribute runs?? Do you have any videos of this? Do you need to be specced into insect swarm for the dot damage?  
---
Sorry but I'm extremely skeptical but intrigued because I need that damn hammer.
---
I agree, they should add ICC gear with the wotlk values as ranker gear because they do deserve to have 30k+ hp and oneshot anyone for playing that much
---
What?
---
It was kinda fun but constantly being hunted by rogues and mages turns it completely around. I didnt sub to game that is absolutely unplayable. Dungeon farm? Fuck no. I wanted to enjoy the pre cata azeroth and some occasional jumps by enemy players but considering im level 51 im free honor. And its always the rogues and mages. Its like certain type of people plays those classes...  Its either gangbang or level 60 vs me but mostly its those classes.
---
Not in Vanilla you didn’t.
---
When the open up paid transfers most likely.
---
You could always transfer PvP -&gt; PvE, but could never transfer PvE -&gt; PvP.
---
when i played vanilla i played a NE to start, i didn't see my first horde till almost level 30. not uncommon to not see one till sometime in ashenvale.
---
Fake news.
---
How often have you respecced? My priest is up to about 10 or 15g a go now - and my mage is similar. I probably haven't spent more than 50g so far on respeccing (a mere ZF hour, after 3 months).
---
I'm currently raiding on my mage in my AoE farm spec - as are probably most mages I've played with. You can be sure with a 5g or 10g cap, I'd be respeccing weekly to get arcane power for raids.
---
The same on my priest - I'm currently raiding as PI/holy, but with respec caps I would experiment much more with different specs and be spending much more gold on talent changes.
---
All the dungeon blues with most spell damage (not a fan of greens). Crimson felt hat, burial shawl, robe of winter night, skyshroud pants, etc. I think it comes out at around 400 shadow damage, though I put on my PVP set for faster mana regen and sometimes forget to take it off on bosses and it doesn't make that much of a difference.
---
I think it’s been 8 of 8
---
Kinda agree.  I am currently running 11/31/9 on my Hunter becuase it gives me 99% of my raid damage, give me Deterrence and Entrapment for PvP and Imp Revive Pet/Entrap/Deter for DM Trib farming.
---
Not a perfect build for any of the three activities, but good enough that I can more than compete in all 3.
---
Gonna need some more explaining.
---
Why not add a button that causes the other player to die? It's basically the same thing.
---
Uhhh, how do you miss the green guy and the cow during character creation?
---
Transfer PvP -&gt; PvE was available back then, but PvE -&gt; PvP was not allowed.
---
Since Paid transfers are the only Micro transaction planned for classic, pretty good chance it's coming again.
---
And yet we have 20+ minutes delay on chat..
---
The R10 is also updated and most people will be able to obtain that so it’s not as bad as it sounds.
---
Well not true, I wanted vanilla PvP and I know very well what it was like but I got something totally different. You can't blame me for not understanding mega servers as there never have been mega servers in vanilla. Give me the option to switch to PvE and I am fine, but for some reason (which I don't understand) they don't.
---
Sublime sucks.
---
Sounds like you don't particularly want to play either, or at least, not your rogue.
---
What did I just read?
---
I mean it's a specific reference. It's true I can't fully verify their intention, though.
---
????
---
1.12 talents
---
In raids they suck. Otherwise they're fine.
---
That change was to bring it closer to what it was in vanilla, so not exactly a "change" from vanilla.
---
i was new and didn't go through the horde races, but my friends were alliance so that's why
---
Wow that’s a stupid idea.
---
Lok'tar ogar. :)
---
The priest duels a party member. When the target is mc'd the priest attacks their duel target which immediately removes the honorless debuff.
---
&gt; don’t just blame your class.
---
I never blamed my class, I'm just stating an observation. I'm even saying I might be the worst pvp'er on the server. Also I have very little pvp ambition :).
---
Bug reporting is NOT A WASTE OF TIME. Please continue to report bugs through regular channels. Make posts like this as well if you think it's necessary, but STILL REPORT THE BUGS. Bug reporting is a direct channel to QA and the devs, where of you make a post like this it might take time to reach the right people.
---
The fact is, an exploit like this gets rather expensive to pull off rather quickly, and the majority of players are not going to have the means to exploit it, so that's likely why it wasn't prioritized.
---
lol damn that's some really sweet luck dude
---
Which is also a problem, but not to the extent of R14 gear.
---
2h
---
Spent money on devil saur -&gt; went for dal rends.   YIKES.
---
He did. You just kept talking to him like he was a stupid child repeating what everyone already told him, just with a more condescending tone.
---
I got pretty upset because someone needed an item that was a pretty large upgrade for me because he wanted it for his FR set when he hit 60. Didn't say that nor did he equip it after getting it which kind of pissed me off. I called him out on it and we had alittle spat before moving on. I ended up apologizing later for overreacting.
---
What site do you usually use for WoW information?
---
There will always be players who are ahead and behind you - no matter when you start.  If you started at launch, there would still be players ahead of you.  The game is a perpetual treadmill of people continuously cycling through the leveling process.  I have a level 13 alt I was running through the barrens with yesterday, and I'll be damned if it didn't still look like launch was last week.
---
You don't understand the worth of someone's time if you think that people will bother restoring a character that you deleted because of your lack of self control and now you want to play it again.
---
Well I would be very surprised if any alliance character wouldnt have learned about the enemy faction and all its races, which poses a great threat..
---
Mods literally support the fucking up of Classic. Removed my account because I added in "go back to retail" to someone who wants sharding in Classic.
---
Shame we're not on the same server, this would make and excellent addition to anyone's kos list.

6/10 character name isn't Banana
---
In Herod I feel like Alliance does it the most despite being a minority in the server. Aside from occasional Horde raids getting into MC there will always be packs of Alliance players camping the entrance to Blackrock Mountain all the way to BRD or BRS. Horde seems to just not care about WPvP at all.
---
I think it's more about keeping the honor for themselves. Only the priest group gets honor since the others can't tag the target.
---
Pick a dwarf! They can look nasty or fluffy, it all depends on you! They're also short and stout, with a muscular build.
---
Nah, they fetishise animals. That’s not okay.
---
Thank god my "Mind Blasts" as a hunter are on a 0.5 second cast, but then again, yours hit for much more.
---
You're an idiot you need to jump 3x for a long jump it's in the rules.
---
I believe they are breaking the game on purpose. This items? Farming Molten Core like RFC at day one because of the current patch? Lol.
---
That only compares you to those on your faction that did enough PvP to qualify for a rank. It doesn’t count everyone, or even the vast majority.
---
BGs will be as they were in Vanilla and Pservers. Some good experiences and some bad.
---
&gt;Wish classic had better endgame. Feels really stale.
---
We know Blizz's content plan. If you're done with all the loot from MC / Ony, you can take a break until BWL comes out.

Don’t come to kromkrush. It’s bad

Lol, first of all, what I said was a joke. Secondly, I still don’t see any further comments from him, so he seems to have abandoned his claim.

Oh so hiding? Yeah I do that a lot

I'm a noobish druid tank and attempted WC last night. I couldn't really keep aggro with our dps constantly attacking different mobs whether there was a skull or not. It was very frustrating. Am I able to just dps in cat form while doing dungeons going forward?

I've only read that there is no decay in classic at all, do you have a source that there is indeed a respec decay?

If this is Woke I'm going back to bed.

You been using snuff dude?

Ima do things my way, its my way, my way or the highway

Do not use Cdew as a meter of a spec that's considered meme for a reason. Enh in PvP is very RNG. You can delete people, or get kited to oblivion.
---
Like honestly, what did you guys expect though? Not trying to be a dick, but like are you guys new? Did you not expect it to be like this? Did you think it wouldn’t be as bad? 
---
Yeah it’s really fucking annoying. I get annoyed too but that’s the game. I’m alliance on Incendius. Horde have been non stop douches in Searing Gorge, Feralas, Tanaris, Menethil Harbor and every other place my lvl 49 is questing. Half the time they don’t even care for the guards, they’ll gank me in an inn, or right in front of other guards, etc. but that’s the game. Take the death and move on. If it’s too much go level an alt or take a break or something. Like I really don’t know what to tell you. That’s a PvP server for you.
---
honor != ranking points
---
You can do something as a shaman, but it requires heavily outplaying the other person, hence the difficulty.  Also even casting a chain lightning is something that is very easily counterable by most classes.  If we're talking about one-shotting either way, it's just a gear imbalance which has nothing to do with skill.  A class without CC is also more difficult not because something isn't possible, but because in every situation you have to worry about countering what 2+ people are doing instead of pressing a button and removing one of them from the equation.  A fight that for a rogue would involve sap/blinding one person while CC locking the other - on a shaman would involve baiting one person around line of sight walls and timing earth shock interrupts perfectly to keep them from interfering.
---
Not on this scale, now it's like jewish concentration camps
---
All soulbound sorry.
---
Projection is real with you.
---
The fact that he was playing fury at 55 should have been the chief concern, lol.
---
&gt; Honestly, I'd just wish there was a confirmation button before accepting your talents, instead of just slotting them in the moment you click.
---
I know I had an addon for that at some point, but I don't know if it was in vanilla or tbc
---
For those who use the **HonorSpy** addon, how do you change the weekly reset day? I believe the default is Wednesday. The addon notes say it can be changed, but doesn't say how. It's not listed in the options menu and there doesn't appear to be a slash command for it.
---
In my first play through, I was walking towards tarren mill and feeling really scared of the surroundings (I had previously ventured in western plaguelands and got 1-shot there) when I saw a guy fishing and instantly felt relieved.
---
In my mind if the guy was calmly fishing it meant there were no real threats nearby
---
You really need to stop smoking that Doom Weed.
---
It's probably the lack of red tape.
---
Big companies get bogged down by bureaucracy and finances while volunteers are doing as little or as much as they want.
---
Also for the matter of lag in world pvp, it's very likely that classic is shackled to retail's sharding/phasing technology, except modified to have only one shard per zone (i.e. elwynn, westfall, durotar, ashenvale, etc) instead of evenly distributing 400 players across 20 shards (or whatever)
---
[It's entirely possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPJ0AB12h1I) that either the server hardware or software (or even both) is set up in such a way that specializes it for handling extensive sharding because whenever they last upgraded it they didn't anticipate ever going back to a design philosophy that enabled more than 40~50 people to see each other at the same time.
---
An amateur server wouldn't be likely to run that kind of specialized tech so it wouldn't run into that kind of issue.
---
And if such an amateur server did run into such an issue, they would be free to tackle it whenever/however they want once they obtain the money, where-as a large corporation would have to run it by half a dozen suits before they even think about presenting the suggestion to the board responsible for deciding whether or not it should be presented to the board responsible for greenlighting the paperwork required for presenting it to the board responsible for allocating funding.
---
I'll havet to get another one to show you exactly, but it is above the room with the dead quest on the molten span.
---
Acutally extremely good for enhance in dungies and raid and absolutely close to bis if you ever wana go elemental
---
Perhaps you should read
---
Which church do you go to?
---
Yes, have you tried marking targets? I find dps at lower levels need a bit of direction. Try marking the target you have the most aggro on for them to burn.
---
Well, looking forward to playing The Burning Crusade then. 
---
I wouldn’t mind earlier releases if they were scheduled. Now, a bluepost might change your plans big time.
---
"avoid being outnumbered"
---
like....how? it's not not 3 people in a party or something it's an entire fucking raid group.
---
Dont think RP player would use "lol". Could legitimately be new to the game.
---
I got someone guild kicked before for stealing a chest in a lowbie zone, people care
---
I just disagree with this what is the point of versatility if it’s locked behind a paywall? Hybrid classes exist with a number of other trade offs, but if you’re going to lock it behind 100g a week paywall you might as well not even be a hybrid class.
---
Just earlier today they had 3 massive alliance guilds transfer over from Faerlina and destroy balance
---
Spellpower and stam...thats all that really matters. stam/int until mid30s-40 then start stacking spellpower stam
---
I see you’re poking your orc pee pee.
---
In private servers I believe it could drop the lightsaber but haven't seen it confirm in classic yet

TBC will be 10x the Horde tilt. It's not even close. The racials are insane, fear ward is baseline so imagine an UD priest with fear ward too, lol.  Yeah. Count me out of that shit show.

Calm down princess and read the op again “EVEN if they were going to sell the accounts....”
---
Meaning nothing was assumed
---
Maybe don't passive aggressively criticize someone's logic and immediately follow it up with a non-argument.
---
It’s a really rough point. I think most people who PvP want a fair chance to pvp. Getting ganked by geared 60’s when you’re level 40 is a poor definition of PvP. 
---
When people roll on a PvP server, they want to be fighting their peers. They don’t want to be getting camped by players that clearly out level them. Again, i know this is part of a PvP server environment. But there’s a VERY clear difference in getting ganked in a driveby in STV, and getting corpse camped for 3 hours at a Searing Gorge flight point.
---
I appreciate you. I never go out of my way to kill a cow-person, as you guys pretty cool. Orcs and zombies are dead, but cowfolk I'll never initiate against.
---
Sure, my point is that I think you're wrong. You can think wotlk zones were "awful to navigate" and I can think the exact opposite. I thought they were fine to navigate and are you really going to argue that, as one example, Howling Fjord was not "connected with" "Grizzly Hills"? That makes no sense at all. Not only were the zones directly physically connected, they both shared the same aesthetic, with Grizzly being a little higher level and a little darker because it was closer to Icecrown, the center of the Scourge.
---
Furthermore, flying has certainly had negative effects on the game, but you seem to forget that you couldn't fly most of the way through leveling, so you had to navigate wotlk zones by ground. And people did that plenty. And I look forward to reliving this when blizz rolls up some wotlk servers.
---
Nothing to say? No, I have plenty to say, we just don't agree buddy.
---
I'm sorry but import an image and trace with illustrator is not going to impress anyone, the backdrop is way to pixelated and the lich king in the back does not make any sense. Also, it's different drop-shadow on "Paladin" and "IN THE NAME OF...". The whole poster seems like a school project, please, apply yourself.
---
Much love for us Pagle Alliance 😎
---
Go elemental. Have more fun (thanks spell batching!).
---
As mentioned, enhance is way too RNG.
---
Yeah it really doesn't seem too terribly hard to just slap an error handler onto every mob and call it a day. It's probably not that simple sadly. 🍝
---
Nah I know the reference. But still not taking that bet haha
---
Guess ill mount from iron forge and run to epl.  Oh wait that's camped too, guess I'll fly to hillsbrad, camped and raided.
---
How much you value each stat in gear.
---
For example, if you assign a 2 to stamina and a 1 to spirit, a gear piece with 20 Stam 20 spirit will have a score of 20*2 + 20*1 = 60.
---
When suggesting gear, the app will start with the highest scored gear based on your puntuation
---
Yet ironic you saw “sell accounts”, and shut off yours as well in your hurry to win the internet, if you were to read the op starting with “even if”
---
a fully geared prot warrior "CAN" be a FC but a druid is simply better
---
Same, I have never had any problems when dealing with other players, and other players never had a problem dealing with me when it came to crafting things and transmuting arcanite, we all just trust that both parties are trustworthy and if not then Blizzard will handle it. This thread will make me think twice because it seems like Blizzard doesn't give a single shit about Classic players.
---
Cracked out
---
You're the one ignoring the "entire composition."  You're missing the fact that hit becomes very hard to shed once you have raid BiS pieces.  You get 2% hit from LH, 1% from Onyxia neck, 1% from Onslaught (I have all of these).  2% from Devilsaur means you need to drop hit from bracers, rings, boots, or range slot is either wasted on 2H or diminished in the case of dw fury warriors.
---
Bracers have options, ranged can use Blastershot.  We haven't seen a QSR drop in 8 weeks, so I'm not holding out for one any time soon.  There arent great non-hit options beyond for boots (Bloodmail boots are best pre-raid).  Coupled with the fact that the other options for shoulders are mediocre, BDS starts looking much better.  There's nothing awkward at all about using it.
---
I have Devilsaur, too (and it cost me more to make than BDS did early server due to mafia stuff).  It served its purpose, but with gear BDS is just an overall damage increase.  It might be minor, but so are most things in this game.  Minor things add up.  You keep saying "Devilsaur is better" but if you actually sim it, optimal BDS beats any optimal Devilsaur set by the same amount as Onslaught beats Brigham/Girth... which is considered the biggest damage increase out of raids.  It isn't an either or... they're both craftable or purchasable on the AH and worth crafting for gearing options.
---
Not to mention a 43 free FR isn't useless and helps in every available raid.  I regularly resist knockback on Ragnaros which keeps my uptime higher (and thus increases my DPS), and it helps keep me alive and makes the healers jobs easier on 20-man Ony.
---
Is it going to last forever?  Not at all... but for the cost, it is well worth it, if you're gearing properly.  I've spent more on more temporary upgrades.
---
roflmao*
---
I guess this would depend on your server economy but alchemy doesn't really make you money. If you could reliably just buy mats on the AH and instantly turn them into a product that is worth more, all the alchemists would do it and saturate the market. The way you would turn a profit this way would be to buy herbs when they're cheap and sell potions when they sell for a lot (like on raid day or the day before raid day).  But even then you could theoretically just do the same thing with the herbs without being an alchemist at all. There ARE however transmutes that could make you a gold or two every now and then but I haven't really made any good money that way so far.
---
If you look at it the other way: If you're a herbalist you're going to be running around gathering herbs. MOST of your time is spent running between nodes and hoping for the node to spawn just as you pass. Adding mining on top of that is just extra cash for nearly no extra effort. Granted, most of the money you make from mining will be from rich thorium veins and the odd arcanite crystal.
---
I'd say neither herbalism or mining is particularly 'chill' though since you are constantly competing with other players, but that's why they make you money. As for how many other players there are, this will depend on your server population and when you can go. I usually do a few runs around 7 am before I go to work and often manage to pick the odd black lotus and a stack or so of some other herbs that's worth decent money.
---
Why are you tanking with a 2.8 speed weapon?
---
Just circling back, the observation based warnings are now going out to players from Blizzard GMs.
---
Meh. As someone who played a ton of BC, I was looking forward to world pvp and vanilla raiding. Wpvp is something that was literally released just to kill off not even a month mater
---
Mindless rambling much?
---
I am leveling my character and this Taure was riding right in my direction. 
---
A quick /sleep and playing dead made him ignore me. Good guy Taure.\^\^\^\^
---
Or even the items like edgemaster gloves.
---
Deviate Delight
---
You seem to lack some hit% and or weapon skill to go dual-wield yet. The requirements are higher on dw which is why 2h fury performs better if you don't have the gear yet.
---
Rage generation is highly affected by your flurry uptime which is increased by crit chance.
---
OK but the guy you replied that to basically told you he's finnish.
---
Some quests are locked behind cooking skill(like the wolf kebob quest in darkshire for alliance) this change didn't happen until cataclysm, there was no quests locked behind cooking skill in real vanilla.  
---
Dungeon set glove being BoE already. This didn't happen until AQ patch in real vanilla. Only belt and bracers were BoE until then.
---
he gets 5x the amount of quest gold which does really add up after 60
---
also he can 1 shot basically everything. a 5 boxing warlock with 5 pets could literally non stop pull for basically forever
---
How many hours per week on avg will it take to reach 11 on a server with around 2k population? I finish school the days bgs are released so I have about 4 weeks of free time. Just wondering what kind of time-investment this will be!
---
Rly? Ok I that both where not allowed.
---
Wow that trash hunter is triggering.  Like why! 
---
Upvote for visibility, hope The server’s community comes together and blacklist this kid
---
Good, fuck this shit game lmao we want A R E N A
---
Weak auras can track this nicely, downloaded it last night and it starts a 1hour countdown everytime you reset. Giving you a visual countdown for all resets.
---
I also believed it was 5per hour at 12mins until I got the weakaura add on, which starts on first instance reset
---
Congratulations!  This was me last night so I know the feels.
---
I report botters only from my faction. The opposite faction botters are nice free honor, since you almost always know where to find them every day :D But they are disappering over time, so I would say bans are being handed out.
---
I did that from start of the first expansion till Classic :)
---
i get killed on my alt and i just shake my head. im lvl 35 im not worth honor 
---
i /golfclap them die and then runback and go about my day
---
It's rare yes, but only tanks use them, and there are only really 2-3 tanks per guild so really it's not all that many.
---
They mismanaged it totally. The initial name reservation with only a handful of servers fucked everything. All the dead servers they created afterwards achieved nothing. You cannot move entire guilds easily.
---
It sounds like you demand a much better product, idk prices on this matter but the content can be as lackluster as possible and sell.
---
Although, I also wonder of how the copyright works with images from a game.
---
Idk bout you but I destroy any clothes, especially mages as a enh shaman. Rogues are my biggest difficulty due to evasion. Warriors are even sided. Hunters are a pain. Warlocks are terrible if I don't get close to them/ unfeared. Paladins are just a nuisance lol
---
Wow.... So when you're attacking Zevrim, and you get him into that one spot where you're hiding behind the pillar, does he just path away from you when you duck behind the pillar?  Or are you doing something to make him run away from you?  I'm asking because I'm trying to work out if this is possible on a hunter - or if you're using a priestly ability that I dont have access to.
---
Not a guild in the world would care.
---
Druids mages and rogues are all better fcs
---
I’ll give a pass on trolls as monsters, the accent is fantastic.
---
I bought the book with 160g on Gehennas, it cost about 250g in AH. Fucked up the first Ony and died before i could place the sword in Phase 3..
---
I ran into Broken Tooth about 3 weeks ago whilst questing there on my main, and as I was about to tame a 60 hunter came with proper raiding gear and asked if he could take instead so I passed... Has more use of it than me..
---
I got the 13 fire thorns trinket from Rag on my paladin, went to farm lashers and on my first two runs I got the same epic dagger as you and a Destiny. Paladins unite in our luck!
---
can we just ban the word woke
---
Quested in peace? There was a lot of pvp going on before p2, p2 probably increased the pvp, but STV was a fucking war zone when I levelled through it.
---
So about the Rez in raid or dungeon. It takes the same cast time as a portal, but does not require the 20 silver reagent. So let’s say you pay me 80 silver, as I will let you spare more of your very valuable time.
---
Oh and about the mob the warrior is tanking. It means no dmg to you so less fees. Hum plenty of money.
---
Oh and about that heal to let you spare more time during regen...
---
I would tell him to fuck off in the most colorful way possible that would most likely result in my ban
---
&gt; Round up a whole hallway with chain-lightnings, rockbiter autos, then drop a magma totem and GG spam heals in between more chain lightnings.
---
Won't chain lightning take forever to cast with all those mobs hitting you?
---
looks like you got fucked owned bish
---
Dirt nasty editing?
---
Yeah, I know. But it's a goal atleast :)
---
there have been a few cases that seem like blizz could do something but dont want to, in Vanilla i saw multiple ninjas dealt with by GMs, the stance now is there is game systems in place so you have to deal with it in game.
---
Scamming was dealt with in the past not this "sorry its a risk in game" fuck that if the system doesn't guard against scamming, which it doesn't, then they should deal with it
---
So common, top 90 or so on my server got rank 4 lol. Out of several thousand. REALLY COMMON bro!
---
Since an MCd target is considered your pet, this might/should work anyway. Haven’t tested myself, but I would assume that it does.
---
I'd say around 3/4 hours per day (probably more on the week end) for 3 months, but the system is kind of tricky, it also depends on how much people pvp on your server/faction. But the further you are in the ranking, the more you need to play. You usually end up knowing who are the people trying to rank

The way this was handled by Blizzard is actually incredibly disturbing. One of the only reasons trades like this are even possible within the game is because it comes with the idea in mind where the crafter can be severely punished if they try to steal mats and run. Historically I believe Blizzard would straight up ban people that do this. Without this type of punishment potential in place you can be certain that this type of behavior will only increase in frequency and piss a lot of people off in the process.
---
Ah missed that last part, good to know, thanks.
---
MC still would have been taken down in greens even if we weren't on this patch. None of MC is hard, at all, ever. AOE mage meta is in no fault due to blizzard, nor is fury tanking. You want vanilla, but not real vanilla. You want the vanilla that you remember through your rose tinted glasses.
---
isboxer is a game in itself
---
doubt
---
There are two reasons people do it. Some do it for fun and others do it because that's how dedicated they are to the game.
---
Someone in my guild multi boxes 5 characters also, right now he has 5 mages, warlocks and hunters all with mooncloth or transmute for arcanite bars (mainly the bars), a few are still only lvl 35. So he gets enough free money every day to no longer farm gold for your average needs. Now imagine how much gold he can farm per hour with x5 mages. Obviously this guy has more IRL money than he does time to invest into making money in-game.
---
Well not all Forsaken are evil, just main Forsaken society.
---
holy shit, that was painful to watch
---
so many bad hunters in the same clip :D
---
I assume most of these people crafting it are just buying gold and buying ingots from other players.
---
Good guide. There is a weakaura that can track this, it's worked 100% for me.
---
Wear a shield, and gear with stamina. Equip your 2h when you're actually attacking. It helps a lot in surviving the initial stun lock. Oh and use plate.
---
&gt; I specifically mention UBRS and Scholo, as they both have gear people farm for, and **the tanks usually get their gear very fast** and will "finish" these dungeons after 1 or 2 runs.
---
Hahahahaha.
---
It took me 3 runs to simply see a Draconian Deflector drop. Took another 2 before I won it. Haven't gotten any other sizable drops from there.
---
Hmm, well that's good to know. But I wonder how much movement is needed to prevent this. I could also make a short script which moves you forward and backward every few minutes.
---
I play gnome but i love Taurens
---
Lol noice.
---
I wonder how many people will know what != means :D I think you overestimated this sub :D
---
Warriors never Respec from fury to arms unless for pvp throughout vanilla.
---
Why is 48 wished for?
---
Lol wut? How?
---
That is completely untrue. I got COD scammed in vanilla and they returned my gold. CS has been shit across all Blizzard games since they purged staff a while back.
---
Right. Anyone that put the work in got it lol. That is very common especially with you do some research and realize how much it thins out at high ranks! Get some knowledge dropped!
---
I'm just having fun with photoshop. The paladin in the front is actually a screenshot of my pala, which I editted, dunno if that violates any copyright.   
---
I put it on a poster website because people requested it on my last post. 
---
Lich King is in the back because Arthas was a paladin before all the frostmourne business, just thought it was fun.
---
I'm pretty sure being "the best" in anything includes following the rules.
---
who are "Them"
---
Thanks,
---
That's not fucking true at all
---
Horde will go gank, yes. But not in Ungoro, not in Silithus, not in Tanaris. It will boil down to zones located in the vicinity of Horde Capital cities. Such as WPL/EPL, Winterspring, maybe a little Blackrock due to HS to kargath.
---
I noticed atlas loot says these will come out in p6, but I don't think that's correct?
---
On the other hand, wtf cares. It's a lvl 13 dungeon. At that level, every gear in a dungeon is an upgrade for everyone, so everyone and his mother can roll need on green crap for all I care. And yes, that means that clothies get the shaft when the leather+ players (druid/pally/hunter) roll on it. That +2sta +2int item is better than their white lvl 5 crap.
---
Think I'm way above hit cap. Im at 9% with 305 wep skill. My real problem I'm guessing is that im using mirahs MH and dal OH?
---
Di molto
---
Just keep hitting maul and have dps focus on a target.  If they each dps a mob, good luck.  I had a ZF group do this to me while I was tanking ZF a few weeks back on my Druid and it was hopeless keeping aggro.  Druids make excellent tanks, just go up the feral talent tree.  Invest in the talent that increases your rage by 5 every time you get a crit and the one that gives you more aggro in bear form.  That will be helpful in your ability to spam maul and keep aggro.
---
Let me know if he ever answers.
---
Leveling my hunter BM (currently 32) and since WPvP is rampant (not complaining) I’ve been using The Rake my main pet during PvE content since I never know when a fight is gonna break out and I also want to keep his level up with mine. Since his damage is faster than other pets at 1.2 he’s great for PvP but dies constantly when I take on more than 1 mob in PvE. My long drawn out question is, should I stick with my cat for potential PvP and decent DPS or am I wasting more time having to constantly revive and feed my pet and should stick with a tank pet like a boar or turtle?
---
Also, I’m seeing conflicting things about how things were in classic/vanilla. Does Gamorrah from BFD actually have slightly better armor or does their stats equalize after training them?
---
I see what you did
---
I have a guildie with the same name and until I saw the guild name, thought it might be him.
---
His main is a shaman named Shammydavis. Now only if he could come up with a good pun for Dean Martin, then the rat pack would be complete.
---
If it were 250g on my server I’d buy it in a heartbeat, wow.
---
Like others have said 25 mins is nothing, I've waited over 3 hours when I used to play on Faerlina. Go do some chores around the house you've been slacking on, go for a quick run, etc.
---
I hate them!
---
Migraine is nice active UK server, I could help you out there... Need to make my lvl19 twink 😍
---
&gt; How are the most uninformed people always the most vocal ones?..
---
Idk you should just try to educate yourself before posting so your not in those ranks so often. 0.8% is still incredibly common when you learn how few will keep ranking up. Rank 6 is nothing in the grind. You should google "high warlord" and read up, it will blow your mind.
---
whatever you want it to be. worth is determined by you, value by the price it sells for
---
Well, a relatively advanced LFG addon existed in Vanilla and the ClassicLFG plugin got shit on to high heaven. There was a full-fledged fishing bot as an addon back in Vanilla as well. 
---
Funny, how no one cries about TSM being identical to the BFA version, though.
---
Right. Obviously the top 90 who played the most got it. They put in the work. That doesnt make it common tho. Common has to relate to something else more common or less common. In this situation it's not common. There is your knowledge dropped lol.
---
Huh? I'd like for my guild to consist of non-pieces-of-shit, but you do you I guess
---
Blizzard is so full of shit. I can’t believe they don’t have your back on this....
---
At least it's not as bad as disengage.
---
Isn't accountability and server reputation literally one of the main points people hype about Vanilla/Classic?
---
But he wasn't naked =-/ still had his pvp trinket, rings, neck, and essentially everything that won't show up with a graphic equipped.... 
---
He's good at pvp but I honestly can't believe this is even an entertained debate... 
---
Rogue by far is pretty much designed to be a PvP monster, while shaman is one misstep away from catastrophe... If the rogue makes an error he can.... still just use 5 other options to cc.
---
Which is that?
---
And theres a flirt that says "show me your dick"?
---
I -hunter- passed it for a clothie caster. However, I did roll need on the illusory rod, which was a sick upgrade at that time for me. The caster in the group was 31, so he would have to wait 3 or 4 levels anyway to actually wield it.
---
There's nothing to do in the game between raids. I can be social with my guild mates between raids by playing other games where there is stuff to do.
---
Icy Veins has outdated information on class guides, but the raid guides are good.
---
The 3 times I made a ticket I got 3 automated answers that had absolutely NOTHING to do with what was in the ticket. Every time they marked it as ''solved'' themselves and I couldn't reply to it...
---
You would be lucky to hit R4 with only 15k honor
---
The blue PVP gear has updated values as well - even shit players can obtain this gear. In that respect, anyone (even if they are shit) can put in a modicum of time and have reasonably good gear. If anything I hope that this stimulates some actual sick premade vs. premade.
---
Anyone who literally can't put in the time to get R8-10 gets a /shrug from me
---
Blizzard didn't spend 18 months of dev time on classic, that is clearly evident by how the game plays. They have continually done the absolute minimum possible to launch and support classic even despite the fact that it is their most played product at the moment. Yes, servers have a cost to host this many users, however Blizzard has also done a woefully inadequate job of managing them properly leading to a poor experience for everyone.
---
60
---
‘While he didn’t deserve that yet, he will someday soon’
---
all the serious rankers will do it, trust me.
---
Yes this is why they're rushing through the Classic content patches. Classic progression needs to be all wrapped up before Shadowlands comes out so their plan to get everyone to jump over works.
---
if they took 6th grade math they should know what that means
---
I don't have a source, but I can confidently say with experience that it does indeed decay at a rate of 5g/month. I was fury spec for some farming at the end of October and respecced fury/prot for raid, and it cost me 35g, raising the cost to spec again to 40g. A week later, now in November, I went to spec deep prot, realizing that it was superior for current content, and it cost 35g again. So it had decayed by 5g during the transition from October to November.
---
Dude you just fly from point a to b skip all world interactions and are untouchable in air .People hated that and wanted world pvp which is why they tried limiting it after
---
No. #nochanges
---
When we were grinding for rank 11+ yes, we did this. We flew to Kargath and killed horde there, until our queue popped.
---
When we weren't, we didn't do this.  I'm not saying people WON'T. I'm just saying there will be LESS people that do this, because after a few times of flying somewhere, to maybe find someone to kill, it becomes kinda a chore. This is coming from someone who played on the dominant faction who was grinding for a rank (albeit vanilla).
---
When your queue pops you are also GONE from the world, for 15-20 mins. That's a respite enough for someone to get OUT the flight path area versus choke pointing and hanging around in rez distance. 
---
Remember that the Alliance that PvP will most likely be instaqueued in BGs so there will also be less overall people to kill in the world.
---
There was a dude recruiting for a furry guild in Barrens chat for a few days on Benediction.
---
His copy/pasta wasn’t sexualized, but it was f-ing weird.
---
On the other hand, he wasn’t hurting anyone or being a dick. I’d rather see a harmless weirdo than half the political or mean spirited shit that’s usually in Barrens chat
---
Bgs are being rushed out next week. OP missed a lot of the memorable parts of vanilla, including WPvP. By the time they hit 60 theyll likely have missed BWL phased too.
---
This is the definition of “Some people just want to watch the world burn.”
---
To echo what this guy says, not only can you take a break. You **should** take a break if you are mostly interested in endgame  and BG’s don’t catch your attention. A lot of people feel like they’ll be punished if they stop their sub and come back later. I recommend it highly as it’s easy to get burnt out in this game.
---
Warlock here - how do I update my macro to dynamically state the zone name I'm in? I've seen some macros say things like "Summoning \[name\] to Onyxia's Lair." Any ideas how to do that?
---
You're an idiot lmao
---
It gets better. But here are a few tips to make the experience less horrible:
---
1. Use marks (Skull-&gt;Cross-&gt; etc)
---
2. Use feral talents to increase threat generation.
---
3. Spam swipe :)
---
It's crazy because this post is essentially the average IQ of most wow players
---
Well since it's the fastest attack speed pet in the game i don't think anyone would kill that majestic beast.
---
My guild has kicked members for similar stuff. If someone had a video of a hunter griefing other hunters trying to get BT, I'm pretty sure every hunter in the guild would be telling them to fuck off and demanding they get kicked. We have to fight for spots, hunters aren't in the minority; and people who are shitty to non-guild members will eventually be shitty to guild members as well.
---
If your guilds wouldn't care about guild members making their guild look bad, then it sounds like you aren't in a very good guild.
---
Maybe this dipshit has never played Super Mario 64
---
I love how people show their faction bias in these kinds of posts. Every faction has this issue somewhere, just not all servers are awfully imbalanced like yours.
---
Thanks for the reply and i’m happy that others have similiar comments. Have a good day!
---
How has the honor grind been for the Horde on Horde dominated servers? Asking for Horde replies...is ranking more cutthroat than you all thought?
---
Thanks, this is one of those times where anecdotal evidence is enough.
---
Then you’re not really the MT but thanks for the obnoxious response to a simple question.
---
Apologies, I wasn't aware of the origin of that term,  
---
Thanks for learning me dude :)
---
Yeah what is the server cap these days?
---
Uh...even the opening monologues after character creation set your character up as just a nobody. So we are exactly butchers and bakers.
---
*gnome. Fuck gnomes
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk
---
Sure, it's common courtesy to let the group know when joining.. "I'm doing this to get HOJ.. I'm healing this because you guys needed a healer."  If they aren't ok with it up front deal with it then is the best time.  But that doesn't mean being a shaman healer excludes you from getting dungeon dps gear.  The difference between a dungeon and a raid is that you can run the dungeons infinite times.  If you didn't get your drop you just run again.  If a shaman needs HoJ they should roll on it.  MS &gt; OS works too but you can't define someones main spec by what role they are currently performing.  If you never let tanks or healers roll on dps gear you might find that there are less of them willing to go.  That's what they want from there and they are just performing a role to help the group.
---
Hunter damage is static and doesn't change based on gear (besides AA dmg) but warlocks sets get better and better giving more damage to their abilities
---
I've almost exclusively tanked in retail, and I found tanking in Classic to be very frustrating. Aggro is hard to generate and the DPS I've ran with were completely aimless.
---
Respecing to SL for the drop of honor was fun. You could pinpoint the panic reaction as they blow everything and you're still at 75%hp. SL isn't honestly too great right now but most people aren't nearly geared for pvp so I had a few ganks where I texted waiting for the dots to kill them.
---
Would be nice if WCL would look and see what the max +healing someone could have rn is. Then invalidate logs that are over that number.
---
Alert: 0 math below all numbers are arbitrary
---
Like if its +788 which would make renew tick for 240 then any renew ticks submitted on logs over say 250 would be auto removed. 
---
Nothing would make me more mad than to get a true 100 but have it show up as 99 bc i didnt exploit.
---
So you didn't actually beat the fight and are talking down to people who did because they didn't do it in a way you like? lol
---
No, it most definitely isn't.
---
Probably more like Macintosh Apples versus Honeycrisp apples...
---
The mechanics aren't that drastically difference throughout classic man. It isn't they they reworked talents and skills mid expansion. They tweaked and balanced AP and others as well.
---
You have to give me some type of example on how the mechanics are so drastically difference it became a different game altogether.
---
This is infuriating because when it happened to me during BC and I got all of my matts back within 24 hours. Anytime you made a ticket you'd get an answer within 24 hours, most of the time it was within hours of making it and a GM would actually chat to you directly. 
---
Nowadays on classic when you open a ticket you get to wait 48 hours to get a canned response that has nothing to do with the ticket...
---
Th..thanks you too
---
This is incorrect.  Deep frost is useful in some respects (mostly Onyxia) due to Ice Block and Ice barrier, but for optimal dps, you spec down arcane to Arcane Power and then down frost. With this build, you miss out on all the key slowing and freezing aspects of a frost build that make it great for farming.
---
That said, even an arcane/frost mage is superior to a dps warrior for farming.
---
Pally &gt; Shammy 100%
---
i could see that happening. As far as i know, I've only seen the one mage using that line, but then again, i never hang out in IF very long. Get my shit and go go go
---
Warrior getting angry losing Spinal Reaper (rolled vs 2 others).
---
"I should get that item because I've wanted it for 2 months" (classic had only been out for 2 months at the time).
---
This is infuriating because when it happened to me during BC and I got all of my matts back within 24 hours. Anytime you made a ticket you'd get an answer within 24 hours, most of the time it was within hours of making it and a GM would actually chat to you directly.
---
People say its never too late but in reality it is no different than other expansions. Many people rushed and blizzard is catering to them. At this point you missed the most memorable parts of vanilla. World PvP is being killed next week so thats it.
---
Just set your afk or dnd tag with thanks but not tanking right now / today and go about the warrior way smashing mobs. They'll see / get the auto response.
---
I was even ready to give it to him at some point just to not waste it, maybe he could have seen some hope in my gesture and offer to help me get next? I dunno i'm not reasoning like that
---
I'm not even a hunter main and it would be impossible for me to kill it, its my faction... If he is not going to be decent i'm not going to lower myself to his lvl and feed this behavior
---
I run a guild on felstriker and I can tell you that while the community is small there's generally no problem finding people to play with.
---
I prefer the smaller server over arugal because you get to know everyone.
---
Lock doesn't rely on pet as heavily for dmg as hunter. Infact the defacto raiding lock spec currently doesn't even keep a pet active and out and instead sacks it for a dmg bug.
---
Because that would at least justify the gank for some gain as they get honor. Below that and it's just to be a dick. 
---
Had a buddy this week say he stopped leveling his alt at 48 because he was no longer ignored by the gank squads
---
Because its BiS for most of classic for enhance and you'll likely never see it drop again.
---
That's absolutely not the case. Anyone who's played retail WoW at basically any point over the last 15 years would have seen the massive ban waves and there glorious schadenfreude of the botters crying on their cheating forums.
---
Pet damage means nothing. Especially for warlocks that will never attack with their pet.
---
*that guy who show up to conversations about a certain theme and Claims to be the exception to the rule”
---
You can do DME lashers as resto no problem.
---
As a resto shaman i make a lot of my money just spamming instances and with professions. (Currently make at least 8g a day just for my alch transmute) Also make money picking herbs and fishing/cooking. 
---
Hell, shamans heal fine as 30/0/21 anyways.
---
Plenty of stuff you can do to get gold together.
---
Yep. Just dot, coil if i have to, walk away from them. Cool guys don't look at explosions.
---
Worse thing you could do is ask people for their anecdotal evidence. Hyperbole is unreal when it comes to this. Better to just play it yourself and see what it’s like on your server, at your play times, at your level, in the areas you decide to play in.
---
Have full cleared ony and Mc 5 weeks now, havent recieved a single epic yet haha. In all that time only 4 priest items have dropped. Meanwhile the lvl 56 pally we carried through Mc is just waiting to ding 60 to wear his 3 pieces of lawbringer lol. Rng is such a cruel mistress sometimes.
---
when I was 41 in STV, I saw a ?? Warrior on his mount (60% mount). As I passed him with my mount, I /spit on him. He turned around and chased me for 15 minutes all the way to booty bay. I was spam yelling "guards help me" all the way, was hilarious
---
bur
---
AV and WSV
---
I can't hear you over the sound of drain life. You have to cry louder.
---
&gt; Meanwhile dps classes can only dps, and will have harder times finding dungeon groups, but Ill never really need to respec. 
---
That is so not true even pure classes have to respec for raid dps, pvp, farming...
---
So in 5 runs you got the most important item out of UBRS? And how many runs do the fury warriors and combat sword rogues do to get dal'rends?
---
Everyone's luck is different, but 5 runs to get an item is trivial, and tanks usually have no competition (UBRS you only compete with your offtank). That's what he's saying. Though 1-2 runs is a bit low, tanks do have less runs to do to get geared than other classes.
---
&gt;both get full honor
---
This is the only part of this that makes it an exploit, imo.  If you want to MC and duel at a flight point to deny your faction honor that doesn't really bother me.  Get good, other players.  It's not really impacting your ability to play the game, all it is doing is taking away from your ability to gank people right when they land at a flight point.. oh no let me tell you how much I care about your honor.
---
Guilt by association
---
&gt;Sure, my point is that I think you're wrong. - "awful to navigate"
---
Icecrown / storm peaks were patched together from weird platforms with limited access by land, and those were the zones people mostly spent their time on max level. It is true it wasn't so bad at "Boring tundra", but Howling Fjord had began these weird cliffs here and there which felt like continuity of that mess of a Blade's edge mountains. Grizzly hills was probably the best zone which balanced accessibility.
---
&gt;Not only were the zones directly physically connected, they both shared the same aesthetic, with Grizzly being a little higher level and a little darker because it was closer to Icecrown, the center of the Scourge.
---
Ahahahaha, yeah that's probably the reason why crystal song forest was so dark and gloomy because it was even closer to ICC.
---
&gt;Furthermore, flying has certainly had negative effects on the game, but you seem to forget that you couldn't fly most of the way through leveling, so you had to navigate wotlk zones by ground.
---
You seem to forget it was possible to reach max level through not moving at all from capital via dungeon finder.
---
&gt;Nothing to say? No, I have plenty to say, we just don't agree buddy.
---
Good attempt but you brought nothing to the table.
---
Isn't it like 2 weeks ago since they introduced faction-only transfers?
---
top kek, so true
---
Horde are superior in numbers on every server. After P2 came out the game is almost unplayable as alliance. No matter which dungeon it is there will be horde camping you all the way untill the entrance portal. It usually takes 30-60 minutes getting into DM for example and BRM is even worse. I dont understand why horde keeps doing this cuz i know many players who have already quit because its getting too much and you will end up having to queue for hours to get into a bg
---
Whenever you get close to the wall he tries to run around the middle of the room for some reason.
---
this is deep
---
Damn what a shame. Oh well, they're worth like 6g each to vendor, that's enough to buy a green axe.
---
The good ol days where people wore wizard hats and robes
---
This is taking advantage of a bug (since you and the one you're dueling both get full honor, no one else can get any), not exploiting intended mechanics of the game
---
Guess I made the right choice by picking horde on sulfuras. Sometimes horde dominates, sometimes alliance dominates
---
I can actually say that lol. My retail account is separate from my classic account, and has an inactive sub since January '19. Classic account has zero retail characters. Yeah the money is pooled, but they absolutely keep statistics about who is playing what version and for how long.
---
Atlasloot assumed like a lot of people that since this gear was updated to match the power level of naxx gear that it wouldn't exist before phase 6. This has been confirmed to not be the case.
---
Your entire premise is that rogues could do things in and old patch, and therefore are broken forever.
---
Both classes are very hard to master.
---
How long are AV matches in this patch of AV. I'd really like to try and win a match for the xbow reward but not sure how much time i can really commit. Any one know how long they last?
---
Kromcrush rarely ever has a queue time.
---
Not sure if it is BIS for Level 19 twinking.
---
Either way I would hold onto it at least until BG's are out.
---
I did run number 104 last night and only just now got my offhand. I lowkey hate you.
---
If respecs were cheaper, some classes might farm more, which would put more gold in the economy.
---
I've done solo Mara, DM: North and BRD Arena. Kited boss adds in MC and so on, I've done my part. I got the jist of it in my first fight and when the other hunters there need numerous attempts to clear it (even with curse), you can bet your ass I'll take the free ticket. You can be a hypocrite and still be against cheating.
---
Way to completely destroy any legitimate argument you may have by resorting to extreme hyperbole.
---
Already have a 300 engineer (hunter).
---
Mother of God
---
You'll have a bad time into hardcore premade teams, but most servers have enough population where you won't run into the same ones back to back.
---
Prevention is part of it, but enforcement is equally important and in some cases better, as it doesn't have collateral damage.  
---
Think of it like a speeding problem.  You could put a speed bump in the road, and that might slow some people down, but someone who habitually speeds down that road will just adjust to it or speed down another street, and it doesn't prevent that behavior elsewhere.  It also hinders people who aren't causing problems.  However, start handing out tickets to the speeders instead and those people will have the fear put in them for a bit everywhere they drive, not just on that street.  Get caught a few times, and they have a bigger problem on their hands.  Drivers who follow the rules won't be affected in the least.  
---
Certain people will always find ways to exploit things to get an advantage so long as they keep getting away with it.  Enforcement is the only way to fix it at the source... source being people who push the limits of what is allowed.
---
&gt; they designed to be exploitable?
---
Says who?
---
Mine has never decayed.
---
WC? Don’t worry about it, for low lvl dungeon like WC u are not going to hold threat if there are multiple mobs period. Trust me it will get much better when you lvl up and get access to more talents, spells and better gear.
---
Why is he dying to more then 1 mob? A cat is perfect (and recommended) for almost all parts of the game. Don't be afraid to pull some aggro yourself, your pet should be able to handle 2 mobs no question with a third trapped if you want.
---
Honestly, dual spec made eveybody cookie cutter specs.  Everyone slowly became the same because not being the "ideal" spec put you at a disadvantage.
---
I perfer making ppl make tough choices, it fosters creativity.
---
When I wear plate with 300 armor, do I get less damage from a frostbolt than if I would wear cloth with 20 armor?
---
Does "armor" also mean "less spell damage"?
---
I hate retail right now. You can change anything when out of combat. After i play classic i realize it's not perfect after all. We need balance between them(closer to classic). Couple days ago i was in BRD trying to do MC quest and all party leave just before quest. Effectively wasted my 2 hours (tank had almost no gear). It's just frustrating.
---
So you are admitting to ban evading us? That isn't very smart on your part now is it. As for your go back to retail they are removed because they are uncivil, promote no discussion, and just down right overused and unoriginal.

That’s way out of date an inaccurate
---
If you can run dungeons by playing casually there’s some decent gear in the world not raid locked that should give you a decent chance at winning encounters if you gear up pre-raid.
---
no
---
We haven't been underpopulated for weeks. Balance was great, pop was great and we were doing great. Now it's garbage. I play alliance and our whole guild hates it. It must be 10x worse for horde.
---
I completely agree, but I feel the need to speak up since this has a much bigger impact.
---
but he didn't? as shown in the first part of the video???
---
Source? Got a source for that? Got a source for any data which indicates anything other than a 50:50 split? source???
---
He'll walk far to the south west, not far from the road. Turn on beast tracking and clear the mobs that are in your way. Then you can just kite him along the road.
---
On our server the recipe still hasn't dropped :(
---
Maybe I should check our server discord to check if a player can make it.
---
It's all pretty similar for PvP that it's 65 horde odd.
---
Golemagg whilst alliance are lower feel more organised at endgame though, we usually control BRM at raid time etc.
---
As an undead rogue. Its true
---
The cost of respeccing is part of what makes the talent system interesting. For example, I have dropped a few points in threat reduction talents to pick up silence on my priest. That is not a fully optimal pve or pvp spec but I have made a compromise and made 'my' build.
---
Also, your spec is part of your character identity. You make a conscious decision to be e.g. Shadow or Protection or whatever. It seriously devalues spec identity if people can respec all the time.
---
If you want to tank and be Fury, you could consider a Fury Prot build, or just tank as Fury and accept you won't be optimal. Those decisions are what make the talent system interesting, imo.
---
I wasn't ready :(
---
Rogue? Don’t you mean a swarm of Horde?
---
I had 6 Hordes chase me throughout Winterspring the other day.
---
I’m talking about a 20 minute chase, just so they could get one target with honor.
---
They only got me because i grew tired and stood my ground.
---
If the other team turtles it get long to around an hour or double that, if both teams rush then its a fairly short match
---
Went through hundreds at this point and seen a few greens but no blues and certainly no epics. Does help getting a god number of health pots though.
---
then find a better one and link it plz.
---
QQ
---
All those site use inaccurate data, I would not trust any of em after blizz nerfed the./who command
---
Yeah, classic is way more noob friendly so has way more worse players.
---
Sc really depends on how geared your raid is as a whole and if your daggers or swords (daggers having faster attacks and more damage per energy gained), the longer the fights are the more chance that you will have enough energy procs to make it worthwhile.
---
As an example we are killing shazzrah in 20 seconds, so the chances of sc proccing enough to be worth it are very slim.
---
Group
---
Upvoted for visibility, what an awful guy I’m sorry this happened bro :(
---
Well damn, I'll retract my statement and congratulate OP on being one of the few good dudes on gehennas. But I still believe that the vast majority of people would do the same thing.
---
Logically, yes. But once you ding 48, you're fucked. Blizzard made 48+ honor worthy.
---
And yet people rolled anyways, knowing pvp is just griefing.
---
Sad.
---
I reported this bug on September 2nd or 3rd. I'm not exactly feeling confident in the process.
---
Hey. I gave him our log files since I am not able to answer all those questions by myself. I'll dm you too. Might find some useful info there, such as class distribution.
---
Good luck!
---
It does feel a bit rushed. But I don't agree with Classic being "over".
---
I mean, if the only reason you keep playing is because of "F R E S H", then I've got bad news for you - the developers can't keep up with that nonsense.
---
Iirc it was wrath that did away with the priest racials
---
PvE servers are still an option, after levelling on one for a while pop back on your pvp server to see how things have changed and feel out which the better option is for you in the long run
---
Okay thank you
---
Blizz broke the addon to stop this sort of thing so none of them are accurate anymore
---
But ironforge.pro attempts to as best as they can.
---
That's true
---
I don't...understand
---
Yeah I dinged 48 last night and the amount of ganks i got in Tanaris was crazy, step out, targeted, go inside inn, targeted.  Like i get it, but mages are just so obnoxious with it.
---
Alright I'll swap my mask for my eye of rend and change some other pieces around. That should hell my flurry uptime. Thanks for your help.
---
This is kind of off topic, but your shit lock on your door wouldn't stop a small child.  Picking most locks is stupidly easy.
---
True Dat
---
We,on the other hand, can't kill raggi befor submerge :)
---
Oh but an hour is it? It's not days like it was originally?
---
Lol no one in this thread agrees with anyone else in here
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK-XGqAMqH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK-XGqAMqH4) 
---
***Just kill them***
---
It's not taking money away from the economy if nobody is respeccing because it's too expensive. 
---
Lower cost means more people will respec, and more often, which will lead to a greater amount of gold removed from the economy than there is now.
---
I feel bad
---
Hunters scale poorly. Poor weapon choice. Poor agi to crit ratio. Poor AP to damage ratio. They have a decently high DPS floor but their damage goes up much slower than other DPS.
---
Awesome, I can't wait to try it.
---
Because of things like ethics and principles? What?
---
\#NOCHANGES
---
Then you feel bad for a at least 50% of WoW’s total player base.
---
Cause let’s face it, what better way to escape how shitty and meaningless life is than pretend to be someone cooler and feel accomplishment from slaying virtual monsters?
---
It aint the best coping mechanism but it’s all some of us have.
---
gehennas has a bunch of active alliance pvp guilds
---
What's the downside of LFR ?
---
Normal content is still available to people while casuals have a watered down version.
---
Why should I have to farm stuff just to play the same raid ?
---
I think LFR should be a thing.
---
yes
---
Undead only have gray.
---
Just did this and Quartermaster with a mage friend for bis gloves and pants.
---
An FC wants mobility and self-peels. A warrior has none of these. A hunter or rogue would make for a better FC than a warrior. Let’s not even talk about druids/mages because they outclass you even more.
---
It's like the humiliating things they do with new students in student clubs while on camp, I only know the native word for it....but the cycle keeps itself alive.
---
in the beggining i was goin for hydrospawn for the neck, after i got it i stopped doin the boss.(will start doing him again when darkmoon faire comes out tho - ace of elementals)
---
about the satyrs, i know it adds up by doing them, but i kinda fuck up more pulls than not, and the gold gain for me wasnt rly that much. 
---
i rly make all my money from the lashers and it has served me well till now.
---
My bad, dunno about that sorry
---
Wondering the same thing, I wanna play a pally but hopefully on a server that isn't ridiculously horde dominated
---
What a piece of shit, hope people on that server+faction blacklist him
---
Huh. Weird.
---
&gt;"if you don't play the game the way I do, that means you don't really enjoy it!"
---
Nice narcissism.
---
Lmao, sorry you’re getting downvotes :/ sometimes group compositions don’t have a user for these items.
---
Not on blizzards side, but how is that condescending? I just don't see it.
---
Im in faerlina and the queue start around 3 to 5 pm and they can last for about 3 hours but its crazy the amount of pvp you see there
---
Respecced when I got to 60. 10 gold.
---
Respecced 2.5 months later. 15 gold.
---
There is no decay
---
Spent 10 minutes clearing the area of mobs, guy runs in and ninjas it as I'm killing the last guy, then tells me to "stfu" when I ask him to stop. 10 minutes of my time is 10 minutes of my time, doesn't matter if I'm 60 or 30
---
I'm sorry I came out harsh. It's just, when you sell items and for that price. People (or at least I am) expect quality and not some art made for five to ten minutes.
---
 Spent 10 minutes clearing the area of mobs, guy runs in and ninjas it as I'm killing the last guy, then tells me to "stfu" when I ask him to stop. 10 minutes of my time is 10 minutes of my time, doesn't matter if I'm 60 or 30
---
Maybe his character is a brain damaged zoomer?
---
and this differ from M+ / M raid how? except that mythic actually offer challenge instead of facerolling your way through 100 arena-angerforge run to get your hoj?
---
You know, I should try it out. Have always played on a pvp server, maybe this is what I need, thanks.
---
There was a MS &gt; OS loot rule and tier priest gear isn't for shadow.
---
So?
---
    /cast Major Healing Potion
---
I replicated this and it works (I don't have multiple levels of potions but it's functional for Major). Check for spelling errors maybe?
---
&gt;Second question is is it possible that when I have no Major, Superior or Greater hp pots it shows the icon for the Healing Potion and amount I have?
---
I use [Dominos](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dominos/files/2793922) for my action bars and that adds a nice stack counter for consumables or potions that require reagents. You might also want to look at [AutoBar](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/autobar-classic).
---
&gt;Upon testing this next macro just doesn't want to work either.
---
Yeah no issues with that macro. You might have an addon interfering or something. Even at full HP it doesn't question out.
---
For one faction.
---
I remember standing next to a copper vein trying to flag people down so they could mine it.
---
I didn’t realize that they would be everywhere and thought it was really rare lol
---
I quess you are a part of those 40 griefing grps, gotcha homie.
---
We ended up running 4 rogues and a shaman from sfk thru sm the first week,  other guild cleave group poached our warrior so we just made it work, with some coordinating it was surprisingly smooth, rotating blade flurrys/evasions, lots of stuns and vanishing if it got bad.
---
Met a lot of friends on the way who have taught me a lot of tricks and better ways to PvP. Rekindled with old friends I met in early phase 2 who wanted a person they could trust to PvP with. Lots of little duo and trio parties. It's fun. I've never loved this game so much. Yeah we outnumber them, but there are many times they outnumber us. They have good players to practice with and die to. Helps keep our egos down. At the same time, we start to hunt. At the gates of iron forge, we now are the underdogs and we must unite and strategize to remind them that their egos are only an illusion. It's amazing.
---
In terms of raiding, Hunters have three things going against them.  The first is the pet because it never really gets better.  The second is lack of good DPS CD, so they can't take advantage of shit like their ability to frontload a lot of damage.  The final and possibly most important is mana.  Since Hunters don't really have good dps CDs to use, extremely short fights aren't great for them, but at the same time long fights are issues since they will go OOM like warriors/rogues keep going and even Warlocks can lifetap as long as they get healed.  Hunter sweet spot is a fight long enough for DPS CDs to not be as significant, but also short enough so they don go oom.  This ends up being around 2-3 mins.
---
Hunter's greatest weakness is their ability to maintain mana and lack of quality DPS CD.  It ends up putting their peak in a very specific type of fight.  They have issues Rogues/Warriors don't.  Unlike mages they don't hit a tier where they can simply switch to a vastly higher damage spec like fire.  Warlocks share some of these issues, but unlike Hunters they aren't really hard capped by mana in terms of how long as fight can be.
---
Are you the three that have been camping the Azhara FP?
---
He doesn't have Blizzard mispelled in his name. Can't be a real GM.
---
[X]
---
hum, good, long-term raider might not stick around if you keep taking 2 hours to clear MC.
---
That deserves an opposite faction corpse camp
---
320 spirit = 80 healing, but it gives 240 instead and it continues to do so after respeccing
---
You got a link to this confirmation?
---
Genuinely want to know.
---
You can watch them, but you can't touch. Not until next year, anyway.
---
All chat is logged by Blizzard
---
except all the retail raiding community.
---
But I wouldn't expect a classic zealot who's afraid of actually challenging content to be honest about it.
---
A lot of shades of gray tho
---
Sure, but problem that isn't a problem is not a problem.
---
actually made a rogue for this :)
---
I’ve been reading up on the hit cap vs. crit chance. It sounds like for raiding I would still not be wasting stats to do something like devilsaur and black stone ring even with the human racial and swords since it will continue to increase white damage against bosses.
---
This is good to know because I don’t just want to blindly follow a BiS guide without understanding why. Now I just need to get the rogue to sixty! Haha Thanks for the info!
---
What a trash human. Make sure everyone on your server sees this video.
---
You wont look like that much of an ass.  But you also can do it the way you want, and you certainly dont have the justify yourself to other players on reddit.
---
Make sure that you have all of the latest abilities trained up.  As a hunter you've got to constantly be taming new, higher level pets to learn new ranks of abilities.  You probably need to up his armor and stamina.
---
Itemization
---
Cloth Turn-Ins
---
Mounts
---
Check the imgur link in the OP, the spellblade is the updated p6 version, along with ALL the other gear.
---
so, your 150th arena-angerforge run to get the HoJ felt more like a challenge while mythic raiding / mythic pushing felt more like a mindless threadmill?
---
Depends on your hit rating if you have enough you can drop the DMN trinket for HoJ.
---
Ayy grats super lucky run! If you plan on raiding and want to do competitive dps within your guild you might want to look into buying some edgemasters if you want to use those swords. If not you could start farming gold for Axe of the deep woods &amp; flurry axe. Alternatively Rivenspike/ribsplitter MH &amp; Boneslicing hatchet/Serathil offhand are solid choices and easier to attain.
---
time is money friend
---
To reset the instance you need to be outside it, so to accomplish this and get returned to the start of it, you log off and log onto an alt that is in party with you, this alt then wait 2 minutes to get leader of the group and reset the instance for you.
---
when you log back into your main, the instance will be reset and you will be at the start and ready to run it once more.
---
I feel like I offered a little more substance than just a complaint though. So there's that.
---
Just to add up - warlocks have terrible most of the T1 including set bonus (for PVE) compared to hunters and there are barely any spell hit pieces at the moment to get close to hit cap. Later on once locks have more hit and crit, they stomp hunters without question. Also on the longer fights locks won't have mana issues, hunters could.
---
Just accept that enhance is not our most potent spec. Elemental will definitely make you more powerful in PVP, but if you don’t care so much for the numbers and just want to have fun, enhance is plenty of fun. 
---
But it’s true, you’ll either get a lucky WF and melt someone or just smack them praying for a WF until you die.
---
Aye I too was laughing at your attempt of an excuse as to why your drivel shouldn't have been removed. I'm glad we agree on that :)
---
Right but when you say that only two people dueling get honor, you're implying that other people In their group don't.
---
I'm alliance and you're definitely wrong. Last night was terrible. Large packs of alliance in every 50+ zone
---
Eh valid point just nice to finish a fight and see how you stacked up. I usually go with the if I'm purple I'm playing correctly.
---
what? theres green grey, blue grey, purple grey, a reddish grey, more grey grey.  soo many colors
---
What have you bound to changing camera distance?
---
Something too, is a 19 rogue was ganking in duskwood and he gave no honor to my 26 warrior. Seems odd that 48 gives honor 12 levels higher; but it’s not the same for lower levels.
---
Why do you say that?
---
If we have 5x as many people on a single server, it surely would be good to have them spawn a bit more frequently than in vanilla?
---
Aah alright, I was thinking it just gave  the 25% but didn't get removed when respeccing until logging.
---
Pull mobs and die on him and it would have fucked the tame up. The only thing those people understand is conflict that makes them look stupid.
---
Wow, nice BiS list! Does something like this exists for other class than warrior?
---
i think you're replying to the wrong person
---
&gt; (if they catch me (which they usually do because of paladins))
---
Can you explain this? I'm curious what this means.
---
Plus by WOLTK 1000g wasn't the feat it is in classic.
---
The worst are paladins.
---
I farmed that ring on a priv server for my r sham. It wasn't something I expected to ever see just one of those BiS things to get after your nearly full BiS. Anyway, it actually drops and I get hyped but then I realize this hunter is gonna roll on it. I'm going to lose this unmatched Rsham item to a hunter pls no. After the timer is soon to expire he PASSED it and I got it. Same thing, he wanted it cuz purple n shiny but took the time to be considerate. The world, ofwarcraft, needs more people like you and that hunter. This ring is not OP like it was on priv servers but I'm sure you made that healers day. Good work.
---
Funny that this is where they draw the line.
---
This is such a stupid opinion to hold. You're stupid.
---
Yeah, I would reach out to the GL, guild banks probably have some money stashed up or arcanite bars, arcane crystals etc.  I think fixing this would be helpful to the guild, since the scam happened in the guild itself, I mean, the GM approve the guy getting invited after all.
---
Either way, Blizz's idea of "you will get a reputation" if you scam people has a lot less weight when you can just freely transfer servers.
---
Sorry that happened man, I am also saving up mats for the helm, with the hope a guildie can make it.
---
This is why i like wow, the more time you put in, the stronger your character should be.
---
How tf can you steal a chest? First who opens got the chest. Will you report same faction players to their gms who open chest in the stv arena when you just won a 1v1 against someone else? Get over yourself. Any serious guild would laugh you off the server for some pity shit like this. Especially if it's an open world chest worth 3 silver.
---
I mean say what you want but my Horde tattoo is actually pretty sick.
---
"We finally did it."
---
"So what do we do now?"
---
"What do you mean? Now we can finally start playing the game."
---
so condescending
---
So the answer is, no, Spy doesn't let anyone do what /u/206Buckeye suggested. What you are describing could just as well be performed by continuously clicking a /target macro when they are nearby.
---
I think bug fixes are important but godmode.hack seems more important to me than "sometimes I can't cast entangling roots".
---
T% puts the name of your target there.
---
your holy priest - resto druid - prot warrior and other class with shit-tier farming ability ( or who need to respec in order to farm properly) could answer that question rather quickly.
---
assuming here you run with a stable crew and not just 30-manning the instance + 10 pug looking to refill your Gbank with consumable.
---
Lol people quit on both sides. A mass die off is happening bc of the ignorance of faction balance and will get worse if bgs aren't successful
---
Too bad our T1 is awful for PVE
---
He's wrong. The Seal is only worth it if you need the resistance.
---
Would you say 50 shadows of grey?
---
There was a warcraft cake post yesterday or the day before &gt;.&gt;
---
But there's a reason why the majority of those games are dead now.
---
This is a high quality doompost in disguise
---
Ah so now every class and spec can farm gold at the same rate of time? And all classes are punished the same for being a different spec than is generally advised..?
---
Stop picking and choosing what parts of the game you consider to be equal.
---
Right, so Spy doesn't do anything similar to what /u/Shalrys commented upon. Cheers.
---
I do't know how they can say counterattack lodestone is better than HoJ.  Lodestone is 22AP and 1% parry while HoJ is 20 AP and 2% chance for a bonus swing. HoJ can be more tedious to fully optimize since it resets your swing timer, but even ignoring that aspect will make it better.
---
For Horde there is also Rune of the Guard Captain from Hinterlands which is 20AP and 1% hit.  THis is better than the lodestone.  Even through passive useage it still probably isn't better than HoJ, and definitely not if you really micro the HoJ, but it would be close.
---
Blackhand's Breadth is the typical other trinket rogues use.
---
Depending on how much you want to micro the trinkets I'd say they are 
---
1. HoJ
---
2. Rune of the Guard Captain
---
3. Blackhand's Breadth
---
4. Counterattack Lodestone.
---
The only reason you would use dmn trinket is to reach hitcap or increase your crit cap. Hoj and breadth is better in all other aspects of PvE
---
because they are forcing fucked up schedules for anyone who wants them.
---
And I though Bigglesworth was more balanced, pity
---
I'm pretty sure you cannot go soul link ruin. Not enough points
---
Still do that, and when he finds a new guild do it again.
---
[Why would it matter?](https://youtu.be/VbcwAPZycGE?t=52)  (NSFW - link to speech by Rust Cohle from True Detective)
---
In the end, everything you've done in the real world will vanish, unless you're a person that has impacted the world on a massive scale and even then their accomplishments and memories fade with time.
---
honestly when this bug is fixed warcraft logs will have to reset all the logs, as this bug has removed any level of competition from the top end of logs for priests, I'm sure there are a ton of legitimate logs on there we won't know which ones are since spiritual guidance is a common talent holy priests take
---
When I first started, in like, December 2004, I rolled alliance without even looking at the horde races.  It was pretty cool running into players of the opposing faction for the first time.  Tauren were the most surprising, because they seemed HUGE.
---
You might want to make it a 3-man jump run just to speed things up, make sure one of them is an Herbalist. Should be fine.
---
Do you consider reserving orbs to be charging for runs?
---
That is until you can get DFT from bwl, of course.
---
Farm build utilizes 3/3 Improved Blizzard and 3/3 CoC. Sometimes even not speccing Frostbolt Castspeed over additional Armor talent.
---
For Raids there are two versions of mages. Good geared ones skill down Arcane all the way and just a bit into Frost as someone already mentioned.
---
The other version goes deep frost for Winter's Chill and get 10% critchance on a mob for all other frost mages.
---
I am currently the winter's chill mage in our regular pug and if i wanted to aoe farm i would need to respec to get Blizzard/CoC over Critdamage for example.
---
You realize most pvprs are also in a guild that raids and gets the same loot as you
---
Why?  WCL isn't handing out awards for performance.  Not to mention with stacking buffs, you could create an absurdly high value that even when exploiting, you wouldn't get close.
---
If anything, Blizzard should be watching WCL for suspiciously high values so they can investigate for bugs/exploits.
---
You assumed you are just allowed to have fun?? on this subreddit of all places!?!?
---
Standards are falling around here.
---
I'm just tired of seeing the same shit everyday. No body cares about your "unique" experience and screenshot of dying while you quest. I also don't need to move under a rock because of that. This clearly wasn't just a bitch and moan post it offered more than that with the questions at the bottom so either answer them or go to the other 100 posts discussing how you were "griefed" in Arathi Highlands on your level 32 warlock.
---
This shit is so buggy. God damn.
---
The first time I saw a horde player they were speaking but I couldn't figure out what they were saying so I kept saying "dude, you're speaking gibberish, I don't understand you." A couple other alliance people had to explain that you can't speak cross-faction.
---
According to this post wow is only 53.9% horde
---
Here's the thing . It is a design choice. Gold was available in different amounts in vanilla. It feels way harder to grind out gold right now because of server pops. So less gold to spend on respecs.
---
I think having 10-15 years of experience is a greater factor by far than 1.12 talents. And sure, r14 weapons are sick, but anyone who puts in that amount of effort kind of deserves some perk to compensate for lack of life. 
---
And even though you're against it from a vanilla vs classic progression point of view, it will still take people a minimum of 13 weeks of that crazy playstyle to get it. If they manage, they are probably already decked out to their teeth in MC gear and higher rank PvP weapons and would bash people left and right even without the weapon anyway.
---
I don’t think he’s talking about the lodestone, but the 2% hit class trinket
---
You let lvl 47s live unless they start shit so they can quest faster to level 48. It's all about the sweet honor.
---
People being toxic even in reddit, just help him or shut up
---
Gotta be vigilant. Especially with high end trades.  Sounds like you floated your entire bank without collateral and without really knowing this guy.  Good lesson for us all although defin sucks butt.  And this guy getting to server xfer really makes it suck.  Thanks for posting this so we all know what to expect.
---
I'm convinced there's something affecting the Gorosh spawn rate.  You either see him a reasonable amount, or you very very rarely see him.  It might be confirmation bias, but I am rather convinced it has to do with the party leader.  
---
It took me 251 runs (did more, but that's when I started documenting them on a spreadsheet) to get mine.  I ran with a priest friend and we very rarely saw Gorosh.  6 times in 223 runs.  Longest streak was 87 runs between Gorosh appearances.  He went out of town and I enlisted another healer friend who said he saw Gorosh regularly... and suddenly started seeing regularly (6 of 28 runs) when he was the group lead.  Got it rather quickly after that, then it dropped again 2 runs later (same healer as lead) when I was showing another Warrior friend how I 2-manned it.  
---
I know that's just how random chance goes sometimes, but it just didn't seem to be normal.  I also saw 24 Ban'thok Sashes in those 223 runs and had Mages who told me it took them over 100 runs to get (I made a lot of Mages' days).
---
Okay great. Now what about any fight longer than 60 seconds. Plenty of guilds aren't even killing ragnaros before submerge, so thats 4+ mins.
---
BWL is just around the corner. Is that going to be 100% 60 second fights as well?
---
We're running 3x15 man Ony teams in my guild, fights last a good 10-15 mins.
---
There's more to it than just throwing more int at the problem.
---
1 bad experience = screw it I'm done. Ok.
---
Classic, like vanilla, was always about social connections. You have to talk to people and network.
---
I made the post to show how constant the Horde flight path camping is on Skeram. It’s not just peak hours, or fringe hours. I made it to show that we can’t even go turn in AD signets at 8:45am on Monday without running into 2min rez timers.
---
What?! xD
---
You mean having more Options to kill the world Boss actually hinders you in getting it? :P
---
I mean if you want to get EVERY world Boss it takes some more time.
---
But you don't have to **Catch' em all** just got for the ones you would anyway. Don't Change your schedule because world Boss might appear :P
---
Maybe I'm just missing something though and you actually make a lot of sense
---
Am Alliance on Herod, seems to be just as many Alliance players here as there were at the end of P1. You just don't see them because they are all AFK in Ironforge.
---
Lol please. Warriors have fury prot which is A. Ideal for raiding and B. Still good for PvP.
---
Preists: Shadow is fine for raiding dps. Great PvP. Disc is good at healing for both PvE and PvP.
---
Ret pallies are fine dps and good at pvp. While being elite lvl healers in both.
---
Shaman can do anything. (Current sub 2 hour MC/ony includes 3 hybrid healing shaman, 1 enhance dps shaman and a enhance tank shaman all pvp very well.)
---
Hunters, mages, warlocks, rogues. All dont need to respec to do veey well at both.
---
Literally no excuses for needing to respec weekly except that your to stubborn or lazy to actually problem solve in game. Gold can be easily had just by professions.
---
Hunter soloing mara here. Any tips for not pulling a hydra with Rotgrip when kiting to princess? I got the impression it was rng from guides but it happens every single time to me.
---
I've seen the decay happen, I was at 50g then 45g, now back to 50g
---
Always mark a target skull and x, doesn't matter if its the right or wrong one, having them marked is better than not having them marked. If DPS start all attacking different mobs and nothing is marked it's kind of on you as a tank, you call the kill order. If you have stuff marked and they're still attacking wrong targets feel free to call them out on it. 
---
To answer your quest yes you can dps in cat form but don't give up on tanking just because you had a bad group. It's going to be much faster for you to find dungeon groups as a tank/healer than as a kitty dps.
---
We have 6 mages on the guild and last night we did ony two T2 helms dropped. Not a single mage wanted it.
---
So I’ve finally managed to get my friend to start WoW Classic.  If he decides he wants to roll alliance I will stay on my current server, but if he would prefer to roll horde I want to try to find an ideal server to give him the full WoW experience(Europe). A good balance with a strong population so we can easily find groups and a good guild for end game raiding. Does anyone have any recommendation?
---
TL;DR best balanced server with a high population to reroll horde
---
&gt; • Pure DPS classes are limited to DPS only as opposed to classes who can fill multiple roles. There needs to be a price for that luxery.
---
But there is a price without respec costs already, that is that hybrid classes always deal less damage.
---
Not gonna happen. 
---
They can’t just cancel pvp servers because it’s more intense than everyone expected. Just gotta wait till the 10th.
---
You will have to gauge it based on your week to week climb, keep a small spreadsheet going. Honestly though it shouldnt be too difficult, you just need to be consistent.
---
As alliance hunter main, hats off to you. You deserve my utmost respect sir. Even if this was cross-faction I wouldn't interfere (and I have been in that scenario, let the other hunter have his epic moment and we both cheered after), doing this to same faction is simply the essence of being an asshole. Absolute trash of a human being that troll hunter, Idgaf that it's "just a video game".
---
I've use home/end - I think they are already bound by default.
---
It feels a bit sluggish using them to zoom in/out with them, but it's very rare that I need to do it.
---
this is the funniest one yet
---
Literally what I was fucking thinking. Guess I should have seen the whiners coming to this thread and down voting it and whining in my comments.
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOL no
---
&gt; I wouldn't. I would find it pretty fun actually.
---
To each their own. Some people enjoy playing games with all cheats enabled allowing them to waltz through without thinking, whereas others enjoy competing in a competitive environment (or on the hardest skill in a singleplayer game). I'm not going to pass judgement on whether one thing is better than the other. 
---
&gt; This is what the majority of people are aiming for when they gear up in WoW.
---
To be able to roflstomp people of the opposing faction? Sure, that might be *one* of the incentives for *some* people, but certainly not for everyone. People in my guild do it more for the sake of achievement, to be able to show off, to be able to hit higher numbers in PvE (or simply make PvE content easier), etc. 
---
&gt; Somebody in full epics vs somebody in greens? HMMMM i wonder who wins...? You want that edge over your opponent for your own enjoyment.
---
*Some* people would consider having such an edge over their opponents to be enjoyable, but certainly not everyone. I would get bored of such a thing really quick, that's for sure. It's like getting enjoyment from killing lvl 50's when you are lvl 60. Sure, it might be appeal to some people, but far from everyone. 
---
&gt; Would you prefer to be the one with the 50% hp?
---
I would actually find that *more* fun than being the one with a substantial advantage over everyone else. But that's irrelevant to the point I'm making anyways.
---
Except that people were unhappy by server merges before when it happened. Guess what, Blizz listened!
---
Shaman have a significantly higher floor but a slightly lower ceiling.  I would say that means for the average player (read most players), Shaman is solidly more difficult to play.  You can get away with being a bad rogue in PvP for obvious reasons and still come away with "ez" kills, especially by landing lucky crit ambushes.  Being a bad shaman means getting wrecked wholesale by almost everyone.  That being said, because of the sheer number of abilities and tools that rogues have access to, many of which are very niche but useful in the most skilled hands, and the pure speed of the sequence of events that need to occur timing wise, the very best rogues are a solid step above difficulty and skill wise.  
---
I think a lot of people with experience "wrecking" people in pvp with rogues in 1.12 were/are doing so with bis weapons which is another point to make.  The weapon maketh the rogue and is another thing that can cover up a LOT for lack of skill so it skews things a bit.  Toss a Perdition Blade on jonny nub and he can one hit cloth and /spit all day.  When I say high skill ceiling I  mean equal gear, top tier, 1v1.
---
It is really loke, Lord of the rings, finding endless orcs. Riding the burning steppes with my crew of 10. It just builds and builds and then we are overran. We regroup ride, getting picked off. Fight. Fight, they build and build, we get overran. We move, we fight. Get overran. Sometimes you don't even get to form.
---
It's to the point your ride into Burning Steppes from redridge. You port to darn and don't bother with theramore. Or auberdine. 
---
Even if we could take one area, they'd just all resupport and we'd be crushed again. Plus taking the boat back from a raid is near impossible. The lag and choke point, it's just poop.
---
The only thing that is raid wide is a positive attitude :)
---
leef I
---
You're missing that we have no period of grace where we don't need to scout for them. We have had respawn faster than 48H, which means that you probably want to scout 24H after a kill and not 4 to 5 days after. It's just a constant stream of world bosses. Makes them pretty whatever tbh.
---
Damn, what an insightful post. I'm sure this will get a ton of discussion!
---
No, wpvp is why i play on a pvp server...
---
You're gonna spend 12 hrs camping a rare spawn and 0 minutes talking to others that may be interested or may decide to screw you over?
---
If you want a certain level of fair play from your own faction you'd better start enforcing that and making sure all the people on your server are on board with it. As is, good luck with getting random internet people to agree on proper behaviour. You took your chances and you lost.
---
wtf are you saying? lol
---
Beside the full realms. Which high/medium realm is closest 1:1 ratio?
---
I've been getting messages with DBM before them going off. I've been able to teleport to Orgri a couple of times where I noticed it in time. No idea why a legit question is being downvoted.
---
You look at the worst item haha!
---
Overall I agree with you on the fact it needs to be fixed, but having a wrong movement speed, a manaburn that is working through bear form or an aggro problem in our tanking form is still very problematic... and nothing has been fixed as of today, which shows that they are pretty ok with this being not prior.
---
So is someone that is going to be overpowered in terms of healing, and healing only until next disconnection, at the cost of a massive amount of gold,  and this only until next disconnection, is that much of an issue... maybe... but not sure it’s going to be fixed soon.
---
You implying paladins aren't better than shamans in general, son?
---
I've had a queue time twice on Kromcrush. both were like 10-15 minutes that's it, and they were like prime time on a friday night. Otherwise its pretty much as close to a perfect server as I could hope to be on. PVP seems pretty well balanced overall.
---
They were very sceptical about people accepting classic as it was and a lot of threads with "literally unplayable" whine seem to prove it.
---
Cookie-cutter spec level 60 holy priest; what's my best option for farming outside of DM lasher farm? I don't have the mana for it and want to grind some gold to finish up buying mats for my Truefaith and Hide of the Wild. Would rather focus on grinding gold than specific mats. I've heard the bats in EPL have the most profitable gray loot table in the game, so should I just kill a bunch of those? Any other spots?
---
That would make sense, I hadn't considered that. Cheers for the input :)
---
It is up for download, I just saved the high res image from this reddit post and printed on A3 glossy, looks great!
---
Not really man. Put it in your spreadsheet. It’s pretty significant.
---
Nothing stands out. Try downloading BugGrabber + BugSack to see what addons may be throwing errors.
---
Well, where are these not evil Forsaken? Who are they? What's their plan's name?
---
Or get equally committed friends to help. Run WoW on a virtual machine and have them remote into it when you need to sleep. That would still violate ToS, but with very little ways Bliz could detect it.
---
For the truly committed and not willing to violate Blizzard rules, there's another option. Adopt a Senegalese orphan and hook them up on WoW. A minor and their guardian can share an account according to WoW terms of service.
---
Thats because you went from the 10g “tier” to the higher one before the decay kicked in.
---
Nah this is classic. More like 8 shades of grey.
---
No need for discussion, the facts have been laid out
---
You're probably right that blizz will continue an abbreviated release schedule, with mini content releases between official patches.  However, I am also prepared to believe that the way content has been rolling out was nothing more than an unfortunate blunder.  This is how the blunder may have gone:
---
The early DM release is inexplicable to me, and was rushed for sure.  However phase 2 was released when it was JUST because blizzard wanted something to announce about classic at Blizzcon.   Due to the absolute mayhem the honor system unleashed on PvP servers, and blizzard understanding that it's their fault that the servers are so imbalanced, they decided the best option to retain subscriptions was to release BG's early and separate from Phase 3.  
---
It certainly looks like a pattern of rushing the content, but it could just have been a horrible failure in planning.  Lets hope that Blizzard understands their mistake and starting with phase 3 they will stop rushing the content.
---
From the wording of your post it sounds like you're bad at this game but HAVE friends to support you
---
There's multiple people on my server that are bracket 1 this week that leaned on this heavily.
---
Feels bad to be a loser in a group of friends, I hope they don't mock him for it. At least they can help him level then!
---
&gt;I am in fact certain that OP would do the same thing to the other hunter if the tables were reversed.
---
Did you watch the first part of the video...
---
Jesus Savage Glad and HoJ in one run? That is by far the luckiest thing!
---
red=dead
---
In the mean time, if this happens to you, your raid, or your guild. You can "Google" blizzard live chat (this is how we found the correct link) and make sure you choose the live chat option from the first link that pops up instead of doing a bug report or opening a ticket. We had this happen to our group 2 raid last Saturday. 
---
They had to log onto each of our characters individually to reset our lockouts as well. Took about 2 hours total to get everyone's raid lockout reset and we went in the next night and cleared MC. 
---
That next night, The Eye dropped off Rag too!
---
The server imbalanced killed the world PVP not BGs.
---
The dude is still alive even after looking like that, I think he knows what he's talking about.
---
&gt;It gets a small portion of +healing.
---
it gets half the portion of greater heal, and it also has half the cast time.  Given that you still spend the same amount of time casting spells, it's the same.
---
That would actually kill the game.
---
Blizzard never came out and explicitly said what the respawn timers were for world bosses.  People would make guesses and their responses would usually be shit like "That is a close approximation".
---
In general though, most world bosses would spawn within about 2 days of a server restart, with almost no minimal time in that case.  I remember having the server come up and Kazzak was there as soon as I could fly out to the blasted lands.  The other end was after a kill, the respawn timer seemed to be about 3-6 days.  In general people would kill Kazzak/Azuregos on the Tuesday/Wednesday after a reset and then at some point the ensuing weekend.
---
There is some give on each depending on a late/early spawn after the reset, but in general that is how they would spawn from my experience in Vanilla.  So far in classic it has been the same.  Both Kazzak/Azuregos spawned and dies on the Thursday of P2 release.  Azuregos then respawned on Sun 17 with Kazzak not coming until after the reset Wed 20.  Azuregos respawned after the rest on Thusday 21.  Kazzak then respawn Sun 24 and Azuregos Mon 25.
---
Sounds like you might wanna look for a new guild.
---
I think what they are trying to say is when the sub revolves into only these type of posts it gets a little silly and uninteresting. I’m sure your tattoo is a banger though :) also happy cake day.
---
It's a game. Crying over it is really not needed mate. Just be patient.
---
I play classic solely to raidlog.. and will probably cancel my sub soon in order to crawl back into the sewers of TBC/WOTLK private servers
---
Arugal 25k players
---
That's why I'm debating. I've killed that fucking spider so many times.
---
What does discord have anything to do with giving a recipe or pattern to someone who’s more active and doesn’t just login for raids?
---
I feel like this comment is meant to be an insult? But yes my guild has currently completed all the content the game has to offer.
---
Any idea how much coding/debugging/testing something like this takes?
---
Partially true. You can also get feared from the top of the bridge, into the lava, and the lava counts as part of the same zone entrance. 
---
Since Phase 2 has dropped, and there's normally 80-100 Horde standing in BRM every Tuesday, it's become common practice for my guild to just jump down from the very top straight into the lava to zone into MC.
---
&gt; What is this, high school or prison? No mature grown-ups will actually call someone safe-spotting "committing an offense".
---
Poor attempt at trying to copy my reply and turn it against me. Too bad you didn't realize two sentences don't make sense together. 
---
&gt; No mature grown-ups will actually call someone safe-spotting "committing an offense".
---
Sounds like you don't have much experience with being a mature grown-up. When someone is committing an offense, it is perfectly natural for such people to call it out.
---
Don't need a alt
---
Can't grind Winterspring Frost Saber 
---
Don't care about Timbermaw rep
---
Will get alternate faction mounts via PvP so no reason to grind the rep. 
---
Maxed my professions
---
Have 2700 gold and nothing to spend it on 
---
Have a bank full of raid consumables, limited invuls, and free action pots. 
---
I knew when my character was level one that getting all the farming out of the way pre honor system was the way to go. Not that I don't make a lap or two around epl for rich thorium still but it's not the zone out and watch Netflix task it used to be. Now it comes with 1v1s and ganks so I have to pay attention.
---
I try to run in and throw rank 1 consecrate but a lot of the time when I get that close to a boat full of bad guys I have to pop my bubble to get out and then there goes my best tool. It's a rough life.
---
Grats, gotta buy edgmasters now and be known as the sword warrior in your guild.
---
Hand of Justice is better than the Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas. The chance to gain an extra attack and 1% hit are quite similar but the chance to get an attack has the potential to be a lot better. If we assume that we are at the yellow hit cap 1% hit will convert a missed white hit into a hit. When HoJ procs you also generate an extra attack, the same as turning a miss into a hit. The advantage of gaining extra attack is that you can generate these with yellow hits as well, hit has no effect for your yellow attacks past the yellow hit caps and at the same time when you gain an extra attack from your OH that extra attack will have the damage of your MH (this is also a negative at the same time because it resets your swing timer but the problem can be reduced if you learn to use your yellow attacks after a MH swing).
---
After all of this you also have the extra 20AP on Hoj. This makes HoJ a much better trinket than the Royal Seal.
---
but generally speaking, higher end guilds go insanely fast, by decreasing the window of time you have to heal for, your potential HPS for that window skyrockets. people still take damage even in molten core
---
Getting downvoted for stating a fact. Welcome to Reddit.
---
Good for you. But I don't see the relevancy.
---
“How much gold do you make per hour selling water”
---
“I make zero gold per hour by *not* selling water, that totally answers your question.”
---
Yea, I realized that after I wrong everything but I still think it might be helpful for him or other people so I left it.
---
and as a consequence completely benefits horde :):):)
---
The stance is only seems not neutral because pvp servers overall is SO overwhelming majority alliance. It's not that the people playing horde are worse people it's that for most the people having the issues the servers are so crowded per square inch with horde that they cant play the game. So when people make statements like you must be horde etc not about them being horde it's about them being on the severely overpopulated faction which just happens to be horde.
---
Depends on your server. The top players on my server are doing 90-100 hours a week.
---
what server are you =)
---
Cool your solution is "don't play the spec you want use the specific hybrid that's only kinda good at things instead". 
---
And putting aside the fact that basically everything you just wrote was wrong.. have you heard of this thing called "fun"? I'm a rogue. Know how much more fun a sub build is for solo/PvP than a combat build? A *lot* more fun. But sub builds suck for raiding.
---
Mages.. did you know throwing fire at everything that moves is *awesome*... oh you want to raid? Too bad, no fire for you. 
---
And so on. There are a ton of reasons to want to have a second spec available to use, why are *you* so against it?
---
Thats what I thought. and yeah the royal seal hahah sorry should have been more clear
---
fck are you on about exactly ? He was there first and he gets first dibs. Yea, I am pretty sure a 60 is gonna be okay passing on BT through a warm conversation over tea. Use all that 12 iq of yours and think before you speak next time.
---
Super good for shamans this even enhance since you totem twist
---
Yeah I was. lodestone is not really a rogue trinket ;\\
---
Sigh....
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
the reason we have such bad imbalance is because they TOLD us bg would be crossrealm before launch so pvpers didnt feel the need to go alliance to avoid queues
---
I think someone said he's actually finnish.
---
That might be true but I dont know anything about picking locks, its just that the insurance company wont pay for any damages when the door wasnt locked.
---
Might be easy to lockpick a door, but its easier to open an unlocked door.
---
Imagine being such a spiteful piece of trash.
---
It depends if you play for immersion (meaning someone that could be you) or for other reasons
---
Make friends. Travel in groups. Do as many dungeons/dungeon quests as you can. If you are in a guild of less than 10 active members you need to look at joining/merging with another guild. I’m not saying guild hop. Ask around, check forums, talk to GMs, find a good fit that has a healthy community and go there. Large coordinated numbers is how you combat large numbers. 
---
If you are 52+ you should be running BRD till you have all of your pre-raid BIS items from there anyway. Might as well start the grind at 52. I get that running BRD can get old but if you are a melee class and don’t have HOJ yet. Guess what? You should be running BRD till you get it. It’s BIS. You will still be using it in NAX. BRD has multiple pre-raid BIS items for every class. Even if BRM is camped you should be able to corpse jump into BRD in 10ish minutes. 
---
Save world quests till 60 and BGs come out. Will be easier to do and you won’t have as much competition. Open world questing 50-60 was rough even before P2. Was not as crazy as it is now but there were still 3-5 man gank squads roaming around in most zones. 
---
If you hit 58 and are burnt out on BRD start running Scholo and LBRS/UBRS. 
---
TLDR- There is no reason to open world quest 52-60. You need to do these dungeons for gear anyway. Dungeon run from 52-60.
---
I think mongoose in BC was restricted to items higher than 35?
---
thats what I thought but they tried to make me feel stupid about it and his counter argument was "You're never hitcapped as a rogue because hitcap is 24% or something like that.
---
Fucking with same-faction is brutal. 
---
Shit, even murdering opposite-faction players while they're doing something like this is pushing it.
---
If you didn't have winters chill or arcane power you wouldn't be raiding with us. So 100g a week just for respecs.
---
yeah that thing is a beaut :D
---
Most raiders are done with dungeons many weeks ago. Not much to do atm other then gold/alts/rank. If you have gold, dont want alts, dont want to rank, then it's not much point logging atm.
---
Of course I know *that* one! :D
---
You forgot the most important reason to summon yourself: Bungee jumping off the bridges in BRD / UBRS
---
Run Strat dead and kill the guy with the key to the city. He drops a set of plate gloves (Death Grips) that make you immune to disarm. I never take them off in 5 mans or out in the world.
---
But you can do anything at a touch of button. It just costs gold.
---
I'm sorry if me calling you out on your immature choice of words offended you.
---
So you want the SECOND BEST option? DM flasher is great for straight cash, bonus if you can herb.
---
useful on Garr too
---
Gnome warrior with Edgemasters. I got a Brutality Blade, and I am curious if I should run with Flurry Axe or Mirah's Song in my OH. I feel like flurry would be better, except I cannot put an elemental sharpening stone on it due to the level.
---
He's 100% correct though. Servers are dying because of the forced pvp and there's going to be less and less reason for people to stick around.
---
BWL won't be easy for the casual crowd, AQ will be borderline undoable, and then Naxx is a dream for most. So the new content doesn't provided anything new for the majority of the playerbase
---

---
Hazing, perhaps?
---
&gt; Hazing (US English), initiation ceremonies (British English), bastardisation (Australian English), ragging (South Asia), or deposition, refers to the practice of rituals, challenges, and other activities involving harassment, abuse or humiliation used as a way of initiating a person into a group including a new fraternity, sorority, team, or club.
---
&gt;Elemental or restoration
---
I didn't know about the OH proccing HoJ and resetting the MH swing timer. Thanks for the knowledge!
---
I have read a dozen of these hit posts. This is really my only question and no one seems to have the answer.
---
This is the best news I've read all week.
---
This guild is doing that whole server a favor. Rather than these weirdos being spread all across different guilds, they're being recruited to be quarantined into one giant avoidable ball of fucked up people.
---
It's nerfed version of AV.
---
Essentially. As I said, I don’t have enough mana for lasher farm. I’ve read you want around 6k mana for it to be successful and I’m sitting at around 5.7k with my int gear and AI buff.
---
There is a really quick way to get them. Go into the strat live entrace, clear the few trash packs to that guy since he does not run away when you come in from that direction. Run out, reset and back in the main gate. Do this until they drop.
---
You truly don´t get the principle of fractions, do you?
---
Ranking points and thus Ranks are awarded for a fraction of players. That's quite literally the opposit of "anyone that put the work in got it".
---
Does the buff get removed if you leave Darkshore?
---
Roses are gray.
---
Violets are gray.
---
I'm dead, and colourblind.
---
Yep I don’t think anyone would have believed it if I didn’t have two others there with me for it.
---
Sword specialization works the same way.
---
I had to ask because if you have Eye of the Storm you probably already have a spec that's more damage focused (e.g. 30/0/21) and not deep resto like what I assume Sakkreth is.
---
I run 30/0/21 because it's good enough to heal current content with, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a bit selfish to have 30 talents points that brings nothing to the raid while the other shamans in the raid brings mana tide totems and more healing. So I understand why people are deep resto without Eye of the Storm.
---
Thank the nochanges crowd.
---
Dance monkey dance!!
---
What's a jump run?
---
&gt; Ahahahaha, yeah that's probably the reason why crystal song forest was so dark and gloomy because it was even closer to ICC.
---
...yes? Crystalsong was in fact darker than Grizzly. I never used the word "gloomy."
---
&gt; You seem to forget it was possible to reach max level through not moving at all from capital via dungeon finder.
---
I doubt many people did this but I won't disagree that dungeon finder was a bad addition. But we weren't talking about dungeon finder, we were talking about flying mounts. Why change the subject?
---
&gt; Good attempt but you brought nothing to the table.
---
That's something a gamer baby who doesn't agree with not respect someone else's opinion but still wants to act like they won the debate would say. Sad!
---
rank 6 is the theoretical maximum after 2 weeks, yes. But you do need to make more than 11000 RP each week to reach it. So, you'll likely only see 10-50 players on your server with that rank.
---
I saw him equip it, otherwise I would have been very upset lmao
---
I tracked every run I did.  I saw Gorosh 6 times in 223 runs (with an 87 run drought in there).  Switched healers (had him as party lead), saw Gorosh 6 times in 28 runs with 2 SGC drops.  Here are the totals for bosses I saw in those runs:  
---
Gorosh - 12
---
Grizzle - 54
---
Eviscerator - 22
---
Ok'thor - 59
---
Anub'shiah - 53
---
Hedrum - 51  
---
I know it could just be confirmation bias, I'm rather convinced there's something weird going on with the Arena spawns related to who is party lead.  Certain people see him regularly while others (including people who aren't specifically farming for him) are convinced he's closer to 1 in 30.  Maybe I just went mad from running the damn instance so many times, but this game has all sorts of stupid things going on, so I wouldn't put it past it.
---
I usually just report these people. I feel bad camping a town to the point where people need to go on a roof to feel safe but still, that shits annoying.
---
PIN IT THE TOP BOYS.
---
And I'm truly happy to have shared this special moment with you
---
People multibox the same class because it would be extremely difficult to play a whole group by yourself.   It would be impossible to tank and heal on 2 different accounts while running a dungeon.  Instead, it's much easier to have multiples of the same class that do the exact same thing at the same time.
---
I have read a dozen of these hit posts, no one answers this question lol
---
What a toxic piece of shit.
---
Yeah my guild will definitely not help me. But they helped the other tank get Quel serrar and flurry axe despite him having only 4% hit. Ah to be favored by the loot council
---
How could I be so stupid, it won't happen anymore!
---
and comes BGs, the highest ranked people will be the ones queue-dodging premade while pug-stomping 24/7... not the best pvp'er.
---
there's a reason the PvP ranking system got completely redone in TBC
---
Server:  Myzrael
---
Main:  night elf druid (level 30) - Habeeb
---
Alts:  undecided 
---
So I'm in NA (east coast time) but I'm on a bit of an odd schedule.  I'm looking for a guild that's active later at night.
---
I'm still leveling but I'd like to gear up and raid at 60. ASAP.  I plan on re-speccing resto but I'm willing to do whatever is needed.  I have vanilla experience in molten core (as a warlock).
---
Specifically I'm looking for raids that start around 9:00 PST on weekdays- Maybe kind of a long shot but that's when works for me.
---
Let me know if you've got any questions, thanks!
---
Hey OP is the blue gear updated and if so can you post a pic?
---
Wait until you see Naxx gear locks.
---
You haven't even seen their final form yet.
---

Must be nice. For alliance on whitemane nearly all high level fps are camped and the menethil boat 24/7. For me to go from Iron forge to thernore for first aid training and back I died probably 15 times. Menethil fp camped by 4 horde, dock camped by 2 rogues ambushing together, boat camped by 4-8 horde, menethil dock camped by 3 rogues, fp camped by a couple roamers, then back through the gauntlet.
---
Well technically the person giving you their bank alt is helping
---
But that's because you're a bad ass who loves overcoming the odds.
---
That's a cover.
---
I'd take shitposts and pictures every day of the week over the current "boohoo I rolled on a pvp server and its not fun now that people are killing me" posts we're seeing flood the front page every day.
---
Thank you for this. This makes me so happy.
---
Engineering.
---
Yeah its a pain in the ass but it feels great when you get it. The slow speed lends itself to some big ol crits. You can always buy a heartseeking crossbow from the AH to hold you over till you get the AV bow, or a lucky leaf from MC
---
6% with the +5 weapon skill talent
---
+1 for the set-up too lol
---
Go herb/skinning, swap to engi at 60.
---
it's a pain but well worth having engi on both classes
---
Yeh no idea mate!
---
The massive disparity of undead vs. other races says otherwise
---
But how much wPvP are you actually encountering?
---
If the smaller faction stops playing, migrates out or pvp is turned off, the net result is the same. Only in the last case your server may not die when BGs are released.
---
I mean I despise you hunter filth, but that shit is punishable by quartering. 
---
I’ll get the horses.
---
If it were my guild the other hunters would riot if he wasn't kicked.
---
Speaking as a priest 10-10 MC and 1-1 Ony, I find that magic number to be around 450 or 475 for priests, but only with around 80 or more MP5 (sans buffs).
---
You really need both in certain proportion to effectively raid heal, so there will be a time where you're building up +heal and suffer on MP5 and have to chug pots and use consumables like you're an addict.
---
Again, no hard and fast rules here, and both your spec and items play into this heavily.
---
Having to wait days to get a ticket response while you are offline.
---
Back in my day they actually had enough gm's on staff to help people with issues.
---
It's sad. I used to attack Chillwind all the time....by myself. Had a blast trying to fight groups of level 55-60 people as a warlock.
---
The challenge and excitement of world PvP is ruined by people like this.
---
People were given the choice of PvP or PvE servers, they chose PvP.
---
High pop servers had queue times and were encouraged to leave for other servers, they didn't.
---
It was a very common warning that once the honor system hits for the dominant faction on those servers to be ganking and camping people, no one left.
---
Everyone wanted the advantages of being on a huge server until they had to face the drawbacks of them.  People knew this shit was coming and warned people.  THey had their chance to leave and didn't.  They specifically asked for faction specific transfers even though the entire history of wow has shown people don't like transferring away from mega servers.
---
People have gotten exactly what they wanted at nearly every step of the way.  They only don't like how their choices has ended up being bad.
---
No, the army ranks are a game mechanic. We're not actually soldiers. We're just nameless adventurers.
---
You're right they're not equal at all.  
---
One is a russian basement dweller who cant succesfully host a server capable of large scale pvp battles, and doesn't use god awful batching.  
---
The other is a multi billion dollar company who will do everything to make as much money as possible by doing as little as possible.
---
If you don't think the state of the first clip in the OP is completely unreasonable then you're delusional.
---
Oh, so it's not because horde has better pvp racials AND because people knew most pvpers will choose it, eventually making it safer faction to level and manage open world activity even if you don't like pvp? Gotcha.
---
As a warrior you easily get your hit on other pieces. Post raid you have Lion Heart Helm (2%) Ony Neck (1%) Striker's Mark (1%) Onslaught Girdle (1%) and BDS 2 piece bonus (1%).
---
Most warriors already dropped Truestrike for Valor or the leather pauldrons from DM West
---
Also named "FinishManlet" so maybe he just likes to disrespect his own race
---
Because ots beyter than a devilsaur composition if you habe flameguards. Its pretty clear to see. I think your just blind or bad at math.
---
I'd say rogues have a higher skill ceiling but Shamans have a much higher skill floor.
---
While this sucks, why would Blizzard be on the hook for this? 
---
He wasn't using some third party tool to scam you, it was just a standard player interaction gone sour. I just don't know why anyone would think Blizzard has a responsibility to do anything about it when the only rules being broken were social ones.
---
I still have Mirahs too. Still no compendium has dropped in the zillion DM runs i have done. On a good note, i did get the Left binding sunday night, so i have that going for me at least.
---
What did the Finish do to you "FinishManlet"
---
Pretty sure it's not as drastically bad as most say.  I cannot level as horde on Biggles.  I'm in dungeons or I'm not getting XP.  Just hit 55, every zone past tanaris has been total cancer.
---
It isn't even up for debate whether or not you're being passive aggressive when you admit to using a hyperbole in your response. How about making a point instead? I hear people respond well to that.
---
You don't use multiple accounts for solo runs resetting with an alt. You only need one, which is why you add the 2mins to pass lead. If you had multiple accounts you could pass lead instantly and not have to wait
---
Why not just roll on a PvE server? There is nothing wrong with that.
---
Yeah im illegally stopping others fun!
---
Yeah and if you are rolling for 3 gear sets you are probably gonna have a hard time finding a group. I'm also not letting an enhancement shammy heal me in any late game dungeon anyways. If they want dps gear they should be a dps.
---
I did my Solenor with no buffs, no shadow protection pots, no warlock. Was a learning curve, used my entire first spawn just having to learn and nailed him first shot the second spawn. had 20% hp left and 0 mana would have bit the dust if not for well timed bandages.
---
Yes. 
---
[Q: What are the plans after Phase 6? More content for classic or moving to TBC? ]
---
A: We’ve done most of the hard work by bringing back 1.12 so progressing to Burning Crusade would be a lot easier for us. Our plan is to identify everything we need to do should we ever decide to go this route. We want to be sensitive to the desires of our players. Some may want BC and some may not. We’ll be following the Classic community closely to help determine what our next steps should be.
---
Had this happen too. I ended up killing him because fuck the other hunter.
---
I'm sorry if me calling someone out on their immature choice of words offended you, but making incoherent comebacks won't help you in any way.
---
yes this is mostly what i was asking for, i want that bow for my hunter!
---
If you do more damage before you OOM it was still a better build.
---
In reality, you pop evocation, major mana pot, nightfin soup, etc.
---
Should have rolled PvE carebear.
---
Just curious are you using cleave instead of heroic strike?
---
Tried to 5 man for 1 week, only to ever meet 10-20 man groups. So obviously that's the response. Currently our slightly disfavoured faction concentrates on holding important points, where you can farm dungeon goers. Blackrock, Dire Maul and LHC. The rest is horde territory. To reach Blackrock you have to die 10 times, but fucking blackrock is an alliance bunker since 5 days.
---
Gratz man that’s absurd. A fury warrior is only as good as his weapons this is huge for you.
---
Yep, same problem comes into play with DKP. We use a rank based round robin type of loot system. Core raiders -earned through 4 weeks of solid attendance, performance, and attitude after being accepted into the guild as Raider, which takes a week as a trial, are given first priority. Even then, we had people passing on best in slot gear to be first in line for big ticket items like Mageblade, Staff of Dom, Eye, Leaf, Brut Blade, Vishkag, Deathbringer, talisman of Ephemeral Power, etc. 
---
In the end, the only thing we could do was make those big ticket items a /roll for core raider classes whom the item was prioritized to, and if you got say, staff of dominance, you had to pass on Mageblade, and vice versa. We also prioritize certain drops to specific classes until everyone in that class has the time. For example, Vishkag / Brutality Blade are prioritized to rogues, since we are hoarde and axes are best in slot for warriors, and 2h fury is also a viable spec due to windfury totem and hamstring spam (yes, it's a thing).
---
Those options already exist
---
If you read the post about the trade scam, Blizz has stated that classic has limited support by design.
---
I'd actually go with a hybrid spec for both. 
---
The more prot focused one should go 11/0/17 and then put everything else in protection.
---
The support one should go 11/0/21 and then put everything into holy.
---
This allows you to use imp retribution and sanctity aura in unison, which is a very powerful damage return und boosts both your consecrations by a large amount.
---
Lmao this theory takes the hat. Doesn't get any more ridiculous than this one.
---
This woulda been a lot better on the realm forums.
---
I don't play on a PvP server, I have no stake in this. When reading all the hundreds of complaining threads about pvp and about server factions dying because nobody wants to play anymore, I think as a programmer "if I had to address this but got no time from my boss to invest on the problem, what would I do?" - and this is the only logical answer.
---
If the opposing faction on your server is dead, come BGs the rest of your server will die. Because nobody gets to play.
---
Imagine not having stealth 🗿
---
Boomer mentality
---
they dont drop from lashers, but there r two spawn spots for books in the lashers room. also the other spot for spwan is behind the tree as u get in the instance -the tree behind imp across the gap on balcony(tho i never go see if it has spawn there)
---
Yeah! That's it! Although I only read that term in the XXX College hazing category :D
---
use TSM ffs
---
One thing is don’t let the downvotes and upvotes interfere with you and your son playing. Some people will downvote because it’s not elite level WoW shit or about honor farming
---
Your channel looks great and to be able to game with your son and him with his pops is something one can take for granted. 
---
You have a great family based on the way you guys hangout in the video and that is the biggest thing and I’m happy you’ve stated that too. 
---
Keeping kicking ass man and congrats on the mounts!
---
Theory crafting != Real World application
---
&gt; First UBRS run
---
Or, you know, it could be for attunement?
---
The only time alliance have control of LHC is when the children go to bed. Literally the only time I've seen it clear of horde is in the middle of the day when population is low or after 11 pm server time.
---
I was grinding most of the day in epl last Friday during the day not a single gank until about 4 pm server time when all of a sudden the zone is overrun with horde.
---
Because it didn't take an hour to get halfway to brd before I just gave up and said fuck it. But thanks chief
---
Dadgamer spotted.
---
I enjoyed this.
---
5 debuff limit vs 32... having to go through BRD to get into MC... the class changes which improved basically every class.. I agree this is big, but MC/Ony are a joke because of the patches.
---
&gt; experience the story lines
---
If it makes you feel any better they're pretty much the same bullshit fetch/kill quests you've been doing for the previous 50 levels. 
---
You're not really missing much.
---
He's not wrong about that, it just adds less to your dps than the other trinkets.
---
I did 50 runs on my Rogue and never saw the MH drop...
---
Got a MC dagger and switched to daggers!
---
Congrats on the good luck
---
Yupp, we had a guildie that joined a UBRS PUG, won briarwood reed and then decided to leave the group despite it being a full run. He was a good DPS, but no longer member.
---
Honestly, if I could transfer to Westfall, or any other PvE server, I would transfer immediately. 
---
Last night, at 11 PM server time, on a work night, I went to go run UBRS for some guildies to get attuned. It took me over a dozen deaths to get there, and the only reason I made it there so easily is because around death 9 a small group of Alliance tried to fight back, and we were able to kill the 10 Horde near the ramp. The other Horde were coming in from both Thorium Point and BRM though, so I then abandoned them as sacrifices and ran into the mountain, where there were only about 7-8 Horde waiting to corpse camp, letting me get through with only a few more corpse runs due to their lower numbers.
---
I'm fairly sure that the GM's are having way more fun monitoring classic than retail. Because there is so much just... random anarchy happening and there is less systems in places. Especially now that layers were disabled.   
---
Because on retail the game world is so automatised because of layers, phasing, and x-realm.
---
I can't say sure, but I think I'd rather be watching the insanity unfold in game, and occasionally scaring people who I suspect being bots. (Quietly farm some spot for a long while, a GM will whisper you soon enough.)
---
I have nipples Greg. Could you milk me?
---
Dueling is 100% the exploit here.  Mind controlling is part ord the game.
---
News to me, do you have a source on that?
---
this post &gt; homers iliad
---
Not sure how this is any different from just spamming sap/polymorph and waiting until honorless target wears off. That GM needs to get off his power trip.
---
It’s fun while leveling up but I think just has such a weakness either your mana pool goes way too fast or rng sucks and you don’t get a proc but as I was leaving SM yesterday a 35 rogue was running by and I just followed him until he stealthed, flameshocked him out because I just stayed on top of him, got two wf procs and he was gone all within in like 5 seconds so it can be really satisfying.  I think I’ll stay enhance as long as I can just because even if you DO get stomped by someone that’s outgearing you or outskilling you it’s like there’s a chance you actually can kill them if you get a good proc and get that sweet revenge comeback dopamine you know?
---
60 priest who would MC fort on occasion while leveling, you cannot bubble iirc.
---
Lol but boomers invented video games and the video game all day everyday mentality
---
Hey I'm on mograine too, good server, if you choose the allies hit me up, I am level 59 but I have a level 6 mage alt I'm gunna be using soon
---
Which means it’s not at a touch of a button but rather at the touch of a button and x minutes of gold farm. Which is the whole point, to not incentivize people to swap from their spec
---
what's the quickest way to get Sword training as a Human rogue that just got to Goldshire? I've never played Alliance before, do I need to go all the way to IF?
---
It's not about the gold though, quests "feel" better when you complete them at their intended level. At least for me.
---
I mean, it usually doesn't because 9/10 times people sit by the entrance at the chokepoint.
---
then just log off and do something else ;) and wait for bgs i guess
---
I don't care what population % says, I respect your guys ability to group. You always have BRM under control and have tons of gank squads. Don't think horde on herod have it easy!
---
Lmao right
---
If you get ganked on your Level 30 alt by a Group of 2-3 other Level 30's.
---
You then Switch to your main to Fck those dudes up.
---
You get there just to have them laugh at you for being so stupid to think you can attack them with your main.
---
You Switch to your alt again.
---
Repeat
---
Yeah, zoomers ruin everything
---
Ofcourse they will because they have the number advantage... how is  that even a question?
---
My comparison is a perfectly fair comparison because only characters matter... each player character ingame counts as one. So if you intend to multibox something that has a playercap, you will have to obey that cap. You cant go into a BG with 5 characters and be counted as one even if you are the only person controlling them all.
---
Can you pm me the locks name? As i play on the server as well.
---
Chest worth 3 silver today, a epic worth hundreds tomorrow. Wouldn’t want anyone I couldn’t trust in my guild personally, but you seem comfortable having ninjas in yours.
---
Exactly, if there are only 2 druids on the raid with the first one being completely geared and this boomkin keeps getting ''free'' loot, he's gonna have way more points to compete for the high tier loot like Staff of Dominance or the choker from Rag.
---
I'd be pissed if one of my caster dps lost gear for a boomkin that does less dps than an undergeared spriest because he kept stacking his points since he doesn't have to spend any for his T1 set.
---
My favorite thing to do is get on the boat to Ratchet with a low level guy, equip a fish in my OH, and then kill him with it. Never gets old.
---
Welp.  Someone took this way to serious.
---
"You are horde on your character you invested the last months in and can't play anymore. What do you do? Right, you quit."
---
I mean, how is spending 1hour corpse hopping to BRM any different? At least once horde logs in they can play. They can quest, farm, gather, run to dungeons. Alliance just get corpse-camped literally everywhere.
---
Ew.
---
Mmhmm. It'll incentivize world pvp while allowing lower levels to get into dungeons without corpse hopping. Instead of BlackRock meatgrinder, they'll spread out to other zones.
---
What are you talking about it? The way he typed made it seem like the 60 hunter was more entitled to the pet because of his gear, while he wasn't. It's about him, not the other hunter. Christ.
---
WoWhead is a great tool
---
Cheap fire protection positions for the raid go a long way and greater ones for some heals/tanks can save wipes. 
---
Clear communication is what makes it easiest so don’t be afraid to step up and voice your concern or idea! 
---
MC is exciting when first going in. Some people downplay it because they have it on farm but it is a fun experience to have. Relax and enjoy it!
---
Haha yeh i agree 10k is probably waay to much. And i have only seen 1 guy advertise to craft it on my server yet, i was told that i was the third on the horde side with it but don't know how reliable that info is.
---
&gt; But flying worked fine in TBC
---
Flying was only 60%, slower than epic riding. And epic flying was quite expensive and not something you just bought when dinging 70.
---
I was using the ground mount and public transportation quite a bit because it was faster then the normal flying mount.
---
hot take: you're S H I T
---
They really dont care unless its real harrasment.
---
It is definitely not wasted stats. Generally you will see a lot of hit on prebis, but not neccesarily because the hit is so good, but because they give hit + a ton of other stats. Like devilsaurs set gives 2 crit 74ap AND the 2 hit
---
DEFINITION OF A HORDE
---
Dude, I joined a hardcore BDSM erp guild on moonguard once. I was NOT PREPARED for the shit I saw in guild chat. Like I just randomly joined their guild because they sent me an invite. Whatever, I don't care, I didn't listen to what they said to me either(I should have). Next thing I know someone posts a link in chat, and I click it. Instant regret and I have to go in gchat 'What the fuck guild did I just join? I'm just here because my server is down. Also, the fuck is wrong with her nipples?'
---
&gt;  come BGs the rest of your server will die. 
---
Cross Realm BG's.
---
I don't have to now that world pvp is a thing.
---
I feel like same faction griefing like this should be a soft ban for a day or something. This totally goes against what the game is all about. You are supposed to help your faction not hinder it.
---
Care bears everywhere
---
* First of all and it's something not obvious to people playing a lot: when you play casually (and people around 48-59 are mostly people playing casually) it's a lot harder to find friends because casual players are playing less and therefore it's way harder to sync than hardcore player who are always online and have two hours to run an instance.
---
* the day of "lfm BRD" at all hours of the day is gone, there's still group (don't make me say that it's impossible) but the big chunk of player is 60
---
* It's still 'unfair' that people who happened to be 48-59 have to play the game in extra hard mode when other people were able to breeze and do whatever they want because there was hardly any PvP before phase 2.
---
realistic scenario for alliance: you get ganked by 5-10 level 60 horde. you do nothing because you cant kill 5-10 level 60 horde. if you do, they'll come back with 2x what you come back with. For alliance, its just a numbers game
---
RetAil is your kinda game, you seem stupid enough for it
---
Sure but then make it so low levels can't attack the red players either. Basically force everyone to fight in the 12 lvl range only lol.
---
Former Bleaumeux player here, only ever had 1 15 min queue like a month ago and I played during prime time 6pm-9pm server time. Blaumeux suffers from being horde dominated. Last data I saw said 68/32 Horde/Alliance and as an Alliance char, I transferred off that server.
---
The same players that left Skeram for a similar reason are now doing it on Heartseeker? Sounds about right.
---
you're braindead lmao
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
Boomers not understanding how discord works propably
---
No faction changes or paid transfers are available. 
---
I don't know if server cap is a bigger problem than balance or the other way around. All I know is that both factors that compound on each other in an incredible manner. Whereas we could have imbalanced smaller servers and both factions could play in the world - and whereas we could have perfectly balanced megaservers and both factions could play in the world - imbalanced megaservers mean that the losing faction is basically disqualified.
---
This would result in level 47 alts that start ganking maxed players.
---
Indeed, but Juju’s was easy to farm (atleast power).
---
Since it gave Rep and fire water aswell.
---
Now in P2 it’s a tad bit harder, but probably managable.
---
I’m not saying we need it, i’m just saying it’s fun to go all out.
---
Besides, there’s always this healthy competition between people.
---
Alot of people bring various consumables to speed things up, and to have a DPS race (without interfering with the tanks).
---
Personally, If i’m online, i rather go do/farm something, rather than stand around in IF/Orgrimmar.
---
So i already have a bunch of consumables stacked up in bank, and i will save the majority for BWL.
---
That does not mean i can’t enjoy myself in MC though, since it’s time i used farming things anyway, being productive, instead of running around in a capital city waiting for something to do to find me.
---
So I guess 60's just don't PvP then...?
---
so again, nothing is raid wide.
---
&gt; Even a raid boss I don't think you need 100% shield block uptime.
---
For current tier bosses, you definitely don't.  You do need to be able to keep it up during certain stretches of fights though.
---
Sounds about right. At this point in the game, I'd expect most factions to have anywhere from 1-3 recipes. We have at least 1 that I know of on Alliance side on my server, and I believe 2 on Horde side.
---
Level 60 NE dual wield fury warrior looking for some guidance on hit % recommendation for dungeons. I don’t have edgemasters (they run for like 700g on my server). 
---
I understand &gt;9% hit is recommended for raid dps. Is any hit required for dungeon dps? I have a big mixture of hit/crit gear and I’m having trouble figuring out which I should favor in places like strat/scholo/ubrs. I don’t raid often, I just like running 5 mans. Tanking all the time got really boring, but fury dps has been a lot of fun.
---
Sooo more important question. Are the exhalted wsg epic pants also in game starting the 10th? I mean thats way easier to grind then kazzak pants for me
---
SORT BY NEW GIVES ME LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
If that's where the trainer is. Yea. Did you ask the SW weapon master and that's where they said? If so, that's where you gotta go.
---
Take the tram. It's super quick.
---
Very cool. Think this is doable as a lock?
---
Incendius is large pop PvP and has an alliance majority. They camp everything all the time
---
Druids can remove curses and changing forms removes slows. Soni don't know about the curse dropping on shape shift but it prob would remove it. If not just decurse and solved the warlock problem.
---
It doesn't matter because it's player choice driving these decisions.
---
No one wants blizzard to get involved until it is a problem, and the solution is always to fuck someone else over.  Faction specific queues because let's fuck over horde!  Let's make the server PvE so anyone who chose it to be a pvp server gets fucked!
---
Even if Blizzard had capped the server pop as they were released, you would end up with virtaully every pvp server being stuck at a 60/40 horde split AND people bitching that the servers are all dead.
---
Blizzard developed solutions over time, cross-realm and sharding.  People determined those are shitty retail mechanics and thus have no place in Classic. "Well the server pop is higher than in vanilla".  This is something the VAST majority of people had almost no issue with until the patch came.  In fact most people loved it and were willing to sit through queues to stay on those servers because it meant being able to do an MC pug at 2am.
---
Here's the reality, world pvp died as WoW progressed because it wasn't that great.  Either a server was horde/alliance dominated and any sizeable pvp was onesided, or it was just people ganking each other.  Arenas and BGs didn't kill it, the playerbase did because it was never some glorious even battle.  It was always one sided.  What we have now is a large amount of tryhards going out to try to power through the system and it will largely die down in the coming weeks.
---
When people bitch about retail they talk about how the game is mostly single player and they want action in the world and to build a community!  Well not people are bitching about how they can't go play out in the world alone?  Why don't they go build a community to kill the rampaging horde?
---
People want community in their server, but then flock to mega servers where you are a member of a faceless mass of players.  I knew a much higher percentage of players on my vanilla server than these people know on their mega servers.  If we wanted a world boss, we had to work with the other guilds to pug it quickly.  If you ninjaed somehting or fucked your rep, it was harder to hide because people knew who you were.
---
This is the reality of wow.  The way people behave and what they say they want are drastically different.  The only thing they really want to to be able to do what they want when they want and everyone else need to allow them to do it.  They don't want a game with obstacles they have to overcome, they want to play the game their way.  This has always been the issue and it always will be.  It isn't unique to retail or classic, it has been this way since vanilla.
---
Your response is gold. I'll be using that in the future... lol!
---
Was having plenty of fun, that is until I hit 50. Spent a week trying to get dungeons together. Hardly any luck my guild was fun to play with and easy to group with until everybody got to the mid-50s. feels like a waste of time just sitting in front of my computer waiting for something to happen. Might not pay for subscription next month.
---
It's the fencepost problem. The instances are the posts, the resets are the fences. It's not that you can place 5 fenceposts per hour, it's that you can place 4 fences per hour. And if it's your first hour, that means you've placed 5 fenceposts.
---
Thanks for the analysis!
---
Its a win/loss situation. But it feeeels soooo good haha.
---
idd idd, but pls dont talk about the mushrooms ;) ppl seem to forget lashers drop them and u can get around 5/6 of them each run by picking also those that spwan in hydro room and the upstairs on satyr boss :)
---
This is exactly right. Enough to make me seriously consider just cancelling my account. Literal bullshit is what this is.
---
Isn't heartseeker mostly Alliance and is a Na PvP server? so there is at least one. IIRC it was something crazy like 70-30 alliance and i even saw a report of it being 80-20.
---
You've obviously never ran a guild.
---
Because you chose a PvP server...?   Could always go back to retail and hide in your bunk house and collect mailbox epics.
---
Spy is still nice because sometimes rogue will become briefly visible but you dont really see it on your screen nor hear the sound nor can target them in time.
---
That requires a LC that is "unbiased" and not playing favorites, unless you are one of the favorites. I rather have DKP to counter a biased LC
---
&gt; Because it's bullocks.
---
So therefore you ignore it instead of voicing your disagreement and as to why that is? Alright. 
---
&gt; The most important thing in raiding right now is whole dungeon clears.
---
That's certainly debatable and depends on the context. The only metric I've ever seen mentioned in over 15 years has been comparisons of single-target DPS against single-target DPS. Then you can make niché comparisons for a select few bosses that have special considerations to keep in mind. 
---
Never have I seen serious comparisons of classes that focused mostly on their ability to clear trash quickly (because that's basically what you are arguing). I guess the inclusions of trash in regards to specs/classes being relevant is some new retail thing? Why would you not considering things like having dispel duties either?
---
&gt; You also cherry picked some bosses and left out Shazz, Gahennas, Lucifron for example and try to justify shorter times.
---
And you have no idea why I did that, despite I clearly gave explanations for the bosses I included? Things like having to dispel over a fight changes the parses dramatically. That is also the reason why I only included fights where the two classes were expected to have the same amount of inconvenience. 
---
Alright, I'll go into further detail, although I thought it would be a given as per how I described the included bosses:
---
&gt; Lucifron
---
Shadow Priests might have dispelling duties on Lucifron, as will Mages, hence the comparison there becomes very situational as one would have to account for such things. Especially considering Warriors/Rogues don't have such duties. It would make for a terrible comparison without including many confounding factors. 
---
&gt; Gehennas, 
---
Gehennas has adds, which would skew the numbers in an unpredictable fashion in regards to Rogues/Warriors. Mages likely have dispelling duties which also makes for a non-optimal comparison. 
---
&gt; Shazz, 
---
Again, Melee
---
Should be in the trade district of Stormwind. Master Woo Ping in the weapons shop across from the AH.
---
Night Elf 🧝‍♂️🧝‍♀️
---
Sounds to me like you need to join a more active/better guild. Is it faster if you are being corpse camped? No, no it’s not. You could easily be corpse camped before P2.
---
If your guild won’t take under leveled players then they are either bad (I tanked my first BRD at 51 And my first Scholo at 58 with no real issues. Also MC was cleared week one with most of the raid at 55) or selfish. These dungeons are not as hard as we remember them.
---
&gt;  I usually do a few runs around 7 am before I go to work and often manage to pick the odd black lotus and a stack or so of some other herbs that's worth decent money.
---
how long does this take you and what do you earn from this in numbers?
---
Feel free to respond to what I actually wrote at any point in time. I don't see the relevancy of your comment in regards to what I wrote.
---
Not a rogue.
---
In this hypothetical scenario you're in searing gorge. No one just sits in the middle of searing gorge picking their ass and waiting. 
---
So you wait until the people that killed you move on to the next target, or run as far as possible towards BRM, rez, mount up, and keep running until you're caught.
---
Thank you for your well thought out and detailed feedback.
---
dont bother. buy dm book &amp; the other trinket will be the ubrs quest reward
---
Heheheh just log out, change char and keep playing. I got Shaman, War, Priest all around lvl 30. I just rotate them when the enemy raid is close.
---
Incendius is supposedly a 52A-48H sever and we still have 30+ minute runs to BRD, so I'm gonna say it's not an imbalance problem.
---
I play Alliance on a Horde dominated server, but I am having a ton of fun.  It is like guerrilla warfare out there.  We are always looking for ways to ambush Horde raids with smaller groups.  I am looking forward to BGs and I know they will be fun and have good rewards, but there is a part of me that knows I will miss the time that we are currently in.  While it is frustrating trying to get into dungeon/raid portals and questing or open world grinding is impossible, I know in 6 months time I will look back fondly at the memories I am making now.
---
PVP 2 piece bonus is insane, it's best to use it whenever you can, though of course at rank 10 shoulders + boots are the best possible combination, hands + boots or legs + boots are still worth it.
---
It's a big problem with both bds and devilsaur, but at least devilsaur has the shot of being usable with the pvp set eventually.
---
I do think, neither set is too great, but I jsut don't see the value of bds. Devilsaur is great, when you don't use lionheart and when you do use lionheart you can get that last hit percent elsewhere and get non set pieces and never have to worry about breaking any set bonuses, while being about equivalent with bds.
---
This. Until aq i have no worries of threat. Warriors aren't all doing 600+ dps so deep prot with using shield block is easier on healers
---
Well, shit, then better prepare yourself for the massacre as one of the biggest Alliance guilds on Lucifron is about to trans to Heartstriker.
---
Really easy to mount up when you get sapped the second you come to life....
---
&gt; end game priest builds run about 1.4k +healing.
---
I'm sorry, what? What gear gives that much +Healing lol. Most are ~700. I'm pretty sure 1.4k isn't even possible.
---
Hey all! I am looking for someone who would like to level a fresh toon in Grobbulus Alliance side! 
---
I am planning on leveling a paladin, and would like to partner up with someone who is pretty chill and wants to level together. We can talk through discord and just spam dungeons as well, since I am planning on healing and tanking throughout the journey. 
---
My schedule does fluctuate and I am aware that sometimes one person might level more and might get ahead. That is fine with me, since I would just like to have a friend to talk and chill around:). 
---
Anyways, my time zone is Central Time and hopefully someone is interested! 
---
Take care now.
---
I understand that you want a clear confirmation on the matter.
---
It wouldn't make sense to release the old blue set version since all the items from raids and 5 man are on 1.12 itemization.
---
15hks? People who attended MC, anyone who showed up at hillsbrad got that within 15 minutes. I feel it's a fairly representative slice of active 60s. I wouldn't say the same about this week though.
---
That said, for faction balance it's the number people should care about.
---
Nobodies...the exact people actually affected by horde raids.
---
I'd Respec very very often if it was capped at 10g per. I can farm the 20g in no time and get my profit after that. 
---
I literally don't have the time in a week to do all of the other things I need to do at this point and also grind an additional 100g per week.
---
Perfect. Don’t even have the goal of getting honor anymore. Horde ruined my classic leveling experience, they won’t be allowed to level if I’m online
---
Yo this sub is a joke lol
---
For naxx we separated into sub raid groups with sub raid group leaders also together to relay info
---
Hi dad, im gay
---
No, that just means the the other classes will just pile into any group with a priest.
---
Sure but there was always the threat of punishment and item restoration in Vanilla. Also free server transfers were not as common and were nonexistent this early in the life span of the game.
---
That's not true at all. I've summoned my whole guild  to the end of DM North to get buffs
---
The game only lets you create characters on 1 faction on PvP servers. So if you have a horde character you can't create an alliance character on the same server. These people are creating multiple accounts to circumvent that rule. I don't see how circumventing the rules of the game is not cheating.
---
It's been around since beta, and is a really well known trick from all the private servers. 
---
This didn't just suddenly pop up two weeks ago.
---
Sure, just looked like he was putting himself down to me.
---
if he whispers him anything about money he is just gonna kill it lol what world are u living in
---
Fair enough. Id reckon its sensible to be skeptical about most claims on reddit.
---
Bigglesworth
---
I wish the solution were that simple mate, I really do.
---
I use to farm the first boss of DM N as shadow. 20-40g per hr depending on drop luck.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9xVf9PDzzQ
---
I dont care about breaking the set later. I care about right now in this raid wearing the best gear I can.
---
There aren't that many people who have this plan.
---
So the people who do like it have to suffer because you don't like it?  I can not like something and have no problem with it existing.  I expected this kind of shit happening so I went PvE server.  I had no interest in PvPing so I didn't want to go through the bullshit.  Other people had convinced themselves of some mythologized idea of what vanilla was like and refused to listen when told they were wrong.  You want out of your bad decision by punishing others and that is a bad course of action to take.
---
It's supposed to but you never know with these servers. Haven't tested it personally.
---
naxx builds get that high. Don't even need KT mace for that number
---
Of course he's a monumental douchebag, but you messed up by not offering him some gold or something. Now you're going to spend hours and hours more trying to get him... and that time could be spent farming gold, etc. So the opportunity cost of not negotiating with him so that you'd get it, is massive. You'd have to beat down your ego a bit with the pangs of *shouldn't have to* coming at you, but you'd have (probably) ended up with the better ending.
---
They probably waited all day too
---
Have you had a chance to transfer off?
---
It doesn't, but, could still be easily done.
---
I think the growing respec cost punishes people leveling far more than 60's. Especially new players that don't look up what to do for everything that might have a few bad talents placed.
---
50g on my 60 isn't a big deal, 15-20g while leveling if it's your first character is.
---
Doesn't mean that he deserves it more, with that logic the 60 hunter in the above video "deserves it" more.
---
&gt; My comparison is a perfectly fair comparison because only characters matter
---
I disagree. Only players should matter. Nobody cares about the experience of "characters".
---
They bought another account. The rules are that you can’t have two characters of a different faction on a horde server on the same account. If they buy another account they are allowed to do whatever they want with it...... not cheating.
---
Its a simple fix. It costs them nothing. I have all the evidence needed. And, other players have had their items restored in Classic. Do you want me to just give up on my 700g?
---
Earthfury has alliance in kargath,uc, and org around the clock .
---
With that logic nobody should pay for upgrades and hoard points and everyone can get free upgrades.
---
"For myself, on this forum (or any Reddit forum), if a post doesn't interest me in any way, I typically just don't vote at all. I'll up vote if the post interests/entertains me in some way, but I'll only down vote if the post is something I really don't like for some reason (is rude, is overly negative, etc.) -- my up vote to down vote ratio is probably 100:1.
---
But after I post these episode updates here, I notice the vote counter go up and down throughout the day. So even when the vote counter shows zero, I know at least a few people have up voted and down voted. I appreciate the up votes, but the down votes make me wonder: What was so bad about this that you clicked a virtual "I actively dislike this"?"
---
Well that's you and how you do things.  I view it more as a "would you recommend this post/content" or "do you think this was worthwhile?" thing, and no offense but there's nothing even remotely interesting to me about what you're doing here or offering as content.
---
That won't be possible unless you're being a dumbass. You can rez in a pretty large radius, and you'll be much faster than a stealthed rogue.
---
Everyone downvoting you has no coherent argument against what you’re saying.
---
&gt;ran it almost daily once or twice.   
---
wut?
---
Can't find one. Several people in my guild have said it's confirmed, but... yeah. Either take my/their word for it, or try harder/be better than I was at trying to find the source. :S
---
If anyone else has a source then feel free to share it.
---
Guilds are not different than the playerbase: the big chunk of player are 60 and if you're in the 48-59, chance are that you are a bit alone in comparaison of the dozens of lvl60. Now of course you can beg for help but is that really fun to always be asking lvl60 to help? 
---
Then it's not about PvP being fair or not it's about the fact that people in the 48-59 range must face a situation that none of lvl60 have to deal with it.
---
If only because I'm not super bothered by gearing up now since I'm far more geared than most people entering MC and helping guildies is far more fun but I must have done like 25ish Maraudon runs (all including a princess kill) just asking if the Blackstone ring drops I can have it before it ever dropped for me.
---
I play horde on Incendius and the last time I went to BRM, it took me three corpse runs just to get in the front door. The same for UD Strat last night and the day before. Flying into Everlook or EPL as horde has been an instant death sentence all week. There are almost always groups of alliance outside Orgrimmar and on the Zeppelins. 
---
I know our server has relatively good faction balance, so I don't know if the alliance are just more organized, but it seems like they have everything camped at all times.
---
Combat log radius was 50y in vanilla.
---
What a troll. I love it
---
That's the point of an open world mmo. You act like you don't in real life, because there are literally no consequences to anyone involved other than the hurt feelings of 40 year old dads not getting the 3 silver out of the chest. Feelsgood seeing you this mad over such little things.
---
Sounds like you would like retail more, you should go play it
---
I think they could done the same in the other expansions. What would been even cooler was if they had limited mounts to different zones. 
---
But overall (and I think we all agree on this) they totally dropped the ball on how they game would progress long term (Warlords of Draenor is a good example of this on it's own). 
---
Classic is actually a good example of this. As a level 60, I can easily die to a level 40 mob. But at level 80, level 60 mobs was more equivalent to level 1 mobs at level 60.
---
Each expansion just seems like an insane jump of everything from the previous because they insist on doing a full gear and content reset between level X and level X+10.
---
Pretty sure it has already been confirmed the upgraded rare PvP gear is what you can get. Atlas loot is wrong. Read it a couple weeks ago on here
---
That's messed up man.
---
How would we know though, if there still undiscovered...😳 Seriously, idk but would be cool if there are.
---
I'm not really sure, but I would love to hear these stories.
---
The distance at wich you can see players is alot fucking lower, as is nameplate distance.
---
The dungeons is of the nerfed 1.12version and they drop the buffed 1.12 gear. Turning all pve into something resembling lfr-raiding difficultywise.
---
25 min for me in EU.
---
&gt;There are plenty of ways to filter  posts so you can see the type of content you want to see, and you also  have this crazy ability to continue scrolling when you see something you  dont like. This a public forum  where ppl can post whatever they want, as long as its within the  moderation rules. if you wanted to avoid all the whiny comments then  maybe you should've made your post about what you actually wanted it to  be.
---
There are plenty of ways to avoid gankers so you can see the type of gameplay you want to see, and you also have this crazy ability to keep running when you see PvP. This is a PvP server where ppl can kill whatever they want, as long as its within the ToS. If you wanted to avoid all the gankers then maybe you should've joined a PvE server so your experience was what you actually wanted it to be.
---
I saw a dwarf trying to tame it, had to kill broken tooth then the dwarf
---
Absolutely.
---
Already on grobb
---
It's estimated not the actual time the program just guessed wrong
---
I’m only going to comment on how to actually implement a faction specific queue. Because ete be real, there’s ideals and reality. While I agree a faction specific queue is a good solution, how to actually execute that is trickier than people would like to believe. For that we need to look at how the queue work. The queue mechanisms are the same for every server, it comes into play when your account is trying to connect to a specific server. So let’s say there is a second queue now for each faction, how will that work? Will you need to jump back into your faction queue everytime you switch from your main to your alt/bank alt? Also how is the client supposed to determine your faction before your account has connected to the specific server? 
---
Case in point, there are a lot of behind the scenes issues with this that everyone loves to ignore and just assume blizz can fix this with the flip of the switch. Just know that your solution is a good one, but implementation isn’t so black and white as you make it seem
---
Its from the CE edition of WoW only if you had the original Collecters Edition you have this pet
---
They way I see it is that you're going to have to do that grind anyway to get your bis at 60 so why not do it when it grants you XP while the rest of the world is nearly impossible to progress through. The added gold of doing all the quests at 60 is nice to help you buy your bis items on the AH.
---
They issued a warning to me for opening another ticket. I think they just want it to go away.
---
So you wish all the classes to be really similar and not be unique?
---
Maybe you would like retail more
---
As someone who also waited hours a day for quite a few days, i'm sorry this happened to you.  
---
The way your heart races as soon as you see BT, its a rush.

Fuck this guy.

Yeah okay safe-spacer
---
&gt; •People should be manually tracking their threat because an addon shouldn’t be parsing the data for them
---
I think there is a difference between having an effect in PvE content and having a direct effect on a PvP environment. But that's just me. If people want to dumb down their PvE content, that's fine and all, since it doesn't really have a direct impact on anyone else. 
---
&gt; •People should be manually counting down their cooldowns
---
This is done in the base client without the use of any addons. Why include it? 
---
&gt; •People should be manually tracking quests with pen and paper
---
Why, when there is a perfectly viable quest log in game? 
---
2/3 of your examples are blatantly flawed and the last 1/3 was specifically regarding PvE, not PvP. Which, in my opinion, makes a drastic difference. 
---
&gt; If people are mad because Spy watches the combat log for enemies, then they should be mad at every other addon that watches the combat log for them.
---
That depends on the implications, at least in my opinion. 
---
&gt; This “its botting/wallhacks” bullshit is just that. Bullshit.
---
I agree and I haven't mentioned any even remotely similar to that. I honestly don't see why you would bring it up to me. 
---
&gt; If you want to sit there and call spy a botting program, them you might as well ban auction addons, damage meters, threat meters, chat filter addons, dbm, etc etc etc because they all do the same thing. Filter through data for the player.
---
I won't reply to this (see my reply to the quote above it for an explanation as to why that is).
---
And then you'll cry because you have 10 DK/hour out of nowhere because everyone will just bring some grey level healer with them to get free healing and DK for the opposite faction.
---
It’s the Upgraded blue set
---
Relogging makes it recompute the spirit-&gt;power conversion again.
---
im 60 on both my chars. But if i were to level 50-60 now. Id just open up /who and pm every single player on the server within 2 levels of me and ask if they wanna chainfarm brd jail+arena+angerforge for hours on end.
---
Absolutely not true. Classic suits my needs perfectly. It's not just for losers and stereotypes of WoW players. It's a fun game that you can play at any pace.
---
I [found something similar](Relogging makes it compute the spirit-&gt;power conversion properly. I reported on this [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dlhf5o/i_think_spiritual_guidance_is_buggy/) but alas reddit didn't think ) a while back but got downvoted to oblivion for it lol.
---
True, they can only go to 11/0/16 at that level, but any aoe-spec really needs lvl 40+ to come online, so that gives them an idea.
---
imp ret aura is quite big. It's a 50% dmg increase, which amounts to 3 dps per mob at lvl 36. Also note, that ret aura dmg is boosted by sanctity aura. So, once they get on lvl 40, they are looking at 20 dmg returned every single hit. 
---
Blessing of Sanctuary is nice as well. Less dmg than my ret aura variant, but a bit more survivability, though you can get both bosanc and imp ret aura by lvl 58. Problem with bosanc is simply, that your block chance is crap, you only have any with redoubt procs and that often causes mobs to go down unevenly.
---
That's how automation works with analyzing the last waiting times.
---
Fair enough, I don’t like those kinds of posts either! Just the consumer thing bothered me a little haha since I like what I like. 
---
Also, thanks!
---
Surely you must recognize that the 1-faction restriction was put in place to prevent abuse like this, not drive additional subscriptions, right?
---
rogue main/class lead here. the answer is Hand of Justice and Blackhand's Breadth.
---
XD imagine turning away people from faceroll MC over their spec. We 20man clear it in 2.5 hrs with our main tank wearing an admiral's hat for memes. The content is not difficult yet. This "uR SpEc is BaD 4 FiTe" mentality is cancer.
---
I would be fine with that, but it wouldn't stop the complaining.
---
Some people want to respec after every raid so they can always be in the optimal pvp/farming/raid spec.
---
Elixir of Mongoose won’t stack with Elixir of Giants.
---
Oh yeah im the mad one here. Type another paragraph
---
If your healing rotation is 'hp=not 100%, start healing' yes. You are a bad healer and do not think.
---
 If you don't heal that way it is not the case, but I have my hunches. 
---
You replied to me dude. Read the post I was commenting on, their decision on how 'warlocks play' was clearly decided. I also chimed in with my experience with being tired of seeing this constantly on reddit, but it seems like you didn't bother to read my posts either!
---
So I guess the best way to say it is your warlock doesn't need your permission to life tap, knows how to heal themselves because they got to 60 on a warlock, and is tired of hearing your TOTALLY ORIGINAL IDEA about how the warlock needs to manage their mana.
---
Unfortunately, the link you posted is very outdated information. As a member of the Horde on Kromcrush, we now outnumber alliance with probably around 65/35 with all the realm transfers, as opposed to the 55/45 the link shows.
---
Reddit does not reflect the ingame population.
---
Also it might look like the Majority is leaving, but all these post are the vocal minority.  
---
Why would you make an post if you are happy.... right ?  
---
Reddit has become a wailing wall for all sort of things people don't agree with.  
---
Doesnt mean that that opinion is the same for all and everybody.
---
Fuck. Which guild, by the way?
---
im on arugal and tonight was the worst ive seen it. I think there were about 70 horde players evenly spread from fp to brd. I died probably 15-20 times over 45minuted.
---
If you are gonna dungeon grind daggers is good but if I absolutely hate questing as a dagger rogue
---
Shrek and Donkey
---
Its not.
---
Each caster class has its own version of the staff. Depending on which class you are the staff will be "class" only.
---
They haven't confirmed anything but it would be so weird to release old pvp set that doesn't match our current itemization.
---
Wouldn't be the first fuck up from blizzard, but it seems not likely
---
Glad I'm not imagining that it has been longer than usual
---
Yeah, I normally solo grind or do quests.
---
I was a warrior in vanilla and thats why i know you have several ways to get out of there alive.
---
Welcome to development. Let me be your guide. These things take time and sometimes have layers of complexity that are not known to the user. Once the appropriate fix is found then testing must ensue. If that passes (which many times it does not), then it will be placed in the next release.
---
No, i just hate dad gamers who only whine about issues, which can easily be solved by actually being competent ingame. :) You are the reason retail went to shit. Stop whining you baby.
---
A couple weeks after launch census count was 25k+ players counted.
---
While I expect the numbers have gone down a little with transfers, dieoff etc - I don't think it's much different.
---
Those census sites say that Whitemane is 70-30 A-H so it's best just to LOL at them. They are not just incorrect. They are wildly incorrect.
---
alright if you're just going to repeat what you said last time, then I'll just repeat what I said last time:
---
Surely you must recognize that the 1-faction restriction was put in  place to prevent abuse like this, not drive additional subscriptions,  right?
---
Yea sour apple is way better then grape.
---
Felstone Killing Fields
---
I started questing in Desolace - little to nobody there and a few green/yellow quests with good xp. Green are totally doable alone.
---
Then fuck off loser.
---
Oh no one member down on UBRS how can you ever finish?!
---
What time zone are you in? It's currently 7:50 AM at blizzard HQ on the west coast of the US. The times in the message in the launcher are US Pacific time zone times, not times for your location.
---
If you are a mage you should be sitting in brd doing escort spam for 100k xp an hour. The fact that you are in the open world as a mage 52+ makes me not feel bad for you at all.
---
He's not going to understand that apparently. He's right, everyone with a different experience then him is wrong.... according to him. Lol
---
I'd argue being given a rare pet while giving nothing in return isn't a nice gesture, but maybe I'm just not used to getting everything handed to me.
---
It's simple, leave the facebook/4chan guild and find ANYTHING else.
---
Doesn't BM also have a pet IAS buff that proc's on crit? and more hits = more uptime on it.

Inukenshin is from Whitemane and Whitemane server is down at time of writing mate, you got jebaited by a private server pic.
---
Look [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22630/atiesh-greatstaff-of-the-guardian) for the Warlock version.
---
For PVP?
---
It is known.
---
I thought the one wowhead one from shortly after launch showed it as a bit more even?  Regardless, my experience over the last few weeks doesn't feel remotely even; I've seen a few Ally PvP groups but they are few and far between compared to Horde's.  Getting the last few levels to 60 is the most trying exercise in patience I've ever experienced.
---
You’re a loot whore moonkin. Reroll or change your attitude.

Upvote for visibility.

Just hope that people from your server will make his life hard when he’s online.
---
He ran it once or twice, almost every day.
---
At 38 I think you should be able to farm the rock elementals right outside of Kargath. Good XP and they drop a lot of garbage greys that vendor for a good chunk.
---
The city flight points should, too. I just feel that every 'hub' should have at least one place of relative consistent safety. City ganking is a different story. The cities also do have guards that usually roam, but a place like chillwind point has nothing.
---
You’ve got a great/hilarious sense of humor. “tAkE a cHiLl PiLL LOL”
---
I appreciate the rabbit hole of paladin aoe leveling spec discussion. 
---
I think BOSanc is more damage than you'd think because you'll still be getting crit occasionally, thus proc'ing redoubt a lot.  If you want to go "next level" you can even try sit critting to trigger redoubt on demand.   Every crit would basically mean what, 5 guaranteed blocks over the next 10 sec, which is a lot of damage returned on top of what is already happening. 
---
I guess the two points could go into improved ret aura but I just feel kind of silly having someone go all the way down Ret only to get it, when the rest of those points in prot could get redoubt, BOK, improved rf, 3% hit, improved BoP, etc.  Not like the other points in ret would be "wasted" per se but you'd be a bona fide tank with the Prot talents and you two could do dungeon grinding pretty effectively with a mage or priest if you wanted to as well.
---
Switch to swords, your life will be easier. I switched at 40 and never looked back
---
It's been eternity. I just want to log back on and buy my epic mount ;_;
---
Not a bad strategy.
---
1.12 talent trees are very, VERY different from how the talent trees were through earlier patches.
---
Pre 1.12 holy had all the best healing talents stacked in the start of the tree, with the top of the tree being weird subpar damage talents. 16/0/0 was a full raid healing build, the 35 points could be used anywhere.
---
BoKings was the ret 31-pointer.
---
The hero we need. Thanks.

I'll do you the favor of a quick education since you seem to want to argue semantics and not any actual point. Last week had the most possible players at the highest obtainable rank. I'd suggest you look at what getting to the higher ranks requires then realize comparatively its incredibly common. Weird you argued straight semantics without knowing something about context.
---
Some definitely do. The guild I'm in kicked someone because people showed the GM evidence of him ninjalooting. He was new to the guild so I'm guessing they whisper the GM of every guild he joins. He must've ninjad something really rare and it came back to bite him in the ass. That said, guilds are probably less likely to kick if it's a loyal member/friend/officer.
---
I did 7 ubrs run saw oh and mh drop twice each. Got both. Still need shoulders tho.
---
See my reply to your other post ;)
---
Sam for me, started at 14min, went to 35min, then to 12, now I’m at 15. Blizzard get your shot together. Like really.
---
There are different update times for US and EU, Never seen them do a mid-day maintenance before.
---
Lol it’s literally a chill pill get it
---
If you're Horde I'd say run SM a bunch. Plenty of Humanoid mobs, sell everything.
---
Quest-wise you could visit Swamp of Sorrows or Badlands or Dustwallow Marsh. The latter parts of Arathi Highlands or Desolace could work too.
---
Scholo is better rep overall I think, plus you get more Corruptor's Scourgestones for when you hit revered, which is what ultimately matters
---
get some fucking water goddamn that was painful to watch
---
Again that'll depend on your server. On my serve black lotus go for around 20 gold, on some of the bigger they go for 70-110. But of course, on the servers they go for 70-110 probably a lot more people are getting up early in the morning picking black lotus...
---
3 or 4 in the party were 48+ so he was focusing on killing them first.
---
Yes. A great example of this is Holy Shock paladins with full T2 and Nez'terek the Blood Drinker from AQ. The lifesteal proc from the axe gets all of the spell power bonuses and is spooky in PvP.
---
your manspreading disgusts me
---
fishing is god. mithril bound trunks all around you in pools in STV

I'm glad people are informed and having engineering and using consumables. Therefore there is better competition in PVP. Stomping headless chicken who have no idea about PVP could be fun, but not for a long time.      
---
Also people were exploiting back then, you just probably didn't know about it, since the internet was in a "stone age" in those times and information were not overflowing all around like today.       
---
I would like to know what do you expect in MMO if not organized groups=premades?    
---
You think using engineering is 0 skill? Cmon man.. You need to hit the grenades, you need to know when to pop the reflectors, you need to know when to use different gadgets and against whom. And every slot you use for engineering gadgets (head, belt, boots, trinkets) is for the price of not having regular gear on.      
---
Btw if you think engineering is 0 skill and equals auto-win in PVP, why don't you make it instead of whining? ;) Well, I know why..    
---
     
---
Sorry, but this is typical "git gud" example. The game is 15y old, but players are on completely different level today. It will never be the same uninformed inexperienced players like you was used to meet 15y ago..      
---
Ps: Since you claim to be WoW veteran, why didn't you roll on PVE server? You had to know what's coming and what the honor system looks like.
---
it says 03:00 to 04:00 CET here (im on EU, i think op is as well), yet its 16:52 in CET. I also cant log in, yet others can (which would be strange for maintenance)
---
If you are spending more than 10 minutes forming a group during peak hours your guild is not an active guild.
---
You haven't even done your research on it lmao. Each class that can use it have a different exclusive version.
---
Ah, waiting for the rank 3 discount?
---
That's weird, because honor doesn't update until 8 AM Pacific on Tuesday.
---
I don't think it is worth it. Maybe for those who can't raid, but I got two epic daggers from MC in a few weeks without having to pay any money or use any materials.
---
Rolling timer makes sense, still probably worth speedrunning the first instance to get the timer going from there you just need to do whatever you need to get 4 runs done with the next 60 minutes. Kill some lasher packs, go fuck with Lethendris etc. Good info, thank you!
---
the only boat you even have a chance of using is the one from BB to ratchet.
---
Mage, Warlock, Priest and Druid are the four classes that can get Atiesh, each class gets a slightly different one, so it requires that specific class.
---
Nobody RPs 100% of the time. I'm in a fairly serious RP guild in Grob (have played RP servers since Vanilla), we only force players to RP in /say and during events. Guild chat and /party is free speak. 
---
If you're a real RPer you know trying to RP during raids is fucking stupid.
---
Are you trolling?  You are aware of time zones, right?  Weekly maintenance is **7AM Pacific Standard Time**
---
&gt; 99.999999999999999999999999999% of your skilled wpvp, is ganking lowbies/ppl with mobs/ppl on mount/ppl drinking or outnumbering people 3 to 1

Nugg energy for sure, and while ur at it, maybe also weapon timer.good addon for fights against warriors (kite them between their attacks)

I feel offended and you should feel bad for telling the truth. i hate you, sir
---
Unless you want to log in to help guildies run dungeons. Pretty sure that's what they were getting at.
---
Ok, do you not understand how time zones work? It's not 16:50 everywhere in the fucking world.
---
DISGUSTANG!
---
Should make another for Until the Light Takes Us
---
Yes, Warrior.
---
I have Truestrike.  That's just incorrect.  It outdamages Truestrike setups when you're 2H or at soft cap for hit.  Same deal as the Devilsaur set bonus.  It's minor as far as damage goes, and depends on the rest of your gear (requires a fair amount of raid gear to outdamage Devilsaur).  Sure, might not be worth the money to some, but that doesn't make it worthless.
---
You're missing the point. Let me reiterate:
---
This gear was updated in patch 1.12 when Naxx was released to match Naxx power level.
---
Why should this be in the game 6 months before the release of the gear which power level it's supposed to match?
---
I am a dagger rogue, I am going to say no. The cost on Faerlina is like 600 gold if you buy all the materials outright, with daggers that will be replaced pretty quick in Molten Core, considering you MAY have 1 dagger rogue or possibly 2 per raid group. I have never seen a single one on my server, mainly because they aren't worth the trouble or price.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1zsil/can_i_transfer_server_from_stonespine_eu_to/). 
---
Great solution, honestly.  Higher queue time for the outnumbering faction.   Greater incentive to do a server transfer in a faction controlled server transfer.  Lowers the overall players on a crowded server while also serving to better balance the faction base of two servers.
---
Anytime, you need any directions anywhere or need me to google something as well? I just really like helping people.
---
Servers were up earlier.
---
I think the correct answer is "No, Blizzard doesn't release that info and they broke the addon that used to do it a long time ago."
---
Pretty much everyone is just guessing based on their own experiences at this point.

Guildie of mone said this the other day. He was at 300g, meanwhile, the rest of us had like 50g.
---
Can't say I'm surprised that /u/DingyWarehouse didn't respond to this.
---
Then you are running the same dungeons at 60. Why not two birds 1 stone.
---
They make the best Tuesday Off-tanks in the game, hands down.
---
Lmfao you’re pretty daft. The argument/complaint everyone is making is that it’s not true PvP.
---
Since you seem to be so wise how do you recommenced one “run from pvp” when there is over 60 players of the opposite faction camping flight paths? Take Rez sick maybe.. oh wait, there’s another 30’camping the graveyard! 
---
but yeah, great input on the overall issue. Pvp will be great for you when the opposite faction on each of the imbalanced servers becomes non existent. 
---
Thanks for proving my point btw. Have a great day!
---
Woooow what a sack of shit.
---
Praise the Banana !
---
You definitely can, I don't know where your information is coming from.
---
Three man eye of shadow farm looting 3 eyes in an hour was nice. About x12 more efficient than what I tend to get farming dungeons.
---
We will live, they will die.
---
What can I say... I'm a man of classics.
---
Lol.... Right you are!
---
Are you claiming 16:50 is in the time period of 0300 to 0400?
---
Hey!
---
Every 30 minutes.... i can kill an elite 5 levels below me. :P
---
This is incorrect. 
---
The rewards come with the honor system. This was already stated and confirmed by blue posts ages ago, and also confirmed today by players. OP’s question was about the pre-1.11 set or the 1.12 set itemization. It has been confirmed the itemization is 1.12.
---
Same, I'm not sure what they're talking about.
---
only those 6 are now
---
We were trying to, the best we got was a 57 warrior on the second day. Were at least able to get the mallet so that's nice
---
I remember having a lot of problems holding aggro in low level dungeons. Also, PuG DPS will rarely be willing to throttle DPS even at endgame dungeons, and some classes (most frequently Mages) will most often AoE. The good news is that having threat bounce around a bit isn't really gamebreaking in dungeons, and, as long as your healer can handle it, your parties should be able to relatively efficiently complete dungeons even with DPS grabbing aggro sometimes. Also, as a Druid, your threat gen both AoE and ST is comparatively strong, so you'll have to worry about this issue even less than averagely geared Warriors. Tanking for PuGs will rarely feel tidy, but what matters is the job gets done. I'd encourage you to stick with it.
---
No one in my groups has ever taken longer than 15 min ever to zone in. Ever. I play a lot. I run a lot of dungeons as I am one of the MTs for my guild. Never have I seen it take more than 15 min to get from Thorium to BRD ever. Which is my experience but if you are rezing at the edge of your Rez area you should always be moving towards the zone in. I’ve seen a swarm of horde from the landing FP till the zone in and it still only took us 15 min for all of us to Zone in.
---
If it makes you feel any better it wouldn't make any difference people would still gank you just for fun.
---
You mean, like on PvE servers? Yeah, if that's what I wanted, that's where I'd be playing.
---
it's 14 hours since 0300. What are you smoking?

I spilt water on my keyboard and talked shit in the barrens

Not every server is horde-dominated, though.

So please never ever say that it's maintenance time when it's clearly not.

But you can’t have your cake and eat it too. You can love PvP but you’re describing and complaining about the exact opposite. I just don’t understand I guess... this stuff comes with the territory of PvP servers.
---
I mean I probably shouldn't have to explain why an entire race isn't evil, their are plenty of Forsaken who aren't don't associate with Under City or even sometimes the Horde.

Uh, neither? I am playing on max settings. The point is that you can't see people far enough in the distance to avoid them.

Like wtf? Disc priest go get Benediction and stfu. Healers getting butt hurt about not being able to roll on the Choker?! That +1 healing and like +2 int upgrade from a dungeon blue. If they're gonna beg for that then they shouldn't have any problem with enhance shammy rolling on tier gear or shadow priest rolling on tier gear. Crazy.

I'm playing alliance on Shazzrah. Fadeleaf farming is impossible and getting to BRD for pickpocket runs is hard even for CB/Prep rogues.
---
If you can get your hands on an instanced farm of anything primarily sourced in open world, you make good gold. Scarcity is good for business.
---
"Its more masculine" lol
---
wouldn't deep woods be cheaper / better?  and rivenspike debuff gets replaced by Faerie Fire so not too useful
---
Specs are meant to make you special. You have to CHOOSE, you cannot just do everything. Personally I wish that past 50g it would reach a hard cap where you cannot respec at all until some time passes and the cost decay sets in. Dual Specs was a terrible change and one of the biggest reasons I quit original WoW, lowering respec costs would have a very similar effect.
---
Ah yes, being positive about retail and suggesting achievements get added.
---
This will go over well.
---
No, they will be down for a bit for the tuesday update
---
Right, I'm not blaming the horde for the problem created by Blizzard. I'm sure many horde feel compelled to corpse camp, FP camp, etc because they are competing with all of the other horde for honor. It doesn't change the reality of the situation for alliance though.
---
was this on rattlegore? because fuck that guy
---
It's still down for maintenance.
---
Servers are down lol.
---
On whitemane these sell for 19g-30g (those are the exact prices of the ones listed right now)
---
Biggelsworth is 24% ally 76% horde. Will blizzard step in to fix it or will the server just naturally die? I can’t do an instance without dying 5-6 times in a row. Might have to move servers sadly.
---
Bullshit, it takes 10+ deah runs on alliance fairbanks. I've sat in the dungeon for 6+ hours the past week watching people make the run. 
---
10+ deaths. Many have rage quit trying to make it in, it's very brutal to have almost all 4 arriving and one leaves because he isn't metal enough to make the run.
---
This problem is like a cut major artery. Wow will die if we don't do something crazy fast. People are leaving like rats leaving a ship.
---
&gt; It should be a dishonorable kill and should remove honor from you.
---
No, it shouldn't. There are PvE servers for a reason, go play on them if you can't handle playing on a PvP server.
---
&gt; Nah that sounds more like Vanilla to me tbh.
---
Having all information available spoonfed directly into your HuD in a easy-to-read fashion sounds like Vanilla to you? Alright then. 
---
&gt; There were way more completely broken addons in Vanilla that Blizzard actually did end up removing by limiting the functionality.
---
Why would you bring this up? They cannot remove the functionality without removing the Combat Log basically. 
---
&gt; Remember decurse?
---
Aye, decursing addons still function pretty well last I checked.
---
I mean you wanted 60+ Elite guards for flight points in the wild when even a city like IF has only 55 Guards without stealth detection. And to be fair its fine the way it is. The world is not out there for you as protection, **you** should be the one protecting it. 
---
If you want more hand holding with stronger guards in every zone I recommend the retail version of the game.
---
And what % are the single target parses where you dont have sweeping strikes?
---
That sucks.  Before classic came out there were polls out that gave indications of what to expect for H:A ratio.
---
The flirt is like "I'd like to see you in a kilt if you know what I mean". They also have a joke that is "No they're not real, but thanks for noticing". 
---
The durotar one is a rephrasing of the \*Insert Race Here\* guy with a parrot joke that has been a staple of racial humor forever. "So, an orc walks into a bar with a parrot on his shoulder.  The bartender says 'Hey, where'd you get that?'  The parrot says 'Durotar.  They've got them all over the place!' " 
---
Draeni one was "Do Gnomes have a vibrate setting? I'm just curious."
---
&gt;competing for speed runs
---
Ok so less than 1% of the playerbase? Probably 1% of 1%? And in those guilds, you think those players don't have anything better to do than troll around badlands fucking with their own faction?
---
nah that'd ruin silithus quest for rhok'delar. it's fine.
---
na its just you. They sent a patch your way that just makes all your servers gray. The rest of us are online and playing.
---
Are you ally or horde? If you're horde on biggles let's get you some mats
---
At Exalted there's +5 all resist enchant for shoulder slots and free entry to Naxxramas.
---
Ok just checking since ever since classic launch each tuesday update has been no longer than 15 mins till you can get back in.
---
Imagine being butthurt over how other guilds you're not in function.
---
I’d recommend skinning/mining, and stockpile mats to level the engi, and sell the excess
---
You seem pretty clueless to whats happening in BRM alliance side.
---
If you can single out what's triggering it, you could set it's alpha to 0% without harming the overall functionality of your auras
---
We havent used them. It s on schedule next sunday.
---
Actually its more like year 25. 
---
If you wanna be immersive here...  classic/vanilla takes place in the year 25 since the opening of the dark portal is considered year zero.
---
"NEEEEEEEEERD!!!"
---
Also horde on Herod, it took me 40 minutes to get in BRD yesterday., then 30 to get into UBRS. This server is obviously horde favored but idk why people are mad at you for pointing out that alliance holds down BRM in massive groups
---
I KNEW IT!
---
Find any closest guard and ask for directions.  
---
It's either SW or IF (but IF is less than 3 minutes away from SW because of the Deeptram)
---
They are releasing content based off player subscription numbers and watching when they rise and fall. When theh start to drop, they anmounce somenew content to be added in a month or two, forcing you to second guess cancelling your subscription.
---
If you value being able to play World of Warcraft and World of Warcraft as nothing, then why are you paying them?
---
Properly geared dagger rogues are close to properly geared sword rogues, though not quite as good. Daggers are a bit harder to gear for, though. It's a decision to go either daggers or swords, and then your raid has to gear you properly (priority on the dagger gloves, daggers, etc.) Even then, it's not quite as good at bis as swords, I think. You do it so that dagger gear doesn't get wasted.
---
Yesterday I landed in hillsbrad foothills, chatted with some guildies and formed a raid, then turned on my pvp flag and went nuts for about an hour. When I got bored, I turned off my pvp flag, few to a different zone and collected herbs in peace. 
---
I don't miss anything about pvp servers
---
probably for hemo for more raid dps?
---
Not if the hunter is multi shooting and weaving aimed shoot well. Both of those add damage to an attack.
---
And Arcanite Reaper, my server, is one of them. Since I'm alliance I'd definitely want to know who to look out for.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4398_Bigglesworth
---
top 5-10 guilds in each faction in each server is not 1% of the server base...
---
The amount of people playing classic who are absolutely trying to min/max everywhere were always going to be doing anything they could to max honor.  Without BGs they were going to have to kill anyone they could find.  These are also people who are spending a minimal amount of time raiding each week because either they aren't, or have it down to 90ish minutes a week.  There is nothing else for them to do.
---
Yep that's the ticket. If everyone on an imbalanced server re-rolls to the dominant faction, the problem will go away.
---
&gt; p2 probably increased the pvp
---
*Probably?*. Lol, P2 increased PvP exponentially!  In P1, there were basically a handful of zones (stv, hillsbrad) where pvp was the norm as opposed to most people leaving others alone to quest/farm.  Now, literally every zone is all out war at all times.
---
Did you read it? It's not a Horde vs Alliance issue.  It's a faction ration imbalance issue.  It's a gameplay issue.
---
Coming from someone that rides horses as a hobby...  id honestly insult you cause youre being toxic, but its too easy
---
honestly, I just switched to herbing so I can alc on an alt. If you plan on PvP you're gonna spend the most money of consumes and I enjoy being self sufficient.
---
That doesn't help folks on servers with a 70 to 30 faction bias. I just feel that flight points as relative 'safe' points (or harder to take and hold) would be a positive change. You're obviously welcome to disagree. Perhaps you're right and the main cities should be better protected as well, though I don't believe that level of coddling to be necessary.
---
No... And even so that would be 1 rogue tops.
---
Just cause it's blue doesn't mean that getting Dal'Rends is particuarly easy. I have seen rogues get Viskag while waiting for the MH.
---
Since when are combat swords higher dps..
---
ony resets every 5 days and if you split run it you get more shots at viskag faster then you can get shots at perd
---
By the end of the age of PvP/PvE realms in retail, many PvP realms had existed for years at 80/20 or worse ratios, Illidan being maybe the most recognizable and egregious example. If the game truly feels unplayable to you, then it might really be better to cut your losses.
---
yes, and to be honest 1.2 AS pets with the proc is like, .87 vs .94 or something stupid like that.
---
It's not worth the time camping Broken Tooth when the difference is not noticeable.
---
But he's saying you can make it work. Cdew does this, granted he's a top 1% player and it would take a lot to get to that level it's still a possibility. All in all play to have fun not play to please others. Calling a spec a "meme" spec is stupid imo. Everything is viable, some will perform better sure, but if you're having fun playing a spec who gives a shit?
---
Lol I ride horses as a profession nice try though
---
Totally agree with you. I kill every green i see, maybe even 2 times if i'm in the mood. But greys i let go, not worth my time. How would i get honor when single farming if i would be like "no, not gonna kill this and that" and so on...
---
Thanks so much, really appreciate it!
---
Everything is different in classic from how they were on private servers where those videos were created.
---
Leeway is fucked so mobs hit you from 10+ yards away, blizzards slow and damage are out of sync so a mob can run through blizzard, take damage, but not be slowed, etc.
---
combat swords does more dps than combat daggers/seal fate daggers right now, all things being even with gear etc. 
---
of course you might see different results based on player skill, gear level, RNG, etc.
---
Not sure because in my guild dagger rogue is top 5 dps in MC on last log. Better daggers drop from MC than swords as well so idk might be case that they don’t have the daggers yet and have Krol Blade and something which is prolly better than pre MC daggers.
---
I dunno, I might prefer Friday's off-tank. At least when it comes to Ony :)
---
You're assuming I was already in range of DoTs to begin with.
---
And this is why I’m glad I didn’t transfer
---
Just give it up, not worth it.
---
Now what about after you hit 60? \*Peeksoutsidedungeons\* Nope, still crazy AF out there. Still getting crushed by the 1/3 sometimes 1/4 ratios, alliance/horde imbalance.
---
And Heartseeker wasn't even a realm before Classic came out. Blizz really dropped the ball by releasing ridiculously few realms to start.
---
Warrior is up next :D
---
I’ll have to check once the servers are back up, but that’s what I thought. However, the thing that is confusing me is that I got a new wand last night that is more DPS than my current wand that has shadow damage. I pulled up my character panel to see what effect it had on my ranged damage. Ok so text with shadow wand was green. I equip the new wand and the next is no longer green and the damage range is less (this may Just because the new wand has a smaller range but is faster, thus having a higher DPS, but I don’t understand the change in text color). I did just recently finish SM so I’m going to check wen the servers are back up and make sure I didn’t have some buff like hunters mark that was buffing it (but in which case wouldn’t both wands show green text?)
---
Your Guilford are lying to you, to get you to pass on it so they can have it.
---
30g on Razorgore. I doubt twinks will buy it, I presume mages will prefer frost anyway. And twinks will have engineering, so Green Lens of XY Wrath is doing pretty much the same.
---
I love you.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if blizzard shells out shekels to astroturfers. It's the same script.

DS/Ruin  (7/21/21 with a few to spare) is actually fine for DM E solo farming and good for PVP (Fel Stamina+Instant Summon+Shadowburn+Instant Corruption are all very good selling points imo) You can get better/different ones, but I feel like it isn't hamstrung on any one thing.
---
Flurry axe is ~400-600g on Herod, but Edgemaster's are 1200g+.
---
Rake looks Really good at 60.
---
Humar looks small but Rake looks big af.
---
Okay fair enough. Enhancement shaman is tier 2 at best in the hands of a great player like Cdew. On average it's tier 3.
---
I had the same experience when starting, it was so curious watching alliance players screaming VAROS xD
---
That's part of what makes the world dangerous and why people get a kick out of PvP servers. Gotta always watch your back.
---
If people got bonus honor for starting a fight while fighting a mob, or when low on health, this would for sure be exploited. There isn't exactly an easy way to implement this.
---
Since always until some time around AQ~ IIRC when you get enough crit to make daggers competitive.
---
it is true and has been done to me as well. i was really confused what the hell happened but yup, its true
---
Theyr'e super cheap, start picking up even more things like arthas' tear recipe! That increases raid dps more than you'd think as well. There's lot of things you can shove into tank mouths to make them stronger.
---
If what you say is true then that sucks. Though from my experience daggers did more damage in raids (DPS) so i'm not so sure of your statements.
---
The issue with you not paying for it is around non tier gear. Since you're getting tier 1 boots for free, you're at an advantage over other classes already. When something like Staff of Dominance drops you'd have more points than the equivalent mage. For example, say they had 6 people they had to compete with for their t1 boots, and they had to use their GP and you didn't you're unfairly ahead of them for something like the staff where different classes are all going for it.
---
Nah, tailoring is unnecessary until phase 4, at least for warlocks. Robe of the void is replaced in MC (and should be either warlock or warlock/paladin prio) and meanwhile you can use winter night which is almost as good. Alchemy is the best crafting profession for making gold.
---
Sigh...
---
TLDR: Yes, blue pvp sets exist right now, this was clear before classic even launched and I'm baffled, so many people really believed, there would be no blue pvp set until phase 6.
---
Here's the explanation as to why atlasloot shows the blue sets as phase 6:
---
There are two blue pvp sets, the original set, which was released with the honor system and an upgraded version, which replaced the original set in 1.11.
---
Atlasloot only knows the upgraded set and classic will only feature the upgraded set and as that was added in 1.11, Atlasloot tags it as phase 6.
---
It is not a minor QoL change, it's huge.
---
He's a huntard and wasn't even in the run but i wouldn't be surprised.

X)

This is life for alliance on most other servers. Wait until the 10th Dec. When BGs are here alliance will at least have instant queues.
---
Grizzly is known to have and work with the horde. They also split t another guild and rebranded as DANGER ZONE. 
---
They had a massive log in of 5 ally and 5 horse charcatwrs in the remote spot in the hinterlands at the same time which I reported to a GM and they win trade honor and sell world bosses. 
---
They ruin the realm simple as that
---
I am very unhappy with the current situation on my realm (EU Gandling). I am playing horde and to say we outnumber the alliance is an understatement.
---
Most fights just result in a chase to get a hit on the enemy since you’ll be competing with 5-10 more players. There were so many people in BRM farming honor we wiped multiple MC raid groups.
---
I don’t know the solution. Maybe be open and transparent about server populations and allow cross-server faction-based transfers only in specific cases, with queue systems so the servers don’t overpopulate (1 person on each server has to transfer for it to be completed).
---
Too much hassle i’m afraid. I fear we gave blizz a “get out of work” free card with the #noChanges stuff.
---
wpvp\*
---
What the fuck is going on in here and why is there a guild with my name
---
1. You said I got jebaited by a pserver pic. 1.13 client cant connect to 1.12 pservers and 1.13 pservers dont exist (yet).
---
2. It did not, especially not with [this very specific string](https://wago.io/KSACGWwO9)
---
3. They must have been.
---
I’m sure paid transfers is coming soon!
---
Same thing happened when I was killing demons.  Hunter would come over and fuck it up because of envy.  Like.. why not just let me finish so you have less competition..
---
*urge to tell you to roll PvE intensifies*
---
Have you considered playing on a PvE server?
---
Its designed this way so it deters the ability to 'farm' world bosses. Alas, the gear is pretty noticeably better than anything prior to P2. The respawns are 100% RNG based, (within set parameters.) Unlike a retail world boss, (which seems like how you want classic bosses) classic world bosses were not intended to be camped as often. You have to 'work'for your epics in classic they aren't just handed out with your food stamps these days. 
---
A lot of players can go months without seeing their first epic, (aquired,) Loot.   Dlnt beat yourself up too much over the world bosses. If you get a roll on a kill, congratulations! That's a step ahead of the vast majority of us that play.  😀
---
Cheers
---
This, but make sure you type /leave lookingforgroup when you have finished searching because it gets pretty spammy.
---
It's true, it can work but it's not worth it. Just do DM:E Jump runs instead. It's better money and each run is 10 mins so you can stop at your leisure  vs hour long dungeons.
---
I’m not up to date on my role playing but is lol something people use often when they rp?
---
Link would indeed be appreciated
---
Possibly yea. Never experienced a faction imbalance like this.
---
Vanilla was sure as fuck never like this.
---
Back in the day this was considered griefing and could lead to account action if reported. I don't know how Blizzard CS feels about it now.
---
Did you play vanilla bro? Tell me which server you were on that allowed 10,000+ people logged in at the same time, effectively making the entire game unplayable. I'll wait.
---
&gt; This is how the system worked in vanilla bro.
---
people keep saying that, and they are still wrong
---
Just because it isn't new doesnt mean they have a fix ready for it.
---
Server is dad?
---
world player versus player
---
Not saying you won’t be able to twink, but just letting you know a lot of people who do twink plan it in advance. Especially the last couple levels. If you seriously plan on thinking, I would stop getting experience right now. Let me repeat that, stop getting experience right now. You may need to run dungeons to get items and getting those items may push you to 50. This is why a lot of people plan in advance, so they start dungeon farming items at 40
---
I heard so many horror stories on HoJ then started tanking BRD on my pally this week. Same group every time, myself, 3 mages, and a druid healer. We saw HoJ drop 3 times in 10 runs, got DE'ed twice. Just get the drop lol.
---
Oh come on alliance trash rings a bell? Its always the same on both sides.
---
just wanna say, that everyone is calling BS, this has been done to me as well. mind control + stam buff. it happened extremely quickly and couldve been a macro or something. but i have been buffed by an enemy priest in the same manner.
---
Grizzly is known to have and work with the horde. They also split with their members and have another guild and rebranded as DANGER ZONE. 
---
They had a massive log in of 5 ally and 5 horde characters in the remote spot in the hinterlands at the same time which I reported to a GM and they win trade honor and sell world bosses. 
---
They ruin the realm simple as that but since they pay more than others they get to have a stranglehold over the realm
---
There were other things I needed from the dungeons, and since I had never once seen either item it was more of a “that’ll never drop anyways so it’s yours” type of deal. Said as a joke, but I even jokingly I hate going back on my word.
---
I’m all about principal, so if I say I’ll do something I stick to it, regardless how dumb it seems. It was going to a guildy and a friend anyhow, so I’m less concerned.
---
There's no need to turn this into a silly argument. One person logs on, confirms it, end of story.
---
Damnnnnn son you got iron foe? Haven't seen anyone with it yet
---
Use your brain for a second. In this particular hypothetical you're running to an instance. Half of your 360 degrees is completely cut off because it's counterproductive. You're heading 1 direction, so you get 30 yards, to rez in a single direction. It's either top left, top right, or straight forward. Assuming there's only 1 horde (lol), he is by default covering 1 of those 3 positions. you have a 66% chance of not rezzing directly on top of him, nice. He immediately tags you with tab, hits a swiftness pot/boots/sprint/eng helmet(s)/distract/grenade/shoots gun/whatever Assuming he has absolutely none of that and no cooldowns, you're completely idle for 3 seconds to hop on your mount. Nothing says he has to be stealthed to engage a half health target, but even assuming he is, he's going to make it to you, because he's working with 180 degrees. Unless he's petting his cat or rubbing his dick, he's going to get you. That's assuming there's only one, there's not.
---
Blizzard is lazy.
---
Which is stupid
---
However this is not how any enhancement shamans play, because if shamans are actually concerned with the performance of others in their raid they spec resto... or at least ele
---
If you are in a guild of active members and none of them need BRD. Which pretty well means the whole guild is sitting in raid gear. You joined some high end progression guild as a casual player. Which was a mistake on your part. 
---
Yeah, well those people had months to hit 60. I agree that PVP came out to early but move forward. It’s out now. People need to adjust to the change rather than having blizzard cater to casuals.
---
Hahahaha.
---
What!? That’s insane high. I’m a tank on Herod (best in slot feral druid) and people gripe at me when I ask for 20g)
---
Cheating isn't limited to the what's against the ToS... There's different kinds. A Horde and Alliance agree to duel 1v1 but the Horde has his friends help him. To me that's cheating, or do you think differently?
---
Is your username resembling the containment of your head?
---
Please tell me you quoted Tales of the past 3
---
Come phase 4 you're going to need Tailoring to use the  Bloodvine set, which is BIS.
---
I'd recommend dropping Herbalism on your Lock and picking it up on an alt.
---
People generally just need BRD for a specific item that they can rush with other 60 because... they also used that instance to level and got most of what they needed.  I mean it's ok to ask once or twice for help but I'm not gonna ask to get carried in BRD from 52 to 58. 
---
And no it's not a mistake from my part: first of all cause it's my old vanilla guild and then, in the long run, in 2months when everybody is 60 then playtime matters way less as it's just being there for the 2 raid nights.
---
Finally it's not just catering to casuals it's about game design: what's the point of making lvl48 give honor to 60 for exemple? it's just plain stupid as it brings absolutely nothing good to the game.
---
im kindddd of hoping for BG's  early?
---
Leave now. All the bis healing gear is leather and mail.
---
Your guild sounds like idiots
---
Well no you wouldn't. Instead of 20 people camping a fp, you'd just have 10, or 5. Every major hub would still be camped but there would be less people.         
---
The only way to have prevented this would've been to have BG's come with the honor system or to come a week after
---
3 people took Thanksgiving week vacations so Classic lost 50% of their work force.
---
Could have just clicked on the chat name
---
That analogy makes no sense.  People chose to play on PVP servers and should understand the repercussions.
---
After few months every retail raid was on farm for most.Lets not talk how easy it would be after several years like its on classic
---
I literally got logged out with the server shut down 1.5 hours ago, was online before that...it has only been offline for an hour and a half.
---
You can give criticism without sounding like a dick btw
---
"Waaaaah these mages want standard rate for a SERVICE they provide that saves me 15 mins of my time so I can use it to go make 10x as much gold as the portal cost!"
---
I heard they asked an intern to fix server balance and he Thanos'ed it up and deleted 50% of all Horde characters.
---
That doesn't make sense.   Resto shaman cannot totem twist as efficiently.   They typically do not have improved totems.   Ele does less damage in raids, cannot twist either and ooms immediately.   I guess your statement makes sense if your raid group lacks healers...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iusUq4-f5U
---
I just farm dungeons or do duo jump-runs. I'm not making 50 gold per hour like mages or hunters, but I'm not poor either.
---
You don't understand what itemisation is. OP specifically references the level 60 pvp blues which has had no different itemisation other than what it was introduced in 1.12.
---
That's what 3 of us do :) its too good, they stun lock and I do all the burst damage. Only have Gutgore/Felstriker at the moment but still efficient
---
The honor system was my \#onechange.  I remember how bad it was and I knew it would suck, though admittedly I thought it would suck because of the grind, not because it would keep one faction from playing for a month.
---
That said, to be fair to the people that did defend it, a lot of Blizzard's changes had good reasons, and we all know where that led us.
---
Honor was always shit though, I'll stand by that.
---
Mother fucker, 0/73 haven't even seen main hand still.
---
All of those classes can do jump runs for more gold than mage can do zf for
---
There is a version of the game that allows you to be the best at everything whenever you want. If I wanted changes I'd play that version. #nochanges to Classic
---
It might be worth mentioning that more DPS on a wand is good for leveling, but it kind of becomes a stat stick when you're level 60. I don't find myself wanding often as a warlock during farming/dungeons, let alone raids.
---
seems fair to me. he's just trying to lighten up the message with emojis but hit cringe status in doing so lol
---
&gt; 19-29 and actually have fun in a live, active bracket
---
Yeah, stomping grey equipped level 14 casuals that are leveling is so much fun! Some people desire artificial self-esteem way too much.
---
Star Fox and Slippy have entered the arena.
---
Every MMO in the history of MMOs has done this for 20 years, sorry you don't get it.
---
affliction and fury. Maybe call it, deathknight.
---
My opinion on what Blizzard should do is produce a player cap for both alliance and horde on a server, allowing only a set number of each faction online at a time. This would cause the majority faction to want to transfer to lower populated realms yet retain a more even populated server.
---
Stealth works in levels (actual player levels). So as a level 60 seeing a level 60 will be a smaller distance compared to seeing a level 50. I.e. You can see a level 50 from much further away. 
---
Paranoia effectively increases the level of the warlock when seeing stealth. The rogue stealth talent does the same thing but in reverse, essentially makes it as if the rogue was a higher level in stealth.
---
Prob getting super duper high and running arena anger golem runs nonstop until I got omnicast boots. We had a good 60 tank, I was decently geared at 60 with archmage robes and only mage so I knew I’d be counted on a bit with our mid-low 50s. first run we get to anger and the axe drops ofc, we all greed except some lowbie shadow priest. Everyone keeps moving but I’m like yo why u need, and stop attacking. I demanded a payment of vendor price divided to all 4 members. I said I will not move until so, so he pays. We move on and I’m calling the dude a ninja every greed roll cause the dude kept winning every damn thing. Anyways I must’ve scared him Bc after 4 runs the omnis drop and he passed n I’m like y u pass n he’s like I’m scared lmao. I stay ofc Bc im nice like that and they drop for him next run. Anyways it was fun af Bc one I was high as shit, two it was my first time running brd in forever, and three we were getting so efficient with the runs that it was just fun to see how much faster we could push it. Had a lot of good laughs and me n priest bro both made out with boots while luck be a lady was playing.
---
So #changes?
---
Dude again I am a tank for my guild. I run a LOT of dungeons for guild mates a lot of which have been 50-60. So I run to dungeons with them. Have you ever PVPed as Prot where your only support are level 52s? Probably do BRD 20 times a week. Most of those groups are filled with guild mates that are not 60 yet. But I have no idea what I’m talking about bro sure...
---
What ret wishes it was.
---
I get what you're saying and I agree Alliance or horde it's fucked. However in this instance I'm glad it happened. I'm salty and it brought me enjoyment to watch horde screw each other over.
---
so sad to see the mage meta dissolve like this. I was a classic mage and I never charged people for shit. just made them cover mats price
---
Well if they weren't gonna before, they are now. I'm sure they'll be better off without this clown guild anyway.
---
Sounds like youd be better off playing some sort of herb collection simulator then
---
Yeah, if I were in his situation, I'd quit. There isn't much to do at 60 anyways and there are a bunch of good games that have come out recently.
---
I rerolled last month. Either do it or stop complaining jeez people it’s pretty simple. “I hate wpvp I can’t play!” “Okay we have numerous options for you!” “No! REEEEEEEEEE”
---
Beg for forgiveness.
---
If you are the ONLY person in the party with the trinket equipped, you will get 5x the stones as normal. However, your party members must still search the corpses they are eligible for in order for you to be able to loot a stone from them. None of them need to wear the trinket, but if they are wearing the trinket, they must not use auto-loot, for obvious reasons.
---
I am already Exalted with Argent Dawn.
---
Dank Budz was a shitter guild on private servers, not surprised they’re doing the same on classic.
---
As a warrior I have to say epic mount is definitely a priority imo.  This is why: you will be wearing lionheart game for the rest of classic, literally.  There's no need to rush to get an item that there is no upgrade for for the entire rest of the game, even if the helm price doubles from 1k to 2k in the time it takes to save up for the helm after buying epic mount, it's still worth it to get mount first imo.  Also, as more and more people get the recipe for it the tip price goes down and the materials for the mats are farmable so the "cost" of the helm is stagnant to a point because if the gold price rises too much for the mats you can always just gather them yourself.
---
If you’re not an asshole you don’t take resources if there’s somebody already killing the mob that was guarding it.
---
gives literally 10 honor, if not diminished.
---
Gentle warrior, polite warrior, please get in touch with your shit-talking side and get this FUCKIN MOB OFF ME
---
Consumables dont change a mc run from 5hrs to 2hrs wtf?
---
Will there be any Pilgrim's Bounty things in Classic?
---
Is it really going to be cross realm battlegrounds?
---
That's extremely disappointing if that's the case because there's a lot of well known trolling horde players I'd like to have seen inside a BG.
---
As someone who did the GM grind... I don't remember that.  I remember facing the same people over and over again, actually.
---
How about the male dwarf who has a 'wardrobe malfunction,' then you hear a spring noise, then he says 'ohhh, there's me hammer.'
---
I 100% advise this route. Since daggers/sub is god like in pvp. But solo leveling with it is cancerous. I’m hemo/sub right now (with swords) but still so much fucking fun. Can’t wait to get good daggers
---
Not saying they should put it in the game, but that's a hilarious achievement idea though.
---
I have Herb/Alch on my main and really wish I had just done it on an alt R.I.P.
---
IIRC cold weather flying requiring level 77 in WOTLK, not max level.
---
Can you possibly tell me what's the name of the song?
---
It sounds like what you really need is a life
---
To be fair, he said "9 int is something like 1sp~" and if 59.5 int = 1% crit and 1%crit = 12sp, then 59.5 int = 12sp, so 1 int = .202 spell power and 9 int = 1.8 spell power, which could be argued is "something like" 1.
---
The part that really confused me which made me ask "what are you talking about?" is when you said "you say you'd want 7 spell power over 60 intellect" When nobody said anything of the sort as far as I can tell.
---
Scholo is best. More bosses, short run (skip Jandice), and the whelps also drop Healthy Dragon Scales.
---
And every time you take a boom in instead of a mage every one in your raid has to stay a few more minutes. You can go full boomkin if you want 4hour Mc. Most people don't want that though.
---
Thought that was resolved already
---
Mauradon available on release (it wasn't with OG vanilla)
---
We don’t ‘pay’ for classic, we pay for retail. Classic is just a lovely freebie that we get for paying for retail. 
---
Blizzards logic anyways.
---
ok, boomer
---
Thank you
---
As an Alliance on Kromcrush, I wish I could sympathize. But I just can't. Not even a little. The number of times of been ganked by skull Horde is immeasurable, the number of them camping corpses, camping FP's, camping boats, it's beyond frustrating. It takes SO LONG to do ANYTHING. I'm not some kid, I have a life, a wife, responsibilities. The time I have to play is limited. The brief moments of nostalgia still make it worth it, but honestly, you are just whining. This is the game. You want it to be easy? Go play Minecraft...
---
Nice. What do you think about dagger mh/sword oh? No one in this thread has really touched on that
---
Don't have engineering yet.
---
Again, its not WHAT was stolen, it was the act of stealing, and his reaction to me asking him to stop. If you're an asshole at lvl 30, you're an asshole at lvl 60. Doesn't matter if its your last piece of a T2 set or some iron ore.
---
I swear it's not my weed, officer!
---
Real RP players download a stamina addon and switch to walking when they're fatigued. They also buy water for their mounts to keep them hydrated. If you get disarmed, there's a 5% chance you aren't able to recover your weapon and you have to trash it. 
---
\#bringrealRPback
---
Sounds like something that has happened every Tuesday around 8am Pacific time every week for the last 15 years. 
---
Retail, and call of duty are also down 
---
Gasp!
---
But no worries. It's just maintenance. Give it an hour or two.
---
If that makes you feel better about getting ganked while farming for raid mats, whatever. lol have fun I guess
---
As long as damage and healing are applied at the same time, infinite healing by priests on another player means he is invincible.
---
Definitely gets you closer to where you want to be then hah :p
---
Ok I think you just don't know what speed runs are, and that's cool, but it's not accurate. The term you're looking for is "having content on farm".
---
Speed runs are where you literally are pushing for maximum speed. World buffs and consumes are fully required, and specific comp metas are abused to get as fast of clears as possible. It's an entirely different midset vs. traditional farm guilds, which use a varied comp to speed up gearing so there are fewer dead drops.
---
It's not "dictated by your server and faction", it's a completely different genre of player and guild. The mindset, goals, and methods are just objectively very different.
---
And like I said before, we *have* kicked players for less, and other guilds we collaborate with have kicked members for being shitty to players not in their guild. Removing drama whores that make your guild look bad is more important than having some random hunter with nothing better to do than troll lowbies.
---
Can’t or aren’t willing to die a few times? I’ve landed in Thorium with the path from the FP to BRD choked with Horde and it’s never taken me more than 15 min for my whole group to zone in.
---
Characters are safe tho
---
We have a mage in my guild that only farms DME. like... unless its raid day that's where he is. He took a SS of his gold and it was over 10k. Just from DME farm. So yea I'd say it's pretty worth.
---
No one suggests Sulfuras so I'm here to sell it to you. It's a PvP server and one of the most balanced IMO. Plenty of PvP activity going on no matter what time of day it is (I got jumped by a Horde player while trying to farm water elementals in EPL at 8 a.m.) and it feels like a 'calmer' version of the much larger servers.
---
I always level with Herb/Skinning to help with gold generation while leveling and then switch to Engineering/Skinning at 60.
---
Yeah, can still sheep people and wait for it to wear off too. 
---
The MC duel thing removes the buff early, but the real kicker is being able to deny other FP campers the honor for the kill, which is now split two ways instead of between all others that are in your grp, since the target is friendly to them. 
---
At best this is a temporary problem while we get BGs and it becomes easier to find targets that give honor.  Also just doesn't work on PvE servers.
---
Waiting in queue is a little different though. If you have a queue time of 2 hrs you're not going to just stare at the screen the whole time. You can do other things and come back later and be ready to play.
---
What OP is describing is him attempting to play the game and being unable to because of griefing. If it takes him 2 hrs to finally get into an instance, he has to be present for that entire 2 hr period. Even if he leaves for rez timers, what other fun things are you going to do in just 2 minutes? It's just wasted time.
---
&gt; You can’t server hop, yet
---
No, but having free transfers to different servers isn't helping. The additional matter of having very high server populations means that this was a risk worth taking in the eyes of the scammer.
---
they already announced bgs are dropping dec 10.. which is early
---
Report it to blizzard and ask them to remove the gold. Don’t support the influx of gold created by gold selling sights aka don’t use it
---
Go engineering n something else useful? It was quite cheap to lvl up on my server anyways, n if you have a 60 already? easy life. Did it on warr, first char- cant imagine how easy it would be for you.
---
It\`s unplayable.
---
Yeah, right now we do CS and garrote. With the garrote person on standby just in case cheap shot is resisted. But ambush would be so so much more fun. I already have a blast when a priest at 60% hp thinks it’s fine, then I 5 point cold blood evis for 2250 lol.

Is wowhead the best resource to find druid pre raid BiS for bear+heals?
---
I think your best bet is to just wait for BGs in December. Start leveling an alt in the meantime. You can't get ganked in the first \~20 levels or so until you get to the contested zones.
---
Do them at 60 with a guild group.
---
You once again are incorrect. 
---
He is asking about whether the upgraded or “regular” blue set will be available. The item stats are the key component on what OP is asking for, and these are the only differences in the two sets and and this is why he is asking which set is available (aside from 58 vs 60 which is irrelevant). 
---
The PvP gear that will be available follows the 1.12 itemization. I’m sorry that you don’t understand what this means.
---
Witch hunt it is, what a scumbag, I'm gonna level a rogue on his server just to tank him into oblivion.

Your post is titled "You are leveling wrong", I was simply pointing out one of the many flaws in your logic. I have no issues with the current leveling speed. :)
---
When you learn more about game mechanics, you will understand.
---
There are no insecurities playing on private servers, time to stop with your bullshit.
---
Nope, wrong. I'm not the reason, Blizzard is the reason. You need to calm down and control your emotions. This is a video game, not real life. Get a hold of yourself nerd.
---
It’s definitely not

This is exactly how it is on Stalagg. Just with the roles reversed.

It won’t be as popular but that doesn’t mean it will be dead. 40+ is when levelling becomes less linear so people will definitely be taking breaks and doing BGs in between  zones.  It’s also the only way anyone that level will be able to gain honor for rank rewards since wPVP isn’t an option
---
I think the main issue is that we had so few servers at launch that we have mega servers pop up and people putting a lot of thought into chopsing servers because of the limited options... they were also extremely hesitant to open new ones because they were afraid of a population decline that didnt happen in a meaningful way. So then we had server transfers during phase 2, which lead to mass faction exodus on disadvantaged factions. Kromcrush had gone from 54/46 to 58/42 in only a few week span for reference.
---
Sorry hunters I once killed this guy just because rare. Didnt know its worth taming apart from rarity.

Heavily moderated forums will always, read, ALWAYS be complete and utter garbage. You see this across the internet. All it does is remove anyone interesting, and the only people who stick around are those comfortable using passive-aggression in lieu of free speech. Disgusting. The WoW forums are where most of the garbage ideas in Retail come from too. People who were around in 2004-2005 know this all too well.
---
IS THAT..... A FEMALE NIGHT ELF? OOOOOOOOUGGGHHHHH
---
The only advice I can offer is is to either roll on another server with a known-good pop balance, transfer or whatever options you have to get off of this one. If you are not getting your money's worth on this server, I would just leave and go to another one. I will also say that this also brings up a good reason why people will never leave a "full" or high-pop server. Sure it's not an indicator of population balance but I think we have a pretty good idea of which are the known-good servers now. This is not retail with cross-realm support(which like it or not, did solve the issue to be honest but introduced others).
---
That said, 15 years later it's different from what it used to be. Back in the day PvP was exactly as we remembered it. These days it's all changed, we have roving bands of players who farm the other in co-ordinated groups. Unless you are likewise in a group, you are not fighting back in any real capacity. You just get steamrolled. That's world pvp as it stands today. Times have just changed, the playerbase has changed, but the game remained as it was 15 years ago.
---
A friend of mine couldn't handle being camped and he left my PvP server entirely to join a RP-PVE server. He's been happy ever since although we don't play together anymore :'(
---
Not if you can’t play on any servers with them....

stay salty

Tell me more. What can a resto shaman do to earn decent gold (that doesn't require a tank or another person that would be better off without me).
---
Numerous? Make me a list then.
---
What about challenging shout?
---
&gt;  At this point you can't blame players
---
If you are an Alliance player who transferred to Heartseeker, you 100% can be blamed.
---
I hafe found [www.icey-veins.com](https://www.icey-veins.com) to be a pretty reliable source for BIS guides
---
The problem with that idea, is that TBC created a world that heavily relied on the usage of flying mounts. If they were to make some tweaks, TBC could come out to be a pretty interesting idea. I really loved Karazhan.
---
You serious? You are describing vanilla, not classic. This time round you won't see a single player who isn't level 19... you forgetting how much INFORMATION there is this time around?
---
OH GOD I PULLED TWO! RUN! FLY YOU FOOL!
---
Yep it has been stated by blizzard. We don't have details on the battlegroups tho
---
They already have locked transfers to Heartseeker to Horde only. It's helped a bit but the server is still really imbalanced. The Horde don't have very much motivation to transfer to an unbalanced realm that isn't in their favor. Blizzard is going to have to go with a nuclear option now such as faction specific queues to balance the realms. A lot of people will surely quit because of that but a lot of people will also quit if the realms remain this unbalanced.
---
I'm so confused why some people are of the opinion that stealing is fine as long as it's a low level item.
---
Your honor I only stole $300 from the gas station, it's not like I robbed a bank. Oh OK then no more laws, free to go.

It's not about difficulty.  I love PVP.  Like I stated, I achieved Gladiator in BC.  I really LOVE PVP.  This isn't PVP.  This shit isn't playable,, man.  Like, I cannot play anything.  I log into game and am getting camped.  How is this even in the scale of easy - hard difficulty? To use your comparison, this is like logging into Minecraft and each block to mine takes 5000 hits before mining the resource.  And all you want to do is mine the resource and build cool shit.
---
Developers have stated in an interview that they will definitely be using the cross realm BG system.
---
And there is very little benefit to suffer through faction imbalance.  Sorry buddy.  You should consider rerolling on a more balanced realm, there are several.
---
I'm a troll warrior, got axe of the deep woods on my first scholo run after hitting 60 and traded it for edgemasters.  Deal of a life time right there lmao.
---
Sure on your own, they are not gone proof me wrong
---
No, he is saying that there was overwhelming presence.
---
Your ele though. Ele is the better pvp spec. Your basically taking the bis pve and pvp chest for 5 phases from the warrior because you might pvp in enhance later. Pretty scummy.
---
On EU-Lucifron, Horde is suicide bombing IF with mages. They wait until their cd's are ready, then rez, bomb fresh targets, die, repeat. Every 3-5min for the last 3days in front of the bank.
---
fun game
---
Some guilds invite 58s and 59s to raids, they should get all the gear they can for those raids and definitely not wait to be 60, though.
---
Again, I'm not saying your advice is incorrect, I'm merely implying that there isn't a single "correct" way of doing things.
---
So don't charge anyone for offspec loot? If no one wants and it's not for offspec then you DE it.
---
**Dear Alliance,**
---
You rolled an Ally character on a PVP server, in a game where racials attract the best PVPers to the Horde.  What did you expect?
---
**Dear Horde,**
---
This shit ain't world PVP and wasn't nearly this bad on any vanilla server at any point.  The fights were spontaneous if imbalanced and almost fun to see a mob invading out of nowhere.  This 24/7 gankfest is was more problematic then Vanilla.

nice to Baaa you again.

It’s his bank alt. He logs between the two while they’re in the same party.
---
Makes the game way more interesting imo, otherwise yeah... its logging on once a week for a few hours, to get gear that you wont use to pvp with anyway? All these posts are sob stories of people putting a stick in their tire spokes and crying to reddit when they're shocked at the result. If you wanna just walk around collecting shit go play minecraft
---
The other person isn't giving you their bank alt, they're just letting you form a group with your own bank alt.
---
Who transferred there?!
---
Yeah, I feel people are failing to note this when we complain about such exploits. Back in the day these things weren't as widespread and known and people tended to keep these exploits to themselves to prevent them getting fixed and getting themselves banned. 
---
Then when they got fixed, people started talking about them and now over the years everyone heard about them and now wants to try it. I bet if Blizzard, for instance, leaves the ZG blood glitch in (unlikely, I know) all servers would be unplayable within hours of release because it now is so famous and everyone knows how to do it. 
---
On top of that communication has way, *way* smoothed out over the years. Back in the day there were dozens of unofficial WoW forums fighting for dominance. Now, a new exploit would be posted here and a large portion of players would know within hours.
---
Bingo. As an Alliance on Herod the Alliance on Heartseeker in my opinion (and I bet if a poll was held the community would agree) are the least respected server of Alliance on the game. All they are is a coalition of people who were in the same boat as for instance, I am, however their patience is so thin and they blow so bad at PVP that instead of stick it out for the next phase they ran into a mega-server of likeminded cowards where they faction-bully the smallest population of horde on the game. They literally chose to go to a dead server and bully the horde of the dead server just so they could feel good about themselves.   It's pretty funny, they will be begging for mergers in about 7-8 months. I'm calling it.
---
Why are you wasting your time on a hunter for them?
---
&gt; Each heal cap that reduces a heal rank adds 1 spell to your mana pool
---
Either this is incredibly wrong, or I'm not sure what you mean. When you reduce your spell rank, you get quite a few extra spell casts added to your total pool.
---
In AQ even the trash mobs are tough. Experiencing that again will be fantastic.
---
Yes they can. 
---
The “upgraded” set *replaced* the original blue PvP set. The “upgraded” set is what will be available to players. Atlas loot is incorrect and everybody is freaking out and arguing over something that was confined 3 months ago. The stats on the items (itemization) will be the same as 1.12. 
---
I am happy to continue this conversation for those who still cannot comprehend the message here.
---
I’m not denying any of this. My point remains sulfuras is one of the few that doesn’t  have major balance problems.
---
I know. It’s very low commitment but still requires another person.
---
Of course you will! Because everyone has a role, strength and weaknesses. You are the only class in the game that can help people cross the world instantly with a very low effort (a 10 second spell).
---
But you are still charging 80 silver to do so! Everything above 20 silver is already a tip! 
---
Price is determined by the buyer and the seller and personally, I’m ready to do plenty of portals for 30 silver of profit that is going to consume 30 seconds of my time.

"There is very little benefit to suffer through faction imbalance".  I wish Blizzard felt this way about server transfers.
---
Exactly. I didn't get anything I needed, but it was just a fun group.
---
Some of my best nights actually have nothing to do with gear. My group all added each other as friends. 
---
I was especially stoked because I switched to PvP spec (I'm a rogue) and was like, hope I can hold it down. I ended up doing great and my stuns and CC actually helped everything move even more smoothly with it being a 4-man. 
---
Tank went AFK (he told us first) for a while and me, a priest and a mage just marched on,  killed a shit ton of mobs and even killed a boss. Tank came back and the mage was like, "Yeah, we uh..went a little ahead.". Tank was walking back like, "Holy shit, ya'll are already near the end?".
---
Us: "Oops."
---
Just a fun time. Then I went to Searing Gorge to farm BRD, but ended up farming Alliance instead. Everything was just clickin'.
---
And these builds have already been tested and made meta a decade ago. Nobody is experimenting because you will be called a troll or a noob. I dont think I've ever even seen a boomkin for that matter because the internet has already decided it isn't meta
---
Bro you play mage
---
I have the same feeling with mages recently...
---
I'm having a blast on Heartseeker since transferring. I would not be having any fun on Stalagg if I stayed, and more than likely would have quit.
---
Why would I hamper my enjoyment of the game on purpose? I'm not into self-harm.
---
How many times have you posted this content here now ? You will get more views from a good title/thumbnail/tags than posting it here over and over.
---
Every time PvP server people try to make PvE people bad with that excuse is pathetically hilarious to me. Lots of us did that in the past. It’s awesome having a goal in mind and being able to accomplish it. I also see the fun aspect of PvP servers and always being on your feet or whatever but that doesn’t tickle my fancy. I don’t get why they get so butt hurt about PvE server peeps playing and being happy with their decision lol.
---
And also life tap*
---
&gt; we now outnumber alliance with probably around 65/35
---
Where did you get this info?
---
It was confirmed 3 months ago. There’s over 5 different posts this week alone about this topic, m8.
---
I legit didn't pvp again after my original grind until the arena came out, so makes sense I wouldn't remember.
---
Really? i think the ratio is 60:40 now, and horde has some great pvpers. Maybe if youre not level 60 I could see why you feel the way you do, but I disagree.
---
T2 chest is way better, but truefaith is definitely very good by T1 standards.
---
so your suggestion is to make the faction imbalance even worse by telling the minority to gtfo if they don't like it?
---
Alliance will probably have short ques simply because horde tends to have more people interested in pvp overall. Not sure why you think you deserve compensation for your decision of server though,  we all make choices and have to live with the consequences
---
When the drugs are just so good you have to share.
---
Alliance tend to be more organised on general since he swarm of horde weeds out the casuals.
---
If picking up herbs is the most interesting content to you, then probably true
---
Not needing and offspec are two separate things. 6 rogues not wanting to bid on an upgrade because they  are saving for weapon is not the same as a Fury warrior taking might because every other tank has it.
---
why cant we expect a relatively even matchup on pvp servers? having every contested FP camped is fucking dumb design.
---
they could fix it in many ways, including having NPC guards on the FP or contested cities. that alone would give the weaker faction time to prepare and coordinate with others standing there to launch a counterattack.
---
much better than instant death upon landing with no chance to fight back. and it would be much more FUN for both factions.
---
&gt;  This meant it was also no longer possible to make good decisions to the same extent, and what happened over time is that people who were good at the game stopped playing
---
People who use the right talents aren't people who make 'good choices', it's people who copied the meta builds from online. Making every class and spec viable makes the game casual friendly? Good players stopped playing retail? I don't know where you're getting your info from but you've been grossly misinformed.
---
You cannot expect anyone to stay on a horribly imbalanced server. If the server is 65-35 against you, why *wouldn't* you transfer off?
---
I saw a paladin out dps most of the rogues and warriors against ony. All I was able to notice about his gear is that he was using ironfoe and a t2 helmet.
---
What was this man doing to push those numbers so high?
---
Yes they have.
---
Just ask in world chat for someone to spare 30 seconds. Invite your alt and do exactly what you do.   
---
After 2 minutes party leader will get passed to your alt and you can reset it yourself.   
---
2 mins vs 5 mins is a big difference, might let you get another run in if you aren't hitting the 5 cap.
---
nowhere did they say it was released to "match Naxx power level", they stated it was released to give casters and healers more diverse options, nothing else. none of the weapons, melee, caster nor healer, matches naxx power level, naxx items are way better.
---
Alliance: 56 hunter, almost 57. I have left my body at the entrance of BRD in hopes of finding a group and saving myself the 30-40 minute corpse hop run into the instance. For the last 3 nights I have not been able to find a group. Last night I decided maybe I could get some questing done on a Monday night, so I fly to WPL to be greeted by 10-15 horde and I then proceed to get ganked at least 10 times and manage to travel a couple hundred feet before hearthing and logging. Question: are there any locations that are general safe spaces for high 50s? maybe Azshara? gonna try there later and see.
---
I would only call it a "service" if you were traveling to the other person to portal them. Majority of the time, they come to you, and LITERALLY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUSH A BUTTON TO PRINT MONEY. You are free to reject their offer, but why do you care if they hand you 50s or 1g? You just got free money. If you don't want the free money, I'm sure the next mage will. You want to waste your time and energy arguing over how much free money they should give you, but do you complain when someone gives you MORE than 1g for a portal?
---
Yeah, flight paths suck, but it's also a good time to take a break. Please don't kid yourself into thinking you're performing some incredible favor by opening portals for people. If it's too much for you to push a button, just say no. Getting bent out of shape because someone gave you 50s instead of 1g is nothing short of Scrooge levels of greedy.
---
Sounds worse tbh
---
The bad news is as a warrior you are extremely gear dependent in PVP, especially when it comes to weapons.
---
It's not just naxx, cthun mace, belt, neck, emp leggings, pure thought boots, aq quest reward gloves... Then all the enchants
---
This subreddit full of lunatics. Feels like this is babies first mmo for some people.
---
You must be leader of group to reset instances, you cannot give leader to an offline player.  Leadership automatically moves off an offline player, after 2 minutes.
---
Yeah, or...the whole wpvp system is an imbalanced mess regardless of what side you're on. Glad I chose pve at launch.
---
If you are logged out within an instance for 5+ minutes, the game will port you back to the entrance, yes. It is faster to do the dance with an alt in your party though, since it only takes 2 minutes for you to be able to reset the instance
---
Aww man, when I see a prime hunter pet up and nobody after it I tell the flippin' map just in case.

Scroll up, another reddit user provide screenshots today of the gear.

Were he to fuck off with your gold, you had mats of equal value in your inventory. How did he know you weren't going to just fuck off with his mats ? My view of the world is perfectly fine, thank you.
---
I agree that Blizz should resolve such issues. It only seems fair. I don't know about banned for life (they could just make another account anyway), but they should definitely get banned for at least 6 months (which as I understand it might just happen as they said they would "investigate" the player), and the scammed player should get his stuff back. But until they decide to be fair (probably never), it's absolutely ok to look for assurances, even with a guildie in light of this event. It seems that you can only trust your rl friends or people you've known for a very long time.
---
yep.

Ya horde is easy mode, thats clear, it's just tiring when you're reminded of yet more things horde have it better.

Only 2 1v1's I have an issue with as an ele shaman are SL Warlocks with a felhunter out, and Rogues burning every CD when they get the jump.

Entire reason I'm saving up the 1600g for invulnerable mail, that way I can just avoid the SL warlocks outside group pvp.
---
Just make a character on a non-PVP server. 
---
Heck, make two. I made 5, although some of 'em are just to have more bank storage.
---
You'll still get stunlocked most of the time, lul.
---
Resto is a real healer, and ele does about 50% more dmg than enhance in equal gear. If ur guild takes 5+ minutes to kill MC bosses maybe an enh could out dps an ele due to mana
---
This was literally one of my co-workers. Yikes.
---
My Wife watches MLP without the craziness so I knew like half of what he would talk about unfortunately.
---
That's not how BI works. I know it, Blizzard knows it, apparently you don't know it. They absolutely keep track of who is logging time where.
---
Then transfer or re-roll on another server.
---
There exists builds with maybe 1-3 floating points that allow for the maximum effectiveness in PVE raids and PVP BGs.
---
There is a meaningful decision, "I want to play my character the best raid DPS possible, so I go a tried and proven raid build."
---
Another meaningful decision, "I want to play Fire mage because it's fun, I don't mind missing out on Molten Core."
---
How about the meaningful decision of "I want to be the best/most efficient AOE gold farmer possible, because grinding gold is fun."
---
Get out of here with the nonsense of experimenting...its a 15 year old game.

I would have just killed it so he couldnt take it for being such a douche after you had engaged.   Id rather no one win than someone like that.
---
Reddit is devoid of empathy in general.
---
The truth is he doesn't deserve compensation, but he also doesn't deserve punishment.  The server faction imbalance is a shitty situation that Blizzard should never have allowed to come to be and should be working to correct ASAP. *Most* of us chose are server well before any demographic data was available and shouldn't have to "live with the consequences" if Blizzard wants to keep our money.
---
Do you think he edited all that stuff out for fun?
---
Dual spec with 72 hour cooldown would be pretty cool imo
---
Looking for a guild on one of the lesser populated servers. I have a 60 orc lock with some pre-bis and MC gear I could xfer. But looking to level up a druid so I can heal and tank to help instances a long.
---
Prefer west coast server solely because I'm in Central TZ the time difference fits my schedule.
---
PvP in duels isn't really rock paper scissors, there are a couple classes that are amazing at dueling and weaker in other content.
---
Shadowpriest and warlock are the notorious ones.
---
just did, says nothing about this being forbidden
---
That thing is trash and good luck selling it for anything more than a massive undercut.
---
Maybe learm a bit more about warriors before you start comparing pur talents to your bud .
---
Ypu have 1 viable pve spec. We have many.
---
then they cant have transfers, if they did that from the start, they creates a new server with 100 % horde population since at the start all realms were even or horde dominated, and most transfer targets were newly made.
---
they need to have faction queues with a button to do free faction change within the servers
---
What server is this? I'm gonna create a character just to message this piece of shit.
---
im on krom as well and the boat thing is annoying. 10 horde in menethil killing honor-less targets - make it to dustswallow - 8 people on the docks
---
if you read the pvp shit talk channel on discord its pretty comical and sad. so few people actually leave IF on non raid days that they have to do this to get any honor
---
Lol they used the service blizzard offered to them, if blizzard don't understand what they are doing they are clearly responsible
---
Player using the service to have a better gaming time and be able to play seems just like the way to go.
---
Maybe if you want to balance it out you should motivate your guild to move on hearthseeker, but I highly doubt you would.
---
That very first instance of the day, time inside does not matter, according to this post. Every instance after that does. 
---
From what I gather from this post, when you reset an instance it gets hit with an expired timestamp. If you have 5 expire timestamps within 1 hour from the current time you get locked. That check prolly happens when you try to enter an instance.   
---
From this we can deduce that every instance has an expire time after the last person leaves in which it will naturally reset, which could also be taken into account when doing farming but stopping a while and coming back.
---
Shamans are easily my second favorite class. And Tauren are just the best, it’s indisputable.
---
Mm, nah. Look, I main a druid, which is probably one of the classes that people most like to respec frequently for differing roles. 
---
But if that's the case, then all druids are mostly just druids, rather than being feral, resto, laser chicken, etc. Forcing actions to have consequences creates identity. Sure, sure, you CAN respec and regear, but it takes effort. So not everyone raids with the optimal spec and then pvps with the optimal spec unless they opt to blow money like mad. Good.
---
Can't the same be said of alliance?
---
What the fuck are you doing outside of raids? Killing level 40 mobs?
---
Not doing dungeons? Nothing?
---
lol its definitely noticeable ESPECIALLY with ferocity and frenzy, brokentooth was a huge upgrade over a 1.2 cat. Even without those talents you notice the upgrade.
---
Close to 50-50 *can* and *has* been achieved. And it wouldn't be that much of a struggle with faction-specific transfer queues and possibly even faction-specific population caps.
---
Blaming individuals for doing what's best for their own interests is stupid. Blame the system for making *this* their best interest.
---
- It's not a gold sink because most people aren't spending gold on it. It's far too expensive for what you get.
---
- Classes who can fill multiple roles are generally weaker at most or even all of those roles. I love my druid but suggesting I should have to pay for having access to 4 roles is dumb when I'm so much weaker than mages, rogues, warriors, and priests.
---
Players HAVE adapted to respec costs by NOT RESPECCING. I don't pvp on my mage because I don't have Ice Barrier. I don't tank on my druid because I don't have feral talents. Those are things I would enjoy doing, but won't be in classic because it's too expensive, and the gain in 'spec identity' for this is way too small to justify it.
---
Oh I visited this exact barn 2 days ago. Died, of course. Ressed right on top of the book, and surprisingly I had enough time to do the quest and make it out... to die to this patrol. RIP.
---
holy shit
---
survival mode wow
---
Zandalar Tribe  is alliance skewed. They outnumber us by a fair margin.
---
Most reasonable people do.  Triple pop servers and massive faction imbalance does not make for a good experience unless you get off on 5v1ing randoms in the world.
---
It means its Tuesday
---
Should have rolled PvE
---
It's not a great PVP tactic but the psychological impact is worth it sometimes.
---
HoJ is a raid gear.
---
Mass scale griefing = world PvP. It was in vanilla and it is now. You chose this when you chose a PvP server.
---
Not sure why people fail to understand but the population amplifies the imbalance.  In Vanilla, people would coordinate camping BRM, thorium point, and the burning steppes one evening.  However, zones like wintersping and EPL would be somewhat clear except small scale PVP...which was a bast.
---
The problem is that the overpopulation has allowed people to camp EVERYWHERE.  Literally everywhere at peak hours.   A slight imbalance is not the issue, it's mostly the insane server cap increase.
---
No, he said his reason for not *wanting* to reroll. Downvote all you want, you guys are the reason retail turned out the way it did. Majority of people are just fine, it’s people who are LITERALLY CRYING themselves to sleep, and also those that enable them, that are the cancer to everyone else.
---
Is there a tldr version?
---
Not sure what mod it is but I believe ClassiceAuraDurations will show enemy buffs if your client "sees" them cast it.  Otherwise you'll need Detect magic from a mage to see enemy buffs.
---
Name and shame, if you want less of this type of content you should want less people joining those guilds.
---
Actually though. Stalagg feels way more balanced than it is on paper because while the allies are few, they are mighty. Granted most of my evidence is anecdotal but things feel pretty okay over here. Not sure why people are going on an exodus. 
---
Maybe just knowing the faction balance numbers gets in people's heads too much?
---
Once he ran it twice almost daily.
---
No, your experience has nothing to do with what I pay for.
---
The solution to your problem is battlegrounds, not forcing people who pay money to do things they may not want.
---
Dad... why dont taturen have 8 nipples? Like our cat.
---
The guys with huge numbers are obvious. But what about the people who respec 2-3 times before a raid to get a smaller advantage? Those will be harder to identify and purge, especially without knowing each player's current gear.
---
This is why guild creation should be free. So you can solo play and not be hit up by a furry recruiter.
---
You are paying to die. Shouldn’t have rolled pvp then. I’m horde on a 70-30 ally favored server and I’m not complaining. If the server isn’t full there shouldn’t be a fucking queue you whiny guy
---
Glad you find it to be so, and I appreciate your openness to others' perspectives.  I should clarify that I personally didn't downvote your post (I think my initial response might have read that way), in large part because I felt that (as one poster indicated) it might be of value to people who are different than myself, rather than it being just a spam post providing no value to anyone.
---
Dang, this guy is so far up his imbalanced faction's ass he can't even see the argument. He's not arguing against PvP servers, he's arguing against severe faction imbalance on the PvP server. By people's logic on this thread, you're either supposed to roll on PvE server to avoid faction imbalance (and WPvP altogether) or roll {imbalanced faction on X realm} to enjoy the game. That's flawed. That is what he's saying in this post.
---
the cycle of abuse
---
He is able to reroll tho. Those are his options. If you have two shitty options to choose between, you choose the least shitty one.
---
This is epic
---
If you are 60 and don’t need anything from dungeons? Sack up and go PVP bro.  Form groups and fight back. BGs will be out on the 10th. Until then the open world is a war zone. Act like it. This is not a solo game. Play with people. You can fight back even out numbered if you are willing to make groups and fight as a team.
---
Is rolling a new character on faerlina worth it at this state? All my friends gave up on my other server (Kurinnaxx) but i have a level 60 shaman that I have gotten burned out on. I want to experience the craziness of the server but don’t wanna roll if since phase 2 has come out it’s been impossible to level?
---
You and I are in the same boat.  I feel you man.
---
Bro horde on every other server do the same thing, go reroll there.
---
More to that, he rolled on 2 healing gear beforehand and 1 magic dps. 
---
Go figure.
---
Why an owl for PvE?
---
I don't think there is a sword trainer in IF
---
You played yourself. Just pass on the boots, take the staff of dominance and then join. Another guild with a better loot system.
---
That was the opposite of condescending. He gave the guy advice on how to use a resource and did it with no aggressive language at all
---
I switch to a PVE server to enjoy the content pre-60 for this reason. Ive never played classic, and the literal ganking everywhere i step has ruined the PVP experience. I wont be going back, unless its Bg's
---
Lol when a warrior begs me for might 😂
---
This has always been a nail biting experience.  Rather than focus on the specific instance of theft I believe blizzard should have (in vanilla!) provided a way to craft mats without handing them to another player.
---
They gave us a spot to "not be traded" but definitely should have gone the extra mile with "hand these mats to trade for their outcome" I am not really sure why they didn't, though I personally never ran into an instance of being stolen from.  
---
Enchanting is absolutely an issue of this, and personally I'd rather do cash on the barrel head (old timey quotes are awesome) for that crusader or +sp then trade people mats back and forth.
---
If you keep saying this on discord and reddit... maybe it will be true!  Or maybe, the faction imbalance is real.
---
I used Google and they actually are no quote from blizzard stating this.
---
Didn't see it, but it seems only logical to do it this way.
---
but hey, if that means they get free 45  minutes back each run to brm why wouldn't they take it
---
and the best way to hurt the asshole horde on the 85 servers is to get off of them so they have no food and crush them with raid geared groups with paladins
---
Luckily my server is roughly 50/50
---
However, blizzard only allowed certain servers to transfer to specific servers. Are those servers now fucked? If so that’s obviously poor planning
---
The issue isn't the ratios. Much as people think it is. This happens regardless of ratio as the mechanics of the game allow for it. Griefers exist in all games and will always do so. Linear thinking never works.
---
The best solution is to reward players being disadvantaged, and minorly inconvenience those who do grief to make it harder for them and less fun. There are numerous ways to do this, but no one single solution by itself would work. Even "Just ban them Reeee" doesn't work look at the last 15+ years.
---
Having more secure "safe" zones would lesson the grieving in lesser PVP encouraged areas, such as near flight paths (FPs) or quest givers. It makes no sense that you can kill a flight master so easily.
---
Having a mechanic that gives rested EXP (as if you were logged off in a town) while ghosted for up to 10 minutes (to avoid exploiting) would also help make players who are being ganked over and over feel less crappy about having to wait for the person to get bored and go away.
---
Having a bubble protect the player or giving them an option to use their heathstone (if the cooldown is up) after the 3rd time they die within 10 minutes would also alleviate corpse camping.
---
Give +1 minute per resurrection (unless they engage in combat) as "honorless target" for players who die in PVP for the 3rd+ time. It would also be wise to give them the inability to gain honor for at least 30 seconds themselves after breaking this buff.
---
Players who consistently kill players (say 5 or 10 within an hour) with no honor should be given a "dishonorable" debuff that reduces their stats by 1% for each set of 5 or 10 honorless kills. With the exception of if there are many other friendly higher level faction members within range. Eventually if they keep doing it they will be killable by the lower level players they are griefing.
---
Add PVP zoned areas where none of these things apply such as near world bosses.
---
Alliance on PvP server. 6-10 deaths getting to BRM instances is the norm at peak times, double that for non-stealth classes.
---
22 MP5 is pretty dope for a shaman. If all you ever want to do is enhance, sure, it's not good but elemental or resto it's one of the best rings period.
---
the biggest pain besides  losing it in front of your eyes is getting it at 60, and having to level it all the way up
---
... Srsly ... I have bookmarks for Warcraft tavern guides and for sure it's not wowclassicbis on the address... Weird
---
nope, 9 am PST
---
It’s a dick move to be sure, but I’m not sure why you think time spent = entitlement to a thing.
---
It's gear you use for raiding.  Not gear you get in raids.  By context you can obviously tell I meant raid gear as in gear that drops in raids.  Which is when MS &gt; OS governs.  You can run for HOJ 4-5 times per hour, whereas gear that drops in raids you can only run for once.  That's the difference.  I've seen HOJ drop 10 times now.. it's not hard to farm.
---
In the dueling context rules were established and the rules were subsequently broken. There is no rule that you can not use debuffs or buffs to help you kill the demon. 
---
If curse of recklessness is considered cheating then is fort buff or shadow protection buff also considered cheating? As both are forms of help from other players. 
---
How about consumables or on-use items such as shadow protection potion, BS trinket with fear immunity or a shadow reflector. Is that cheating? They involve spending hundreds of gold to level a profession which others may not have access to. Is that cheating? 
---
There are no official rules so its hard to establish cheating imo.
---
I know but it still requires another person to join your party. I’m not saying it’s a big commitment, but it does require another person
---
On behalf of all the Rogues and Warriors who are still farming for them, fuck you! Congrats tho!
---
It will cause more problems than it solves. Every time this debate comes up I type up an essay on it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1kqj4/factionbased_queue_call_for_action/f8pxhnx/
---
I stand by this even if I get downvoted by the alliance that swarm these thread. I'm sorry your faction is getting destroyed by numbers I really am. But this isn't the answer.
---
The problem here is an inherent flaw in vanilla wow. The only way to solve it involves significant changes to how classic works.
---
I have  the WeakAuras addon. How do I add that "string" or whatever to the addon?
---
&gt;Lol please. Warriors have fury prot which is A. Ideal for raiding and B. Still good for PvP.
---
Fury is absolute dogshit in PvE, and you only need 1 Fury Prot for raid.
---
&gt;Ret pallies are fine dps and good at pvp. While being elite lvl healers in both.
---
Other than PvP, none of these are true. And even PvP is debatable.
---
&gt; Shaman can do anything. (Current sub 2 hour MC/ony includes 3 hybrid healing shaman, 1 enhance dps shaman and a enhance tank shaman all pvp very well.) 
---
Unless you've got logs for that, I do not, for a single second, believe that you have an Enhancement Tank in your raids. And if you DO, I don't believe he actually TANKS and more likely just exists, being carried.   
---
Also, Enhancement is dogshit in PvP even when damage oriented. An Enhancement Tank spec would not be able to even come close to competing in PvP.  Ele/Resto hybrid is by far the preferred PvP spec. Oddly enough, it's also the only spec you didn't mention, and also the only spec that's particularly serviceable in both sides of content.   
---
Please don't talk out of your ass like that dude.
---
Not even true. Just a myth.
---
Ahh didn't understand it within the context of the post. lol yeah true
---
&gt; In reality, they all just desired the greener grass and wanted to be the bullies themselves.
---
I transferred from Stallag to HS as Alliance, this is only partially true. This wasn't the case when people first transferred, we outnumbered the horde by a lot but Alliance where usually friendly to horde in the open world unlike on Stallag where horde camped instances 24/7 and killed every alliance on sight when they outnumbered them, even beffore honor came in.
---
All when to shit when honor was introduced though, people started camping instances and fp, horde does the same though until a big group comes and wipes them.
---
I mean you can still see it in the normal UI, but yeah I get you that it'd be handy if it could go further. Like hunters are one of the classes that can attack from farther away with talents but it obviously screws up stuff like threat plates.
---
Looking for a dungeon group or player to level with. Horde, Stalagg, Level 19 warlock
---
&gt;That said, even an arcane/frost mage is superior to a dps warrior for farming.
---
Not so much.  I am specced arcane power to raid and if I go out herbing or trying to farm and pull more than 2 I am probably dead.
---
As a resto druid, I love fighting solo warriors.
---
Yeah but why? It was written out that he was going to make the helm for the mats. He broke the agreement. Blizzard should handle this. Not say its not supported lol what kind of cop out answer is that?

How is getting attacked while you are neither prepared nor physically capable of fighting back PvP? It's just getting killed on a FPS game while you are still choosing your Loadout.
---
&gt;Comparing it to outing pedophiles is completely absurd.  
---
But comparing it to a witch trials isn't?
---
Come on dude
---
yes, thats how i do it. 5 minuts on my alt and my main goes back to the entrance (still inside the dungeon, but at the entrance) no need for inv from other players to reset it. 
---
will try to make a video this weekend and then ill post it here.
---
If your guild of bros who have been playing together since Vanilla don’t want to help you then they are not team players. End of story. You shouldn’t have to beg. None of my crew that I’ve been gaming with that long ever has to ask. If they are on we are helping them catch up. I’ve probably done more than 150 BRD runs for guild mates that I don’t need any of the bosses. 
---
It gives the 60s who ground their asses off a sense of accomplishment that their hard work paid off and are now on a much higher footing then the player they are now stomping into dust. The cut off has to be somewhere if not 48 then where? Also hate to break it to you but even if you didn’t give honor people would still kill you. Why? Because it’s fun. It’s a PVP server. It gave honor in vanilla so it should give honor in Classic.
---
Remember been downvoted to oblivion for stating Blizzard won't do fucking anything in this Classic if you get scammed. 
---
Back in the day you would get items, but in 2019 you have no chance.
---
Wait a second, you’re not actually sorry...
---
How do I delete others idiotic comments?
---
Im loving it ! trying out the methods, AOE Farming, Quest farming, Dungeon Farming and finding groups with people who aren't assholes? Don't care about iLvL, willing to help. It's all been amazing. So when i experienced the phase 2 launch. It tainted that for me - I love PVP but I hate wPVP
---
I'd really like to know. I just want my materials back. It does not take that much effort.
---
Oh...you aren't bright.
---
Hi there guildie!
---
(Saving this thread to check back later)
---
lol see what I mean. You automatically assume i'm the one being camped. Don't really know why I expected you to be able to empathize with others.
---
Just jumping in to say 60s are still doing lava runs for HoJ all the time. I’m 50s and the 60s in my guild jump at the chance to go to brd with a Druid tank
---
Time to get that gnomish cloaking device. Elite will attack the rogue.
---
Yep anything, only TBC arenas limited what you can use
---
The idea of PvP:  
---
Heroic and close fought battles with your besties, holding off the enemy by the skin of your teeth, but dominating nonetheless! Campfire tales of heroic last stands or sieges where you won out in the end. Continued personal rivalries that are equal parts respect and hatred.  
---
The reality of PvP:  
---
Getting ganked by a mob of 10 L60s as you try to quest solo.  
---
Getting murdered the second you get off a flight path with no chance of defense.  
---
Getting one-shot by a ?? rogue over and over and over and over who apparently has no life or purpose in this world other than to ruin your game.  
---
Corpse hopping into the instance.  
---
Getting screamed at in all caps by some barely literate, mentally and emotionally stunted Alliance teenager because you can't hold back the tide of L60s zerging you.
---
Also keeping BGs single server. Then they queue for their queue.
---
Every private server player knows how much better the presentation and quality of the game is on them.  Blizzard's classic is a joke compared to pseevers.
---
If youre guild didnt have the GFPP recipe then yeah, you should be doing it to better your guild. However, having two of them and they want a third? You aren't out of line in asking for something small in return.
---
Are the rewards in term of XP the same for the cloth turn in quests? What I mean is if I turn them in at level 40 or at level 59, will it gives me the same amount of XP regardless?
---
No, just mostly questing without surprise corpse runs
---
Ele shamans are disgusting. Chain lightning + earthshock crit and you've lost 80% of your health.
---
Thanks
---
Although he has 1.0 attack speed the DPS is normalized out across all hunter pets. He may interrupt slightly higher on casters but someone like Humar who is 1.3 attack speed is just as good. Never understood the Broken Tooth circle jerk after pets were normalized.
---
Warrior and Priest/Druid can team up and do jump runs together, Warrior can sell tanking services. Warrior can just tank as Fury/Arms, Firy/Prot or 31/5/15. There's maybe 1 person per guild that "needs" to go deep prot ever and they can spec out of it for good once shit is on farm or they get slightly more geared.
---
Awful, I see the same sort of mind-set on my server in regards to guilds griefing each other mid-pull on world bosses.. ultimately resulting in the opposite faction getting the kill.
---
Maybe for 12 year olds or people still getting used to the idea of rp
---
So you'd rather spend another 12 or 24 or 36 hours of your time, instead of a little gold?
---
I'm not saying it's a good situation. Just making the best of a bad situation. 
---
So yeah, I'd offer the dude 50g or whatever, and then go make 50g *per hour* elsewhere.
---
Like...what IS the fix here??

Undead is a spectrum
---
Your origin story might be my favorite one that I've read about.  Your wow-life, from the friends you made along the way, what cities and zones you made your memories in... all changed due to one rando's bored adventure.
---
Not a bad thing at all, just interesting.
---
That's not my experience at all, I play horde on HS. Even before phase 2, alliance would be camping the instances in brm and dm. It has just gotten worse. I have to corpse run 15+ times to get to the elf hours before raid times just so I can log out and be ready to jump through the window when we start
---
When it comes to the WoW community, where exactly would one go for empathy?
---
My guess is nowhere, because the WoW community is oversaturated with misanthropic assholes.
---
I for one feel bad for OP. I don't have any constructive advice beyond "reroll", but I'm not going to shit in his cereal because he told his story.
---
You knew that was a possibility when you rolled on one. It will get better in two weeks when bgs come out. Ride it out or take a break.
---
65-35 is that bad. Especially when it takes 45 minutes to get into BRD and your group falls apart before you even get there because the trek is such a slog.
---
Yeah my guilds main tank is like a boss and I can’t kill him as a fury warrior (not saying much) but our geared rogues who own world pvp get curb stomped. It’s impressive.
---
Brutality blade??
---
wouldn't lose any sleep if he alched himself irl
---
Granted, these are all 1v1's.
---
A rogue just doesn't have time to burn you down if its a group fight, they need a solid 15 seconds of popping thistle teas, prep, cold blood evis combos etc. to get through ~4k HP @ 4.5k armor.  They usually get focused if they open up on you or prefer a much squishier target.
---
SL Warlocks lack a lot of range so they need to get a lot closer to fear/dot in which case that bulk does them no good if even two players start to focus on them.
---
Warriors in a 2v1 situation is a death sentence.  They need a proper support (so in alliance case, a paladin pocket healer bot) to shine.
---
In groups, elemental can stay back, toss the spot heal and nuke a target at range.  But I digress, in 1v1's those are the 3 big challenges, of which invuln mail solves 2 basically.
---
Love these ideas.
---
sigh i was looking forward to playing...
---
Dude, i have no idea where you heard that daggers gets better at 40, its pretty much the exact opposite. Daggers is good at 10 because your ambush does a high % of the mobs health, but at 40 it doesnt do much. STAY SWORDS. Open with garrote or cheap shot.
---
This only rewards the dumb alliance that didn’t transfer in P1. “Ooh we will crush those mean Horde even 1v2 when P2 comes out, you’ll see, I was GM in Vanilla!”  Don’t reward that idiocy. Any alliance that stayed when the server was “only” 70/30 deserves what they get.
---
The whole WoW community is devoid of empathy. Most gaming communities these days are.

---
Because I don’t care about their feelings it’s a pvp server
---
As a 56 Horde priest on Heartseeker, I say no.  I can quest, I can fight, I can heal.  I'm clever enough to avoid being camped and I have been able to complete quests at a regular pace.  Sure gank squads are roaming around.  Doesn't mean I'm shaking in my boots over it.
---
I prefer the PvP servers because of the added danger and ability to contest quests or resources.  It makes the game feel more intense and even all the ganks in the middle of goblin towns aren't going to drive me away.
---
Theres also the whole world of PvP.
---
I see several MAJOR glaring fuckups by blizzard throughout all of this.
---
1.   Not having enough servers on launch,  they could have predicted this better.  It was obvious to everyone they were underestimating and if they have access to better metrics than us they should have known. Period.   But you know,  "SeRvEr CoMmUnItY"
---
2.  Painfully slow rollout of additional servers.   They should have immediately doubled before launch not doing onesie twosie shit for 2 full weeks after launch,  this lead to an imbalanced smearing of players across realms and would force you to reroll potentially multiple times to avoid their queue's  so yay  "SeRvEr CoMmUnItY" and guild organization.
---
3.  Non-faction specific transfers from imbalanced servers and lack of hard cap on server population.   Yes it sucks to be prevented from playing on a server because its 'full'  but it also sucks to only have the options of "leaving my guild and/or friends to transfer to a server i know nothing about"  "SeRvEr CoMmUnItY"   Server's should be hard capped on players, period  especially since these servers are several times larger than in vanilla.  Sorry if you don't like that but its necessary.
---
4.  Enabling faction specific transfers AFTER transfers were started for a 2nd time.   This furthered the divide on unbalanced servers and then ripped the rug out from anyone trying to flee the raging dumpster fire that's been created.
---
Every single faction imbalance and population imbalance issue right now has been directly created or exacerbated by Blizzard.   Unfortunately at this point they need to do some fairly heavy handed things to sort out the problem they've created.   It's beyond lazy and inept to even imply that this is a problem that can be sorted out by players.   It was at one point, and that point was during name reservations when they started fucking up.  At this point server mergers and splits are going to be the only way to fix this and it will be massively unpopular.   They really backed themselves into a corner.
---
I remember in high-school like once a month we'd get late start days always on Tuesdays. I remember distinctly always being bummed that I couldn't play WoW early in the morning before school.
---
Authentic classic experience!
---
What are the highest % pop alliance PvP servers?
---
Yeah there are things to like about D3, and people would likely not be totally happy with D2 with a new coat of paint, though some would.
---
Character choice and specialization seems weak and meaningless to me, and is an area I'd like to see fixed. There is literally no risk involved in how you build your char since you can swap it on the fly, and there is not much in the way of choice in that area.
---
Necromancers could be many specs in D2 for example, and there were wrong choices.  I played and enjoyed one of those wrong choices.  
---
But gear is more interesting in D3, and the story is well supported comparatively.
---
In this case, the warlock's detect spells do not actually have ranks.
---
Good luck convincing your raid to give you not only one, but two BB over your rogues/warriors. Are you dumb?
---
The one in Burning Steppes can be cheesed by jumping on and off the tree at around 25, 52. [Here's a video showing it off.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCE0Sz18we4)
---
Complaining rather than adapting to the situations was the whole point of the post tho.
---
There are definitely boomkin. It may not be the most popular spec, but they're out there.
---
Pretty sure faerlina is heavily horde dominated.
---
Those of us still on Skeram have lost our respect for HS Allies.
---
Yeah it's DEFINITELY noticeable. I've had both and thus I noticed the difference realtime. 
---
You're spouting complete nonsense but you know this yourself, ofcourse. A 1.0 AS cat will have more uptime and more crits than a 1.2 AS cat. Also, the 30% doesn't benefit a 1.2 more than a 1.0 lol, it's the EXACT same relative increase. It benefits the 1.0 more for the reasons mentioned earlier.
---
Showing 9 PST on my end. I think we're there aren't we?
---
how do hunters beat you?
---
Essentially all private servers completely died with classic release. You could set up your own server though as GM and give yourself level/items or start fresh completely alone.
---
&gt; had items restored in classic.
---
You mean vanilla right?
---
A GM told me they didn't restore items in classic after loot bugged out and I didn't get an item after winning the roll.
---
Uhh no 30/21 is a shit dps spec lol.
---
And shadow burn, death could and drain soul!! See, warlocks do do something after all!
---
BRD, ubrs, strat, school, DME, killing naga for golden Pearl's, killin elementals for water essence or elemental fires, farming winter spring for firewater and jujus, dunning alts through low level dungeons.  Theres a lot to do combat wise that's not MC/ONY
---
Some of us hordes are very very kind ;)
---
Well for starters, it's A player/group of players, verses, another player/group of players.  
---
Also your analogy isn't even close to the same, getting killed while choosing your loadout would be like getting ganked while on the character selection screen.
---
tru
---
Is there a way you can see who the leader of a guild is, without addons?
---
*falls asleep*
---
Oh, I didn't mind at all.  I thought it was rather funny I was healing the lock and the warrior in almost equal amounts.  He did die once when he pulled aggro and I didn't have mana for the tank, myself, and him.
---
If someone gave me something very rare I'd want to reward them, I'd at least attempt to. Do you really need to project towards boomers because you can't come to terms with that you're entitled? AFAIK they're the generation that got everything handed to them, sounds like what you're advocating.
---
Lies. This will only be truly authentic if the servers dont come up till friday!
---
What is different on private servers? I would be somehow interested in a server with higher rates.
---
I'm sure you imagined yourself saying that in a terminator voice to be edgy.
---
“I’m saying something dumb so I have to write off everyone who knows it’s dumb as first timers and shills.”
---
Fixed it for you.
---
HoJ is super good and it will be super good till the end of classic.
---
I wont get into detail because a lot of people here said the important things already but one point I always see missing is that HoJ scales insanly with better gear. 
---
Every Agi/Str makes HoJ better and better (this is true for Hit aswell but not that much) 
---
Also there is the additional chance that a HoJ-Proc procs Sword-Spec and vice versa.
---
Pros:
---
-Free, greater customer service (bug fixes, ticket responses, etc), more elite playerbase, no P2 clusterfuck
---
Cons:
---
-Smaller pop, few people actively leveling, could go poof at any moment if devs/server have issues
---
Agreed. WoW is a social game. If you chose to roll alone, you face the consequences.   Every time I go to chillwind, there are huge numbers of Alliance securing it. But yeah, if you are on a less active and populated faction and you don’t organize for your safety, it’s going to take you longer to get where you want to go.
---
Just make sure you have the correct detect spell active. Detect Greater Invis will still not detect lesser and normal invisibility.

Two Questions:
---
Anyone on Grobbulus want to invest in a warrior? (e.g. provides some awesome green weapons?
---
I also saw a post about a warrior discord here a day or two ago. Someone said it was the place to go for warrior information. Anyone know that discord?
---
Heartseeker is the alliance safe haven from the horde hell that was servers like stallag (10 to 1 H/A BEFORE phase 2).
---
Horde decided to roam in packs killing people as they leveled and it drove the ally to places they could play the game instead of eating 2 hour queue times just to get corpse camped.  This is the result. 
---
Sucks just as bad for ally on the majority of servers that are horde favored but this is why we eventually got the likes of dungeon finder in wrath that gave people a way to safely do pve content without constant griefing.  People will always be dicks if you allow them to be and most world pvp is not fair fights, its ganks or roaming packs.
---
You're so cool bud. It's a good thing you picked the easy faction.
---
Whats better about private servers than the real thing?
---
No, I loved flying mounts when they came out
---
How viable are dagger fury warriors for raiding damage?
---
Consider I'm a NE without edgemasters and +9 to hit, I got the +1hit +5 dagger belt from DM and I can pair it with 2 daggers from Baron Rivendare. The whirlwind damage will suffer for sure but bloodthirst and the white damage will improve.
---
No luck with rends or epic swords, the other option would be Myra's and a blue sword or axe.
---
lol @ thinking that's even remotely the same thing
---
HA substitute horde for alliance, and you have almost ever other PvP server, except you have it much worse since you will have BG queues, and shitty world pvp, F

&gt; Alliance had 500 more people online but theyre all &lt;lvl 40  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;  Horde has 500 more lvl 60’s patrolling around?  
---
Pick one.   
---
Also if there's an imbalance then they close the gap to 60 very quickly.
---
The total dps for an enhance shaman is greater than any other dps.
---
Take enhance shaman dps + attack power from strength totem + windfury and it will be higher than any other dps player.
---
The other argument is you could do that as resto, but keep in mind here wont be 8 resto shaman in a raid because you want druid and priest healers as well.
---
Deserves BAN.
---
Lmao weird correlation  of zoomers there. Kids are less shitty now than they’ve been in 20 years
---
If you didn't like the thread, don't click on it.
---
You have that backwards. The hunter who stopped him from taming is the griefer in this case.
---
Even with cross realm BGs horde will have the larger numbers, since they dominate pvp servers overall, and will have to wait in queue. It might end up being a good thing for Alliance if the queues are not super long because then they will all sit in Orgrimmar queueing for Bgs instead of queueing and moving out to world pvp in between. Ideally the queue times are 10-15 mins for Horde and instant for Alliance.
---
Is running wow in a VM the TOS breaker? Or account sharing? Just curious, I've heard cloud VMs are against TOS. But BootCamp or HyperVisor are both VMs and pretty sure most Mac users use them.
---
So ideally I could go to Ogrimmar, Undercity, and Thunderbluff and turn in all the quests for each cloth quest and get a TON of exp?
---
Mages can iceblock and priests can AoE fear. I'm sure other classes have options I'm not thinking of.
---
Agreed. Been running imp FS for cleats and it kicks ass. Don’t need a huge mana pool either. Been clearing with only 5.7k
---
Well, by 'nuclear', I mean it's probably going to upset a lot of people and make Blizzard lose money. But they're probably going to lose money anyway if they leave the realms as they are now. 
---
I definitely agree that they should have implemented faction queues from day one. That would've been the best option and wouldn't have upset that many people if they knew it would be like that from day one. The problem with implementing faction queues now is that people have invested a lot of time into their characters and making friends on their realms. 'Forcing' them to move will cause a lot of drama IMO.
---
good shamans and sometimes locks
---
Guys please, this literally was in Vanilla lol. As with many things it was a limitation of the time. It doesn't *have* to exist (and in the main game it barely does, the window is tiny) but vanilla was balanced around batching, hence its reimplementation in Classic.
---
I have no complaints about 20vs1. I'm asking for some changes in towns/flight points to avoid campers and the stupid CC until you drop the honorless buff so at least we can get our quests in peace
---
No joke I did my demons quest at like 3 am server time to avoid ganking. And this other hunter would just wait in a hiding spot while I was doing the steppes demon. He would wait till it was around 20%, pop out and tag it, make it deshawn and then run away and do it again. Bastard did it for like an hour.
---
If you are trying to do open world quest right now you are the simple minded one. Wait to do open world quests till you are 60 and BGs come out. You will be able to do them much easier AND you will make gold. It’s not that hard to see you are playing extremely suboptimal. You probably tried to do the starting zone on day one too. Which is why you aren’t 60 yet...
---
5-600 dps single target is achievable in arms with good gear/wf proccs
---
Here is the real kicker. Not only are Horde outnumbered 8 to 1 on this server, but we will be in hour long queues for BGs because of the imbalance on the other servers. We are double punished by this situation.
---
It is shortening his blizz channel when he gets hit even though the damage is being absorbed. Casting is not supposed to be affected when I've barrier is active.
---
it got less then 5% droprate on average
---
The Tiger you can tame outside of sen jin village at level 10 has .4 less attack speed......You really don't need to bother with Broken Tooth or the other rare pets unless you are trying to impress people with your NEET camping skills.
---
60 lock on one of the very high pop first announced pvp servers. For many reasons I want to leave it. I want to find a community on a medium pop pvp server with some guilds raiding, some world pvp, and its not aids trying to find dungeons with a decent H:A ratio.
---
Does such a thing exist?
---
Absolutely not a change this sub is mental.
---
its unique... can't have 2
---
Honestly I think this is too heavy handed. We all just want to play the game, but need to find a way to navigate out of the situation we are in. Horde will likely have a queue either way.
---
when classic launched i no lifed extremely hard the first week(17 hours playing a day) and hit 37 a few days in. i rushed straight to badlands to tame him, met a friendly opposite faction hunter and we became friends now! took me 4hours or so to find brokentooth but it was worth it compared to how bad i can imagine it is now
---
I play both classic and pserver  (still return to pserver occasionally to raid end game raids, AQ / naxx, for a change) 
---
As a serious-casual player I can hardly tell the difference and I consider them 98% the same. and I don't bother care about the 2%
---
same dude
---
That's what she calls me, her "big pve server".
---
19/0/32 is my preference, actually.
---
Maybe people on PvE servers can justify running helpless x/x/40+ healbot builds all the time but I just can't imagine ever leaving myself so dependent like that.
---
&gt;Having specific routes, and spots where I know I won't find a raid
---
Dreddit is recruiting.
---
A lot of people want #nochanges as if every new line of code added to Classic was completely unnaceptable, but leaving Classic on its current state is already a change compared to Vanilla.
---
Vanilla servers didn't have a billion players like many Classic servers does, nor did they have a bunch of players willing to sit in the same spot for several hours farming HKs because they are already out of content to play three months after the release of the game.
---
 Better it’s a dps than a tank or heals. I call that a 100% successful run if only a dps does.
---
Dal'rend mh is objectively better than aotdw, i highly reccomend getting edgies and doing this since all the best wpns in the game are swords
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60&amp;realm=4732_Heartseeker
---
It was 80:20 before 2 waves of horde only transfers. Regardless of "hurr durr its not accurate!" Its certainty way better than it was a month ago.
---
Yikes.
---
Blizzard said long before launch items were going to be in their 1.12 states. I don’t see why it would be reasonable to think that wouldn’t apply to the PvP sets.
---
How do you manage to stay so calm and composed?
---
I'm not whining, I'm in no hurry.
---
they've basically already done this (without the faction specific queue), and from what I can tell it's not doing much. Skeram has free transfers for the horde, but the option is to go to a latin american server, or joining the OP on heartseeker. Yeah, Horde aren't transferring off of Skeram to be the camped.
---
I might consider it if entire guilds decided 'yes, let's transfer to the other server and balance things out', but no one is doing that.
---
This will forever remind me of my GM.
---
It's not about you leaving to go to an intentionally dead server, it's about the fact that Heartseeker is comprised of a bunch of people who "couldnt stand the heat so they got out of the kitchen" from a BUNCH of different servers.
---
You are all just a concentration of every populated server's alliance who had low patience and tolerance for being ganked, now you go and do the same thing to the horde on heartseeker.
---
That's the best I could word it.
---
Thanks for the little extra knowledge about sword/hoj procs
---
Boomers are usually the entitled assholes. Maybe it's an old age thing.
---
You talk about heartseeker as if you had the ultimate truth and knew anything about it. The truth is that you're mad that you didnt leave the shit-hole you're on when you had the chance and know you're on a tirade on reddit like a 5 years old.
---
Good to know, but I think my point still stands. Good luck convincing your raid you should be eligible over a rogue/warrior. If you are able to, please let me know so I never join that guild lol.
---
lol, what? and skip bwl/zg/aq/naxx?
---
Realistically you could just stay zoned out until the person is at the boss that drops your item, then zone in to go get it while only gaining xp from that one mob. Could still over level but probably not. Assuming you had a friend/friends willing to help you that is.
---
No, just /who theguildname and whisper someone and ask. There are people behind the keyboards, stop being so afraid to chat with them. :P Many great relationships can spawn from simply reaching out.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the guide. Love doing things on my own soloing bosses.
---
Need one for Ras 🧐
---
Unless you're doing a dg or raid, then you should be charging to summon imo. If it's some guy just whispering you then I'd charge.
---
The only possible solution is once an imbalance is reached, say 75/25, they open up free faction swaps. Obviously they’d need to solve the Paladin/Shaman issue, but otherwise the systems exist.
---
Isn’t fadeleaf farmable in SM? Not sure the viability but I know it’s there
---
PPPPPPPPPPPPPvP is quite different than PvP.
---
Although without a source of +wskill u lose so much dmg to glancing that most blue axes will outperform dal'rend in a raid setting
---
I'm curious how many listings are on alliance HS AH?  Horde usually is just around 10k
---
As someone from Heartseeker this is a confusing perspective :)
---
True, and I made this assumption that this was his first character. It didn’t seem like OP was playing an alt.
---
Did the Google search, couldn't find anything.
---
I have a character with Engineering, and of course it can make shot ammo, but not arrows.  What profession can make arrows?
---
Is that why they stand so far apart from each other?
---
is rolling a new character on another realm worth it? I'm a ally on blaumeux right now and ive been stuck in the low 50s by literally not being able to go anywhere and quest. even trying to run brd takes 4 hours
---
Since your server is such low pop it shouldnt be that hard, but it all depends how much people pvp and how hard they go.
---
X
---
BGs are coming soon. The fuck are you talking about “won’t pvp with anyways” ?
---
Yeah the short term will be a bit rough for sure, but like I said, players on Stalagg Alliance/Heartseeker Horde are essentially living that reality right now every day. This way there is at least a path forward, the unfortunately side-effect is casual players on the majority faction will have to endure some short term pain.
---
I can easily take on 5 unprepared randoms if I bring two friends. Not so much when it’s 20 people. There is a massive difference.
---
&gt;things feel pretty okay
---
&gt;horde flag
---
hmmm...
---
The get the axes.
---
Well, there's a difference between "I accidentally tagged it and went on my way" and "I'm going to let you spend time on this and just stop it for you. Repeatedly."
---
I mean yea this might not deserve a perma-ban, but if you're gonna make arguments, learn what context is
---
This is the true classic experience now!
---
Faction based queues are the answer. Horde love to tell Alliance to reroll on a different server or transfer, this would propose the same solutions to them. Sorry you can't ruin the game with griefing anymore, learn to play in an even fight. Get used to waiting, re-roll, or transfer to a PVE server (everyone should say to them).
---
yes I did all those in Vanilla, did all of BC also but had way more fun with BC.
---
Which server?
---
This is the dumbest hot take making the rounds. The only reason that you would expect grown ass adults to be that vindictive at their job and their work quality is because you yourself are petty and vindictive at your place of work. Seriously, this idea is getting so old, grow u
---
A whole bunch of people on Twitter are...
---
&gt;because the WoW community is oversaturated with misanthropic assholes
---
my eyes just rolled outta my head
---
These threads make me feel as though I got pretty damn lucky when I picked a server to roll on. Ten Storms was the only mid pop EU pvp server that didn't have a queue timer on the day I created the character so I just ended up there.
---
I've been camped a few times by Alliance packs and I'm not sure what the population balance % is like, but it's felt pretty even going for the most part with probably a slight to the Horde in terms of numbers.
---
Warriors are really strong against rogues especially now that we have pvp trinkets.
---
I'm not convinced it will. A lot of players seem to have either quit or re-rolled, leading to a larger imbalance. This large imbalance will mean that the larger faction have incredibly long queue times. This will be even more apparent where Horde are the larger faction, as in general Horde seem more interested in PvP, so there will be less alliance signing up for BGs as they just want to do the PvE content.
---
I think the damage has been done for some servers, and i don't see them recovering. Those closer to 50/50 might do ok after BGs though.
---
Where does this data come from, some dumb shitty zoomer kids?
---
The extra fire resist makes a big difference and it only take 25 min or so to get the whole raid buffed and moved back to rag
---
Earth fury is not 50/50 sorry it’s more like 65-70/ horde is camped in org and uc
---
Blizzard could rename honor to "Shitpoints"
---
10am PST now
---
great argument.
---
*urge to yell PvE intensifies*
---
Getting engi and the shadow reflector has paid for itself so many times over since pvp came out. I enjoy fighting spriests and warlocks now because once every 5 minutes I stand a chance.
---
So you think I'm just gonna ignore how you ignored the "physically capable to fight back" part?
---
Because multiple accounts cost money I guess. Blizzard won't do anything about it.
---
Orc, because the extra wep skill is huge.
---
Can someone link this spec and possibly go over the Talent progression.. Im confused as to when COC/FS spec becomes viable for leveling.
---
That happens like in every farming spot in game all the time.
---
I'm just imagining a bunch of druids in various forms roleplaying an orgy.  I feel like that's close enough
---
real MVP!
---
During vanilla, Alliance greatly outnumbered the horde.  THis led to a big problem going the other way, Alliance being able to camp and kill horde in their own cities and towns.  To combat this Blizzard went through and added guards and spawns and in general made horde locations more "secure" against the endless Alliance.
---
Classic wow has gone the other way.  There is a shitload of Horde and Alliance don't have as many of the features as horde do when it comes to dealing with a giant ganksquad coming and sitting in towns.  They could add it, but the #nochanges people were very adamant about not having things changed.
---
So a part of the issue is Classic is a mirrored version of Vanilla.  Features put in to protect the horde were not put in for Alliance as they were not necessary at the time.
---
A second issue is the amount of people who are deadset on getting their pvp ranking and the only way to get honor right now is to find and kill anyone they can.  This would have been reduced greatly if BGs were in the game at honor system launch, but once again #NOCHANGES people were adamant in what they wanted.
---
A third aspect is facing the reality that players don't want what they say they want.  What players actually want is to play the game however they want at all times with minimal outside interference.  What they SAY they want is a community based game which encouraged world pvp!  What we end up seeing is a shitload of people who got what they said they wanted in a dangerous world where PvP is lying in wait for you.  THey can't do it alone but they don't want to actually get a group of people together to try to fight it.  What they WANT is to be able to fight on their own terms, or some mysterious idea of an honorable fight.  What they want is a world where THEY can pick their battles, not be at the mercy of someone else.
---
People got largely what they asked for.  The problem was they didn't actually want it.
---
There are some peeps in my guild with issues
---
The game isn’t balanced. Period. Not for PvE, not for PvP.
---
I feel you brotha, I’m an alliance on the Bigglesworth server the H:A ratio is about 4:1, so not as bad, but man phase 2 has really made me want to quit, I’m also farming my mount and the only feasible way to make money is to solo easy dungeons, I tried fishing/farming mobs/etc but there’s just too many hoard on my server... it’s now become a game of dying and running back to my corpse on a loop
---
I lvl my mage alt in fire and would buy it for lvl 49-55 or so, but not for more than 30g
---
Not sure, I can check later when I get off work and ill let you know if no one else comments.
---
Might be better to leave the logs up until the bug is fixed.
---
if you unironically use the word grinding in WoW, you’re a mong.
---
While true, as far as Pre-BiS goes, rogues are much more limited in what is available to them and hunters can get Barbarous Blade prior to +15 agi enchants (which is actually better), and the ZG mainhand after. There is literally no reason for a Hunter to grind out Dalrends.  
---
I am a rogue though and have no idea what the previous guy was talking about when he assumed I was a hunter.
---
I swear they did this on purpose.  Just to prove the whole, "you think you do but you don't" thing.
---
Lol i mean we have multiple tanks for our MC raids. 2 fury prot, one shaman, two deep prot.
---
Doesnt matter how many we "need" its just what we take.
---
The ret "spell-a-din" build is certainly viable in MC if not great. 
---
Paladin healers are very good in PvE.... not sure how this is debatable...
---
We certainly have an enhancement shaman tank in our raids. Has tanked every boss except magmadar that i can remember (including baron which i wouldnt recommend without druids intervating or very good disspells) (he OTs Rag weekly)
---
Still clear all content in 2.5 hours at the most for the last month with sporadic world buffs through the raid depending on who can set up esrly and who cant.
---
No logs unfortunatley since no one has set them up yet. (Think some said they might for this week bit i dont remember.)
---
Also here proof that a shaman can tank MC/Ony from some post i found on this subreddit before.
---
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCodpRSxV0vk3JFYQEMWahyA
---
Oh so you aren’t 60 yet, that makes more sense.
---
There goes my morning of playing before work. Have to leave the house at 1.
---
I mean, my experience on RP realms makes it clear that some people signed up for exactly this. IDK if this happened on a RP realm or not, but clearly one of the people in this screenshot signed up for it.
---
IMO, PvP lacks some of the excitement when it's fully consensual
---
I realized within two days of the honor system, that endless griefing was going to occur. I would find people questing, wait till they were half health and fighting a mob, and then kill them. I did this playing Alliance on a Horde dominated server. That's all I did, and it's very easy. The very nature of PVP servers encourages shameful gameplay tactics, by rewarding players when they do. 
---
I have rerolled on a PVE server, and it's the best decision I've made. If you have a problem with that style of gameplay, you should probably switch too. I seriously doubt that faction ques will be implemented, as I don't think it's the right solution to this imbalance problem. I'm not an expert in game design, so who knows what the actual answer is.
---
Lol, I completely understand your aggrivation, however I have to say (as an Alliance player) I am glad to hear this coming from the other end. I have played every version of wow, since classic up through MoP. I stopped after that similar to you (life and burnout). I have always been alliance, and I have always had this exact issue happen to me from Horde. I am just a little glad to hear that on at least one server, the Ally are standing up for themselves. It is just the style of the game. When world PvP is a thing, you get people doing this. I personally believe it is why they added so many features in later expansions, such as the achievement to kill all the 4 city kings and get the mount. If people want to group together to fuck people over, they will do it for a specific mission, like killing the king, and then fuck off to another city. When you can group kill cities, it helps the defending city for them to have a goal, and then leave after the goal, rather than just camp the area over and over for nothing gained really.
---
Chinese are 100x worse.
---
I'm just excited when I can kill 2 mobs at the same time without dying.
---

Lul ret
---
Tbh if ur only tanking id go tauren. I chose orc because i like all aspects of the game and for dps free +wskill is a huge deal. Tauren are best mitigation tank, troll best threat. U can get + daggerskill from a few items that are farmable so u can skip edgemasters and ull need to wear a piece of leather for that so tauren HP can help make up that armor loss. But as a casual id say take tauren or troll, whichever u like more
---
Maybe just don't comment, you are complaining about someone complaining
---
Yes, for the rogues first though. What dumbasses would prioritize hunters over rogues for Brutality Blade?
---
BGs come out dec 10th. That’s the clear fix. World PvP will die down in spectacular fashion.
---
I’d do it too tbh. It’s part of the BT meme.
---
Right? As a vanilla player, this is the nostalgic feeling I was looking for.
---
you are simply cancer in its purest form
---
I mean, you don't have to 'spend hours camping' if you know what you're doing and have connections with other brokentooth having hunters. 
---
The rake has a good AS, but its not as good as 1.0 AS. That's just the reality. The second thing you mention is obviously just some placebo, any good player will not fall for such cheesy stuff. It's like the good old eyes of the beast into brokentooth and then letting people think brokentooth has spawned.
---
How about the 5 million bots
---
Tauren. The racials are great and we're by far the chillest race.
---
Most useless comment award goes to this guy!
---
RP has definitely gotten a lot more overtly depraved and sexual over time, but the vast majority of us aren't looking for ERP.
---
Or so I thought.
---
Yeah, I understand.
---
&gt;The person to whom I replied wrote that gay people can't conceive children without straight people in the mix.
---
You are replying to me both times. I never said what sexual orientation the donor's were. You implied that yourself. I simply said that it takes a man and a woman to make babies. 2 men cannot make a baby of their own DNA. 2 women cannot make a baby of their own DNA. In both instances a 3rd party is required. This can also be said for straight couples that get a surrogate. But the fact remains that to make a new DNA sequence. You need genes from Natural Born females and natural born males. That is a physiological fact of life. You are the like people arguing the earth is flat.  
---
The only time i mentioned "heterosex" was in  the same sentence as "a gay man has sex with a lesbian woman, is that not heterosex?" in the other comment you responded too.
---
If you're talking mostly 5 mans I'd go Tauren for the AoE stun.
---
Did you read the comment you’re replying to?
---
Oh yeah, definitely a huge part of it.
---
I feel like the server should band together and get this guy his BT. If I was Horde on his server I would absolutely get a group to protect him getting it.   
---
I know people will say "this is just pixels" but the reality is that this was incredibly disrespectful to his time and efforts, and the dude on the other side of the screen needs a lesson in empathy.
---
Horde dont dominate on every server lol. I play on a pretty balanced server as horde and got camped by alliance at DM entrance and Strat side entrance yesterday by groups of 10-15. Alliance are just as bad as horde.
---

because they provide screech which is AOE debuff that stacks on top demoralize shout/roar. they also have more hp and armor than cats but dps is a little lower but it pays off in the long run anways so the small dps difference isnt really a big deal

No fuk u.

I have the same attack and follow commands on mouse scroll up and down. To zoom the camera in or out I use Ctrl+MouseUp and Ctrl+Mouse Down.

Amen brother! Level 52 on heartseeker. Came from Faerlina to avoid the que. Worst mistake ever. Would gladly pay for a server transfer. Can’t even port into ORG and UC without being killed.

---
alliance does the same shit dude
---
Must really suck to have a 3:7 or worse ratio, whatever faction you choose.
---
I have no idea why they haven't opened paid server transfers by now. People would gladly pay to play the game, lots of $ to be made. Win-win for everyone.
---
&gt; I think you're putting way too much thought into this my friend.
---
Of course. But I kind of find that fun. I'm a try hard at heart, with casual friends in a very casual guild.
---
So the way I scratch that min-max itch is by trying to find the best character to help our specific situation. I know the ins and outs of theorycrafting for high end try hard guilds. I'm just trying to determine which race gives the best benefit to a low end casual guild. I'm leaning toward Undead for the extra CC breaks (CC destroys casual groups) or Tauren for the potato healer relief.
---
All the servers could be 50/50 and world PvP would still be large groups roaming and camping to kill people! PvP has never been fair, 1v1 8v8 or 20v20 can only happen in BGs and arenas. I get unbalanced servers makes this situation worse but in no way would balanced factions fix this. 
---
Every one was aware that this would happen when honor was released on PvP servers and alot of people should have rollled a PvE server based on the amount of salt that's being mined during this phase! And no BGs wont stop this behavior from happening, it might lessen it but wont stop it.
---
Skyrim ftw
---
" then logging off and crying myself to sleep "
---
I cant take you seriously bud.
---
Most reasonable people assumed once phase 2 hit phase 2.5/3 would soon follow to stop the content drought. 
---
Even the most hardcore players have months of content from PVP/BGs
---
They realistically can slow it down once we get BGs and maybe BWL
---
There is a big chance they will walk off the cliff
---
It's a good thing for the workers: no one wants to wake up in the middle of the night to do maintenance.  Interruption of your sleep is a legit health hazard and people usually aren't the sharpest or most keen after being pulled out of sleep like that.
---
The up-side to that would be that there is a much lower impact to player experience and you give yourself extra time to correct things should they go sideways.
---
A lot of #nochanges people were probably all for a phase 2 without BGs, assuming that Blizzard would also hold true to #nochanges when it came to population size. 
---
I remember when they started to remove layering, and all the comments were along the lines of “See, layering was fine, all of you were being alarmist for nothing.” Completely ignoring the fact that, yes, you can just get rid of layering at any moment, but end up with a server 2-3x what it should be.
---
*iTs PvP gUyS iTs JuSt pArT oF tHe gAmE*
---
A lv60 doesn't get any reward for killing a 20, but 10 lv60s get rewards for killing a lone 60. Blizzard also allows gold chanel invite spam, Suck it up or disable the feature entirely? Yea that's a really good solution.
---
If you're going to continue playing for a long time, then yes it's worth it. We're currently only three months into the game's life - it's far better to re-roll now than it is to wait for another month or two. 
---
If you're going to re-roll, I'd recommend a PvE server. I don't see PvP servers getting better any time soon, even with the release of BG's you'll have one side just camping everything while they wait for queues.
---
The thing that frustrates me the most is the instance lockout is shared across characters on your account. So if I do 5 run instance runs on my main, I can't log into my other character and do an instance, super lame.
---
Will reform the favor
---
This is such a terrible argument. I played PvP in Vanilla - Wrath, and I loved it. I played PvP on private servers, and I loved it. I even played PvP in Classic Phase 1, and I loved it.

But Phase 2 is like nothing I have ever experienced before. As an Alliance on Shazzrah I literally cannot go anywhere without being ganked by a raid of Hordes. All dungeon entrances are camped, all flight paths in end game zones are camped, all farming areas are camped. Hell, even in lower level zones (40-50) there are still raid groups (admittedly smaller), roaming around ganking people. 
---
As of now, I have rolled on a PvE server in the hope that it calms down, but with the amount of people that I've seen disappear since phase 2, I'm not convinced my server will recover. I just want to play the damn game and not spend an hour trying to get across a zone.
---
That sounds right, actually.
---
I just remember eventually getting flying and discovering a bunch of hubs I couldn't access over ground travel.
---
Thank you! Yeah it's fun isn't it :D
---
That might be a tough one!
---
I’d dodge anyone from that guild to be honest.
---
Sort of like the idiots from from &lt;The Enclave&gt; - Grobbulus.
---
Put a faction cap per server and watch how fast people flock to servers where they can actually play the game.
---
when blizzard addresses and works on fixing the problem it will be enough posts
---
That's gotta be lag. Never experienced that one before, though I've seen 3-4 second delays before, usually shortly before I get disconnected.
---
Gehennas-EU
---
People didn’t choose to be on a population 3x the size what it should be. That’s blizzards fault entirely, not any one person for “choosing the wrong faction”.
---
Imagine empathizing with reddit casuals.
---
what's gz mean?
---
You are doing it alone. The warlock is only (de)buffing you. It is no different than having a fort buff.
---
Either wait til Dec 10 (BGs open), or start an alt on a PVE server, imo.  Leveling the 2nd time around is much faster.
---
Yea I'd love to be able to transfer to a PVE server right now
---
These are cool.
---
Holy shit, you're so ignorant.
---
PvE
---
They could do 6 or 5, that's not the middle of the night
---
Most of the first 3 or 4 was spent getting EU launched. It took so long because of resource constraints, not gameplay/content pacing preference.
---
About a half of my guild and myself included just ignore it. I had my fill of pvp leveling and going to dungeons before phase two. Now I just raid log and help here and there with guild runs for people who still need something.
---
You dont really have to play an optimal spec for raids
---
Again you paint every single player on HS with one big stroke as if you had the ultimate knowledge on everything (wich I'm sure you believe) wich is a major fallacy. I love being on hs with my guildies and buddies and I don't even care for pvp so you won't see me ganking level 50s lol. Btw someone who is triggered sounds more like this '' All they are is a coalition of people who were in the same boat as for  instance, I am, however their patience is so thin and they blow so bad  at PVP that instead of stick it out for the next phase they ran into a  mega-server of likeminded cowards  ''. You're literally on reddit calling every people on a server cowards and shitters. Is that not a triggered man talking?
---
Get the classic [ThreatMeter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicthreatmeter). Everyone will be able to see how much threat they are creating. It's easy even for a casual, just make sure the tank is the bar on top.
---
That should make the healer's job easier since only the tank should have aggro.
---
what server is this? asking for a friend
---
It would exist either way, but keep in mind most people probably thought the population size would be closer to Vanilla, not 8-10k.
---
How can I optimise my action bars as an undead warlock? I've not used any addons for it, and outside of thinking which spells I'd like to have keybound from "1" to "=", I've not put much more effort to it. I find I have a lot of clutter, but also in PvP so often I wish I had certain abilities more readily accessible (activating will of the forsaken or healthstone too slowly for example).
---
I had a level 11 ask me for a portal the other day, he traded me a portal rune for it, it was adorable.
---
I’m that lady at the beginning having the ￼ existential crisis. Wait, what did I do before WoW? Why can’t I remember?! 
---
Well, I guess I’ll go check Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram.
---
What an accuate description of OwO
---
When you log in, you DON'T get instakilled in org. We raided org last night, and you just can't go past gates unless you want to risk DHKs, and the gate is some of the best pvp action there is for us while not going out and "ruining your day". I can't believe after whining about WS and BRM, you ALSO whine about alliance going to YOUR CITY to get HKs. 
---
The boat from Menethil to Theramore has been camped every single day, and it's fucking enjoyable wpvp. WS is almost always dead for wpvp, and the only reason you see tons of alliance there is because they are going to felwood or heard about SOME sort of horde activity in WS.
---
I left Skeram because of the increasing imbalance and not being able to leave IF. I haven't found a single alliance player on HS that is going "Yea I love how imbalanced we are". Everyone in my guild and server discord want MORE horde to come here so we have more enjoyable wpvp. Whenever I help guildies get SGC, there's definitely alliance camping BRM, but it's nowhere near the levels I've seen from skeram videos.
---
Horde on HS are raid logging and whining when they don't coordinate anything for wpvp. It's the same people on the server discord doing wpvp, either solo or groups of 2-3. Going out into the world and dying to a group of 3-5 alliance isn't something to cry on reddit about. I've found groups of 3-5 horde and I usually just bubble hearth and come back, and they're gone.
---
Just for arguments sake, the alliance who left us, left before pvp came out.  They left when it was easier.  I cant imagine any of my old guildies sticking it out on skeram with us.  They thought they were getting ganked to much before.
---
I've seen rogues with full CDs dealing with both quite well. Rogue can 100-0 a priest and can sap a warlock to kill pet removing SL.
---
what server is this on? asking for a friend...
---
Surprised at people saying Warriors beat Ele shamans. I tend to struggle on my Shaman vs any warrior who has proper stamina in a 1v1. After they charge into hamstring you're left to fight in melee which gives them the opportunity to pummel and burst you. Even if you fake pummel it's hard to dish out enough damage without going oom and staying alive whilst in melee.
---
&gt;even with the release of BG's you'll have one side just camping everything while they wait for queues.
---
Luckily this still limits how far they can travel,  there is no way that a Horde player is going to make it to Blackrock Mountain before their queue pops.
---
It doesn't have to be prevented, it's just out of control right now. Camping and ganking is normal, but 10 people farming *every* major FP in the game at the same time, all day, isn't.
---
It should still be pretty good (white damage, blood thirst, executes will be strong).
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but if you got a 1% hit, +5 daggers weapon then you only need 5% more hit to reach the cap.
---
So you're trying to tell us how scummy you are?
---
I know right. This comment was the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Even warriors should be in there for consideration with rogues.
---
I would have mind controlled you, saved you and then after you /thanked me I would have annihilated you.
---
There is no total honor. Only weekly honor.
---
Absolutely. There is no doubt that leveling as combat swords is the best overall option for rogue. That's how I did it this time and, as long as you keep your mainhand current by grabbing the important quest and dungeon upgrades every 10 levels or so, it's not bad. I made the mistake of neglecting my weapons because i was pretty far ahead of the leveling curve on my server. There were very few people my level doing dungeons for quests and gear outside of aoe farming groups and groups of players leveling together with little need of a random dps pug. It really starts to hurt you if you're using a lvl 19ish sword at level 30+.
---
Haha lets get to it!
---
I think you just proved their point, mate. If you can't win with your words... you might be a moron.
---
I think it only gives xp for the first one and after that its only rep
---
That means nothing.  GM’s would know this 5min before us dude
---
Its like 45+ (43 if ur ballsy)
---
Eh, gunna say this one is on you and shouldn't be priority for a fix.  Not remotely. 
---
You're putting up a high dollar item, you need to pay attention to what you're doing.
---
 Except i didnt spend 24 hours camping it, nice projection though.  I got it in approximately 20 minutes because i knew the spawnrates on my server. 
---
No, you're 100% wrong here. And yeah, it was immediately noticeable and a significant difference. Sorry that fact makes you butthurt, but I understand that baddies can't get the cat though and that you therefore  justify your incapabilities by blatant denial of the reality. Try again.
---
So if I’m a sword rogue do you think mirahs hand oh or gut gore ripper oh would be better for raids ?
---
I'm usually not willing to put up the AH fee, and make heavy bandages then vendor them.  It's more work than it's worth to list them and manage them in my mailbox when they don't sell.
---
If you want to play on a PvP server, spend some time swimming through the oceans of tears in this sub from the last couple weeks.  Allies are severely outnumbered on most PvP servers.  I think I just read that heartseaker is Alliance dominated.  All I'm saying is choose wisely.  Tons of posts right now from people saying "I love PvP but this is unplayable."
---
You know, I never thought about reaching out to another person on the internet to ask a question. I'll have to try that out in the future. Thanks for that suggestion!
---
yeah I'm sure it's a "we can't tell you" sort of thing, which is why they're saying they have no date planned at this time.
---
I'm sure the discussion is on-going and it will be added eventually (free money and all) but at this time, they cannot give out any other information it looks like.
---
I'm wondering why they haven't released anything for it yet, they would make so much from people sick of PvP servers right now. Instead, they released BGs. I guess the servers would become severely one-sided if they allowed them to transfer off now.
---
I feel bad for anyone that gets triggered by internet trolls
---
Means Best In Slot, the best item you can get for a given slot.
---
For example, for a frost mage, like OP is, you can get the Boreal Mantle out of the first half of BRD, which is better than any shoulders you can get right now, even from MC.
---
So I can do Linen, Wool, Silk, Mageweave, and Rune Cloth on each city? That seems like a loy of exp in exchange for gold basically.
---
Why the literal fuck is there no server column in the excel spreadsheet
---
Herod is like this for ally
---
Cheers for down vote boys
---
Why is everyone taking this so seriously?  Lighten the fuck up
---
He didn't have a condescending tone. You're just trigger happy on the accusation because people have to condescend to you all the time, son.
---
This is the kind of twisted up logic that people go through to tell themselves that the wrong things they're doing are OK.
---
A man of culture, I see
---
This sort of comparing would be kinda valid if the servers has populations able to maintain healthy amounts of PvP.
---
As it currently is: servers are not only imbalanced but also overpopulated. Which makes it hard for 1 of the factions to do anything. They get perma ganked, are pushed into their large cities, forced to log off, unable to gear up furthering the imbalance, unable to get mats and gold further preventing them from progressing. While the opposing faction gets free reign over the server, and only having to deal with small scale ganks at odd hours or in lower level areas.
---
People have shit to do outside of the game. They don't want to spend their 1-2 hours of their 2-3 hours of daily game time getting briefed, camped, ganked, and corpse hopping just because Blizz failed to create a proper PvP environment where it's possible to do a back and forth.
---
These people signed up for PvP servers full knowing they would sometimes get ganked for the whole duration of their single game session.
---
They didn't - however - sign up for getting camped every time they log on.
---
Get it?
---
Wtf. Launch was a disaster. Rose tinted ?
---
There's a way to get there just using an invis potion, to featherfall there you need speed potion as well.
---
Yeah how’d you get so good? Go beast mastery?
---
they changed the max server population for about 5k tho
---
Because gms fix code
---
It’ll change with battlegrounds because it will be a waste of time to stand in TP farming people.  Should’ve released bgs when honor was turned on.
---
You gotta be really good, I've done it once on a single pull while leveling at 46 but I was way to inconsistent and it was a waste of my time. Those bastards have go go gadget arms, reach out across the map and smack you.
---
Not really. Because at 60 you will still be corpse running....because of trolling groups of 2 to 10.
---
Is there any thing special on tuesday? 
---
The maintenance day is wednesday.
---
I would have 5 but i burned out stuck at lvl 30
---
I've never seen that before its glorious
---
Word thanks. I have trouble finding dungeon groups at my level, literally didn’t get a single PM last night after being in trade for like 30 mins. Guess I’ll try again tonight.
---
My first horde encounter was this ?? orc riding a wolf through Elwyn Forrest... that was over a decade ago and it blows my mind that I can remember this.
---
My issue is with people doing this shit. Not faction or anything.
---
"Imbalance" yes. But when the server cap was 3000 you didnt have people camping EVERY zone in the game. Only 1 or 2. But now with 10 000 people per server at a time EVERY single FP in EVERY zone is camped by 5-10 people. 
---
Noggenfogger has roughly 2500 Alliance activly playing. And roughly 8000 Horde.
---
Then stop being so fucking stingy with your water, mages
---
I think they're cowards, yeah. Not out of angst. I just think that they're all a certain type of player that had an early breaking point for being ganked and thus pulled the trigger to server change. You have a passion for debating my opinion which can't be debated. It's a logical conclusion I have came to and I'm entitled to think you're all pussies, just like a lot of people do.
---
You only have a drive to keep replying because you play on heartseeker and don't like being called a pussy. Nothing caused me to get on this thread and call you pussies other than my desire to state my opinion because I found it hypocritical of that server's alliance.
---
You're replying in defense, I'm replying because I know it's making you thin skinned heartseekers mad because you know you're being looked down as the poonserver lolololol
---
judging from your replies to other comments, i'm gonna assume you have some issues you need to work through. get help LMAO
---
They are never bringing back layering.
---
Lmao
---
To be honest, its not just Horde side on heartseeker. I play Alliance (sadly) and if i go out in the world there are a group of 5-8 horde running around killing everyone. Even solo players just minding their own business. Happened to me 4 times in Felwood just yesterday. I get you guys have issues, but dont worry. There are people making it just as bad for us. Keep your head up, this is what was always going to happen on a PvP server no matter the imbalance.
---
I had sympathy at the start but now its just oh yeah, i'm a gigantic pussy for rolling horde on a fucking PVE server just to play shaman.
---
To the naysayers that say 'PvP happened on a PvP server':
---
**No.** Any PvP server with a &gt; 2:1 ratio is effectively a PvE server.
---
&gt;I think its more of an isue of not sticking to classic with server cap size.
---
Nope, private servers had about 3x  the current cap (assuming its 5k concurrent), and they were fine. 
---
The difference was that they were all much more balanced in terms of faction ratio, and they always had stats be publicized so people could see the ratio for picking the server.
---
While does everything to hide their stats, aren't even aware they are on trash server until they hit like the lvl 30 mark and get into the contested zones.
---
I understand the argument iam mostly tired of those meme.
---
In my POV you can enjoy wPVP, non balanced battle, being camped and the thrill that come with it. That doesn't necessarily mean you can endure that shit, which in some case can be hours of camping all day every day.
---
I know my server isn't that bad as some US server for the minority faction and even then they have no go zone if they don't group up to 20-30 people.
---
Grats! We’re still working on our first kill. Not sure if dps is low or tanks not having enough FR is the problem...
---
Off topic, how’d you get the default raid frames to stack like that?
---
Blizzard logic!
---
No one gives a shit about this nolife loser since the staff incident, don't even bother posting anything of him here.
---
Cool, i'll give it a try, it will be even easier at 58
---
if horde don't want login queues, transfer to heartseeker. if heartseeker ally don't want queues, transfer to herod/skeram/stalagg, whatever 
---
the faction queues solve the population imbalance themselves, even with unlimited transfers. you could do no work in deciding who can transfer where, they already will move to a place where they are minority because minority will have no login queue
---
Fear Ward was made baseline in patch 2.3
---
same game different servers...
---
Luckily nothing will happen. And no servers will die.
---
I have 2 BiS right now and decent BRD blues in general. I'll try it out later for sure.
---
Interesting, when I no life it I’ll often have my Mac crash. What have you found resolves this? Closing out wow every few hours or so?
---
This is absolutely ridiculous - I work project management in construction and can promise you there are plenty of jobs where people have to wake up at 5AM to perform their work. Thing is - they get off earlier. Doesn’t affect your unless they choose to let it.
---
Haha I did, but I just thought of this as a hotfix to help with how many people are upset at the state of PvP currently.
---
Who still watches this loser after that incident lmao
---
I don’t play like every one else. Playing disc, I never use renew in raid. I just choose not to over heal, and if a 2.5 second cast won’t do it, pw:shield and possibly max rank flash heal works great.  In five man only warlocks and tanks get a renew.  Works for me, and ask my guild mate how often we wipe, and how often they’re waiting on my mana.
---
The poor thing is lashing out. It's so sad.
---
In the AMA with the Devs, they confirmed paid character transfer is a very real possibility. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ct08c7/welcome_to_the_rclassicwow_subreddit_ama_with_the/exht4pm/
---
Your post title comes off as misleading, as if they are confirming it will never happen.
---
The guards at Everlook/Booty bay/ Gadgetzan can handle 3-5 people. They cant handle 40 people.
---
The game just isnt made to have 10k people on at a time. And it shows
---
We'll play anywhere from 1 to 4 hours at a time. 1-2 hours one or two weekday evenings, and 3-4 hours on a Saturday and/or Sunday. Sometimes we'll play 10 hours in one week, sometimes only 2 hours. We are not power leveling, or pushing for speed, so we're not necessarily gaining XP every hour we play.
---
&gt;So dalrends with 15 agi in each plus the set bonus is BiS for hunters during p3 I’m pretty sure. 
---
They aren't but that's fine. You belieblve what you want, I won't argue with willfull ignorance.
---
I stopped playing once I saw Blizzard really doesn't give a shit about the quality.
---
They said the week of the 10th so this could happen.
---
Using mind control in a duel?
---
This is how pvp should be
---
Easy solution: put this piece of garbage into the trash can. I finally loaded up retail and wow it felt good. The best thing about classic is that it makes you really appreciate how good retail wow is. It is just incredible how wrong the complainers are. When will we learn: Democracy. Doesn't. Work.
---
I want to know what people are complaining about, beyond "I got ganked and it sucks".
---
You are on a pvp server.  You chose to be on a pvp server knowing this was a possible outcome.  Did you want to possibly be ganked and camped or did you actually want to be able to play the game on your own terms?
---
Everyone I heard bitching about this complains they can't go out and farm or make it to instances without being ganked.  Why didn't you choose a pve server then?  If you aren't out there pvping in glorious world combat, then why be on a pvp server?
---
Is the problem that you guys didn't actually think about the possible outcomes of your decision before you made it?
---
Everyone want to blame Blizzard when they literally have several solutions to the problem.  You could play on a pve server! NO I DON'T WANT TO.  They had layering to prevent too many people in an area making it unplayable.  THAT ISN'T #NOCHANGES.  They encouraged people to roll on newer servers as they launched. NO THOSE SERVERS WILL BE LOW POP AND DIE.
---
People can't bitch about Blizzard not doing anything when several of the possible solutions are openly ignored by the players.  Blizzard HAS done things, but people bitched about them or chose to ignore them.  The bitching is really, Blizzard isn't doing this one specific thing I want because I didn't want to admit I made a bad choice.
---
And a huge pvpenis
---
So what’s better?
---
Is this not standard? Man Ive been playing the wrong games. Id never think in a million years to submit a ticket over a trade scam or clicking the wrong button. Hell, in EVE clicking the wrong button started one of the largest wars in the games history. And getting scammed is just another Tuesday.
---
Re roll to pve
---
someone deserving something and something having more uutility value are two different things. he implied the latter.
---
I might have to use that trick with a rocket helm to CC the lock and dispatch the damn pet. Without SL and a felhunter, a SL lock shouldn't be a big problem.
---
They aren't all logged on at once though. It will be much lower than that logged in a the same time.
---
BG's will help a lot, as you no longer need to camp people to even get honour.
---
I’m just entertaining the idea. I understand what greifing is and I don’t support it but there’s a case to be made that this person wasn’t doing anything wrong. 
---
If that’s how the game was designed (honorless target gets removed upon combat) and with mind control, you can force another player to hit you (while dueling) then it is not “cheating”. 
---
The GM asked him to stop and he said OK but it’s obviously a gray area in terms of “clever use of game mechanics”
---
I really shouldnt be on reddit right now but its because im at work. If I was at home I probably would have g/f aggro though lol. She fucking hates seeing me zoned out on WoW.
---
&gt;increasing server population
---
Which adds more pros than cons.
---
So GJ on that blizz
---
So you made a poor decision and then continued to make poor decisions and decided blizzard was in the wrong.
---
New -&gt; import (on the bottom) -&gt; copypaste string
---
Only took 7 runs so I have not lost faith
---
Just like sex
---
The majority of plays cry themselves to sleep over this like OP? GTFO. No.
---
Which robe is this?
---
I started P2 as a lvl 52 Warrior, maybe the single worst level-class combo possible for the situation. I’m a couple bars from 59 now. I loved ganking in retail, but I will never kill a lowbie in Classic unless they attack me. I understand their pain.
---
To be fair, if I was on a "Big" server (you know the particularly bad ones I'm talking about) and I had a free server xfer, I would take that xfer as horde instantly.
---
Being on a low pop server for PvP makes ranking up such a breeze, and removes so many if not all the problems these zoomers are crying about.  Play on a non-shit, overpopulated server and the game becomes a MMO again.
---
Back in the day I had what I thought were good friends I played with all the time in a guild.  Talked to them all the time on VOIP.  I thought they were my friends after over a year getting to know them over hundreds and hundreds of hours together online.  One day, about 8 of them were gone.  They just transferred servers, left the guild high and dry, didn't fulfill obligations, and had given no warning.  It was a first for me.  
---
It's super hard to figure out who you can trust and who you can't in the online world.  It's easy for people to disconnect, pretend to be who they aren't, or whatever.  I can't think of any way to prevent a scam like this without trusting someone: outside having them buy the mats, in which case they are now trusting you.  Hopefully, Blizzard will intervene if they can confirm your version.
---
Not yet, but I do have x2 cauterizing bands. TBH though I don't raid at that spellpower, thats just the highest I can reach with the gear I have. I'm usually raiding at about 776, since that gear is just better overall.
---
This is sorta how it's always been. If you trade the items to the other player and they take them, the only thing you can really do is report them and move on. The shitty thing here is you should always be able to trust your guild. 
---
They can do something about ninja looting, but typically don't do much for that either. I remember being in multiple groups for the 25-man drake runs in OS and having the RL take the mount. Nothing happened to them either but I've heard other stories about them losing their mount.
---
Also, they didn't issue you a warning for getting scammed, they issued you a warning for repeatedly opening a ticket after they told you they can't do anything. The answer sucks, but you can't just keep clogging the wait-list with a ticket that you've already gotten an answer for.
---
There's a difference in damage with abilities from 48 to 58. Lag won't be an issue for me and i'll be farming for gold and not EXP. Sorry for not mentioning that earlier and thanks for your input. Something to think about.
---
I dont believe you are hitting 1k dps with zero world buffs and basic consumes. Keep lying to everyone for your epeen tho.
---
And soulstone!
---
He wants his pvp server to be made more like a pve server. Maybe he should join a pve server and leave the pvp server to pvp oriented players?
---
Retail calls to you.
---
So I'm a night elf currently leveling through Darkshore. What's the best level for me to make the trek and start questing in Westfall? I want to be able to just roll in, do all the quests, run deadmines, and be out as fast as I can. I was thinking somewhere around levels 16-17?
---
You can use it to message someone who's not online.
---
Go tauren, because when you do /moo there is actually a sound. Clearly best racial.
---
i almost never see ppl in trade chat advertising for groups. look in /world and /lookingforgroup channels. also don’t expect groups to come to you when you’re advertising that you’re LFG. mostly you should be messaging others who are already LFM in the chat or start your own group. good luck!
---
This is particularly amusing due to people saying "just transfer" over server queues and such.
---
Here is the result of said transferring. Shocker.
---
I remember questing STV on my retired tuaren warrior, and there was some fellas around questing their own shit.
---
Sudden 60 gnome rogue appears, obliterates all of them, and heads to me. I spam a /cheer macro and he left me alive at 100hp.
---
I missed pvp gear sets
---
They made this game with the "You think you do but you don't" attitude. a lot of things weren't thought through fully and just sorta...thrown together because they did not expect this type of reaction.
---
Sure, but it doesnt make sense for a level 60 to skip it on to a level 39 as its the best pet for both.
---
I am alliance on pvp server too
---
The biggest issue atm is the msssive servers. In vanilla you got hit with a queue when there was 3k people online. Now its 10k. 
---
Towns dont have enough guards to handle 40 man ganksquads out for Honor.
---
There isnt enough farming/grinding spots for 10k people
---
There isnt enough nodes for 10k people
---
The game simply ISNT made for 10k people, and it shows.
---
Was that BT?
---
I don't think there's any way to convince people who don't see an issue with WPvP in massively imbalanced servers.
---
Okay. It's not supposed to affect channeling or casting.
---
The worst is when I see in my chat “you auction for X cloth sold”, knowing I posted multiple stacks (assuming they ALL sold). Then you hit the mailbox later and only one out of 10-11 stacks sold
---
If you're claiming that the 60 hunter should get it because he can get more use out of it then you are implying he deserves it more than the low lvl.
---
That’s not a blanket excuse to ignore solvable, real issues on PvP servers. In other words, you don’t let a server just go to shit because, “fuck it, it’s a PvP server.”
---
Tired of that small brain argument.
---
Noooo. You'll need more than that. Bare minimum you'll need is like 5k and staggering the novas. Work on getting int gear and run with around 6k+
---
Blizzard have really fucked up phase 2. If honor was in the game from the start, levelling on a PvP server would have been much more fun than the snoozefest that it was, and people wouldn't be going crazy now ranking. 
---
They need to start merging servers to improve faction balance, bring back layering if necessary.
---
You are wrong, actually FS COC AE combo with shatter and imp flamestrike MoE build gives  65% crit on that first blow. It is most definately the highest AOE dps spec u could go for.
---
My dumbass just missed out on an OL run with my guild then :(.
---
good to know for the future.
---
Why do you think anyone cares? Just reroll on a server with better H/A ratio. There's a certain type of person to play on a server where their faction outnumbers the other 8:1, and the only way to avoid this type of person is to reroll on an even ratio'd server.
---
So just a zoomer?
---
Linking me a Youtube from this very subreddit, of an Onyxia kill when she still had the GUID bug (Lmao), instead of posting the ***logs*** of ***your*** raid, is really only discrediting you further. 
---
If ***your*** Shaman has tanked every boss except Magmadar, I would like to see ***your*** proof. Not this Youtube  that has a bugged Onyxia fight, and holding threat for sub 3 seconds on MC Bosses, before failing to 1 phase Ragnaros.
---
I mean really dude? Cmon.
---
Curious what server you’re on. Sounds like horde on stalagg from your pompousness
---
#nochanges would also mean to keep the server caps as they where in Vanilla. Which they didnt
---
And the worst 12 weeks of your life, at that.
---
Probably was a Hunter. They tend to think they get priority on everything. I wonder how they would feel about rogues rolling on BiS bows in later phases.
---
Did you go on vacation bro? this was two weeks ago. was it somewhere nice?
---
that's his point
---
they'll be queued for bgs, but they will fill their queue time with camping
---
Because why be civil when you can act like a total cunt instead.
---
Yeah, looking at the title now it does seem misleading and I wish I could change it.
---
Come to Kirtonos, we need the Alliance
---
Where do naxx locks stack? I guess they still underperform wars rogues and mages
---
Does zoomer refer to 18-24 year olds? It evokes an image of the little shitter zooming around the room high on sugar in my mind.
---
"Somethinh something something im dumb and rolled on a PvP server but it's blizzards fault."
---
The best way to increase your dps is to not be ret, and be pretty much any other class in the game.
---
If you are ret, you have to accept dps will suck.  There is nothing you can really do about it.  In large part the items you get won't matter.  There is no magical build which will make you better than anyone who isn't awful or comically undergeared compared to you.
---
More to the specific point, not another trinket really won't make a difference.  Briarwood would is such a marginal amount of spell power increase, the AP alone would be better.  Reed would add about 12dmg per judgement and about 6 dmg per command proc.  Hand of Justice will add about 6 dmg per melee swing.  If you have a 3.8 dps weapon, you will get on average about 15-16 dmg per 10 seconds for no additional mana cost while with the reed you would get 12 per 10 on judgement.  You would be gaining 6 dmg per command proc while only getting about 4 per swing from HoJ.  Over time those this difference is about 14 dmg over a minute while the difference in Melee/Judgement would be about 30.  The next result, even without considering the possible 2% proc would still be in favor of the AP from HoJ.
---
Cus i look fabulous.
---
Bro you're commenting on my comment chain: my issue is OP says hes crying himself to sleep at night over this. My opinion is thats a tiny fraction of mentally-unbalanced people. You're coming in arguing I'm wrong, that its the majority of people. Which is it? Do the majority of people cry themselves to sleep over wpvp issues, or the minority?
---
You asked for spec and many people are just saying classes lol
---
Disc + (Any warrior spec) You'd be able to mitigate damage, and pump damage on anything. Imagine being a disc arms warr in pvp. You may need to rework some things like mana/rage usage along with spirit.  But jesus that would be a strong combo
---
Oh they will address this but not the hundreds of reports a night about people safe spotting in everlook and tanaris. OK BLIZZ!
---
This guy sounds like the guy who doesnt tip in restaurants because I could pour the drink myself it's not like its hard.
---
Orc is the best
---
[OP said he's on Gehennas](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e1x72n/hunter_etiquette_not_even_once_careful_painful_to/f8siw49?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
---
Or PvE realm, which is also an option which exists in Classic and existed from the beginning in Vanilla
---
Turns out is IS boosting my wand damage. I have +9 shadow damage on a pair of gloves and that’s the only +shadow DMG I have. My wand that does shadow damage is getting a +9 boost while the other wand is getting nothing.
---
Lol okay... there are people doing ALOT more dps then that, even without world buffs, even alliance side.   
---
Open your eyes.  
---
Arms is a significant drop in DPS from fury mate.
---
Join the Lookingforgroup channel (don't use trade!).  A levelling/zerg guild can help for this as well (should be lots of ppl forming groups/looking to fill spots).
---
Much of the classic pvp community is absolutely cancerous. I said having fun by ruining other people's play session makes you a shitty person (not even that kit shouldn't be allowed) and got heavily downvoted, lol.
---
There's a huge difference between a pedophile (yes, we would immediately report this to the proper authorities if it were posted here) and an officer in a video game booting two people.
---
Are you serious? I'm this close to breaking Rule #2 myself to tell you how dumb that attempted connection was.
---
Can we get a #\^$ing sticky as to why you cannot balance servers for faction in Classic.  It cannot work because your starting point is 60/40, PERIOD.
---
Buff Alliance PVP racials and you may have a solution.
---
Rolls PVP server
---
PVP happens
---
*Surprised Pikachu*
---
This is why you gotta space out your auctions a bit depending on what you put up and at what time.
---
Best would probably doing dungeons that drop a lot of gear to sell/de and s group that lets you have it lol. Solo lasher farm is the best we can do.
---
If you go shadow you can solo almost all of DM E with some cheese and items. But too much effort imo
---
Of course it will. Alliance will have 1 minute queues and horde will have 20 to 30 min queues. The only way for horde to make up for lost HKs and time will be to farm HKs with no quarter.
---
Noted.
---
If I trade 700 gold worth of materials to somebody, I want 700 gold. After they craft The Thing, I will trade the 700 gold back for The Thing.
---
Will this make some crafting impossible? Yes. Will my blood pressure handle it better? Yes.
---
People are constantly asking for help in these servers.
---
Challenge accepted. I will start a Druid on heartseeker today. Atleast I will  be able to stealth.
---
I definitely feel bad for some of the horde on Heartseeker because there are a few of them that actually left Stalagg and Herod to find a more balanced server.
---
I just do the books and all the lasher packs (don't have herb) and I can do it in around 8 minutes.
---
Only true of pvp servers. PVE are mostly alliance dominated

I srocked up on Elemental Earths, they are used for Greater Nature Protection Potion when AQ hits.

Important to note that AoE farming gear won't be the same as raid BiS as blizzard scales poorly with damage. So you're mostly prioritizing int/Stam.
---
On a daily uber/brd grind on a warrior, aside from a little swearing and calling the horde a bunch of lifeless neckbeards who may as well be bots, gotten past the anger and to acceptance now
---
&gt;  it's mostly the insane server cap increase.

It's almost like they wanted to shoot Classic in the foot before they even launched it.  Either that, or they couldn't give a damn to understand all the consequences of overpopulated realms.

May I remind you that the topic here is not asking for guildies to help doing a dungeon once to complete quests but spending something like 50 hours in the same dungeon? of course they would say no and that's totally normal and I don't want them to do this like I don't ask my friends to go paint my house for 50 hours. Better to play less and wait for BG.
---
And sorry but the difference of PvP activity between phase 1 and 2 is clear proof that people aren't doing it for fun. For example I was barely ganked 20-30 times during phase 1 and I saw that strangely things weren't as bad as lvl47 than 48.
---
Then if lvl48 didn't gave honor, those who feel "sense of accomplishment" by killing low level player would still be able to do it, just wouldn't get a reward that push people who don't feel accomplishment to kill low level player to do it to compete. and what about a cut off at 60? in the end it's a competition between your own faction so it wouldn't made a single difference.
---
In the end I feel you don't understand my point: yes it's how it was in Vanilla, yes I know what it would be and yes I deal with it (by just waiting) my point is that the system is awful in term of game design so you can say: "it was awful back in the days" or "that's just the way it is" but it doesn't change my opinion that it's bad.
---
That’s what I said. Why is this in bold lol.
---
Dwarf character is best character.
---
Roll your eyes all you want. I'm definitely not wrong.
---
What if I want 100-0 servers? Then it would not be more fun for me.
---
Which instances?
---
For these instances I hardly ever see people taking non-60s now:  
---
- Stratholme   
---
- Scholomance  
---
- UBRS  
---
- DM North/West
---
But for BRD, LBRS and DM:E you should be ok. Advertise that you're looking specifically for a quest run and you might be able to find a group.
---
Also, given that most 55+ are hiding in dungeons to level now you might be able to form your own group. "LFM to XXX, quest/Exp run"
---
Although I get it if you don't want to have to make groups yourself.

---
so what, we shouldn't complain about faction imbalance ruining pvp servers making it less fun for both sides... because somehow that will lead to classic turning into retail?
---
Found the alt-Reicher.
---
Post it again...
---
I love sitting at my computer taking care of work stuff and just leaving auto run on my characters to see how much I get camped. Had a 60 Druid camp me from 10am-4pm. He didn’t kill a single mob during this time. Are you hordies so miserable in your real life that this is the only way you can get enjoyment? Like for fucks sake at this point I just feel bad for you guys. Please, kill me all you want, camp me forever so I can’t play. If that’s what makes you happy I want you to be happy because that’s pretty fucking depressing.
---
Yup feels like two seconds on heartseeker
---
iirc the reagent for portal costs 50s so someone giving you 50s for portal is actually them giving you a free portal.
---
The cooldown timer is to initiate the thought that many you should just comeback later. But I do understand the pain friend. It's a good time to start leveling an alt on a PvE server, or go get res-sickness and find a quiet place to fish up some golden pearls. At least that's what I've been doing during peak hours.
---
Dungeon quests and dungeons in general.  You'll be 60 after like 4 of: brd, scholo, strat, lbrs
---
I'd roll PVE then. PVP is a bloodbath due to how honor works in classic. This is doubly true if you're alliance. Corpse camping is rather common
---
Nooooooooo...*I* was taking him. The other hunter kept trying to ninja from me. After about 20 min I killed BT. Was very uncool for him to ninja my game. I mean he literally shot BT while I was in the middle of it. Then it would reset then he’d try to steal.
---
Further evidence human compassion isn't really a thing. Humans respond to incentives. They are compassionate when the incentives are there to be compassionate, but otherwise fuck everyone.
---
it's not hard problem to solve
---
faction queues and open transfers fixes it
---
I actually leveled feom 55 to 58 doing ZF farms.  Lv58 you stop getting exp from scarabs and the bosses.
---
Tauren is best looking tank by far. Good skills and extra hp in 5 mans. 
---
That being said, if you are a hardcore player playing with your casual friends, I would plan on being that hardcore player and going either Orc or Troll (edgemasters or daggers). This will let you continue to play in a hardcore style when your friends are long gone. Then you won't regret playing something that isn't as good. Honestly I'd go Orc for axe skill.
---
I didn’t compare it to lfr, it’s definitely closer to normal difficulty. That was the guy above me.
---
That won't fix anything.
---
That is the daily life of Alliance players on high pop pvp servers so you're not the only one crying lol
---
My exact toughts.
---
This 100%.  Throwing the stun on a group of mobs that are eating your healer is going to save runs.
---
That’s what I’m saying! I can guarantee you the Horde would be crying right now if they weren’t getting cross-server queues.
---
&gt; "yOu sHoUlD hAvE bEEn PAyinG AtTenTion." 
---
Knew it, xD. 
---
I agree, I don't think this has priority and my items should not be restored by a GM.  That's why no where in my post did I mention my expectation to have my items restored.  After navigating through the help tab I concluded I would not be receiving my items back and moved on with my life.  I didn't take screenshots, I didn't call blizz HQ to report this player.
---
My point is, it was not for lack of attention, it was for lack of knowledge that such an add-on existed.  Had I known there were sweaty players standing in front of the AH for hours pressing a macro to auto-buy anything that's posted below market price, I would have been more vigilant while listing.  I always knew in the back of my mind I could quickly cancel any auction that went awry.  But, I was wrong about this.  For whatever reason blizz doesn't instate a 1 minute buffer time for items listed on AH.  But....they will soon.
---
It also requires no IQ to post stuff like this.
---
A pure PvE guild isn't getting R14s
---
.. as lube, or?
---
Dude, bro, the 2 digit IQ screams on-top of your head. It is really baffling for a human, i mean you are at the level of a trained monkey at least, to be able to type here "somethin\` somethin" but hey, failing to notice the design flaws in this ...oooh boy. I bet you have a fun job lol.
---
Not sure you realize -- 45/55 ratio means one faction is 22.22% more populated than the other.
---
That's 122 players on one side for each 100 on the other.
---
Balanced... Not really. Just not too bad.
---
I don't need to pick one. The problem with server queues based on how many from each faction are online is that you then need to take level of characters into consideration to make it fair. How exactly do you do that?
---
I am on a non-que realm at the moment. No will to risk that for an idea like this that would punish everyone on one faction, even those who don't PvP to any greater extent. Faction imbalance is an issue for sure, but this is not a good solution.
---
My favorite is the random who comes up and has you open 4 boxes and then doesnt tip.
---
Im lv 57 wl and I have a good 1h walk up to every instance. On a good day.
---
Not an exaggeration on Stalagg though. The horde around the mountain have started to Chain MC away from the mountain.
---
It would objectively be closer to balance if 500 lvl 60 horde were replaced by lvl 40 (or even lvl 10) alliance
---
So yes in your example it would help
---
will change as soon as bgs are out
---
Someone missed Swifty's incredible warrior videos...
---
You can't ask Blizzard to change the game, that would go against #NOCHANGES fkwads
---
for years and years our guild made references to a mage leaving an early mc run to wash his cat
---
There is no scam here.  I mean yes YOU got scammed but nothing really happened out of the ordinary, you openly traded someone you do not personally know a high value of items across the internet, they logged off, happens everyday on every server.
---
This whole argument is predicated on an assumption that people with more free time are losers.  Given that you cannot reliably prove this, I don't know why you are trying to frame this as some sort of fact.
---
What a true badass.
---
It is Blizzard's fault, you're right. But people who are weathered at the game and know how this shitshow is going to end would have not transferred. You can say I'm wrong but you can set a remindme for 2 years if you'd like and we will see if I am.
---
I am under the opinion that your server is going to die when we get into the reroll phases, it only has population now because of all the transfers opening up.  (obviously). Once those are gone and everyone realizes no new horde are joining and the ones that are starting alts are doing it on other servers, the alliance rolling alts will roll it on other servers as well so they can have a better experience and actually have people to gank.
---
A ton of servers had to merge in vanilla and i'd say 1/5 threads on the forums was people complaining about needing mergers. It was a big deal and it is what lead to sharding in the later releases. You don't think Heartseeker will be one of the first servers to face this issue? It was always the newer servers that had these problems. The older bigger populated servers didn't.
---
Now, seeing my perspective, can you see why I'd have a "nonsense preconception" of the players there? 
---
In my perspective, they left healthy server that will last (for instance herod) for a server that will die in a year just for them to have a temporary escape from ganks, leaving all their hard work/raiding gear in vein because there isn't even anyone to interact with on the opposite faction besides BGS. That's pretty dumb to me and worth making fun of especially when they left their respective servers just to play the opposite roll of why they left.
---
My buddy is a low 50s horde on the server. It's not any better for him either (although horde definitely own BRM). Just ride it out till the 10th when all of the honor farmers go do BGs.
---
Downvoted for making an outrageous claim about the population imbalance. The server is not 8:1 Alliance to Horde. The balance is probably more like 70% Alliance, 30% Horde.
---
Here's a screenshot from Onyxia the other night: [https://i.imgur.com/yCOSvKm.png](https://i.imgur.com/yCOSvKm.png)
---
Nochanges.. if you have played vanilla and tbc you should know that phase 2 pvp is nothing but 5+ weeks of pure bloodbath.
---
Will get better dec. 10th when we get bgs, keep your head up and stop the whining
---
Thank goodness I have my flame retardant gear on for this post.
---
But you can just give the leadership to the alt or do I have some flawed logic here:
---
You log onto your alt, meanwhile everyone else except the leader logs off. You log into your alt, leader transfers leadership and logs of, you reset. Everyone logs back on, your relog. Thats 10sec for you logging of + some time transfering leadership + 10sec the ex-party leader logging off, so maybe 1 minute max.
---
Obviously you need to farm something as 2+ people and the alt.
---
For pvp you are right. That is the reason why it has been changed for 13 years and the pvp system never came back. The raids required skill. I remember we wiped a couple of times in Mc and Ony and a lot in BWL. People were bad at the game back then and it was challanging for most of us.
---
Also pvp gear did not give BIS gear in early stages in vanilla, but now you get the best weapons from pvp until naxx.
---
Pretty much. If you're really bored and have a safe spot to fish, it's a good way to stock up for yourself, but it's not profitable enough to merit over alternative farms.
---
Don't know the name as I'm on Dragon's Call, but my friend is in one of the top 3 guilds on Lucifron and they're currently voting on whether to migrate to Heartstriker or not. Apparently the majority is in favor of moving.
---
It was in the main esc menu for me. Esc -&gt; Interface -&gt; Addons tab
---
Secret hint: Horde gets 5v1'ed too all the time. 5+v1 is the whole thing that happens in PvP as unfair kills still grant honor and people can't get it elsewhere.
---
The honor system is severely screwed with world-pvp, what people are experiencing isn't the result of faction but the pvp system. It's just that somehow horde players realize that, let themselves get ganked or try to play around it while alliance players consider it easier to mobilize friends to whine about faction balance because they need at least something to blame. 
---
And no, not horde, I'm Lucifron alliance and nothing will get me to transfer, I'll just watch the victim complex dudes leave and let the community get smaller but better.
---
/console cameraDistanceMaxZoomFactor 3.5
---
yes, you sit in line
---
with a button that lets you transfer to other servers where your faction is less represented
---
ex: horde on skeram have a 2 day queue. they say 'fuck this' and transfer to heartseeker. they literally have no queues anymore. the alliance on heartseeker with their 2 day queues transferred to skeram. 
---
balance.
---
HotW/NS Resto Druid here who occasionally off tanks or DPS, I always ask if I can Need something that I'd like and isn't going to be equipped that moment. The tank should be allowed to roll if it's an upgrade in one of his armor sets, but him wanting the healer to pass is being a greedy bitch.
---
&gt; There were server combinations in vanilla. All they had to do was communicate that certain new 'overflow' server were likely targets for combination down the road. This communication is key and it didn't happen in any form. But in a larger sense a dead server just isn't a problem, you combine it with other dead ones, the end.
---
They never merged or combined servers during vanilla.  THey did let people transfer off larger servers to smaller severs, exactly as they have done now, but they never merged.  The first time they brought "ead" servers together was cross realm shit during MoP.  Prior to cross-realm your server was your server other than Battlegroups.
---
&gt;Also you have to understand that individual players cannot fix this issue right? Massive coordination would be required which is frankly not possible.
---
Yes massive coordination is required.  People aren't asking for massive coordination, they are asking for blizzard to take unilateral action that will fuck over other people.  The argument is 'LOL GAME UNPLAYABLE FUCK OVER THE OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE I WANTED A PVE SERVER".  
---
&gt;Why would they think that most people who played vanilla and want to relive that would want 3-4 times the largest vanilla server?
---
Because it is exactly what players have done over the history of the game.  Even during vanilla once they offered paid transfers, those people were paying to go to the bigger servers.  Very few people were transferring down.  Over time more and more people have gone to the biggest servers.
---
Im a warrior, i get camped landing in thorium point, once I drop that ledge, every 5 fucking steps theres a horde raid/pack of rogues, then you get to Ben oh there's a raid camping the stairs, then the door, then the main brm entrance, then on the chain, or at the bottom by mc entrance, ok past there, 2 more raid groups to get past, 4 more deaths, make it to workshop are in front of brd, oh hey theres alli outside wtf? Nope out comes a raid full of horde, all alli dead, one more corpse run
---
To follow on, the best thing to try and figure out when reading BiS guides is *why* they are considered BiS.
---
For example, why would a Warrior want to wear Devilsaur? It's leather, that's 2 tiers below plate!
---
Because %Hit is the most important stat for their DPS and mitigation doesn't matter to them. 
---
Once you understand why certain items are BiS, it becomes easier to figure out which ones can be replaced by easier to obtain items. Like the Dal-Rend example above.
---
Yes but you didnt read what was written.  If they are in queue for an hour - hell, even 15 minutes is enough time to take a flight and camp a flight path for a bit. 
---
They wont sit idly, not gaining honor in the meantime.  They do what they're doing currently.  Which is bad
---
Where did all the big outdoor world pvp raiding go? I’m a casual player at lvl 45 and actually enjoyed being around those fights but now I came back and Badlands, Hillsbrad are all but empty. BGs come dec 10th right?
---
A lot of people are doing this because they’re literally unable to level due to opposing factions and faction imbalance. (Most people don’t have 1-2 hours a day to form groups then corpserun to spend another 1-3 hours getting half a bar of experience)
---
Time bro. This ain\`t retail to have a 60 in hours. To pay for a service and not be notified in advance, by Blizzard, that in 2019 shit like this is still happening... that\`s the issue here. Withholding this data from the customer is resulting in this shit happening.
---
Ok Boomer.
---
I'd venture its due to a different definition of "play session". Sounds like you want a hybrid pvp/pve play session, while others want pure pvp total war all out chaos etc. Luckily WoW has options for both types of player: pvp and pve servers.
---
Well no, classic wow PvP is arguably harder than current retail PvP.
---
You cant just grind rank 14 without being good mechanically at PvP, you need to consistently be able to kill everyone you come across in small groups in order to get enough honor. Those massive groups of people running around will 100% not be getting rank 14.
---
They have issued me a warning about opening tickets. I am afraid that if I pursue this issue I will be banned. So. It does not look like they want to intervene in this situation for some reason.
---
You're explanation of why Heartseeker has a horrible reputation literally applies to every single Horde server for why ally won't reroll their either and was the exact reason stallag lost most of its alliance players to begin with.
---
Servers will always have faction issues with the way world pvp works, it has nothing to do with 'reputation' and everything to do with which faction is dominant (with 90%+ of servers being horde).
---
Grats bro 👍
---
Zandalar tribe and Ashbringer are your only answers. (If you want pvp realm)
---
I'm gonna ask which one it is.
---
SL Lock counters everything.
---
&gt;Those are your words, not mine. I never mentioned anything like that.
---
It's also sarcasm dumbass.
---
&gt;I wouldn't know
---
don't be like that you evil fucking cunt bag. tell me
---
GM’s only know what they need to enforce, they don’t control the future of the game.
---
OG will win TI
---
I don't think you understand the role of the GMs.
---
They have restored items in the past. Do you expect me to just give up on 700g worth of mats when they have fixed issues like this in the past?
---
No no no you got it all wrong.
---
I ran it once almost twice a daily
---
Lmao yesterday a friend I were hunting in searing gorge and we see a mage killing mobs and we dismount you delete him and we both realize it’s a gray level 47.
---
Inches away from the player without saying a word we mount back up and ride off as quickly  as we came. It was understood that we should let this guy keep questing unbothered so he can be worth killing for us later lol. 
---
He stood still ready to die , he must have been so confused lmao
---
No shit, im not really a casual but also not super hardcore, i play daily for hours but then log when its time to sleep.  Respec costs have been a huge issue in trying out specs.  We raid on Fridays, Ony then 10/10 MC, for that I like to be combat swords or combat daggers, during the offimte I like to PVP so i need to either go Hemo Swords or Sub Daggers...respec fee is already up to 25g, and anytime I respec its basically a double sunk cost bc ill have to just respect back again for raids on Friday.  So this next 25g respec to just play my toon the way I want is going to cost 55g in total.  Basically 100g per respec when it caps out.  50g to have fun, 50g to raid again on friday.  
---
Not fucking cool

Re-roll on PVE, problem solved.

Will you continue to play the game? Yes.

I would have responded “release BGs sooner”

Accidentally got jumped by the top raiding warrior yesterday, only gave me 210honor.
---
Shittime lol
---
That's only if people are eating damage for the sake of padding numbers and clearing fast. Technically true that HpS would increase in that case, but not because of this:
---
&gt; it's a simple division problem, less time to kill a boss means each point you heal has more value in hps
---
That's not how the division works in general.
---
Exquise me sir, but he payed for this shit without being told that this can happen because, fuck that, Bliztards care only about moneyyyzzzzzz.

Same man.. really sad because I really enjoyed p1

&gt;Record 2 hours of nothing happening. Speed it up to around a 6-10 minute video and post it.

[This exact video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctn-tKXx4Sw) pretty much already exists.
---
Good on you for making a decisive choice. Reroll PvE and enjoy the grind, or quit. Its pretty simple. I enjoy my new PvE server quite a bit actually, just suits my personality i guess.

hypnotic blade from sm at 34 literally lasts you until dm/scholo.

Rank 6 after 12 weeks is not uncommon. Rank 6 in two weeks after pvp launch is extremely uncommon. My God please don't comment if you're going to give incorrect information.
---
Could make Honor less targets immune to MC. Or make it so MC doesn't remove Honorless.
---
No, gms are telling people how they are allowed to play.
---
client asks server "can I connect? I'm so and so"
---
server says "your faction is overpopulated currently, here's the line" 
---
like fuck this is not nearly as hard as layering and they did that when nobody wanted it
---
There is no scam, but at the same time I got scammed. Doesn't really make sense but ok. 
---
They didn't just log off. They transferred servers to avoid item restoration.
---
Seeing those dwarves fighting the skull-leveled dragon on the flightpath was always awesome
---
Your looking at this game from the wrong perspective entirely.
---
The original designers of wow were all old DnD/ EverQuest heads. World of Warcraft is literally dungeons and dragons set in the Warcraft universe. 
---
It's an MMORPG, not an action game or moba. Some "skill" is required for raid encounters and especially in PVP but the real "skills" to he obtained are the ones developed outside of the game, then brought into the game.
---
These skills I'm talking about are those that are required to overcome the collective action problems that pvp and raid encounters present to the players. Decisivness, initiative, charisma, creativity and dedication are just a few. 
---
This is a social game after all and getting 40, or any other number of players, to cooperate consistently in order to overcome challenges is where the real skill in the game lies.
---
I tell this to all of my guildies, "Be the player you want to meet in the world". It's corny as fuck but it's true. The skill you need to develop to be a successful World of Warcraft player is leadership.
---
I feel like that is a good compromise. No system is perfect, and being able to take common sense into account helps out weighs the negatives.
---
Fire - Ony/MC and BWL

Nature - AQ

Shadow and frost - Naxx
---
You definitely have a point. I'm also tired of seeing these posts, but I also understand them. Hopefully something gives.
---
Great post man cheers. Wanting to do it with my priest friend I’m warrior 5/8 T1, 1 piece of T2 got Quel Serrar or Eskhandars right claw to choose from. 
---
Maybe we’ll give it a go my gear seems to be at a level others have said it would be doable for.
---
I believe there's a large exp penalty if someone in your group gets 0 EXP from the mobs (Mob level will be grey in this case). I've heard people say it's up to a 90-95% penalty.
---
But it's still worth doing if you can clear the mobs 10-20 times faster with them in your group.
---
For best results I think you'd want to find group members who still get some EXP from the mobs.
---
Right, but some people aren't good, or have bad gear, or like doing things with friends.
---
I personally find farming to be the least enjoyable thing in wow. Unless I have a friend.
---
God if only they could come out with some sort of instant que system or something! /s
---
That is a terrible idea. Go play on a PvE server.
---
Put it on a grey dagger/sword that is not soulbound so you can sell it after ur done with it;)
---
Just from experiencing the realm and going on kromcrush forums. There are soooo many of is horde running around and rarely find any alliance. Constant posts from alliance on forums speaking to how few there are of them and how many people have transferred off the server, including entire guilds. It really feels dead sometimes -_-
---
this meme would have worked so much better with mages
---
Bang for the buck. Most likely more important bugs to fix first.   
---
Only an indie company would have a different mentality.
---
WELCOME TO ALLIANCE ON ANY FUCKING PVP SERVER ENJOY THE RIDE BABY IVE BEEN SAYING THIS SHIT FOR TWO MONTHS SO ITS FITTING TO TELL YOU TO GO ROLL ON A PVE SERVER YOU FUCKING SHITFORBRAINS IF YOU DONT LIKE PVP DONT ROLL ON PVP (The insults are meant to be ironic I don’t actually mean these mean words)
---
My server is about as balanced as they get so it won’t effect me in any great manor,  but to sit and think that the oppressed faction is any less important than yourself is narrow minded at best and realistically shit head behavior. If implemented and queues arise out of it you’ll have the option of staying in it to play on that specific server for whatever your personal reason is, or you’ll have the option to move where you will balance out a faction imbalance and no longer have the queues.  Where this differs from What we have now is you have the option to change your situation as minority faction players are stuck or can quit. If you cannot see the difference in the situations and how the faction queue solves this than I cannot explain it any simpler.
---
I will never watch a video with that shit robot voice.  Just speak into a microphone if you're making a video dude.
---
I did read it and also noticed there were no guilds names or how big they are. EF was skewed slightly horde before so I’m skeptical that a few guilds would be so apocalyptic. This mentality and the downvotes I’m getting all reek of circle jerk musk.
---
Why should Blizzard have to compensate for the asinine behavior of a player? Get it across to people that being a jackass for no reason isn't acceptable and the problem will stop.
---
I did. It was locked in 5 minutes and I received a condescending response from Vrakthris. Check the second imgur link in the post.
---
Gut
---
Using emojis like this is cringy at best. When they are used in a message while effectively kicking you from guild it makes it seem like you dont care and is rude AF. Imagine a boss telling you that you arent getting the raise you were expecting like this. 
---
Sorry bud no💰💸 in the budget. Better luck next year👉😎. It completely trivializes what you are trying to say.
---
Build a better game.  Blizz dont punish min/maxers with longer queue times because your game is inherently broken.  You'll just lose customers.
---
Buff Alliance PVP racials and convince 10% of the horde to move over to the Alliance, and you're golden.
---
Oh and dont completely #$&amp;% up server balance by allowing unrestricted transfers.  Allowing a mass exodus of the minority faction on a server, only to have it imbalance the new server, is beyond brain dead hahahahahaha.  Honestly who thought this was a good idea????????????
---
**This is the most parroted opinion of Classic.** 
---
**^(It's a fucking MMORPG, of course time is heavily rewarded.)**
---
Because paid transfers don't help the issue. If they opened them only for the dominant faction, sure, but all paid transfers did back in the day was ensure that the balance was thrown further off by flight of the minority faction.
---
Thanks for the input. Going to level hunter and then warrior. More than likely an orc.
---
I was pvping late Saturday night (before midnight) and my hk’s carried over to Sunday
---
Meanwhile on Atiesh, the Horde have become so accustomed to losing that even when they outnumber Alliance they will still fall back to hide behind their civilians in TM. Jason Lemieux is Horde MVP on Atiesh in SS vs TM.
---
Can you link this build?
---
GUID bug?
---
Also no logs to post since no one has warcraft logs in raid. Which i mentioned before.
---
Also the youtube has 2 hours of a shaman being a tank in MC. You obviously only watched like 30 seconds of the two hours of video of it so if you wish to stay ignorant that a shaman cant be a tank in MC go ahead.
---
The only cross relam shit before MoP were battlegroups, which were crossrealm battlegrounds.  There were no crossrealm or server mergers during vanilla.  At the point I quit during Mop there weren't any server mergers at all outside of consolidating some of the absolutely smallest non-english servers.
---
I can't do anything else through the ticket system or I might get banned. So the last hope is this reddit gaining traction by some big names.
---
It's bigger than just g kicking two people, but being that you felt the need to distinguish that comment tells me that you that you really don't care to discuss it civilly.

It's highly personal but here's mine
---
I created this account to post some census I've been collecting, mostly to show how bad it is. However, there was a fairly solid thread on faction imbalance the other day that barely got any votes. So I decided to skip my big post all together as well. Why bother? Many players (mostly Alliance) already know that this is a problem, many others (mostly Horde) can't empathize and don't care. Then there's the constant posting of the horrific Wowhead post with the statistics that are outnumbered and wrong due to different factors.
---
I'll just say that Ashbringer, the "most balanced server", has 30% more level 60s in the Horde side than in the Alliance. That's the most balanced PVP server.  Oh, and BG queues for Horde-EU? There are 6 PVP realms for every PVE realm and there's no Heartseeker equivalent. You're going to be sitting in the queue for a long time.
---
There is no classic decay.  This was posted per a BM on their forums, date included.
---
No **decay** in **classic** a **respec** can cost you 50g max the whole time if you let it get that high. so pick your talents wisely but depending on your level i i wouldnt re roll.Aug 31, 2019

The problem here is that you were sort of trying to double dip.  If you had it your way, you would be decked out in all of the druid gear that is often passed on, while also saving all of your points to blow on that Staff of Dominance you want so  badly.  That would likely piss of other players, did you admit to this while discussing it with the GM?  Or...did you play coy like you weren't aware of this advantage?  Frankly, when people do that shit it pisses me off, so I would have kicked you, too.  If you admitted to it, I would have had a nice debate with you and potentially revised the rules.  Not giving the item to someone who could actually use it just to have it disenchanted is an inefficient way to spend drops.  
---
Seems like you were trying to have your cake and eat it, too.  IMO, I'm not a fan of any of these loot systems, they all seem to end in drama.  Either loot council with a group you trust (what does that even mean in a videogame) or free roll.
---
this is wrong, you don’t need tailoring for bloodvine since the actual gear is BOE. the only benefit is you can’t get the set bonus without 300 tailoring but iirc it’s only like 2% crit which isn’t a necessity.
---
thank god, the first week it kept saying "player not found"

Putting it on OF or MH doesn't matter, it makes you immune to disarm regardless
---
A mom that plays WoW with her kid!? that's a present in itself... but congrats on all the warm fuzzy feelings from people all over world. Happy B-day to your birth giver :P
---
Maybe because they have to devote development resources to a product without the possibility of microtransactions.  Maybe they didn't think anyone would keep playing this long enough to make it worth doing right.  Maybe they don't want their customer base to get used to that kind of monetization model.  Maybe they thought that Classic would draw people away from their more profitable retail experience.
---
Maybe they're just incompetent, I don't know.
---
We appreciate you taking the time to flag this as an underrated human.
---
However, this appears to be in error and the human is a priest, and therefore has a useless racial.
---
DM north is just frustrating. So much RNG with the mobs aggro tables and whatnot. And 1 mistake basically resets your whole run. Mara is so much more chill. I farmed about 1k gold in straight drops from mara in about a week so no complaints here.

This is why all Mages should be obliterated. Magetards are the worse.

It most certainly does not decay lol...

It will last until the players decide to end it. I've seen 48 hour AVs on private servers. Generally people try to rush through them as you get better rep per hour and honor per hour.

Food and water both stack up to 20.

Hope this helps, bye!

The pallies/shamans get shafted in this scenario though.

I see some point and laugh.
---
I'm sitting here, wanting really bad to go do a BRD run, but can't get over the 1+ hours to get there, 2+ hours if someone leaves right as we start. I don't want to quit, but it's forcing my hand.
---
Oh, I'm sure. The problem I'm presenting isn't the lack of asking. The problem I'm talking about is a lack of coordination and general care (for both sides). A possible (but not likely) solution to the whole thing would be for players to treat PvP servers like they were at WAR..craft. Sure, go raid, run dungeons, ect. But look at those things as a means of getting tools to give you an edge at defeating the enemy faction. I think generally, the mindsets of the factions are vastly different. Alliance seems to be generally setting goals of "PvP is fun because I am in danger while exploring", while horde players are generally "I want to crush the enemy. loktar ogar!" So, with this mindset, the alliance is at a disadvantage due to the fact they are generally already putting themselves into a victim role. If I'm wrong, please correct me, I am generalizing based on observation.
---
My realm is also fairly balanced, 55-45 or 60-40 depending on what sensus numbers you choose to trust. But good on you for throwing words like that around. 
---
I am simply stating that this is a crappy "fix" as it indiscriminately punishes people on one faction regardless of whether they PvP actively or not. Not everyone on a single faction does, some are waiting for BGs and just PvP casually, some rolled there as their friends did and run dungeons or raid, and so on. 
---
I acknowledged that server imbalance is an issue already in my previous post but disagree with that this would offer a good solution, and you start throwing around expressions about shithead attitude and so on.
---
&gt; Your post history is troubling

Honestly, his reddit history seems pretty normal.

I hate that I have become part of it..... But at the same time, I secretly love it.

People keep saying this but that's not true.

I'd be careful cause I think she resets around 11am server
---
Ignoring the “losers” bait...
---
What made Vanilla WoW raiding “harder” was everyone was in worse gear (bis optimization wasn’t a thing), didn’t have “crucial” add-ons for a while, and generally learning to play the game. Rag wasn’t killed for what, 5 months in Vanilla?
---
Now you have an exact list of what gear you need for your class, what order of buttons to press, and videos to watch how to behave in the encounter.
---
Side by side the mechanics of modern raids, even on the easiest difficulty, are much more complicated than the average vanilla encounter. The only hard part will be guilds struggling to progress as gear drops are limited and every week more people leave.
---
was just memeing. variant of the "say that to my face fucker not online and see what happens" internet tough guy meme. thought more people would get it lol.
---
Leveling a fury warrior. Best to spec into enrage or dual-wield specialization first?
---
Then Alliance would do the camping in the world during their ques.  Both factions cannot have insta ques at the same time.
---
That's petty as all hell.  
---
Just take the killing.  You don't know how many times that hunter was griefed, or most likely, people not knowing and attempting to help( thus despawning the demon)  
---
I'll be honest, I'm the first to respect a /wave, / nod, /smile, etc. But, with a timer like that, it's better safe than sorry. We've all had plenty of people who have nodded back and then attacked.  
---
All you've done is just embittered a few more people to the process. It doesn't matter the faction, those are people, using their time, waiting that timer, waiting their turn within their own faction. Now your server has 'about 5' more horde willing to grief your faction during the quest.
---
Just roll on a pve server. You'll be able to flag yourself if you want pvp. And battlegrounds are coming.
---
Literally half a day or more of free time everyday that you put towards a computer game... Yes.
---
If you get to the pool where Rotgrip is coming up and notice a hydra, hit it with a concussive shot. Then do it again a bit later and it will lag pretty far behind and give you plenty of room to kill Rot when he starts slowing down. At this point I've pulled 2 hydras before and still didnt sweat it .
---
Gratz which is just a shorter way of saying Congratulations. :)
---
Any idiot can't get R14 on most servers, and couldn't back in vanilla either. You actually had to team up and win battlegrounds more successfully than other premades on your server. Now, ontop of that you had to play a lot. 
---
Now if you want to win 1v1 or 1v2 you actually have to have skill, the skillcap is very high for most classes because you have to weave in the use of potions, trinkets, engineering gadgets and other stuff in to have a chance against your counter parts.
---
...dude asked about two manning and I gave an example. No one’s trying to prove shit my dude

I made a post about weekend based faction queues earlier:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e20v49/the\_minority\_faction\_on\_imbalanced\_servers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e20v49/the_minority_faction_on_imbalanced_servers/) 
---
Honestly I think it is the best solution. The game is playable for the minority faction during certain windows. Majority faction players actually have MORE incentive to transfer because they know they will have windows of fair play in the short term while the populations are balancing. It solves the inertia problem we have now while giving minority faction players some much needed reprieve.
---
I feel for you on Heartseeker man. You took the transfer to make things better and got screwed. Reminds me of the phrase "No good deed goes unpunished" :(
---
Correct
---
Through hurts xD 
---
Don't put word in my mouth.  I never said anything about rouge/sham skill caps, but using videos as 'proof' is useless if they have diff patch mechanics, vanilla or otherwise.
---
The word you were looking for regarding talent trees was overhaul, not rework.  They rework some talents every patch even today in retail I think.
---
Don't get salty because someone points out a flaw in your argument
---
I wonder what servers will become Alliance dominated when transfers arrive!
---
I actually ran into a 5-man multi-box team of Human Warriors, maybe one Paladin was with them, but they had similar names to what you saw.
---
I don't really understand the point of a 4 Warrior, 1 Paladin multi-box setup...
---
Former Ret TBC player. God I loved the class and spec, but in Vanilla it is such a crippled spec. Trying to min-max it is beyond hilarious.
---
Idk, AL has fear ward so I think it’s a moot point in using game mechanic to your advantage
---
Lol no.
---
I saw a level 45 hunter running around with a paladin trying to throw flare out to help him out. Couldn’t have that happening so I murdered him.
---
Yeah Faerlina was bad last night. It was literally 5 minutes from when you typed something before it showed up.
---
They then restarted the chat service or something because everyone got disconnected from chat and reconnected, it was fine for a bit but crept back up to like a 2 minute delay over an hour or so.
---
Do you go out of your way to read things you know are going to upset you?
---
What you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this thread is now dumber for having read it. I award you a downvote, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Is that a scientific definition?   No.  Is there a defined threshold?  No.  That is an opinion, therefore not a fact.  Thanks for playing.
---
If 10 Alliance log off, do 10 Horde get kicked?
---
Imp blizz is 3 talent points, the shatter specc requires more to really be worth. And with Imp blizz you dont really need the shield and Block and so on, so you will be able to make a way better all around specc that way.
---
Paging u/araxom !
---
You know dang well everyone and their mother would cry and whine to blizzard about the games taking too long to be worth doing. This community is never happy lol.
---
Underrated human racial abilities
---
True, but if you're going to use the set why waste the crit by not having tailoring?
---
Alt+f4 fixed it for me. Faeralina
---
I also play on an alliance underpopulated realm (stalagg) and I see what you're saying but they've had the advantage drastically the whole time, and even trying to be objective about it I don't care if the horde get treated a bit unfairly in order to fix this issue.  Being massively overpopulated while leveling allowed their faction to level faster, grind reputations, mining/herb nodes uninhibited and raise their power so they could gank and further marginalize the alliance from the start.  Being overpopulated has allowed them to camp dungeon entrances and flight paths like BlackRock mountain in OP's example allowing their faction to in general be better geared than their enemies by having easier access.  Having a group of 5 fall apart from the hour it takes to get to the dungeon while being ganked is a real thing and has happened to most of us. Its demoralizing.  And its further demoralizing to know that you have a poor chance of beating your enemies in a fair fight due to that lack of gear, even IF you're lucky enough to manage to get ganked by one out in the open that's not with a 5 to 15 person gank squad. 
---
All of this has caused the horde on this server to have a massive advantage that is more than just outnumbering the alliance; it's being more powerful with no hope of the gap being narrowed until late endgame. (Its doubtful cross realm BG's will fix it, the majority of realms have more horde than alliance so they will in general have longer time between ques in order to go out and gank for a little extra HK boost between matches; even if all areas aren't camped like they are now, key areas will still be) question  It's no wonder the marginalized faction is transferring off or quitting making the population disparity worse.
---
I miss this so much! It reminds me of when I started playing with my friend.  
---
We had two Tauren and we were questing around Crossroad, while I was at the NPC to repair my gear I hear him say "Wh.. what... Oni? What the fuck was that?"  
---
Me: "That??"  
---
Him: "Yeah, there was a micro mob who started attacking me and killed me, it was shorter than my foot, like a midget"  
---
Me: "Oh... Those are alliance, other players who chose the opposite faction"  
---
Him: "Oh.. cool... Let's go kill him then"
---
This is exactly my point. Somehow horde players accept this and alliance players blame faction balance instead. The system is pure trash.
---
I feel like posting on a forum worrying about what other people do with free time opposed to playing a game you enjoy makes you the loser in this scenario.
---
On mine people opt into it, they PvP flag and brawl it out in Hillsbrad
---
Part of the problem is that some items require more total stacks of items than there are slots in the trade window. So with your fix, they would need to increase the number of slots in trade
---
Yeah I'll kill lowbies all the time, but then just keep riding. Literally no reason to camp a lowbie outside of sadism. That's what people aspire to be now.
---
I play on faerlina, mostly because my buddy wanted to play with the streamers, he’s a 60 mage geared and with epic mount and thinks the game is I a great state and everyone (including myself) is bitching/ shouldn’t have rolled on a PvP server. I’m 60 as well and fairly geared but I still have stuff to get and an epic mount to farm and it’s been absolutely cancer, I either wpvp with everyone else or get farmed trying to do other things and that shouldn’t be the case and people who aren’t in that position (because they can no life) will just not understand. I even got my buddy to admit one night that if he was in my situation he would be hating his life but he’s not in my situation and apparently it’s my fault for being in my situation, not blizz fault for faction imbalance and lack of foresight regarding wpvp. 
---
I think wpvp can exist and the game be healthy but faction balance plays into that, when one server is so heavily leaning in on direction that faction can pretty much hold down the entire world making it hell for the other faction to do anything. With balance, the factions would truly be warring for these areas, like Blackrock. Something I’ve noticed on faerlina is that not a lot of ally will group up and hold an area down like blackrock but the horde will and I’m sure doing stuff other than wpvp on horde isn’t as toxic as it is for ally.
---
Meanwhile, on Pagle -    None of what you just said. BG's release Dec 10 and voluntary world pvp, save yourself the metric fuck ton of stress you just described and get what you want. Some damn peace and quiet, and avoid what you dont want, getting dogpiled because what the fuck did you guys expect joining a pvp server cuz Blizz has already been TERRIBLE at balancing servers for years.
---
As a fellow WoW fan, I hope you find satisfaction, but I highly doubt you will find it on a pvp server.
---
51 warrior, still wearing Raging Berserker’s Helm from herod back in SM Arms. When/what do I upgrade to? Or is the 1% crit good enough to carry me to 60?
---
Any advice appreciated
---
Yes and yes. Thanks for playing. Try again.
---
Lol back in vanilla I was in highschool and me and a friend made two low lvl humans, bought a guild charter and made &lt;Mushroom Vendor&gt; then hung out in cutthroat alley psting ppl who happened to rarely pass in efforts to coerce them into going in that inn/house to but shrooms from us lol
---
The only way you can prove that is to show that the "new money" going out would be higher than the money going out currently. At 50g per respect you'd need 5 resepecs at 10g per to "break even" on the money leaving the game. 
---
Do you really think respecs are going to happen 5-6x as often if the price was decreased?
---
You could even argue that the amount leaving would decrease. There are a lot of people that respect twice a week and that completely suits their needs. You just decreased the amount leaving from 100g to 20g. Now you need 9 more respecs to make up for this one person.
---
Thank you for tagging him.
---
Yes blizzard had NO ability to do ANYTHING about the faction imbalance this is ENTIRELY on the players
---
Oh wait they ended up utilizing faction specific transfers AFTER they already wrecked the ratios on a number of servers.... hmm I wonder if they could have predicted that the smaller minority faction would be the ones immediately looking for an exit
---
You can’t blame the rats in your maze when they respond to the incentives you design

Nice blogpost.

&gt;Maybe they're just incompetent, I don't know.

This one is the most likely option.

Taken from :  [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760687407](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20760687407)  : discussing the changes post patch 1.11, where they started a decay.  Classic launced at patch 1.12 so this should 100% be in effect.
---
" We start out patch 1.11 with a decay mechanic for respec costs! Throughout most of Vanilla's life it increased in price every time you paid to respec until it capped out at 50g (which is actually a sizable amount of gold back then) so it was very expensive to do it on a regular basis. The cost was reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold. This still didn't really do much for anyone who wanted to be one spec in a raid and another spec outside a raid, but it did make it manageable if you wanted to occasionally change your spec"
---
Was called paranoia used it for most of my time at 60 in vanillia. The main  difference was it didn't auto do a /target command when you click on the player in the nearby list
---
I'm not worried about anyone else. I'm simply stating facts for discussion.
---
Restrict the faction queue to weekends. Most guilds raid during the week so this would avoid that issue. It would mess with majority faction players looking to raid during the weekend, but that would be part of the incentive to transfer.
---
This would at least REDUCE the number of people with a sub-optimal experience, and limit it to certain time windows. Right now the game is virtually unplayable for the minority faction on most servers.
---
Just because babies are crying doesn’t mean you have to feed them. Babies cry just to cry sometimes.
---
How was rerolling off a high population server a poor decision?   It was literally what they wanted and what I wanted?   Do you even know what you're saying?
---
what about the reduced healing effect?
---
Ignorant of what is happening alliance side.
---
The difference is that those up at 5 AM have a routine and are used to going to sleep at 9 or 10 the night before.  To those not on a routine, it absolutely makes a difference waking up hours ahead of when you normally do.
---
It was 2 to 1 when you cowards left. Good job crying and leaving a 2 to 1 only to create a 4 to 1 even worse ratio.
---
Put them all in one guild and have a rotation of guilds on the opposite faction trapping them somewhere, making sure they don't contaminate other players.
---
I hate that quest so much, but gratz OP!
---
Historically, rank 10 could be achieved with 2 hours a day of pvp for about 8 weeks. Rank 11 probably another 2 weeks. But if you grind harder it might be doable faster.
---
It was more a comment on, how I don't want to play anymore after this bullshit.
---
I wouldn't underestimate what requiring 40 players does to difficulty though, both in scheduling and actual playing. The Baron bomb is a lot easier to do when there's 20 competent people vs 40 with fillers since one person can screw everyone.
---
Hey! I signed up for the 12:20-12:30 CST time slot to post this! You took my turn!
---
First off, that is a very old page that isn't even updated any more
---
Secondly, what he is doing is 100% fine. He is postijg different video guides that ARE related to the subreddit and he is NOT spamming them one bit.
---
This is pretty hilarious. Why are you so mad and why did you make this thread? Did your superior intellect finally realize vanilla is grindy?
---
Do you? Because it seems like you've rerolled on several pvp servers then complained about the pvp.
---
Game isn’t playable because the number of groups have decreased? Maybe less people need this content?
---
people throw shit on retail all the time but when classic launches and the other group throws shit at classic, now theyre offended lol, classic community is pathetic
---
Lol are u sure it isnt middle east server? :D
---
I know right! They quit but when they saw me on Classic when it came out they were too jealous not to join! Thank you for the bday wish ❤️
---
I meant the internet
---
This is the only answer. The weapon lasts you until 60 and is good enough to compete with those late game dungeon items.
---
Almost as if people are geared and dont need to do DM or BRD
---
PVE rule set lets you opt in to PVP battles.  Other players can't ruin your play session, you can still fight people if you want to.  PVP rule set lets you ruin peoples play session all you want, at any time, for no reason at all.  If you want a rule set where other people can't ruin your play, then why the fuck did you pick PVP?  The rule set is total chaos, there is no rules about population balance, no rules about "fair fights", no rules about even levels, no rules about towns being safe because of powerful guards, nothing at all.  The only rules are basically you can't attack your own faction.
---
If you chose the PVP rule set then got upset when unfair fights happened ALL THE TIME, I don't really have any sympathy for you, you picked the rule set that can and WILL reward players with victory for only taking fights they can't lose.
---
Just re-roll PVE, and if you like PVP then wait until BG's come out and do BG's on your PVE server.  That is the exact experience you are describing wanting.  No one can mess with you, and you only fight somewhat fair fights only when you desire.  There is a rule set already for this it's called PVE, just re-roll PVE, why are people against re-roll PVE?  
---
You made a mistake, you were wrong, you don't like the PVP rule set.  You thought you liked it, but what you liked was the fantasy in your head that only other people your level would be in your zone and you would have cool battles with them from time to time.  That was a fantasy, the PVP rule set doesn't enforce that at all, its total chaos.  You don't like this, so you should accept you made a mistake and re-roll PVE.  Why play PVP server if you don't like the chaos of open world no rules pvp?
---
Fury + fire would be dopeness
---
Really, the only advantage of being on a pvp server is if your faction controls a one for a while, you eliminate some of the competition for herbs/mines/fish. I know since P2 released, I’ve gotten many more thorium veins, and as a result, more arcane crystals. As a warrior, I have very few options for making money, so this really helps a lot. But then again, I don’t play on a horrible imbalanced server. Smolderweb is pretty even at about 55-45 Horde.
---
I dunno why people are so obsessed with honor farming anyways....the rewards arent even that good unless you're the very top ranks.
---
I was going for Tyrion Lannister
---
Nope. Bigglesworth.  
---
Digging in to research though, it seems that we used to be 50/50, but since world pvp happened a lot of alliance have fled the server taking advantage of free transfers, and we are closer to 60/40 horde/alliance now.  
---
Still, the issue is the massive population,  not the iMbAlAnCe. And I don't apologize for calling Alliance crybabies. Literally every post I see complaining about being killed in a videogame on a pvp server is some entitled Alliance brat.
---
Okay a simple "wrong" would've done just fine
---
never in my life would I have ever thought I'd see the phrase "thinking its a gotem". Thank you for this
---
I did submit them with the original ticket. I did not mark the ticket as resolved, Blizzard did. I put in another ticket saying that I thought the response was inadequate and that I would like speak to a head GM or manager. 
---
He never specifically /gquit. He logged. Then server transferred while logged. He left our discord without saying anything, and he left the server discord without saying anything.
---
Herod has been great! Groups a plenty and lots of pvp, because I wanted what comes with choosing a pvp server... pvp.  It’s like you bought a house or a car that you thought you’d love but when you realize some of the nuances of that particular home you have some regrets.  You can sell the house but with commissions and the like you’re not going to come out ahead.
---
Stop complaining, you didn’t think through your decision. That’s not our fault.
---
Yeah it was tricky as hell as shadow.
---
&gt;You can’t blame the rats in your maze when they respond to the incentives you design
---
You can when the rats demand the maze to be built to their specifications.
---
I would like to know how anyone has a solution for faction imbalance at the onset of the game.  It doesn't matter how many servers you open or how low you cap everything, how do you fix a 60/40 horde bias across pvp servers?
---
The only way is to simply prevent people from playing horde entirely, and that would have gone about as well as anything else.  How wide do you split the servers?  What happens if you weren't there on release day and your only option is to roll alliance on a 40/60 horde server?  What if you were forced to roll alliance because horde was capped and then a new server opens and new people get to be horde while you can't?
---
Clearly no one would ever be mad about any of that.
---
Why are all the deplorables so obvious?
---
You guys are the embodiment of the NPC meme.
---
Thank you for recognizing my superior intellect, peasant.
---
Uh no, in Vanilla, I didn't pay back 35g fast enough to this guy so he claimed I stole it and Blizzard suspended me. They should have helped you.
---
A solid plan IMO. I made the trek at 15 from Loch to Westfall.
---
Did I complain about pvp?  Where did that occur, please quote where i complained about pvp.
---
So it sounds like you actually just don't read or maybe its a comprehension problem.   either way you're out of your element.
---
I didn't replace it until I was 60 and got eye of rend.
---
That's because it isn't about the items.  You want to change Staff of Dominance to Headmaster's Charge, or Silent Fang, or a Skin of Shadow?  Go for it.  I used readily available examples that everyone can easily grasp to demonstrate what the same action being scaled up represents, and even explicitly said.
---
"The one thing that didn't change in all this is the behaviour of the perpetrator."
---
At which point you realized you lost the argument, and now you're trying to regain some ground.
---
Is there any way to toggle PvP rank titles off?
---
Yeah it's pretty accurate. Not sure why so many people are taking offense to it. You clearly don't intend the word " loser" to be literal.
---
Pretty sure u farm 100 manual crowd pummelers, put lifestealing on all of them, get elixirs of shadow power and dragonbreath chili wear full spellpower gear and meme spec ftw
---
you make it sound like the act of one person in desperation resulted in the thousands of misplaced players across these servers. it is clearly blizzard's fault for designing this awful system to begin with.
---
you criticize this guy for taking the only option offered by blizzard in an attempt to remedy the problem, and act like he malicious intent. nobody wants the faction imbalance. it's good for nothing. don't act like a moron.
---
A good mage counters a good ele shaman if they both know what they are doing. It can be pretty close though.
---
When I get home from work, I'll be on attempt 3.  One of these days, lol.
---
I just find it amazing how it's always the majority faction who says "I never see 24/7 camping". It's honestly pretty hilarious. If you want to see it, maybe start an alt on Heartseeker? Or an alliance alt on an equally horde dominated server? That is, if you REALLY want to see it, and are not simply in denial.
---
Just trapping people in horde dominated servers will make them quit instead of transfer. No one should be forced to remain on a server as a punching bag.
---
Its already silly how if you feral charge midair, you quite literally just fly to your target like you were shot out of cannon. Its hilarious.
---
Small is right, the team allocated to work on classic is not big.
---
But I seen the Emoji Movie like 100 times..
---
It's from a movie.
---
Roll on a PvE server.
---
\+1 to limit PvP crying posts.  Maybe we should have a daily "oceans of tears" thread where people go to post their PvP sob stories.
---
The icons dont look the same if it didnt sell though. If it sold it shows you a money icon.
---
New rogue here. Should i try to be obtaining something else besides dalrends if i have devilsaur?
---
he thinks the rake looks cooler and therefore is worth the slight attack speed reduction
---
not everyone plays this game for the specific purpose of min-maxing
---
some people play for *fun*
---
If you’re going to be the main tank and get thunderfury, troll is the best option for berserkering. 
---
If you’re going to be an off tank, Orc is the best option due to axe skill. 
---
If you’re only doing 5-10 mans, Tauren would be best for the AoE stun.
---
Then they can quit no one is forcing them to play. You are at the mercy of the world when playing an mmo that's what makes it fun.
---
So I have a 60 Ally character on an unbalanced PvP server and it's a huge PITA to do anything. I am considering making another character of the same class but on a PVE server, but I'm afraid that once BGs come out, the new PVE server will be bland and dead. Meanwhile the PVP server will be alive and with less overall ganking and death squads since BGs will be a thing. Is that a possibility? What would you do in my situation?
---
Foothills is already empty on my full pvp server.
---
Look up flame strike cone of cold ZF gold farming on YouTube. He lays out the spec trees and explains how to do it.  It’s very effective. 
---
I’m not sure when to use it for leveling though. I’m just a simple gold farmer
---
everyone spouts the same thing without actually looking into it, I have HOJ + black hands, I have royal seal. Even hitcapped royal is better. HOJ procs can be nice but using recount over 20k hits HOJ proc'd 43 times with an avg hit of 250 ish. Less than 1% of my total damage , adding more hit = more whites connecting = way more damage. 
---
For burst sure HOJ can be nice especially with multi-procs (Rare!) but over the course of a fight hit wins out .. although once you hit x% hit perhaps hoj goes back to being better
---
I saw a guy forming an MC pug last night (just
---
him, no guild) he was saying everything is up for roll including legendaries but BOE epics were on res. Is this a thing people actually get away with? Seems like such easy gold but I would have assumed people would flame you and not put up with that.
---
Can Chain Heal chain to people in different raid groups if they are close enough together?  If it can, how does it prioritize whether to cross group lines or not?
---
Are you not able to read? I said in phase 3 they are BiS. 15 agi will be available then. Before you start calling people willfully ignore or obtuse. Make sure you read things clearly
---
Someones little feelings got hurt clearly.
---
He definitely fights people with engineering in this vid.
---
Swifty was also decked out in the absolute best gear possible for a warrior IIRC.  
---
Gear means a lot more for warriors than any other class. Kind of makes sense.
---
I highly suggest trying to request a callback from support instead of ticket service if possible and escalate to manager from there.
---
You might be more cringe than the imojis in Ops pic
---
Herba will make you more money than alch will unless you dont play much
---
No it isn't.  They've said they found the original values and only had to change like two lines of code.  Later, spell batching was changed to be faster, but this was past Vanilla.
---
I don't think conflating a silly gkick with pedophiles really gives you much ground to stand on, either. If you wanted to discuss it civilly, you could at least provide an apropos game-related reason why name-and-shame should be allowed. Instead you went for the most hyperbolic and emotionally charged example you could to establish false equivalence.
---
&gt; These items are BiS for PvE
---
I don't know about other classes, but I looked and that's not even remotely true for mages. For most of the slots the PvP gear is BiS for p2, though the T2 pants off Rag are better than the r12 pants. BWL has a better PvE drop for every single slot compared to r12–14 PvP gear, and it's likely to get cleared before anyone hits r14 (which can't happen until February).
---
That is really the crux of the problem. Faction balance just doesn't exist at all on so many servers, and you choose between farming solitary and helpless characters or being farmed, but actual world pvp is few and far between. Not sure what solution they could really implement, because I'm not sure why horde would want to leave a horde dominant server like Stalagg to come get farmed on Heartseeker at this point, but people taking that leap is what would be required to start fixing it. I'm not optimistic for the long term health of most of the servers tbh.
---
Holy (pally) + Holy (priest) ultimate holy spell crit, pally crit refunds, literally just healing crit machine

I have a little sympathy due to much larger server population and how insanely bad faction imbalance is on most PvP servers...
---
...but only a little because it's PvP. 
---
I've never liked PvP centric games because they're flooded by flavor of the month followers who are typically extremely vocal about their demands.
---
Word up, just struggling to get groups. Nobody wants to invite the 58 mate :-( I promise I know what I’m doing haha.
---
Second time I'm seeing this guild ad on this subreddit. The goal of advertisement is to get heard of. They fucking nailed it.
---
Hoj is a haunted fucking item. You either get in in 20 runs. Or 200.
---
I think that is my only option besides hoping this post gets a lot of publicity.
---
Are there any major profession recipes that are coming in the later phases?
---
This is great! I have problems figuring out what my cc target should be and target priority. Still working on that.
---
Lets face it, enhance is the worst pvp spec for shamans. Its just a meme where you run around and sometimes 1 shot noobs. Otherwise you just get kited and die. See the experienced enhance shaman w hand of rag losing nearly every fight in the duel tournament. 
---
You want that chest cause its purple. No other reason.
---
I would love to be a GM for a day just to talk to people who do shit like this
---
Night elves though? Gimme that juicy grape booty grrrl!
---
Congrats! I was doing my first run of BRD for quests and I got HoJ! It felt good to be lucky!
---
Soon the day will come when my lead will enforce debuff slots - a sad day it will be.
---
I've killed Pyromaster 48 times and haven't seen the shoulders even once.. Something is wrong man..
---
"I made a choice I now regret. It's someone else's responsibility to fix it for me."
---
Nice
---
Thats because all of the casual plebs quit, retail noobs can't handle the grind, good riddance.
---
No problem, child, no problem.
---
If he gets Edgemasters at least its pretty decent but yeah, not really worth it.
---
This has always been their policy. They dont want players leveling easily on a PvE server, then transfer to a PvP server at 60.
---
Because the other hunter was going to harass me non stop until I gave up on my tame.
---
I wasn't solving the faction balance issue, I was finding one guy a solution who hated where he was.  You can't force faction balance at this stage in the game.  You can't even force it if you made it so unique accounts per faction had to be even, because once one guy quit, the balance would be off.
---
wtf...you got some issues dude.  What an odd use of biblical reference.  No one is "sinning" or going against "God's divine rule" here.
---
I’m pretty social and don’t mind making groups, Its just hard to find groups. I’ll take your advice and do BRD/LBRS and DM East for now, and hop into the others at 60. Hopefully I can get to 60 soon!
---
No, you really didn't go through this in vanilla... We went through wpvp on unbalanced servers, sure. However the population cap on the server these days its a lot more than vanilla. That isn't a reddit opinion, that's a fact..
---
&gt;Blizzard is an evil company **only concerned with profits**, but also they're desperate for classic to fail so that people who don't give a shit about **retail unsubscribe and stop giving them money**. That's a real big-brain take.
---
Wut?  These two point completely contradict each other, do people really think this way?
---
In classic you're meant to choose a role and stick with it.  Changing your spec is supposed to be a big decision.  They start out with low costs so people can figure out what they like...then they go up way higher for the purpose stated above.
---
if you are a clicker you may want to look into a UI addon that will basically clump up all of your abilities in a little square so everything you need is very close together for easy use
---
Why are furries playing classic when Vulperas are in retail?
---
Then what are you whining about? Server pop? Because then it seems like you want the single player experience later expansions offered that vanilla never was.
---
Sadly mages have to rely on engineering to be consistently successful against warlocks though.
---
I don't have World of Warcraft, I have Hello Kitty Island Adventures...
---
&gt;things like dual specs or cheap re-specs would end up ruining the classic experience.
---
That's a weird way of saying "would make Classic way more enjoyable with literally zero downsides".
---
OB was nice, I'm not playing right now but it's a really friendly server, both factions.
---
Roll PVE then. I have been playing Alliance on Pagle and it has been pretty awesome. Lots of nice people, easy to get groups, good AH economy. Always full but rarely qeues, 10-15 min max on busy nights. Haven’t seen a ton of open world PVP but there are frequent raids in Org that are pretty fun, and I am sure BGs will be packed. No streamers that I have seen, but most of the big ones are in PVP anyways.
---
Dont use nature damage. Been doing since DM released. heal twice while hitting as many lashers as possible once each with rockbiter. Fire nova. Magma. Heal while magma goes off. 2nd fire nova should about finish them.
---
Not as quick as other classes but still works. Im 5/8 ef and can sometimes do 3 pulls without drinking with mp5 and mana returns from 5 set bonus.
---
30sp will only add a single point of damage to your blizzard, it's not worth it just for that.
---
Maybe one of your addons is doing that for you?
---
Mine looks the same as the guy you replied to as well.
---
Weird how you can mechanically do this, but Blizzard won't program an actual fix for this exploit. So is this actually against the rules or is it on a selective basis where Blizzard GM's become concerned about lost subs from the number of dustressed player reports? Why is something allowed by the game until I get reported enough times and verbally restricted by a GM? Why can it be done to begin with? Blizzard fix your game.
---
ngl this would be cool, but I’m only permitted to using curse corruption and shadow bolts :(
---
Everyone who has gear don't need it.
---
The ones who do need gear cant be bothered corpse running. That dont leave a lot of people who do need it.

---
You my friend want an Rp-PvP server 
---
People are friendly open minded and fun !
---
It depends on the dungeon. After about 5minutes, it'll put you back at the entrance. The dungeon isn't reset, so you'll have to step out and reset then go back in.  For DM, this is easy.  But for stuff like Mara, you'll be in the waterfall area, and cannot step out to reset, so an alt/friend resetting is required.
---
A waiter has to be polite and nice while running up and down for hours to get tips. Mages accept a party invite and click a button. It's not even remotely comparable.
---
If you’re horde, go to the FP in Desolace and farm the lobster crates. Bring a means to breathe underwater. Even if it’s busy the crates respawn quickly. If there’s only one or two peeps there I’d suggest grouping up with them so you can coordinate routes. 5x lobsters turn in for 55s. I’d usually net 5-9g in an hour. You can also check the neutral AH for lobsters. As long as each lobster is under 11s a pop, you’re profiting.
---
If you’re Alliance, you can die and go to hell ;P
---
You can go way faster if immolation potions are cheap to buy/make.
---
I and other players do not want them as it will only make faction imbalances worse, gives ninjas/scammers an easy way out of ruined reputations, and is an overall negative for server identity and reputation.
---
People need to calm. down. about WPvP. You can still dungeon level/grind, and at worst, take a break or level an alt. BGs are coming out in 2 weeks. Chill.
---
My definition is what the op described. People did not knowingly choose PvP servers to be camped their entire play time. That said, with your username I doubt empathy is something you are familiar with.
---
Consider each time you join an instance a fresh instance ID.  It takes 1 hour of inactivity for an instance ID to expire, and you may only have 5 active instance IDs at any time.
---
The 1 hour begins from the last moment you were inside the instance, or if you reset instances that ID becomes permanently inaccessible, requiring 1 hour to become 'free'.
---
This weakaura will track your instances very accurately, I've never had an issue with it:

---
Rolling on a pvp server but can’t bother to corpse run? Sounds like they shouldn’t have signed up for pvp.
---
If this is your first time ever playing wow id start with only questie and better vendor price. They are not intrusive at all and have great value.
---
Besides that id HIGHLY recommend not playing with a veteran player and rather just play by yourself. This way you don't get tainted by their idea of wow and instead you'll get your own adventure and idea. Which in my opinion is the number one thing by far, that makes this game great.
---
Good luck.
---
https://i.imgur.com/CZ8c8uE.png made a little video just for you! Should take about 20-30 minutes until it's done rendering and processing on youtube.

You mean what wintergrasp did in wrath?
---
Bur
---
That's why respecc'ing is really cheap to start out.
---
Yeah it's all over the place. I did a run from burning stepped that only took my one death last night, but then sometimes you have multiple raid groups of either faction rolling through and it takes 30+ minutes. It's also funny with the balance you'll see one group holding down BRD entrance, with the other faction holding down Black Rock Spire and the chain constantly switching control.
---
It's not like "weeeee this is fun haha yayyy" fun but I get a kick out of the sound male gnomes make when they die so that's ok I guess.  I'm just pvping to get the mount discount so will probably cut back to raid logging or leveling alts after that.
---
Principle. If they’ll ninja a chest in a lowbie zone and it doesn’t matter, why would that care if what they ninja is actually valuable? The people who steal low level chests grow up to be the people who ninja dungeon loot.
---
Looks like it's either speed pot or invis pot depending where you jump from, right?
---
If they drop and no melee needs them, I have no problem with a hunter taking them if it's an upgrade. Don't put words in my mouth either.  
---
And I was a rank 13 druid in vanilla and had a hunter at level cap for raiding and was in the server first clears of MC, BWL, AQ40 and the first half of Naxx.  
---
All of our rogues had brutality blade by BWL. As for 20% drop rate - look it up.
---
Roll PvE. Idk what you people thought PvP stood for when you picked your realm?
---
you’re not wrong xD
---
Horde can’t understand me?..... I played retail up to level 73 and am 26 in classic and I never knew this. I didn’t do like ANY pvp in retail, but I have tried talking to a few horde I’ve met in classic. I’ve said things like “Friend” or “peace” or “my friends will kill you if you kill me” and only ever gotten /spit or like /laugh as a reaction.
---
Hmmm.
---
Some people are already building twinks, but most people will be focusing on their mains first when BGs come out. It might not really go up in value until 2020.
---
And that's the type of comment OP literally is talking about in the post. I'm not disagreeing with you or defending the other side. Luckily my server is balanced but the Alliance are just actually doing other stuff rather than camping Searing Gorge / Burning Stepps/ BRM for hours on end, like carrying their lowbies through dungeons to get the average level in their guild up or doing some other dungeon for guildies BiS for raiding.
---
You know what takes even less skill?  Posting copypasta from 2006.
---
Warriors are a mixed bag because so many people play them - you have no idea if they are a kiddo or someone who has been playing since launch. 
---
They can’t bullshit skill/kills like other classes can so it’s always an adventure to fight one.
---
Should've let the tier get disenchanted
---
Build of pretty much same, you can still have 3/3 blizzard just for clearcast procs. You just use CoC and only use nova when you get resist or if you feel ballsy to crit more. You can deal with some mistakes and also you can use 1st rank CoC forever if you wish as your Mana will regen in 10 seconds.
---
Well a lot of us dont want to play on a pve server, if I had to choose between pve and being farmed 24/7 Id just quit the game.
---
Exactly...people wanting to lower the respec costs need to stick to retail.
---
Yep. I had a similar situation, although my PvP that day was between 3 am and 7 am, which is a separate bug post. I had hoped it was just a graphical bug, but it didnt show up after the server reset. Caused me to lose around 10k honor. Very sad day and I can't even talk to GMs about it because they all say it's a display bug.
---
As if layering wasn't the biggest change of all... created an entirely different game, with different economy and different availability of resources.
---
Let me summarize this entire clusterfuck of a thread. 
---
The upgraded PvP gear is available right now and was released alongside the honor system. This is in lieu of the weaker blue PvP gear and atlas loot is incorrect in citing “phase 6” for the rare quality PvP gear. The gear cannot be accessed until rank 7, but it is visible at rank 6, which is when players can enter the PvP quartermaster room. 
---
What is so hard about this to understand?
---
Sure beats the fucking crybaby whinefest of the last 2 weeks, sounds like you guys are all having a total blast as you quit in droves and as the op says, cry yourselves to sleep
---
Like my god. "Pls blizz plsssss do something" for 2 weeks now
---
Cool tabard, I like it
---
Why the fuck would I need to look something up when I’ve been doing MC myself for almost 3 months now and have my own data set... it’s not 20%
---
always ss my priesties :)
---
I dare you, I double dog dare you
---
To answer the question if anyone is curious; you can remain drinking if put in combat, and resource gain gives you threat. It's the same reason why using a mana/rage potion can give you aggro.
---
i do it my style 120 all single stack at the same time. bid price 1 copper just to piss people off ofc
---
Why should I pay for someone else’s mistake or frustration ?
---
Thanks for the tip and for the horde!
---
Trying to Sell a Band of the Underworld for only 200...struggle is real.  BiS for at least two classes as far as I know...
---
quests in westfall starts at 10 if i remember correctly and you need at least lvl 15 for deadmines but realistically speaking 17+ is ideal.
---
On my rogue i did the move at lvl 12-13 and didnt really have any issues
---
PvP happened on a PvP server. If you don’t like it then reroll on a PvE server. I don’t know what you expect Blizzard to do about this. Blizzard can’t force people to play a certain faction on a certain realm.
---
It's not PVP if the other side isn't even fighting back. 
---
It's not PVP when one side controls all the flightpoints.
---
It's a onesided gankfest on most servers and that's just a fact.
---
Wowzers I got down voted for asking a guy to explain himself. Looks like it spawned quite the argument lol. Love you reddit!
---
Agreed. Herod is a shit show, but I'm having a blast. PvP comes with the territory of a PvP server. So what if I have to corpse run a few times to get to BRM. I dinged 60 as a warrior and I'm nearing full bis. Put a movie on, get on discord, talk with your guildies and get to walking lol. 
---
I still will yell "FUCKING ROGUES" every time I get cheap shotted + kidney stunlocked though.
---
12 clear max in 3 months. Huge dataset you got there. 🙄
---
I’m still not sure I understand the difference. In one case you’re simply consenting to pvp at certain times, in the other, you’re consenting when you join the server. 
---
So do you not enjoy BG? Or first person shooters? 
---
I guess I’m just not sure why a surprise competition is more intense than an expected one. I’m pretty hyped/intense for either one, because I like to win.
---
I PvP all the time on my PvE server, I just do it at my own discretion.
---
Horde on a PvP server? What’s it like playing with children?
---
On December 10th this problem will magically disappear

Did you forget to take your meds?

I've been trying to think how I could pull Voone up here, I need his gem last. Can't quite reach him with Eye of Kilrogg

Tauren, warstomp and extra health are awesome.

you cant blame Blizzard for your choice of server.
---
This is Reddit, it's all a waste of time but i personally can't wait to bump this thread with the links of all the heart seeker alliance/horde begging for mergers in a year. Now that will be cathartic.

You tell yourself that, but the real reason is probably because you are more similar to the type of person described in this thread.

holy specc, rank 4 renew, r4 flash heal, the cleanse thingy, r3-4holy nova, 1 mana pot 1 dark rune, selfbuffs gg

I wonder if the circumstances had flipped and you personally had been unable to play the game for weeks on end. Would you call yourself a brat?
---
Thats fine my man, up to you but I don't think a minority of people, who literally cry themselves to sleep because they can't pve on a pvp server, should be able to change entire game characteristics.

What is the quest addon that everyone uses?

The fishing pole is NOT free. I had to kill, like, 10 turtles for that thing!

Ofc dw fury will outperform arms in raid single target dps.. but there’s no need doing 1k dps in mc, you clear it anyway. should I spec 2h fury with my OEB and absolutely suck ass as soon as I leave the raid and go pvp/dungeon? Nah thanks. If you wanna tryhard in mc that’s your deal, I’m fine doing 5-600 dps in arms and pvp with a good spec when I’m not raiding. Ofc when bwl is out playing arms is out of the question early on
---
Haven't tried it but I don't think you can kill a blue boi before the sap wears off
---
I'm sure you are probably very similar to the type of player described in this thread.
---
Stallag was not even close to 2:1 at heartseekers opening.  Server discord census apps had the server at a minimum of 5 to 1 but once level 1-10s were removed put the H/A ratio even higher.  People left to get to play the game, not sit in queue for 3 hours and get corpse camped the remaining hour or 2 od the night they had left at best.
---
My guild has one.  He never shows up on the dps meter but at least he's got innervate, battle rez and the 3% crit buff for our warlocks.
---
And there are other mmos that release content twice a year for people that only play a few hours a week
---
That's a pretty dumb solution considering this problem ends on December 10th
---
Why start over on a scrub server instead of waiting it out for 2 weeks?  If he can level a new character in that time he might as well do it on the server he is currently on
---
imagine saying that and having that name and being wrong
---
That's what happens when you don't support the vocal minorities opinion. If it makes you feel any better I upvoted you and then proceeded to be downvoted on every valid comment I made. :P
---
Herod alliance - join the fight brother!
---
Which classes have a surefire cookie cutter spec?  I know rogues for sure don't have one.  You've also gotta balance which pvp talents you want in your build....or choose talents based on what other raid members have.
---
Frost mage and resto druid! You can run but not really, also i can not be stopped.
---
Some guy was yelling in Kargath "wtb portal to org" I whispered him 1g. I have the best screen shots ever now because of him.
---
I transferred to heartseeker as horde from kromcrush. I was also on the verge of quitting for the same reasons you mentioned. I absolutely love it here on Heartseeker. You have to find your spots because the alliance can be overwhelming in the popular areas. There can be a few frustrating moments like being camped by 10+ people. But overall, I am having much more fun than I was on kromcrush. There aren’t as many dungeon groups going on horde, but that’s really the only downside. To me, I like being the underdog and I feel like the pro’s outweigh the cons. Especially if you are looking for wpvp.  You don’t have to look very hard to find it.
---
What is a solid US PvE West server to start fresh on? I was thinking Old Blanchy but I'm open to suggestions.
---
Look up spellpower coeff, it is not worth it for aoe leveling.
---
I did mostly brd runs from 58-60. With a few scholo runs and lbrd
---
I don't know the math by any means but from my experience the 1st week I did raid grinding for honor and I didn't get much. This past week I did smaller parties and got a lot more honor in a fraction of the time.
---
This. The fight is so insanely dependent on whether or not I can kill the grounding totem in time to counterspell chain lightning. Its rough
---
But it's actually the perfect comment to pair with the name
---
Fire totems don't proc Elemental Devastation. If they did, I agree, it would be a lot better.
---
To be honest its not that fun we are simply not enought alliance. Horde have been camping Ironforge the last 2 weeks and you get gangbanged everywhere you go. Even when  you try to get some decent 1v1,2v2 you get jumped by other horde that are close.
---
The only way to go outside is to form a group
---
No problemo as long as it is optional.
---
Going the lesser faction as a rogue would make getting honor pretty easy imo. On my server you never see alliance travelling solo since they know their outnumbered pretty badly on the server so they go as groups, but horde just wander off solo because they aren’t as likely to encounter any alliance, so a sneaky rogue could grab lots of free fill honor hks.
---
Correct, its your definition of a play (minimal pvp AKA pve) versus the play session those other players are going for (wracking up HKs on a pvp server). 
---
I understand people made ignorant choices in the beginning, though some basic research could have enlightened them to a core characteristic of a game 15 years in the making. However they still have the choice to rectify their mistake.
---
That said, if you're triggered by my username, you probably really are crying yourself to sleep on a pvp server like OP lmao &gt;&lt;
---
Lmfao thats hilarious
---
I'm just saying the way he is talking sounds very similar to the no tipping people. I'm not saying that the duties are comparable and that you should give a mage 8 USD for a portal. I dont even think that paying 50s for a portal is unreasonable. It's just the way he worded it. It takes no skill and it takes 10 seconds. When I read that I envision an old dude saying it's not like it's hard to refill a glass it takes like 5 seconds and I'm supposed to tip them 20% for that? These kids dont understand capitalism if they want to make good money they shouldn't be a waiter they should learn a real skill. It's not as much the point of what you should pay for a portal, but the way he said it.
---
Using corruption in raids is one of the stupidest things warlocks do
---
and druids or anyone who uses invis pots to try and get the jump on someone
---
Don’t play an mmo if you only have a couple hours to play. Don’t try and change a 15 year old game because your boomer ass can’t handle a video game. 
---
Why blame the game when you are the one limited on time?
---
“I have only XXX hours to play so the game should cater towards that” 
---
That’s not how things work.
---
The problem is the combination of large servers and large imbalances. Neither on their own would be as significant of an issue, but when you have both, they amplify each other's cons
---
I transferred from Blaumex to Arcanite reaper which has a Alliance Advantage and  haven't seen this in a few days. Just now that I m in the majority and I don't participate in wuss tactics. I wonder how lame people like that are.
---
Titanic legplates p5
---
The person I replied to pointed out that he has proper raid gear so he deserves it more. The implication is that OP believes that Broken Tooth will serve more purpose to someone who is an active raider, when it makes no difference in a raid environment.
---
Ugh lost mh roll with a 91

Tauren are awesome! I wish they could be Alliance...
---
See that's the problem, you don't know because you didn't read so now you're shifting the goalposts.  Honestly, if this shit is anyone's fault other than blizz it's people like you who run around rabidly defending blizzard without any context or a single clue what you're talking about or any kind of coherent point.   Why did you even reply? Because you think being contrarian makes you edgy?   Somewhere along the line you confused yourself and here you sit still confused.

That's the positive reinforcement I need haha

Pretty amazing to see the mental gymnastics some go through to feel better when they reply to reddit posts while they wait for another person to land at a flight path every 10 minutes.

#NOCHANGES.
---
This is what's happening to Alliance on Skeram... They really should just merge the two servers instead of allowing more to transfer off. It would be a perfectly balanced and populated server.

This is not entirely true. The [Business Judgment Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_judgment_rule) protects a lot of what the board of a publicly traded company decides to do. Successful shareholder lawsuits are very rare.
---
As someone leveling alliance on heartseeker, I'm having a hard time feeling too sorry for the horde. I get that the server is extremely unbalanced and not playable for a large portion (such as yourself). However, there are plenty of horde on the server that aren't helping the situation. At any point there will be roaming gank gangs of 5-10 horde in several lvl 30-40 zones. We aren't even worth honor and they will 5v1 lowbies and corpse camp. I've seen less horde in zones that I'm worth honor in than in zones where I'm 20 levels under them.
---
If these players would stop harassing people that aren't worth honor to them you'd have enough people to fight back in the end game zones. Game would be a lot more playable. Their interest isn't in wPVP though, they just want to grief. 
---
Blizzard really needs to take a more active approach on balancing though. Faction specific transfers aren't enough when people don't want to go from corpse camping the opposing faction to being the one being camped. Maybe introduce a system where you queue into a transfer batch and it doesn't complete until 100-200 people have queued into it. This way, people have assurance they aren't walking into a blood bath with maybe a dozen other players.
---
I thought maybe you could read but alas you’re a moron
---
Ask for layering back? You said it yourself additional servers doesn’t address the fundamental imbalance
---
I never said you “need to be fair” but the pvp server experience relies on some semblance of faction balance, if your rats are drawn to one side of the scale you need to design some measure to balance it
---
Queues are an easy and relatively painless incentive for playing the minority faction. Is it really anymore “bullshit” than non-faction queuing? Why should I be punished for my server choice!! Because blizzard is ensuring the gameplay experience of those who were online before you, you can wait, transfer, or reroll. The choice is yours.
---
I transferred from Herod on the first round of transfers, way back in the day. I embraced Earthfury as the “dad server” it was; close bands of friends ran dungeons, created guilds, and put together scrappy raids. The community was small enough that I nearly learned the names of every regular poster in world chat. Deep bonds and bitter rivalries were formed. The world, though small, felt alive and inclusive, it was home. 
---
For a time. Then, the zoomers began to invade our quiet server of dads and chads. The wise kings of twitch chat, Asmongold’s apprentices, spurned from the attention he never gave, made their presence known with memes and emotes abound. Ninjas were reported to world twice weekly, where never we’d seen one before. The world was burning, the alliance imploding, crumbling. 
---
The balance of the horde and alliance was strong at first. The first week of honor’s introduction was a real war. Menethil harbor was ransacked by a horde raid, and held captive by a team of rogues. The battle for south shore raged night and day. Control over Blackrock Mountain turned hands ten times over. Battles were hard fought and every victory coupled a loss, but both sides carried on. 
---
For a time. Until the zoomers came. Their raiding parties outnumbered the horde. They trampled Southshore, they liberated Menethil, they extinguished Blackrock Mountain. I sit, now, twiddling my thumbs at Thorium Point, waiting for a challenger, any at all. But not one dare come.
---
So to the zoomer, the refugee, the curious transferee, welcome to the realm that was dad before you got here.
---
Warriors with death wish are basically a death sentence for warlocks because you can’t fear them off you for more than a few secs with death coil. 
---
Berserker rage 10 secs -&gt; death wish 30 -&gt; secs -&gt; berserker rage 10 secs 
---
Kind of niche since they need to be fury but it works.
---
Mankrik is populated and the faction balance seems to be decent (definitely more horde than alliance, but it doesn't seem to be an extreme like some other servers).
---
I've only ever used the slowfall + swiftness to get there as a mage, though if you're a warlock an invis pot may be required just to make it to the first safe spot without dying.
---
It’s weird trying to explain to people who have no concept of how numbers work how you enjoy PvP when the scale and ratios are reasonable.
---
“OMG PvP happened on a PvP server! Go back to retail!”
---
No you wouldn't at least not on the same scale. 
---
For example right now we have around 9k players on servers when 3k should be the max. Let's say of those 9k, 6k are horde and 3k are ally. Of those 6k horde only about 4k are on at one time, only about 2k of them are Pvpers and only 1-1.5k of them are actively camping locations. Let's compare that to the old world with 3k people. 2k of them are horde, 1.5k are online at the same time 750 are Pvpers and 350 of them are out hunting. The world difference between having 1000-1500 people and 350 people camping the map is HUGE because the map is the same size on both servers. There will still be some imbalances and there will still be some zones that horde owns but they can't own the entire map and that's the point.
---
Our sub/hemo rogue tops the damage meters soooo....as long as you allow for a hemo debuff slot, they're good for raiding as well.
---
Just read the comments on this sub. Some people here act like only Horde players grief while every Alliance player is a true champion of the light.
---
I imagine you don’t really want an answer, but I will try to give you one. 
---
It adds an exciting level to the game when you have to be aware of your surroundings. To ride up to an area for a quest and happen across the enemy. You get an oh crap moment where you think ,do I attack? Do I wave and maybe we can just do our quests?  Ok I waved, he waved back. All is good we just want the same thing 20 fangs and be on our way. 
---
Ok, I can’t pull multiple mobs, if he sees my health to low the “truce” might be over, I could be to easy of a target. Ok back to getting these fangs. OH Shit, where did he go??? Did he finish his quest or is he behind me. Crap there he is. Target him... oh wait... he was just chasing a mob. All is good. Ok, got my fangs time to wave and leave. 
---
Or it could play out oh crap and I go some place else. Or we square off and fight. But it adds a cool moment to the game. A part that would be lost if the enemy is just an enemy but there is nothing they can do to you. 
---
It’s fun
---
Now what OP is talking about is the not so fun part. I don’t want to  pve it takes away to much. But I won’t spend time just getting killed over and over. At that point it’s time to just find a new game.
---
That first bit hits home.  Phase 1 was fantastic, you'd get ganked, you rank back, there's the occasional camping by an instance portal, the occasional a brawl, sometimes a general gank squad, whatever.  The absolute worst was that once a week or so one faction would decide to take over Kargath or TP or Dire Maul.  PvP happened, and it was fun.
---
This isn't PvP, this is PvE where one faction is the E.  Every once in a while that faction bands together to fight back, and they are immediately swamped by opposition.  It's the absolute worst combination of a terrible honor system, bored players, bad decisions by Blizzard, and the modern gaming mindset of optimizing the fun out of games.  At least when there was no honor, there was nothing to optimize, so PvP mostly happened because people wanted to *fight*, not because they wanted to fill up some meter.
---
I get 230 honor per kill in open 1 v 1 combat, I used to see 20+ horde camp 1 guy every 3-4 minutes. Isn't it much slower? I got rank 3 without ever camping a flight path.
---
Thanks dude felt amazing and the whole guild couldn’t believe it haha
---
One warning from one GM. And there is another person in that thread claiming they were told it was okay by a different GM.
---
Nothing matters until the mechanics are changed or Blizzard issues an official response. GMs are just people doing their job - they don't all communicate with each other.
---
That's just not true. Last tuesday I logged on at 730 am est and my rank was there. It definitely doesnt update with the server downtime.
---
I'm not really sure what's funny about that experience if you're the one who has to corpse drag your way into a dungeon.
---
i legit farmed less than 4K honor since release, i'm not the one you should be hating rofl.
---
They should have implemented a sort of faction population cap. If max server pop is 10k make it 5k per faction, but ideally more servers and a cap of like 3 or 4k.
---
I'm confused as to your objection then. The sub is full of idiots who genuinely believe Blizzard is intentionally sabotaging the game, and it's generally accepted -- as you point out -- that public companies exist to make money. 
---
I've yet to see one of said idiots even attempt to reconcile this paradox, so the answer is either that they really do think this way and are just heroically stupid, or they're not thinking at all.
---
As a mage, a good druid is a tough matchup, shaman is a little worse, shadow priest is my worst. Locks are a little tricky but pvp trinket makes it a bit more if a fight. They have the upper hand but it's not a terrible matchup.
---
WPvP was incredibly fun.. in phase 1.  Lots of fun at Gurubashi, alliance and horde guilds trying to wipe each other for pride.  I genuinely had some of the most fun I've ever had in WoW pvp in phase 1.
---
WPvP =/= honor system.  The honor system is shit.  Once you strip away the intrinsic motivation and give it an extrinsic one, it results in what we see, i.e. the most miserable toxic experience for everyone with pvp autists spamming every server's discord.
---
BINGO!
---
Im on incendius which is an overall more balanced server. But the imbalance of factions at level 60 is 33/66. Doing anything in tanaris, winterpsring, burning steppes, searing gorge or felwood is a test of sanity.
---
Holy crap, Twokings, I can't believe I randomly found this today. This is Kroveron. I remember you, &lt;Army of the Black Prince&gt;, Joe, Anchen, Punko, Gatticus, Chillbob, Bumbbunny, and everyone in this picture. The server was Dethecus, and the times were good.
---
I assume you're playing Classic. What server? 
---
Anyway, hope your doing good man. Thanks for the memories.
---
Jesus christ, I only played phase 1, and I couldn't stand getting into SM.  This is just asinine.  Thank god I stopped playing. This just looks like a waste of time.
---

Is also a great source.
---
The one on being insta killed on logon is so relatable bro. Ironforge full of corpses daily because hordes are invading big balls style and all Alliance do is stand and watch others die. 
---
Tonight we called for a group to help some ganking action at Winterspring, took 30+ mins to assemble a team of 10. Upon arrival, killed some wandering hordes. 10mins or so pass, and reinforcement arrive. 20+ hordes just steam roll us. 
---
We couldnt even res as we were severely outnumbered. Waited 10-15mins for them to leave. Many from our raid left as well. The remaining port back to IF and what do we see? Whole bunch of Alliance just standing around. 
---
Shits pathetic and really sucks to play. I feel ya man.
---
You guys are so dense its laughable. You realize it's corpse run wherever you go. All the time. Every FP.
---
It's not. Oh I was ganked by these guys once. Oh today was rough.
---
That's not what I'm hearing at all. PvE servers still have the large scale battles over BRM and SS/TM, but you can just turn it off when you don't want to pvp. So you have the raiders who turn off pvp and run in for raids while those who want to pvp are there competing for control over the mountain.
---
There are still plenty of people earning kills on PvE servers, you just don't need nearly as many since those not interested in PvP aren't competing with you. If you're on a PvE server and only 10% are really trying for those higher ranks, you're looking at a much lower population than on a pvp server which would have a much higher ratio of players trying for those higher ranks.
---
I mean, by that logic a good anything can kill X Y and Z.
---
Been level 60 for weeks, have not had a single 1v1 pvp encounter yet in classic WoW.
---
Boy did pvp used to be fun in this game...
---
What faction do you want to play?
---
I get it, and thankyou bro haha
---
Because you made a choice to get rez sickness. Babies don't choose to be in the icu.
---
They could have EASILY fixed it - but the nochanges people wouldn't allow it. They shoulder the blame for demanding a flawed vanilla instead of a fixed one.
---
Sorry, but there's really nothing they can do outside of forcing faction queues WHICH WEREN'T IN VANILLA or fixing the honor system so it's not vanilla-like.
---
Not true. You just need 18 hours a day to run premades.
---
Pretty distinctly remember several "High Warlords" in vanilla who were absolute trash at pvp and would get stopped by rank 10s daily" They just had a lot of time to play.
---
Rank in classic pvp has exactly zero to do with skill... zero.
---
Why is anyone surprised. This is what you signed up for.
---
Could you do this as a priest? Just MCing the casters first instead of sheeping? Think I'll give it a try!
---
Ah. There’s the insults and the over exaggerating. 
---
Yes. I’m sure it’s always a corpse run. Always.
---
Im a Night elf Rogue on Kirtonos , we are about that 30% alliance s 70% horde. I can confirm to you that there is NO advantages, You cannot do anything out in the world without being murdered multiple times by multiple people all at once ... You are basically on the receiving end of a non pleasant gang bang.
---
Sure there is plenty of horde running around to pick BUT the problem is that there is plenty of horde running around , its very rare that there is only 1 in sight and they are usually grouped up.
---
Since you are looking to roll a new character, you will have a horrible time leveling up , it was bad when honor wasn't involved, i cant imagine what its like now.
---
Oh yeah?  Well I spent over 3 hours in Maraudon yesterday.
---
Yes its the same reguardless of level. Id recommend saving them for if you finish a dungeon or find yourself in a main city close to a level when you get new skills. Then do whatever wasnt used up by this at 59 to get a boost to 60.
---
I play horde and I want Realm only bgs!  It created rivalry's , you got to rank up with both horde and alliance on your server. fuck im so annoyed its going to be Xrealm now i'll just be another face with a name in a sea of thousands
---
I'm not objecting, I'm expressing genuine confusion at the paradox and providing context for why corporations are inherently greedy.
---
What else are you doing with spare debuff slots?  deep wounds?
---
&gt; horde has some great pvpers
---
Then why do they require a minimum of 10 of them per 1 alliance to get an HK?
---
Grape-skin for the win!
---
If it works like it used to then when the BG is over everyone ports to where they were queued from.  So people will have to fly out after every BG.
---
&gt;oly shit are people ever tired of reading the same complaint, over and over and over and over again, especially when it's a complaint about something the player had to opt-in to experience.
---
I'm not tired of reading it, speak for yourself. 
---
Making noise is how shit gets changed. You being tired matters a hell of a lot less than decent faction balance.
---
oh the classic ITS CALLED WORLD OF WARCRAFT defense while you probably play on a horde dominated realm and would never dream to go to a balanced or alliance dominated realm. Wouldn't you want more people to kill? Guess not, only if you out number them. war is usually a battle.
---
Definitely want to aim towards edge masters, it’s a long term goal for me atm though I only have like 120 g
---
Sure but if you have a quarter of the population, you can't cover as much ground which is the point I'm making
---
I don't know what you're even arguing at this point. We seem to both agree that melee should have priority but there is nothing wrong with a hunter taking them if no melee needs, same with brutality and core hound. You want to say they are BiS, but they aren't regardless of accessability. You seem to just want to argue for no reason and since we agree on most things I think we are done.
---
I know that? That has nothing to do with this comment chain.
---
Fuck that entire area with a rake, god damn
---
So many users here are so biased when it comes to faction, it is not a faction that is at fault here... It is the balancing between them
---
They mind control them and force them to attack someone, removiong the honorless debuff - MC alone will not do it
---
It was entirely predictable. From Vanilla to current retail there has been a *massive* shift toward Horde, particularly amongst hardcore players, and encouraged and pushed by Blizz themselves. Surprise surprise all the PVP kids now roll Horde. Who could have seen it coming??
---
whell yea so i heared curent server cap is 30k but who knows our server was quite balanced at first even tho now it doesent feel balanced at all
---
Honestly you need to drop NS and pick up EM. With how batching works, you can combo EM with a chain lightning and earth shock for a 3k damage burst on a 3min CD which is arguably better than the previous 3min mage. You’ll end up using it more than NS
---
Alliance literally the same in servers where they are the dominant faction. Just look at Heartseeker.
---
Yeah, finally got rid of that dagger with the dm:w one on my warlock.  Every time I leveled into a new dungeon range I checked atlasloot because surely there would be an upgrade somewhere...nope.  But that's one of the things I like about vanilla: it's not so strictly segregated into the pre- and post- level cap modes.  Things you do at level 30 can and do have an impact until 60.
---
Do you think they could "fix" it by making it so more people got rank 13/honor decayed less rapidly, but there was still only one top tier rank 14 person per week for whoever played the most? What would you change?
---
I am Alliance on Bigglesworth. I am glad you guys have such a strong community on the opposite side though.
---
Because you're lucky right now that your BiS is marked for hunters only. Melee doesn't have that luxury. I played a hunter before. I get it, you want BiS in every slot like everyone else, but you habe to remember *so does everyone else*, and there are real people behind each of those toons. Be kind.

Right, I skipped to the TL;DR part, that's why I quoted it in my answer.
---
Admittedly, equitable is not the word I should have used there. That’s my bad. I was more meaning to ask if that would mean loot would end up being distributed more evenly as there’s a sort of built in catch up mechanic for those who get an item last. I asked because I am not familiar with this system.
---
Between 3-8am

Just need to get horde from Skeram to transfer and help both servers. Win win!  But most players are selfish like you and won't do anything like that.

Yes you can :)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB-V71wpGpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB-V71wpGpA)
---
So server transfers might come back up at some point in the future?
---
We already knew that, right?
---
Hopefully the all-powerful Karma boomerang whizzes back and chops his head off
---
Sometimes that Alliance member is literally the only Alliance you will see for an hour.
---
Blizzards response has been a joke ever since Activision took over and they fired half the GM staff; this is what we're left with.
---
Fair enough, preraid bis 8-)
---
The lobster crates also have a chance to drop the best alliance/2nd best horde fishing pole. Depending on the demand and competition you might be able to sell them for a nice sum on the horde/neutral auction houses.
---
Unrelated to OP but is it worth going 31 into Elemental or do you prefer the 30/0/21 healer-hybrid?
---
Fuck off idiot. It wasn't like that in vanilla. People had completely different mindset back then as folks weren't some tryhard wannabes.
---
It's a bunch of teenagers from private servers that are ruining wow classic atm. They think they matter cause they can "own" people in 10v1 combat in a computer game while they still live with their parents. :D
---
Mouseover macros is a pretty huge one.
---
I mean you’re the one who started this by calling me willfully ignorant and obtuse even though your claims have no basis. But whatever
---
Is that the mage exploit? Behind the large jars? Yeah, banned a ton of people for that.
---
Relax dude, BGs Dec 10th.
---
Zul'Aman. Black Temple was 2.1, voice chat was 2.2 and Sunwell was 2.4
---
No one is forcing you by gunpoint to play in a PVP server. Just play on a PVE server where this literally is a non-issue!
---
And what do you suggest they do? Lmao get real they’re already releasing battlegrounds early for you crybabies.
---
Use this analogy: you have a boat with 3 people on it. Have 1 stand on the left and 2 on the right, and the boat is fine. Now increase it to 30 people with the same ratio, anf its gonna capsize
---
Blizzard made recent fix when they allowed Alliance escape Horde dominated server and made free transfers for Horde only, while generously allowing Allance who managed to run away to come back.
---
Next mount subscriptions after phase 2 start gonna show what real casualties of realm pop are.
---
Not gonna lie the only thing I liked about BfA is optional Warmode.
---
If you thought you were being meta and rolled orc then I don’t feel sorry for you. As a Tauren, I laugh at warriors since I can combo a fire nova totem into a warstomp then CL + ES with elemental mastery and it’s basically lights out.
---
You simply don't get it or are trolling.
---
Making the game fun is a developer's duty. And they failed at that by overpopulating the servers and allowing  wildly unbalanced factions.
---
Heartseekers reputation is that it has an extremely bad ratio and is a new server that is mostly refugees from other servers. That is it's reputation. It will surely scare away anyone from rolling there if they inquire first. That is a fact.
---
Also its not about new players. These servers are going to act as a live museum for classic wow. They are going to keep the classic servers on in some form for the duration of World of Warcraft.  Just look at the pserver scene and servers like Northdale. People will stay on Classic for years and years and they WILL roll alts. We have 15 years of data to see this.
---
People will roll alts, new player or not. I never said anything about new players, as a matter of fact if you scroll up I said in a previous comment that this wasn't vanilla and the people who are going to play have joined. Which is why I made the argument hat heartseeker is doomed to fail because its an artificial server and didn't even have the boom of release day. It's growth is inorganic and not sustainable as the problems other servers face are going to magnified there and it will be among the first of the servers to call for transfers.
---
I would just about bet money that I'm right on this.
---
Am I missing something?  If the PvE server becomes bland and dead, and the PvP server becomes playable again - just play on the PvP server gain.  Then if something happens and the PvP server sucks again, you can go back to PvE.
---
There's a lot of skill involved in the fights.
---
[This is what I'm referencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dzgsaa/i_love_to_rank_on_a_pve_server/)
---
Your fault for transferring.
---
Groups have decreased because people aren't going to willingly sit there for two hours trying to get through the AOE Fest that is/will be the DM corridors and BRM entrances.  You could probably choke point Scholomance and Strath as well if you coordinated, but those don't have the player interest density high enough.
---
So people are going to fuck off to the far reaches of Silithus, or Winterspring, or Blasted Lands and farm; or not log on at all.  Maybe they'll play Outer Worlds, or install Skyrim for the 360th time.
---
We should all be hitting Blizzard up to correct this, and "nochanges" can go fuck itself.  Allow PvP&gt;PvE transfers, even if they are paid transfers.
---
Because everyone things BG's are going to fix this.  If BG's come with a queue, what will happen is people will queue up for AV/WSG, then go right back to griefing people while they wait for their slot to open up, and the only difference you'll see is 6 or 8 players out of 30-40 camping a chokepoint disappear while ass-raping the other side.
---
hahah 200IQ moves
---
What are you even talking about?
---
Why are you talking from another persons point of view?
---
Why are you assuming only older people have little time to play video games? 
---
You literally gave the most generic response of “well I have a full time job and a family and a wife and kids and bills to pay. I don’t have time to play a video games 8 hours day”
---
If you think that’s shaming the older community then you are projecting. Old people arnt the only ones who are too busy to play video games.
---
No, it's a messed up pervert from the south that has sex with their dog.
---
They're course and rough and irritating, and they get everywhere.
---
Raid frames! Forgot about that one. The whole raid ui is way different than anything I had ever seen before. They took it from an expansion I hadn't played before, thought I was going crazy the first time we started raiding.
---
I logged in last night, watched out of the Inn in wetlands to see 10 horde coming down the docks over piles of skeletons, I use my pocket watch to sprint to the flight master to fly away to chill wind camp and when I land theres 10 more horde already raiding the camp and get insta killed. It's nearly impossible to try doing quests or even grind mobs cuz anywhere for 35-60 range is just constantly having pvp farming groups running through and they dont care if you are too low a level to get jonir from, they kill you all the same. This is the kind of thing that can really kill a game.
---
Spoken like a true idiot. Takes 3 ally to stop backdoor because slows make the jump impossible. Meanwhile ally have a far easier time attacking.
---
Now that I think about it, I may have misunderstood what you were trying to say.
---
But no, I don't defend companies, like, at all. On the contrary, I'm a commie irl so that would be kinda weird. I just can't stand the constant circlejerk in this sub. Blizzard is doing pretty well as a whole, yet somehow people think that they're in a crisis (or whatever) or that they are obligated to act according to the interests of some random people on reddit. They don't care as long as they make enough money off you.
---
That's what I meant to imply, basically. You, me and our opinions aren't relevant at all because Blizzard doesn't give a fuck. It's a billion dollar company with only one obligation, to create value for their shareholders.
---
I'd recommend setting the game aside until battlegrounds come out (couple weeks from now).
---
Looking forward to all the posts complaining about alliance getting an unfair advantage in AV.
---
As a Warlock I'm perfectly content with Cyclopean Band and Eye of Orgrimmar. The other rings just aren't worth the money. The next one I pick up will be in a raid.
---
For horde on Herod there's just nowhere else to farm honor. Just getting the PvP tier set requires a decent amount of honor grind if you want to get it within a reasonable amount of time. 
---
Winterspring, Felwood, Dire Maul, Hillsbrad, both Plaguelands, and most populated areas already have one or two other horde groups that are roaming around. Even when the allies form their own parties, they quickly become overwhelmed and camped until they portal/hearth out. 
---
Boat/flight path camping is simply one of the better options for us. Most allies we're camping are just looking to get to their dungeon group, so even after camping for a while the allied numbers never get unmanageable.
---
Also keep in mind it's not always the same group camping a flight path. We'll do it at an empty area for two-three hours every couple of days, and when we're not doing it, another horde group is.
---
I think if you are well geared and play perfectly it can  work. In the dueling tourney Payo managed to do it, but this was with specific rules and no trinkets/some consumables.
---
How about paying for invis potions, ressing in a corner after dying, using pot instantly and then running straight to a dead corner in the map ? Hopefully you can get out of invis alone to mount up and do your things. Just gotta avoid coming into range of any big hub where alliance is probably gonna be camping.
---
Yeah! All pvp servers should 100-0! Transfer off if youre the smaller faction! 
---
Why are all horde in favor of pve gameplay? Yet roll pvp?
---
I can't remember, but I was under the impression that faerlina was horde advantage.  Especially felt that wayward  considering I could never get into SM.
---
I’ve had a few seconds chat delay ever since I started.
---
Vanish was bugged.  They apparently fixed it a couple weeks ago.
---
Maybe they are successful business owners?  You seem to take it for granted that people who can play a game are losers.  I don't think anyone here is going to appreciate that viewpoint.
---
I shit you not we had a mage win the mage blade in MC and he replaced this dagger with it
---
Oh boy how you are wrong on this take lol
---
I think the problem is not with the honor system, but how it dropped. IMO it would have been much better to roll out honor system from day 1. We wouldn't be seeing the huge numbers of people farming it right now because it would have been a slow burn as opposed to a huge PVP surge after the update. I know classic wow didn't launch with honor, but it rolled out way later, when most people already had 60s. I don't have a 60 yet (ALMOST THO). 
---
Just a thought.
---
Because I was stubborn for the classic experience. Then realized I was being dumb.
---
Lmao nice strawman I can feel the ree’ing from over here
---
Obviously for them it is. Pjsalt
---
So i should have to queue because there is less alliance on my server? Go fuck yourself. I pay for this game, it is completely unacceptable i (or anybody) have to queue at all
---
I never took it, and I'm not sure if it's up.  I'd rather not be ported to a low pop server, and when I played phase 2 wasn't out so the only issue was queues which I was perfectly fine with.
---
has nothing to do with naysayers, blizzard literally has servers to solely to deal with this issue. just say you rolled on the wrong server and demand a xfer and we will be standing right there with you. the very point of wpvp is rooted in unfairness and if it was structured to be fair it'll would be called a battleground. anyone complaining about it is just ignorant and wanted the boot on the other foot.
---
You have no proof to back that up. You’re creating a fake nerative with no facts just to back up your point. 
---
Stop blaming blizzard because you made the mistake. 
---
Stop yelling at blizzard to fix a problem you created.

If I am up 2 levels @ level 25, what should I do? I plan on doing Stockades too.
---
He's replying to a comment with a video about Skeram, which has an insane horde ratio. My server Stalagg is pretty much unplayable as they similarly outnumber alliance 3:1. It's unplayable, I haven't even bothered logging in for the last week.
---
Good effort, sound like you're through.
---
Not always. As I mentioned in a different comment, weed is illegal but I think that's dumb so I smoke anyways. My friends don't call me out on it because they agree the "offense" is nonsense. This is the same shit IMO. You get killed by a safespotter and you either run away from that spot (omg so hard to do) or you fight back. It's a stupid rule because anyone can get to these safe spots, and it's not like they're affecting you on some huge level. It's like a 2 minutes inconvenience. I've been steamrolled just hanging in contested areas now that pvp is out way more than I have been killed by safespotters in gadgetzan or wherever, but yet one of those is a bannable offense. I say pish-posh, dumb rule, don't report unless you're a whiny pussy. Actual mature grown ups make up their own mind, they don't follow others blindly.
---
how does this work sorry?
---
the detect magic thing?
---
We had a rogue who didn’t need them, was just a 9 man Jed rend run where no one actually really needed them, got pretty lucky
---
Same...they should leave the balanced servers alone.  
---
Like if a server is at least 40/60 faction balanced, leave it be.  Only merge the highly imbalanced realms.
---
I play Horde on Benediction and I'm an adult
---
Payo did it in dueling tourney and it won him the duel AFAIK.
---
He thought he did, but he didnt
---
We have no way of doing this neither. Obviously a well informed source here
---
What?!? That is crazy! There are several people selling the AotDW/Flurry axe combo for ~6-650 gold on Kurinaxx. If you’re patient like I was you can buy both for 250 typically. Edgemasters are 700ish right now.
---
This is good content. Hilarious, then learned something. Knowledge truly is power.
---
That explains it... I could never figure out why my threat plates were great in open world but not available for dungeons and raids
---
Irl community is toxic
---
I disagree...
---
IMHO, faction queues would mean that people wouldn't be able to raid on schedule because half the raid is unable to log in, since not enough people of the other faction is logged in...
---
ie.: I don't see it as a solution, but as an even bigger problem.
---
You have an add-on causing that behaviour.
---
Standing of 33 got to rank 3.5 .... meanwhile on my PvP server, which is one of the smallest ones in the game, standing 47 hit rank 4.
---
It's all relative, and you have no idea how much time it took him to get even that small amount of honor.
---
Why bother with a pvp server? Transfer to and start up new toons on a PVE server. Then if you want to PVP you just flag yourself, or go into a battleground.
---
Weaponized idiocy
---
Too many people don't understand what they were getting into and don't want to admit the problem isn't from the players.  People want to blame the amount of players on the server because they can blame that on blizzard.  It's harder to blame faction imbalance.  They want faction queues!  Won't really solve the problem because then you just get horde pissy they can't play even if they don't want to pvp.  Imagine sitting in queue for 4 hours AND no alliance are going out pvping.
---
No one wants to blame the honor system, which encourages this type of shit.  People gold sold on some ideal world where vanilla was this bastion of world action, but they don't understand that doesn't exist anymore.  Classic is full of people ready to min/max everything they can.  They want honor and they get honor by killing anyone and everything they can.  Time and battlegrounds will help, but this honor system should have never been brought back into the game.
---
I tried to warn people but all I got was #nochanges or people telling me "It wasn't like that on private servers".
---
My claims absolutely had basis but you were conveniently ignoring my points because of your hubter entitlement syndrome. Try playing pretty much any other class and having to argue with hunters constantly because they think they get first dibs on everything. It's incredibly tiring, even for a former hunter such as myself.
---
I'm really glad that you found something that works for you and gives you a chance to get away from everything for a while. You are right, the world can be an insane mess, but that's what makes it so amazing and lets us appreciate the good. I believe that everything happens the way it's supposed to and I'm just grateful to be here!
---
In theory, yes but in practice shitty debuffs will be knocking each other off all the time making it a waste of mana and gcd

ugh i hate spy.  literally all players do is talk about derrrrr my addon my addon my addon my addon derrrrrr i literally cannot play this game derrrrrrrr my addon my addon my addon

PvP servers gunna have PvP. 
---
Easy solution:
---
Play on a non-PvP server.
---
The other day I had to replace a dps for ZF because his wife was being rushed to the ER. He logged in an hour later and wanted to form another group, he said he was playing on his laptop at the freaking hospital. I said "dafuq," and his reply was "oh the wife is fine, she's cool with me playing while I'm here." 
---
WTF.
---
Says the guy who ignores everyone of my points. Dalrends is much easier to get than a brutality blade. And the majority of hunters will not be able to get brutality blade. Thus dalrends with agi enchants will be BiS. Your only counter argument is everyone will have brutality blades in p3 Which shows your ignorance and naivety. Since as we agreed these would go to rogues and warriors before any hunter sees one. So please provide a point that makes sense then I’ll consider it
---
Shadow damage doesn't work for wands only spells do your wands have similar dps but different attack speeds? Would explain the extra damage.
---
So at this time right now, 2 flurry axe on AH for 950 and 975 buyout price.  1 axe of deep woods for 350g buyout and 1 edgemasters for 850 buyout.  Flurry axe dissapeared from the AH for like 12 days a month or so back and when it showed back up it was pretty much always over 1k
---
I just couldn't keep up man. I really tried. they might have had Really high DPS too. Because it was so tough keeping aggro lol
---
Becaus rogues get the swords in tier 1 content.
---
That’s where bliz has to be smart about faction specific transfers. Horde can xfer to servers where alliance is the majority and vice versa. The original arguement applies to this anyways. If they reroll, they can go literally anywhere and upset the balance, at least xfers blizz can guide to unbalanced servers.
---
The only “downside” is that people who get a stupid pleasure from watching others suffer don’t get to continue to watch the person their raid group has camped finally just log off instead of spending 20 minutes rezzing to get to their next quest.
---
People are not going to keep playing if they’re not having fun, so isn’t people getting a transfer and staying subscribed better for the game itself in terms of financial support and longevity? Besides, it’s not like this is the last we’ll see of it either. Once the aq events begin and everyone’s packed into silithus, the faction imbalance will be even more clear and this will happen again. Blizzard needs to allow transfers to pve servers for those who have no interest in getting run over by raid groups now that they’ve realized world pvp is different now. Servers with triple the size of original vanilla made sure of that.
---
Yea how could people predict pvp would happen on pvp servers. Crazy.
---
I see your on Benediction and was I planning on rolling some Horde toons there eventually. I'm wondering if you think the faction ratio is as good as all the population sites?
---
The irony is I play on a predominately horde server, so I am the one who has to corpse drag my way into a dungeon
---
If it was true you wouldn't know
---
Idiots on this subreddit will literally argue about anything. This page is honestly way more toxic than actual in game interactions. lol
---
Because going into a discussion without being able to put yourself in their shoes and see where they are coming from is just a bad way to discuss something. 
---
Again, I can't be projecting because I don't work a ton, and don't have a wife or kids. Like I said I have lots of time to play and that example does not fit my situation. I know quite a few people that have limited time to play for those "generic" reasons. I gave the "older" community example, depending on where you are drawing the line at older, it could fit the narrative of a 30+ year old fitting exactly I described.
---
Of course you see more griefers playing Horde, since it's the dominant faction on most servers, however Alliance players literally act the same when they are the dominant faction. I mean, just read this post.
---
Sounds like you are capping a server and (essentially) forcing members of the majority faction off of it.
---
&gt; A faction specific queue sounds fine, until it's Tuesday night and you cant get on to raid because you're stuck in a queue.
---
That's literally the point. You force people to consider transferring by inconveniencing them.
---
Nah, not your fault.  If you were marking things and they were ignoring kill order, that's on them.  Warriors already aren't very good at holding threat on multiple mobs, and dealing w/ two shadow priests in that situation would just be even worse.  Taunt also has a CD so what do they expect.
---
Seems fine to me maybe it's just not the game for you.
---
Remember guys, you don’t HAVE to play in a pvp realm. Stop ruining pvp for people who are there for pvp.
---
Horde, better PvPers?  Says the guy who has the numerical advantage by more than double.
---
There is more then 1 way to make connections and I said mostly.
---
Yes, that's the best part about it
---
He's not wrong about the vast majority of PvP servers being Horde dominated, the video I linked is from one of those servers.
---
Exactly this: my server is 60-40, and I'm on the lower side. Fortunately though, it is a relatively low pop server, so there might be 3-4 people camping a FP, but you won't often run into PvP groups that you can't overcome with an instance lineup.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Yea my issue is I love pvp and I really love that every other  post on Reddit is people complaint about pvp which was their choice to begin with.   It just makes me want to do it more and more and more.
---
TROLL GANG
---
Yep. Arenas were the answer to this. They showed that skill mattered. 
---
Time invested did not matter in arena.
---
I'd examine why you seem to care so much about this. If pvp in a game is what's giving validation to your life, then you really should seek professional help. I mean, it's just a game.
---
Yikes dude. Learn to make your own argument. 
---
You get lost when you try to talk for others.
---
That may be true, but I tend to not compare the average player to people at the top of their game in duel tournaments.
---
The only advice would be to avoid them, they have no AOE and do an insane amount of threat.
---

---
10 seconds to get agro? Bruh.
---
As a feral tank I am not sold on HOJ. 
---
The 20 AP passive is obviously nice and in some respects is better than many other trinkets.  But I'm mostly referring to the extra hit. 
---
2% chance to proc on 2.0 attack speed- 1 in 50 attacks procs so once every 100 seconds you get an extra hit.  That hit can't be a maul, but can crit so it generates perhaps 8-15 rage and a modest amount of threat.  But being only 100 sec (disregarding the use of MCP, then it's once every 50 sec) it will proc perhaps once on a boss fight, twice if you're lucky, or if you're somewhat unlucky not at all. 
---
Mark of Tyranny / Smoking Heart each provide more than 2% of raw physical mitigation.  Mark via the dodge + armor reduction, and Heart from the armor + resists.  IMO those are both clearly superior unless you are desperate for more threat and comfortable being more squishy (perhaps if you overgear the content?) then you can more rationalize a HOJ. 
---
Kitty druids I think are worse off with HOJ too.  Again the passive 20 AP is nice, but the proc chance is once every 50 seconds base, or once every 25 sec with MCP.  However, the increased proc chance is offset by the fact that you do much less damage in cat form in each individual attack and the fact that an extra hit / crit doesn't help your damage in other ways.  The main generator of kitty DPS is the combo of powershifting, claws, and ferocious bites none of which are affected at all by HOJ other than the passive 20AP. 
---
There are other trinkets too, such as on-use attack power or passive crit, that would provide more value than the 20 AP passive in HOJ and you aren't crossing your fingers that you get a hoj proc at a good time.
---
It's nonsense fabricated by some casual, bt is the best for pve and pvp.
---
The key to running reserve runs is to leave enough incentive for people to still want to join.  Rolling on legendaries is a pretty big one for some people, also the opportunity to just get gear without raiding on a schedule might appeal to some people, or people with alts they want to raid infrequently with.  Even the opportunity to join a ms&gt;os roll group that isn't +1 would be appealing to people who enjoy the gamble on getting a lot of pieces of loot in a run.
---
Get away with?  Odd wording.  He's being upfront.  I can't guess if the run was successful in gathering enough people, but he doesn't seem to be misleading anyone.
---
I dont know how this threat hasn't mentioned TUF. Reputation weapon from AV. A bit of a grind, but good enough to make you relevant, even if you can't win 1v1s. 1v1s aren't really that important in bgs.
---
Yea i really liked vanilla pvp but in classic its just not fun, ive done less honor week 2 than the first one and ill probably do even less this week. The only time you can get decent fight are in the morning and if you try to farm or go to instance during the night you get demolished lol
---
With that said i cant wait to do bg at least we should get a quick queue
---
Just do your drinking then smoke a lot of pot, it's like a aggro reset.

shazzrah and skeram
---
Not saying that faction Queues shouldn't be a thing, but spy was a complete garbage add on that should have never been allowed.  I'm glad they nerfed it,  People should actually have to look around to see other people and know who is in proximity of them.
---
From what ive seen its pretty balanced. It definitely doesnt feel like one faction has control over the other. Both factions are pvp active and both have good raiding guilds.
---
&gt; Most servers were pegged at a unhealthy 60/40 in favor of certain faction before Blizzard tried breaking the census addon months ago, and it's undoubtedly gotten worse since then.
---
Census addon is no longer considered to have been accurate at all. The new version that has basically the same functionality (new perfrms a /who scan on any mouse click instead of automatically) is considered trash since it reads most servers as more balanced now that layering is removed.

Horde is often the dominant faction on PvP servers, whereas Alliance are often the dominant faction on PvE.  So, given that the issue is about WPvP griefing, it is expected that there will be more complaints about Horde than alliance.

Nah, low-effort trolling.

Just make it more like arena rating, so having a positive w/L ratio or KDA can maintain its exclusivity without the insane time commitment requirement.  It would obviously need to be tuned a lot, but the basic concept is there with an elo system and works quite well imo

Its also pretty nice alliance side.

this has been tested on popular private server and faction queues indeed help with population imbalance

&gt; If you’re getting raid patterns you should atleast be on daily an hour or 2
---
So I should just be logging in for 2 hours a day to stand around and do nothing in case someone needs something crafted.
---
.....or, I can just say "if you need something crafted, ping me on discord"
---
Stop trying to tell other people how to play the game, thx.
---
I‘d keep that for myself probably lol. Thank you, I didn’t know!
---
The real world application is the realization of the same data that goes into theory crafting, you know that right?
---
There is no respec cost decay

#FAKE NEWS
---
That fishing pole is a honker though.  Epic bonks.  I haven't had to level fishing beyond 225 yet as a level 60 because of that pole + bright baubles.
---
I died 12 times only had a 10 min Rez timer on my way to ubrs and no one left group even though it took close to an hr to get into instance. I also lost my roll by 1 on the briar reed trinket. Not bad overall. 
---
Only 12 deaths to zone in is pretty low for my server after all.
---
I like this daily thread idea of yours. I would read it.
---
They... didn't?
---
was an expression 5 seconds would be enough. Was just really hard to keep aggro any tips ? lol
---
while at that: dear paladin tanks,
---
your judgement of wisdom proccs generate threat for you, which is not tracked by threat meter addons.
---
in fact, it's a shitload of thread when put with rets/hunters
---
Its a visual bug. It will show you getting bonus damage from equipment but if you actually look at your damage your not getting a bonus from it.
---
Ignore the memebook, still gotta go grab my offhand.
---
You can put a \ before it to cancel that (same for other formatting characters)
---
I play on a balanced pvp server, so whoever doesn't control Blackrock Mountain when their group shows up is the one who has to corpse drag.
---
You’re getting offended for things that don’t apply to you. This isn’t a discussion.
---
Flight masters need to be buffed. Camping the FP just ruins the game for many players.
---
1. Flight master can see through stealth
---
2. Flight master aggros if you attack any player within X yds of them
---
3. Flight master has a net ala gadgetzan guards
---
4. Buff then to spawn 3 or 4
---
IMO if you camp an FP you should be basically insta-gibbed by the FM. I get it, you want to farm your honor, but half of these campers kill you before the "No honor" buff wears off. And it's just not fun trying to level and being insta-killed the second you land, wherever you land.
---
chat channels work like that in many mmos.
---
Every time this gets posted I'm amazed at how many people haven't seen this pasta. Yes it's satirical.
---
dude so true, even with 3 stacks on sunder and revenge they still steal aggro lol
---
LOL. Should be fun for the first 3 seconds.
---
Lmao @ u
---
tldr?
---
If you’re editing a comment, majorly, 4-5 times each, you’re not forming coherent thoughts. Stop. Pause. Reflect a moment. 
---
Honestly, sounds like you sucked at pvp, then you sucked at arguing about it, so you pivoted again to strawmen immigration arguments? Tell me, what are my thoughts on immigration reform? You say I want kids to die? Lmao. I’m sure you like partially/birthing kids then cutting their fucking heads off you immoral savage (ooo look we both strawmanning now!!)
---
Warlock PSA: You can life tap to restore your mana
---
&gt; The only advice I can offer is is to either roll on another server with a known-good pop balance,
---
plz no.  Don't screw up the fun servers by mass transferring to them.
---
it’s like signing up for the military and crying about going to war. you guys are such wimps.
---
Come to kurinaxx PvP server ive got a guild u can join!
---
yes it's 1 tauren 2 orcs.
---
SL lock is tough for mage too
---
There's also the matter of war effort. There are a lot of mats to be collected on both sides.
---
Is the implication here that we've been programmed to be disgusted by trannies despite the fact cable news/Hollywood/social media (like this thread on Reddit) incessantly works to normalize this stuff? You're the "people" being programmed, not us.
---
I don't think you can purge elixira
---
Faction-independent queues.
---
You should've told them to read the tooltip for mindblast.
---
Use a free action potion... If not just die.
---
I'm on heartseeker Alliance. Every horde gets called out with coords in general chat since they are more rare than a black lotus spawn. World pvp is not fun at all, Blizzard needs to intervene and do something to fix this. I strongly believe that Blizzard wants classic to fail so that people will go back to retail.
---
What’s a lasher run? I’ve heard it a couple of times and can’t look it up at the moment.
---
Every Horde that stayed on Stalagg is equal to blame for Heartseeker’s imbalance as Alliance that transferred off.
---
I mean, if the imbalance is that bad, and even 10 people are missing the raid because of the queue, you just snag 10 other people who are already there and seemingly have schedules that allow them to be online. The whole situation is a shitshow though. I was on Biggles and xferred to uhhh... arcanite? I think? IDK. the server was so dead I just quit entirely. I might come back and re-roll PvE somewhere instead.
---
Yeah I'm about to hop over to a PvE realm. Only reason I joined a PvP was to play with my friends but they're all already 60 and raiding and I'm 28. They don't want to make a new character and don't want to run me through anything and I'm stick getting killed over and over by wave after wave of horde in my 1-2 hours I have to play everyday. And this is on Stalaag which is a little bit more balanced, but still very horde heavy (I'm Ally). It's just not fun
---
People will come back for a day for hype, realize they dont have a guild that can do the newly released raids and then quit again
---
He's a big man who likes a big challenge. Only level 11's on their way to Darkshore can give him that feeling he's been searching for.
---
Throw it on a white.  Last thing you want is for an add-on to auto vendor it on you
---
Fair enough but still will screw up the server balances more so as the minor factions will leave for greener pastures/more balanced realms. Shouldn’t happen.
---
The HOJ is essentially like 2% crit though, which doesn't count towards the crit cap, which is why it's nice imo.  It doesnt scale insanely any better than crit  unless you're hitting the crit cap.
---
I agree but only once you get enough spell crit. I'm well geared (4.2k health 170sp) with about 24% Nature Spell crit and even still I feel, especially with how spell batching works, that EM is just a game changer compared to NS. It also helps I'm using Hand of Ed which is a free NS. Once more crit is available I will think about switching to NS.
---
Horde say this.... But they will beg for us back when they are in 1hr ques.... Every PVP server but 1 is horde dominated... Horde are fucked... They deserve it...
---
Don't know what server OP is on but as Alliance on Blaumeux I can tell you it's a corpse run pretty much every time I go anywhere that isn't a major Alliance city. What faction/server do you play then?
---
Absolute redditor
---
Someone plays differently than meee, reeeeeeeeeeee
---
The rocket helm debuff is magic. If the lock is running felhunter, he will just dispel it immediately and be back to killing you 1 sec later. It should work against the other pets tho.
---
Welcome to life as a minority on any server. Atleast horde out populate the Alliance on 80% of all Classic Servers
---
You're a rogue, when your spy lights up, go stealth until they pass.
---
Nope, his theory is correct. The difference is that on rag, the person who was kicked can't join a different group. The new group that Neil joined are the ones who got it.
---
Lesson: Don't be a dumbfuck who kicks people during worldboss events or you get what you deserve 😂
---
I hope you realize in pvp someone has to start the fight. So if I try to engage you in a battle, dont take it so personally. If you win, I salute you and hope you move on. Dont feel the need to gank that person.
---
Why would you punish people who rolled horde side for playing horde? Its not their fault for rolling on the horde side. The faction based queue idea people on this sub keep trying to push is beyond stupid when you think about the fact that youre punishing people for something thats out of their control.
---
That;s tough...I never touched Darkshore/Ashenvale as alliance.  BFD is very out of the way.
---
As one of the Horde players who keeps killing you and your friends, yes I recognize this is a problem severely negatively affecting the game's playability and enjoyability.  
---
That said, the expedited implementation of Battlegrounds is likely going to see a significant drop in wpvp HK farming, which should lessen the extent of this problem significantly. At least we hope this will be the case, but we'll know soon enough.  
---
In the meantime, all is fair in love and Warcraft!
---
I am curious, what makes the Dal Rends set 1 or 2 AP better than the Barbarous Blade in DM North? I always thought the blade was better as it had more AP and the same crit, but it sounds like I am mistaken.
---
It’s a debuff that turns damage they do to the target into group healing
---
Most guilds don’t drop everything to help 1 person being ganked. Everyone has their own stuff to do.
---
It would involve editing the map terrain so probably not?
---
Personally I guess I'm just getting old now, but I think world PVP is just stupid. It doesn't require really any skill since its just a numbers game, creates hostility against everyone for little gain. And creates an immense amount of pressure for people trying to just accomplish their goals (epic mount, etc.). 
---
If you could at least pay Blizzard to transfer it'd be easier, but you can't even do that.
---
Thank you for your comment, toxic individual. Clearly, you are a lvl 60 horde player that camps redridge mountains. What I was saying is that pvp isn't fun due to the fact that the scales are so incredibly unbalanced. What fun is there in getting one shot by a lvl 60 shaman once you step onto a boat? What fun is there when you can't even leave a neutral town without being anally raped? Pvp beeds battlegrounds in order to remove the worst types of pvpers from the open world. You're lvl 43 and run into a lvl 41-45 horde? Cool, have at it. Lvl 20 vs 53? Fuck you. Hell, even on retail, I was sitting in org on a shaman I was leveling. I wanted to test my pvp talents, so I enabled pvp. Literally, within less than 5 seconds, my 110 shaman was dead. Some douchebag human rogue, 120 of course, was skulking through the city ganking people. Like wtf? How pathetic do you have to be to slaughter people just chilling in their home city?
---
I know you are going to berate me some more, but I'm not new to the game. I'm new to classic, and it's a fantastic experience for sure, but I've been playing since middle school, during wotlk.
---
I’m gonna say 99% of players have just the one account.
---
im getting extremely dark yellow piss vibes from u man, please drink at least 2 cups of water immediately if not for yourself, for me
---
day 3 of this shit. how can this not be fixed yet?  clearly restarting chat servers isn't solving this blizzard.
---
Yep that was it, ok because i thought they were just doing op damage or some shit thx for the info
---
it's the lashers in DM East. You go in, jump down and pull the groups of lashers (non-elite) between the patrols. They drop a lot of grey items that vendor well, and also drop lots of herbs you can sell. They also drop lots of greens, with the chance of blues and epics. You can kill the groups of Satyrs too, but I only do that sometimes.
---
I want to say I feel like the hardcore pvpers are mostly matched out in the world, but of course when you guys get a big raid going you’re of course going to wipe us.
---
The issue is the dingdong alliance will just run, and the horde mostly can just go about their business. This has lead to raid loggers for alliance and those of us playing are just more hardcore I guess. Personally I can always tell when I fight a srsbiz horde since they chase me down (they’re a mage, usually no other alliance around) or just straight up shit on me (rogue).
---
Personally I enjoy all of it except when you just want to instance as a casual player, those I really pity but we took over BRD along with Grizzly for like 4-5 hours this weekend.
---
I can check for orcs by failing to stun, ez clap
---
How do you find out who the guild leader of a certain guild is?
---
I was noticing last night that there was a few seconds delay from submitting the message to it appearing in the chat window. Hadn't noticed that before. Never seen it take a full minute though.
---
It's a joke, calm down. 
---
&gt;telling people to go back to retail would only leave less people to play with or against.
---
Only if they actually expect people to switch back to retail because some ganker said "go to retail", which they obviously do not.
---
You disagree because you obviously don't play on a server with a terrible imbalance. I see a lot of people making similar comments to yours.
---
&lt;--Stallag player. I was confused when I saw a lot of people saying some iteration of what you just said, so I decided to look at wowhead's server balance statistics, and, to my surprise, most of the servers are actually balanced.
---
However, there are about 6-7 server currently where the imbalance is absolutely 3:1 or greater, for both horde and alliance. There's about 3-4 servers where Horde are absolute wrecking fucking house, numbers wise, and vise-versa with Alliance.
---
It's hard to a get a grasp on just how awful it is to play on one of these servers if you're on something like a 60:40 split.
---
The best way I can illustrate this for people who play on somewhat balanced servers is that I was in a UBRS group and we were just getting relentlessly ganked on this way in, as usual. You make it to max spirit res range and are instantly dead again, there's just so many horde.
---
So, some guy in my group says "man, if we just had twice as many Alliance, this wouldn't be an issue." I stopped and thought to myself for a minute...no...if we had twice the alliance we would just barely be approaching a 60:40 server's level of balance, and, even then, we would be at a significant numerical disadvantage.
---
It's hard to stress how much a even a 2:1 imbalance is in this game.  Imagine rolling into Alterac Valley and for no reason at all the opposite faction has twice the number of players as you do. You'd be absolutely fucked.
---
Some people straight up stop playing the game because they can't afford to farm for extra things like respeccing, people already have to farm for mats / consumes for raid which is like 80g a week and now they also have to have an added 100g for pvp respeccing.
---
Id rather not play the game than waste time farming just to pvp for a couple of days then being forced to swap back. Overall, people want to scream "economy" but you know whats best for a healthy economy? Active players.
---
Because it appeals more to my playstyle and personal character
---
also fantasy mmo game... alliance is : small human, medium fat human , human, pointy ear gay looking human
---
such fantasy
---
Haven't been playing classic but are horde queues really 1 he?  Are the factions that unbalanced?
---
&gt; Would re adding layering until December 10th be worth it?
---
How would anyone here be able to do that?
---
There are horde inside IF all the time.
---
Doesn’t matter if he gets hell in chat if he can successfully PUG the raid.
---
Laugh while you can horde...your just burying yourselves in a deeper grave... Laughs in 1 hr ques

---
I was horde when it was a suicide wish to be horde in vanilla. This was before everyone realized how OP WotF was. I don't like how "bright and cheery" the alliance towns are, or how self righteous the quest lines make them seem. I have always preferred anti-heroes.
---
So for pve orc is the best choice for sure, 25% melee dmg is incredible, the stun resistance is a nice addition. 
---
I personally prefer undead for WOTF but that is mostly for pvp. The stun resist on orcs is massively helpful in pvp too.
---
Four the horde.
---
Warstomp is beautiful but if you aren't morphing to reduce hitbox even then I still think stun resist is too good. I've resisted so many charges/intercepts and rogue stuns and grenades that it pays its weight in gold.
---
The dumbass shadow priest don't realize how much of a threat bomb a shadow priest is. They were likely throwing out MB and doing there best to out damage each other. 
---
 Sluff it off mate you tanks are the heart and blood of the community lol. I've had plenty of bad tanks as a healer but hey I roll with it. Last run for DMN I don't think the dps could do anything without pulling agro so I go to try and make sure everyone stays alive which in turn I pull agro lol I've rarely used my emergency self heal and had to pop it multiple times that run along with shielding myself lol.
---
Iirc it was a lawsuit of some sort from someone that made a song related to that before WoW
---
except both of those things are steeped in an actual ideal.
---
Finally a normal opinion in the sea of pathetic-ness. And of course it gets downvoted because how dare you not parrot the general reddit demographic.
---
Yes i Do, up to 10-15 minutes. tried /reload and its not working
---
Clearly not playing Alliance on a PvP server, definitely not enough time then.
---
As a Faerlina horde, all through my leveling I noticed a horde dominance but lately, allies have been making life hell for horde. My main had to corpse run through BRM on raid night and my alt has been pushed out of questing in areas of STV by high levels guarding all the low levels and ganking any horde they see. While there may be more horde on the server (I don't actually know), most of them don't seem interested in organizing together or helping out lowbies like the allies do. For most of the guilds I've been in, it's been like pulling teeth trying to get them to even help out with level 60 things like BRD runs/Ony attune.
---
Around 29 you can start tanking RFK.  Minimally farm the first boss to get Corpsemaker, which will serve you well until you get the Whirlwind Axe.  Full runs are good xp.
---
I'm with OP on this. Classic is going to die and it's all because people can't keep their griefing-wieners in their pants.
---
No way
---
It's the same shit over on Skeram. I like pvp but I don't like being honor farmed in every God damned zone, including cities and major cities. I never thought this is why I would quit classic.
---
They should just have faction specific ques. This would stop people from wanting to join the stronger faction and would also stop them from transferring to another server with a better ratio for them because they would know that it would most likely come with server ques. 
---
This honestly seems like the best way, and you could say it would be unfair for the faction with more people that they have to wait in ques, but the same could be said for server wide ques which punish people for picking a server. This is punishing people for picking a specific server and faction, doesn’t seem like much of a difference to me.
---
So is this a PVP server? No PVP allowed?
---
I think it’s more because people are crying non-stop because they rolled on the wrong server even though we warned them several times that PVP wouldn’t be kind to slow levelers and casuals once P2 came around.
---
&gt; killed almost 40 alliance while only dying once in less than 4 hours of time played the entire night.
---
You must be a Warlock.
---
I am sure horde are out numbered on my server. 
---
Why I played? I wanted to play an orc warrior in 2004. In 2019 I wanted to relive the game.
---
Like? Me and my brother do PVE more so than PVP. So we ended up moving to a Normal server with a friend. Later on we'll flag ourselves and find some PVP but it is definitely nice just being able to quest and grind out exp without getting camped by ppl way over our level.
---
I just don't see a self governed solution if it's 80/20 between factions. The smaller portion will struggle with getting into raids due to stuff like this but there's no downside for the majority because they control vital areas.
---
I'm looking forward to leveling again, it's like groundhog day in the open world with one thing happening, murder
---
Hey my guild just did this too! The horde got em first and we all stood in the back and cheered him on until it was our turn. Rattlegore hunters got respect!
---
I went both, so I could check out all the content I hadn't seen for over a decade.
---
Factions are pretty much irrelevant unless you roleplay or something.
---
&gt; Worthless
---
Uhhh. We also slow the group down drinking all the time and asking the mage for water giving you a chance to feed your dogs or check your email. You're fucking welcome.
---
Best answer.

&gt;Not spamming MC and shackle to make every fight completely trivial
---
Yeah, it's on them. If you weren't breaking CC repeatedly, it's their fault for struggling and not using their kits correctly.
---
I'm on an alliance heavy server. Every day I get ganked at least 3-10 times depending on where I'm questing (level 53 atm). Doesn't bother me, but I'm kinda a pvp server vet and knew what to expect going into it. 
---
I'm a warlock so sometimes I'm able to ss and get right back to it, but other times they hang around for a while attempting to camp me. When that happens I res at the spirit healer or find a decent area out of their LoS, res up, mount, and change spots. Other times I lay there dead and take a 5-10 minute break to waste their time expecting me to ss.
---
It's all fun tho. I love the atmosphere
---
You can just have a guildie invite you, invite your alt, then they drop party.  You keep your alt+main party and farm for a few hours and do not need additional assistance from that point forward.  It only takes ~10-15 seconds.

This is what I come here for lol wow what a rip.
---
As someone who frequented private servers and never thought classic could happen, this kind of joke is not funny in the slightest.  We finally got classic and now we've got people running around saying garbage like this.  Nah, hard pass on that.
---
Just let the minority faction transfer to another realm and let the majority faction deal with the shit they caused. Simple.
---
So when you win an item, you wait 2 hours to equip it? Once equipped is it not bound? I generally have it equipped instantly when I win loot I need.
---
Been trying to sell the schematic for flawless arcanite rifle for 100ish gold. So every time I get on I see new mail and it has yet to sell. Always the random herbs being bought.
---
haha MLP haha i don't actually like it im just pretending.... unless?
---
100% troll
---
Holy shit these posts are so cringe
---
No, I would fuck over melee dps, as an enhancement shaman, and I guess Hunters.  No one else there "should" be rolling for healing gear anyway, otherwise they wouldn't have asked me to be a healer.
---
And, it's not fucking them over, they have the same chance to win I do, highest roll of 100.
---
Just transfer it's worth it. It's screws then over and you can play world of Warcraft on a normalized server pop. It's a win for you... And a loss to the horde
---
That's not terrible
---
troll? troll
---
Felbearcatseal
---
Theyre proba ly gonna implement a $5 a month vip service to skip queues... jk... i hope i didnt give them an idea........
---
That's quite the insight. Never thought of it like that.
---
You mean some people othan then me, are doing that in this reddit?
---
I knew what I signed up for and I wouldnt have it any other way
---
There's no upgrade to the epic mount either. One helps you perform better in content, one lets you get to the content and wait on the others without an epic mount more.
---
Or one time faction changes from the higher number faction. Not in vanilla but I don't want to reroll after 60, epic mount and 300 eng/herb.  It's to much work just to delete my character and reroll Ally on the same servers.  To much investment to just dump but I would faction change day 1 to be on a lesser faction for the fact of server life and pvp. I want to find people not spend six hours farming to find 1 ally.  No changes can't hold up anymore, there are plenty of things that are different.
---
a group of 5 gets like 50 honor per kill
---
a group of 10+ gets like 10
---
Not releasing bg's with honor was one of the bigger dumb decisions I've seen so far
---
As a hunter when I see a geared Spriest, I tend to be a badass. I will mark and aimed shot, and if things arent going my way I will bravely run my bitch ass away.
---
Can you wear an off-hand with that? Any recommendations?
---
We exist... you just can't see us.
---
You should had it replaced with leather helm from last boss in ZF
---
VE isn't used in current raids. Shadow priest is amazing in dungeons if properly played and in a decent comp.. Of course running with two SP in a 5 man group is bad, but swap 1 with a lock and you have a super powerful duo buffing each other and providing tons of utility with more than enough DPS. SP can get up to 45% threat reduction...
---
You have misunderstood. The OP is putting this question up for debate and not asking anyone specifically to actually carry out the suggestion. Don't worry that you have no authority to do anything just respond with your view of whether or not those who do have that authority should act in the manner the OP suggesting. Do you think it's a good idea?
---
Appreciated bro
---
Adding a delay would, in large, fix the problem.  I didn't invent this solution, the entire marketplace known as 'sniping' is centered around profiting from people mistakenly listing items on the AH below market price.  The most common mistake being the mistake I made, which is listing a stack of items for the price of a single item in that stack.  
---
&gt; This seems only to be an issue if you see that you posted it wrong and click anyway, OR your particular workflow to post is to post, then go back and double check your listings after the fact. 
---
A player will notice they post it wrong immediately after they list it because they will go into their bags to list the next item in the stack and realize the entire stack is gone.  This is the problem that would be fixed by implementing a 1 min. delay.   
---
&gt; so don't pretend this is just the bare minimum obvious feature to add a delay. 
---
I'm not pretending, this is what I believe.  I do not think a player should be punished for a mis-click, however, if you list something intentionally for a price that is below market price, and someone buys that and resells it for higher, that is simply economics and a great part of this game.  I'm suggesting there is a difference between the two.
---
absolutely fucking brilliant, thank you
---
That'd be nice, but it would be abused somehow.
---
Ehh but you can't steal another guild's world buffs
---
I’d be interested to see how long you’d last on a pre leveled 45 toon on these one sided servers. I doubt you’d get to 50
---
in TBC
---
I think their favorite thing is watching people whine about it on Reddit.
---
I also frequented pservers and I find it at least funnier than people spamming /spit and teabagging. You're getting outraged over... extremely mild griefing.
---
Nah just make every realm PVE and stop this nonsense. This is just stupid.
---
Soul Link Rouge.
---
BG's???
---
I've been loving being Alliance on Old Blanchy!
---
No changes was never going to be a real thing. MMOs more than any game change drastically based on how people are playing them because they don’t tell the players how to play.
---
When the game came out people were exploring and leveling and finding loot and playing it their own way. The game has been basically solved in the 15 years since then. Many players have already experienced he world and just want to “win” now. Everyone is just using BiS and build guides from wowhead and playing the “best” way for their class.
---
Everything about the game is known and people don’t want to explore they just want to get things as fast as possible. MC was cleared in a week.
---
In my opinion the way to maintain the original feel the most would be to make changes. Fix the honor system, tweak back some min/maxing, some changes would make the whole thing feel more organic which would be more like how the game was.
---
This is not how it was on vanilla, so idk wtf you're on about here.
---
I rolled a toon on my PvP server because i can’t get into BRM without corpsewalking 2-5 times. My main is a healer and my toon is a rogue, I would recommend trying something new. I’ve only been ganked once and just hit 25 on that rogue. Seems like the PvP is mainly happening in 40+ zones so I’ll keep the leveling going until I start running into 60s too often. I’m guessing I’ll get to mid-40s before that happens and be well set up to swap between the two characters for raids and Dungeons once wpvp dies down. 
---
Also, it’s fun to spoil yourself on the second time through, BoE blues from AH, mount money in the bag, lvl 60 runs through early dungeons to get the loot you want. Everything has been more fun about it.
---
thx:)
---
Nah, it's equivalent to playing at a bowling alley that gives you the option to use guard rails. Whereas pvp servers are the equivalent of bowling in an alley where other players can take your ball from you and repeatedly throw it down the wrong lane.
---
Maybe you can't use your brain, I'm sure others can.
---
Create one yourself. Probably 4 other people waiting for someone else to start one.
---
Yes... You can be with your family instead of gy

I'm on Heartseeker as an Alliance and get killed by Horde all the time! Fuck a lot of the time the Boat from Wetlands to Theramore is controlled by Horde.
---
Epic mount decreases the amount of time it takes to do basically anything in game.  Also since phase 2 came out epic mount is invaluable for running away from gankers or getting to pvp areas.  Lion heart isn’t going to hugely impact the dps compared to mask of the unforgiven which is easy to get for free.
---
No, and to answer this question forever. Super no. The game has been going for 15 years at this point, if it was too late at the second phase of the games life cycle, it would have died a long time ago.
---
BGs aren't out yet so we don't know.
---
You took what I said and made it something else, my comment was specifically meant for Heartseeker. Thanks for the essay, though.
---
OSRS has got it down man.  All content is voted on by the community and you need like 75% yes vote for anything to go through. Blizzard should take some notes.
---
So you agree there are low pop servers? Low pop PVE servers? Why not go to one? It’s a sunk cost if it’s really causing OP to cry himself to sleep, as he says.
---
fastest shadowburn in the west
---
We're in the shadows
---
200 is too high unless your realms economy is super whack.
---
I'm not saying you're forced to do anything.. but at least recognize that it's every player like you making individually self maximizing choices which causes the problem.
---
Had to wait an hour for the enchant mats to send from my bank alt :[  
---
If it makes you feel any better, I switched it to Anathema until I could enchant it an hour later :P
---
How the fuck do you do it so low?
---
I tried to transfer a while ago from Faerlina to Heartseeker. I missed the first free transfer period by a couple hours, I was so irritated I contacted Blizzard.
---
It may have been the best thing to happen to me in classic.
---
&gt;• Hunter - sPriest, Warlock, mage (still winnable but easy to deadzone and avoid trap).
---
Haha you don't actually even need to avoid the trap. You just iceblock out of it. Mage: "Oh you think *you* trapped me in a block of ice? Actually *I* trapped my in a block of ice"
---
What made you play the same class compared to trying a different one? I played priest in vanilla but couldn't do it again
---
Notice how they didn't state why this is a problem.   
---
Is it that you deny other members of your own faction the honor share? Or is it because it gets around honorless target a few seconds faster than just polymorphing them?
---
For the Forsaken RP. (Originally joined the Horde for Science,  so rerolled a Forsaken counterpart to my human mage and found that I loved the faction)
---
Yeah, this kind of crap has made me completely stop wpvp. I'm all for honor grinding and harassing players, but not at the expense that they'll totally quit the game. Since the 1st week of phase 2, I've been lucky to even see anyone leveling in redridge or westfall.
---
How do you like it?
---
No, because world bosses.
---
Either take a break if you can't handle it, roll an alt, or dungeon grind. People need to chill out.
---
The reak of redditor mate
---
No but this is just stupid.
---
I hope bgs help a lot, hopefully player laziness limits heavy wpvp to contested zones near capitals (UC-&gt;EPL, IF-&gt;Searing Gorge etc)
---
The best wpvp experience I had was after transferring and the realm was low/medium pop for a while
---
My friend that stopped playing at level 14 insisted on it.
---
Youre not understanding. The point is you cant just add a queue for one faction based on the number of characters the other faction has online. Raw number of characters online means nothing
---
Ohp
---
I had a session where I went to Booty Bay to farm nagas, couldn't get out of BB. Res hearth to menethil, I get sapped as soon as I spawn in the inn then killed. Res and quickly take fp to Morgan's Vigil to try and start Ony quest, Horde had a nice welcome party waiting for me there too haha. This was in a span of about 20 minutes. But despite it being frustrating, I love new and unique wow experience classic has given me...
---
Ive got pre bis and bis so I had what i needed they just were too much lol never had an issue till now lol
---
Me and my brother got ours on back to back runs, he ran it 7 times and I ran It 17
---
Full pop...economy is booming
---
Raid vs raid pvp is silly and waste of time.   I’ll take small group vs small group every time.  Much more fun.   You play your game I’ll play mine.   Just stop bitching and moaning on Reddit.    You’ll just get more of the same.    Pathetic is choosing faction realm and crying to have someone else come to the rescue instead of yourself.     Furthermore it’s also their choice to stay on the blood boat or leave not mine.
---
Take this with skepticism. These are the amount of people from each server that log there raids. It's not a great display of server population but I feel it's at least a indicator to help people like you decide. 
---
ironforge.pro/servers/
---
Ya, it's just such a nightmare to go out into the world right now as alliance. I'm pretty sure mage can solo DM east jump runs and collect herbs on the way. Look for some guides on youtube I would sayy.
---
It was very easy for all of us to look back, and remember/see that this happened before. Different forums, same bitching. Yeah, it sucks. Totally agree with it, but anyone that says they didn't/couldn't know, wasn't paying attention. There's been talk of how this was going to go for months. 
---
Blizzard did what they were asked for. Create the old Vanilla experience, for people that have been gaming for years now. They gave exactly what they were asked for.
---
Dont know, they have good pvpers on Heartseeker. Same can be said for the alliance, my horde character is on Blameaux and its not uncommon for alliance to pull up with 5 or more people. I play Alliance on Heartseeker as well. Relax bud.
---
Tanaris for sure with a steady stream of ZF runs. Should get get you to 47 at which point you can keep doing ZF/Maraudon and then flip to Searing Gorge/BRD at 52.
---
Remove "Heartseeker" and insert the name of any other server with similar imbalance. Your comment is unhelpful and uninformed.
---
Hey man sorry for the late reply, I've ran all the wings a bunch and I feel like just doing cath only is worth it. Maybe do arm if you can avoid the mobs (disarm is a huge pain), lib is good if you have keys, guarentee two chest every Lib run.
---
Horde: The Crescent Staff from the WC chain last a long time.
---
Alliance: Idk maybe something from the Westfall Deadmines Chain. Or the BFD Staff.
---
What’s erp stand for?
---
You’re triggered because you’re the type of nonsense poster he’s talking about
---
Torille
---
Btw. Are you alliance on thunderfurry?
---
Avoid this server if your planning on going alliance. Horde dominate brd, burning steppes and searing gorge about every day except when some alliance guilds clean up on tuesday on their way to mc. Estimated ratio is 60/40 favoring horde.
---
Ignorant on what is happening to bad players who are bad sounds more like it. I’m playing and dealing with the same shit show you are bud. I’m just not advocating Blizzard should change things to cater to carebears who should have rolled on a PVE server.
---
we dont know the problem will end with bg's yet. it might help but its not going to completely solve it
---
It's gallows humor.
---
...Then why would they be getting banned?
---
pallys are really annoying when they are paired with anyone. Alone though they are pretty easy to kill, just gotta not be dumb and waste all mana in like 10 seconds
---
It’s either hypnotic blade or just put it on a level 1 item that isn’t even bound to the user.  That way you pass it on.  Plus it is more valuable the earlier you get it.
---
Like, all dudes though?
---
yep
---
Skinning knife with 30+sp is MLG.

When you’re done you can trade it to an alt or sell

You can modify the html of the page to change what people say.

---
While I barely got rank 2 last week and haven’t done any pvp besides defending myself... how else do you expect people to get to those high ranks? Sure bgs will help but it will be faster for those at the top of the ladder when bgs release
---
What part of this post is outrage?  Pointing out toxic behavior and how its detrimental to the community and longevity of the game?  Or doing so in a completely calm manner as I present the discussion point?  Read my posts however you wish but I am presenting everything in a completely casual conversational tone.  If you're reading it as outrage on your end, that's your problem.
---
Blizzard please just put a faction que in for the overpopulated factions and offer free transfers off the server for them already.
---
Joopiter my man!
---
Probably only worth 100-110 then.
---
Yea it’s just a matter of time before the word is out and the big boys come.    I’m not the only one that wants HKs.   Join world chat it’s the quickest way to find action.    Other time you got to creat it yourself.     Don’t hate the player hate the game.
---
&gt; And clearly they aren't smart about it; and opening it up to open xfers means they have no more control over it whatsoever. So wtf is your point?
---
Ah yes, they made a past mistake so clearly they incapable of fixing it, may as well let people quit the game instead of learning from it right? I'm sure the shareholders have no issues with just letting people leave the game after record a record jump in subs the last quarter.
---
&gt; Yes adding a short term solution for the most toxic, whiny, and insatiable faction of the playerbase that can't even wait two weeks is in the best interest of the longevity of the game... what a joke.
---
Yeah these people who have already been unable to play the game for 2 weeks, and are now waiting 2 more weeks, as well as possible future unplayability like the silithus example I gave are just being whiny about paying a sub fee for a game they love only to get to watch themselves get ganked for literally 1/4 of the time the games been out. If you expected pvp servers to be raids of 20+ people camping every lowbie and flight path, you're in the minority and your research and foresight should be justification for other people simply not having fun, especially when the solution is a system that was in vanilla in the first place.
---
&gt; Again: open xfers will make faction balance worse.
---
Again: No it won't. People who aren't having fun aren't going to keep playing after this. They quit or reroll, either way you end up with 1 less player on your server.
---
&gt; How is that even remotely similar to the issue we're seeing now? People won't be camping silithus for R14... that doesn't even make sense? You don't know what you are talking about. Are you complaining about people not being able to play, or faction balance? Either way, your argument is not at all applicable. Open xfers exaggerate faction balance issues, and AQ opening is irrelevant to people getting corpse camped/not being able to play.
---
It's similar because people trying to accomplish anything in silithus of the lesser faction won't be able to go 10 yard without encounter the dominant faction and being ganked. Honor isn't about to disappear... Ideally you have some cross faction cooperation to open the gates quickly, but it doesn't change the fact that having thousands of people of opposite factions is going to lead to griefing and camping of players. You keep going back to this point where xfers are going to kill server balance, but not having them is going to ruin it too, the difference being subs are also going to drop meaning the game suffers overall.
---
&gt; PvP isn't different now and, again, for the bajillionth time it's a short term issue. Everyone knew P2 was going to be a clusterfuck until BGs came out. Just stop whining 24/7, take a deep breath, and calm the fuck down until after BGs come out. If it's still bad, let's talk; but we ALL know it won't be. The R14 grinders will switch to BGs and the casual PvPers in it for fun will do the same. It's a non-issue, chill out.
---
It's not a short term issue at all. You are stuck in your server with 3x the population of vanilla. These are causing serious issues in classic and aren't about to get solved. It's not just mindless whining, it's legitimate issues people have with the game and others think they should just suck it up. That's not how games work, and if you think blizz is going to side with the "too bad live with your choice idc if u quit" crowd, you're going to be in for a surprise.
---
&gt;ntil it's Tuesday night and you cant get on to raid because you're stuck in a queue
---
If it becomes enough of an issue, then guilds will transfer. Seems like a good deal.
---
imp cleave is a terrible talent btw, it doesnt improve cleave dmg by 120% its just the bonus attack power from it, so its like an extra 50 AP
---
Elixir of the Mongoose, Elixir of Giants, Winterfall Firewater or Juju Might, Grilled Squid or Blessed Sunfruit can all be used in conjunction.
---
Firewater and jujus don’t stack, nor do the food buffs obviously. And although you can use a Mongoose Elixir and a greater Agi Elixir at the same time, they do not stack (aka you only get 25 Agi even if you use both, so don’t!)
---
Yeah I'm alliance. Horde get a nice quest reward trinket. Only comparable reverse situations I've seen is a BRD quest for alliance which rewards Magni's Will ring but there's plenty of decent rings to get out there already.
---
What the hell? GM's still chat with people? Why don't they do this more often instead of automated responses..
---
They put you in as a puppet leader. The system is corrupt!
---
I feel like it will die down, but people will get bored and back to camping, as soon as they realise how hard rank 10 is
---
*for the first half, then switching to banish for the second half of pulls.
---
Alliance on Herod dominate BRM during normal day hours. Over 200k Honor just from there
---
Tried - really hard time getting tank and healer and I don’t know the lingo so people don’t really respond to me like others
---
This is what I did. He would despair when I wing clipped him so I just did the figure 8. Turning on enemy npc nameplates made it 100% easier. You can also use a lower rank of wing clip and it won’t fear you but it will just slow him.
---
I actually run a group pvp / dungeon DPS / Solo grind spec. 
---
Many people prefer 30/0/21 to pickup 3 points into spell hit and 5% spell crit, I run 31/7/13 for imp ghost wolf for positioning in large group pvp (as no amount of extra crit will save you from getting swarmed in a 5v1, but functional ghost will has), while being able to delete anyone who drops down under 3k HP.  Often when a rogue jumps me, after LS has done ~850 damage, I can usually trinket out of stun, grenade and pop EleM CL+ES to delete them.
---
I heal and have downed rag with just the 13 in resto.  Getting 5/5 heal cost, totem range, and 5/5 totem cost reduction are the big ones if your main role is raid healing or main healing an offtank.
---
what about the stopwatch?  Is the speed boost the same?
---
Yup. Advocating no changes will kill the game. 😂😂😂
---
Yeah, as others pointed out, it sounds like they didnt talent into threat reduction, which for PVE is simply unacceptable. Spriests have EIGHT talent points they can use for threat reduction, totaling 45% threat reduction (can get another 30% from Salv too). It seems like a lot of people groan about spending so many points for threat reduction. But youd be surprised how good spriest can be if you dont have to worry about threat and can dot all the mobs and mind blast on CD. I have honestly found those 8 talent points are well spent and rarely have threat problems (and just fade when I do).
---
It's not your fault lol.
---
1) Not that hard of a jump. I've never seen anyone stuck on it for longer than a minute or two. Got it on my first try the first time I ever attempted it. After a week of AV every Horde player will know how to do it.
---
2) Never been forced to push onto the bridge. 1) is just that easy.
---
I'm trying to think how. All you could do is mount and run for a bit. It's better than putting powerful guards there, because this way you're only protected when you first arrive. What it would do is move pvp to other parts of the zone, where it belongs.
---
Exactly. All im asking for is my mats back. This has to be simpler than policing mind controls.
---
I was certain they are magic effect buffs, no?
---
Don't have a favorite deep guide, but yeah, pretty much everyone assumes you know all the dungeons by heart. Tank Maps are a great way to lead a dungeon you don't know: https://www.fadedandblurred.com/wow-classic-dungeon-maps-for-tanks/
---
You only bring 1 shadow priest for this reason. Their abilities are high threat. Go 2h arms tank
---
What scrolling combat text addons are people using? I have seen videos in which people have healing on one side and damage on the other, and I can't find one to do it.
---
My understanding is that they are planning on putting a balance cap on the servers. So if horse or alliance outnumbers 45:55 then the server will start a log on delay for the higher number faction. That might cause frustration on servers where the ratio is really screwed like 75:25 by subscriptions. It will keep the game from being unplayable for anyone that can manage to log on though. Idk. It would be nice if high level world pvp was not dominated by assholes also.
---
This is important, so dont blink. I said classic wow... as in the game we are currently playing where majority of the players have been playing for 10+ years and have endless amounts of research and resources helping them play this game.... not vanilla WoW where no one had a clue what was going on... 
---
So yeah, skill is going to have a lot to do with it, mr. 1500 player isnt going to be winning bgs or farming players even if they play 24/7
---
/cast is the real way to play
---
Y'all sound like a group gather for the 5 O'Clock crack give away and it's 5:95 and nobody has shown up
---
Lol, enjoy getting shit on daily on Stalagg :)
---
Once someone bids can u still cancel the auction?
---
Wow that is disgusting
---
People need to STFU about which faction is doing it because both do it. All the time. Alliance will level up and be camped to death by horde until they become a douche at Max level, and then you could turn around and level a horde and have the same fucking issue with alliance.
---
The only reason this gets worse is because YOU GET REWARDED FOR BEING A DICK.
---
Players don't get rewarded for helping other players, but you do get honor and like from killing and camping players. Therefore there will ALWAYS be people trying to find the most efficient way to farm this honor.
---
Ex: Camping FPs, waiting at high populated areas or crossroads.
---
It's not much of a step further to just gank lowbies but there at least you're not rewarded (unless you're a sadistic useless shit who enjoys wasting people's time and their own).
---
More players on your specified faction than the other make it easier to be a dick and make honor farming easier. People tend to not complain when things are easier for them (especially on Reddit).
---
People are tired of it and call people dicks because the system in place requires you to be a dick to actually succeed.
---
It just so happens that it's easier for the actual dicks and assholes to play a part of the shitty wpvp system because it was almost made for them.
---
Balance was never, and will never happen untill the wpvp aspect changes a bit. Or until certain servers die enough that all the people yelling "Shouldn't have rolled on a PvP server" have almost noone to kill and have perpetual surprised Pikachu face. 
---
It's just my opinion but, 
---
TL;DR: maybe things would be more balanced and less douchey if the meta for honor wasn't being a douche.
---
 But you lose the deposit..
---
Warcraft 3
---
Yeah, I know, you're responding to my comment you know.
---
How do place your character on a wall?
---
General use: Hypnotic blade as everyone says
---
AOE Grinding:  Stats, whatever has the most INT&gt;STAM  but don't solely prioritize INT over STAM you need a good balance to be able to survive the round up and taking some hits.
---
Blizzard and other aoe spell coefficients are horrendous and being able to recover quicker or survive hiccups more often is going to be bigger than a few extra dmg on your spells.
---
Cone of Cold - 1.5/3.5/3*0.95 - 13.57%
---
Blizzard - 3.5/3.5/3 - 33% - 4.125% per tick (8)
---
Arcane Explosion - 1.5/3.5/3 - 14.28%
---
This means if you add 9sp,   Blizzard does a whopping 3 extra dmg total.    If you wear frozen wrath stuff and get SP to 100  blizzard does 33 extra dmg total.   Compared to a few hundred extra hp and mana to stay in the fight longer and roll with the punches that's nothing.
---
Reroll
---
I am sad you haven't been enlightened by the print screen button, scrub.
---
I bet your friends cringed so hard when they saw that shit quality image. Their responses were out of sympathy more than congratulations.
---
Maybe to you, plenty of people flush with gold would disagree though
---
It's not that difficult even if you haven't done any tanking before, at least for pugs. Throw on defensive stance and sunder armor/heroic strike. Taunt only when they start to walk away. That's what I do.
---
Where are you pvping at to accumulate that much per day?
---
In an instance or zone with few players, wow actually uses next to no data, so your phones hotspot will work just fine

Fixes display issues on reddit. :)
---
Yeah, if you can get enough spell crit NS would become a more favorable option. But until people are all decked out in Naxx/AQ gear well over a year and a half from now I would say "meh".
---
They decided they didn't need this because they'd have GMs enforce the rules on scammers back in 2004.
---
Haven't tried it, though I'd like to test it out. If the speed is the same it's 100% possible.
---
Yes I want what’s good for me, because why the hell should I be like op on heartseeker hating my life and most likely quitting the game. Solely for someone I’ve never met and have 0 connection with. People seem to want a fix to the solution, and ask others to do something that they personally would never do. 
---
Again, if there were actual good options to transfer to from skeram. I would seriously consider it and mostly likely do it. But as of now there are only mountain of downsides and no upside to transferring. So I’ll stick with my original comment, I’m so glad I didn’t transfer.

I'm a human mage at level 60, want to buy my epic mount but only have 800g and I'm not rank 3 yet. I've read I can get one of my human guildies who's rank 3 to buy it for me to get the discount, has anyone actually done this in classic and had it work? Just want to make sure someone has actually done this successfully before I risk pissing away 800g
---
Innumeracy is very real and evident in those comments. 'Oh its only 60/40'. Over a population of 10k that equates to 2k difference. Two thousand extra people who can throw their weight anywhere and not be matched. That is a massive amount of people when back in the day that swing might have been 500 or a much more reasonable amount. I wish people would think before speaking.
---
thx
---
No. Blizzard needs to listen to and act on these complaints asap. Because we need Classic BfA within a year.
---
Yeah I'm just leveling an alt (same realm, different class) during peak hours and only playing my main to wpvp or late at night. Once BGs come out it will be a LOT better.
---
Then maybe you should talk about "the people in this subreddit" instead of saying "you guys" while directly responding to me.
---
But in all honestly, is it really such a surprise? The average person who browses this subreddit is a "dadgamer" who is completely dogshit at the game. Serious players who actually play the game dont post here.
---
I didnt bother clicking
---
i thought so, but maybe I'm mistaken
---
Absolutely not.  
---
There are real issues OSRS has when the bulk of the player base actively votes against any PVP updates because it would make their experience harder.  PVP has had shit for updates for the better part of the last 6 years.   
---
You also have top streamers basically throwing their viewers around as votes and they all impact votes without even knowing the details of the poll they’re voting on.  
---
It’s a good system in theory, but OSRS has shown some major flaws with it.  Classic would be no different.
---
&gt; they might have had Really high DPS too
---
High for a shadow priest possibly, but I guarantee they weren't doing more dps than a reasonably geared, competent mage.
---
Might be, looking closer at the npc zombie in the background you’re probably right.
---
Why not both?
---
Who knew you would get ganked on a PVP server?
---
What Blizz should have done is have a realtime faction balance shown next to each server. This may have caused people to continue to stack on already stacked servers, or it might have gotten people to chose servers that we were in need of balance.
---
true.  when you're in it to troll though, i guess that doesn't matter
---
5 minutes? try firemaw EU- it's up to 20minutes chat delay now, was 10min earlier
---
I new it wasnt my fault but i wanted to be sure so i maid a post lol thx for the info will makes sure to check next time
---
Hah that's funny..I play Horde on Kirtonos as my main and I always thought it was a pretty balanced server in terms of numbers..Except in Un'goro Crater where the Alliance roam in packs eating up any Horde that get off the FP.
---
I just did this yesterday, a friend of mine was rank 3 and bought my mount for me for 800g. Guaranteed works, just find someone you can trust with 800g.
---
How the fuck is a w supposed to look like a mouth?
---
There’s a difference between no changes for OSRS and classic.  
---
No changes for classic still involves phases of new content.   No changes for OSRS meant no updates at all, resulting in a forever dwindling player base.
---
Delay has been going upto 20minutes 3 days in a row now
---
Just down vote irrelevant posts.
---
true
---
oof
---
How do you know to activate perception when rogues are literally invisible?
---
True, I think the server I had in vanilla was 15k max. biggelsworth is like 60k+
---
Only really works with gnomes due to height. Walk to the edge backwards till you are barely on the platform. Then /sleep
---
""Sinkki has been attempting to tame Broken Tooth for the obvious benefits in PvP and has been camping the mob for 30+ hours over the last 3 weeks. He has to this date passed it to 5 other Hunters""
---
lmao please shut the fuck up
---
You leveled to 60 in two months? You might have a job but you definitely don’t have a life.
---
Can you explain why (for druids) please ?
---
Yes it it, please keep in mind that the video I posted is Alliance POV on a Horde dominated server.  The experience is just as bad if you're Horde on an Alliance dominated server.  It's not meant to promote Horde = Bad.
---
Sounds like you've had some bad spriests that dont know how to talent for PVE. :( Spriest can very often top meters in dungeons but they NEED to put points in threat reduction. For some reason people seem to think it's a waste smh.
---
You can you just lose the deposit and the bidder is refunded as if they were outbid.
---
Yea, I guess I have to keep dealing with it. Maybe BGs will swell this numbers. Doubtful though because Horde will be stuck in hour long ques since there isn’t enough ally playing
---
Reflecting death coils feels so damn good.
---
The voting system has its flaws, but the premise that the 2007 version of the game had enough merit on its own to maintain an active and growing player base is where the #nochanges people are going to be unpleasantly surprised when classic heads down that road in the next 6 months.
---
I'm sorry you have to deal with that :( Full sympathy - I'm on a PVP server in retail, immediately went PVE because been there, done that and it is NOT fun.
---
Think canine, feline, rodent, deer etc. Stylized, much like the :3 emoticon.
---
This is 5 minute multiboxing and can be very helpful, as well as free to use
---
As others have said.  Ret pallies just don't scale very well,they are a weird spell/melee class that is fundamentally unfinished in classic,and you are hitting a point where other players are significantly more geared than you are with classes with far better mechanics.
---
Ive seen ret pallies top aoe meters in UBRS though.  Consecrate can do a ton of damage.
---
Still,as a tank,I love having ret pallies, the utility they have in dungeons far outweighs their dps.  
---
For raids you are gonna be in for a wake-up call. Most are already deeply unfriendly to melee dps and ret is just terrible on top of that.  That being said, paladins are not played that much and I've never seen a pug turn down a ret pally for MC.
---
However you can look into a hybrid holy/ret spec. 21/0/30 you get all the good dps talents and almost all the good holy ones.  Carry a holy set and heal/decurse on some bosses and dps others.
---
Except BGs were always the only way to really push ranking because of the way diminishing returns is calculated. After you've killed someone in the open world 4 times, they aren't even worth honor to you. Your game client will only report the estimated original honor they were worth, not the diminished final total. So even if you see in your log that you got +100 honor, it may only be 25 or even 0 if you've already killed that person a few times.
---
In BGs, you don't have diminishing returns on the honor. So even if there are long queues, people that want honor are going to have to just suck it up and wait.
---
Lmao absolutely toyed bro
---
On my server there's always a battle south of Kargath. Occasionally pirates on the zepps. And roaming groups in Searing Gorge/Felwood.
---
Extremely easy for someone on the “dominate” faction to say “calm down” when it’s clear that there’s a problem with everyone trying to min/max everything. Aggressive world PvP is one thing. Griefing every flight master, quest hub, and even using roof tops to escape guards is not Player versus Player game play. It’s lame af. As well as trying to find ways around someone being honorless when someone lands at a FP with MC is proof that the culture is toxic. Enjoy your aggressive world PvP, GL on R14.

lol r/rareinsults

It's the old tongue of my country you uncultured swine!

10% discount for rank 3 and 10% for honoured with main faction. 
---
So the 1000g mount will be 800g
---
I think this is definitely the case.
---
that's a taunt. it's the same thing. mocking blow as well.
---
MiksScrollingBattleText I believe is the standard
---
Thought the invite would be the funny part.
---
Sprayed water through my nose all over the room when i got to the rejection.
---
Might be EU or just the server itself. I play on NA and haven't had any chat lag whatsoever.
---
It’s happening on Gehennas as well since Sunday. 5-10 minutes of chat lag.
---
To be honest I’m not confident it will be fixed that quickly as large retail servers (like Draenor) have chat lag issues that are pretty much just accepted by the players there.
---
Yeah. Every night.   Every city.  Sometimes for hours while I watch tv. 
---
No one has them.  I finally figured out why - the pattern is on the artisan blacksmith trainers and evidently it’s “skipped “ during power leveling because it’s not “efficient “ to do.
---
Fucking rare recipe just because the trainers out in the booneys and people choose to save a gold not learning them.
---
Sheeples.  That’s what everyone is nowadays.  
---
So much potential profit too if someone would stick them up at an acceptable price.
---
" , the guards should be focused on the person who started the fight, especially considering they won’t even attack you if you don’t fight back. " but they are not cause the aggro range is too low on a 60. So you die of 60 cause of inaction, or die cause of your action against the 60 cause you will have aggro.  
---
Also a second mechanic i despise: A 60 mage attacked me OUTSIDE the city, out of range of all the guards. i stunned him and ran to the city. when i reached the city the goblins attacked me even though all i did was outside the city AND he started it first. :P
---
Finish any quests that you haven't done in Booty Bay yet. Dustwallow Marsh has a few quests in that range also. You should then start questing in Tanaris at 43 and start doing ZF/Ulda runs as well. Around 45, go to Feralas and do the quests in Feralas. At 47, do the Hinterlands. At this level, keep doing ZF/Mara runs, do Searing Gorge, and do the higher level quests in Feralas and Tanaris until 50.
---
Your dagger rogues must be peeved :P
---
Is this an alt? Might be hard to level a character until BGs are out. A lot of people my guild stopped working on alts because of all the gank squads.
---
TBC was the best, I loved owning Rank 14 noobs because they have no skill.
---
well this is why I ask the question.
---
Hate the player not the game man. My server is a joke too. I just hop on another alt or apply my time IRL to something more beneficial
---
I don’t know if it’s the same as you, but for me sometimes I’m just somehow on the last page that’s blank and I just needed to hit “Prev”.
---
There's a secret trick that pro players don't want you to know, and that's if you roll on a PvE server you'll never have to worry about being pursued!
---
You should be a comedian.
---
True. A lot of no changes folks were a bit salty with Blizzard about the launch. It seemed obvious that it was highly anticipated, but Blizzard didn't start out planning many servers for it. So, we have megaservers, layering, population imbalances due to transfer issues...all of these things basically come back to poor planning on Blizzard's part.   
---
And sadly, there's no way to ensure a #nochanges Blizzard.
---
If you want to swing nightfall I think a case could be made for all Shaman specs to be 'viable'
---
The filters on that site don't really work at all as sometimes you end up only getting data from one faction without selecting any faction in the filter. The data points are clearly lacking for individual servers as well. Characters above lvl20 on Benediction seen in the last 30 days had a 44/56 split in favour of Horde but once you change it to seen in the last 14 days it suddenly becomes 85/15 in favour of Alliance, and the number of characters recorded tanked from 12420 to 3089. It's clearly pure BS due to the lack of data contribution or some mess in the backend with data filtering.
---
I'm with you. I LOVE world pvp, but not like this where we can't get around anywhere. You're supposed to get into skirmishes over quest mobs and herb and mining nodes, fight for grinding areas, etc. You arent supposed to take 45 minutes to corpse walk from every boat to every flight master in every zone. It's fucking absurd.
---
i bet there is a higher amount of priests on your realm.
---
Shadowguard is better than any other priest racial, change my mind.
---
You could run two.  They weren’t bricks, the gameplay just lagged like hell.
---
Census had it at 68% horde when the first xfer opened up, not 85%. The first 5 to 1 server was heartseeker, which became that bad after the 2nd round of xfers. 
---
Here's the data at the time of the first xfer liar.

So yeah your entire post is a bucket of lies. Get rekt
---
I know.
---
The issue is i had a blast leveling with them,  just we cant pull 40 people (about 20-25 on average) so they pug the rest, and when you pug you have to free roll.
---
Noones helping anyone else out now,  they all roll for themselves.
---
Am going to give them a bit of time to recruit more and see how things go before i start looking around.

Does anybody have a working /castrandom macro? I want to have pigmorph and sheepmorph on the same button and used at random, but every time I try it either does just one or just the other. I don't know if the macro formatting has changed or what, but it's just not working and I can't find any macro guides specifically for classic
---
Commenting for later, thanks.
---
If it's literally unplayable because you spawn in a group of enemy players literally everywhere you go  that also sounds like something that needs to be addressed with a "necessary evil". Wasn't that the argument Blizzard brought regarding to layering? Too many players at once for the game to be playable?  
---
Vanilla was never this populated and underdog factions on every server  still managed to progress.
---
\&gt;  players didn't know what they signed up for is just a little silly. 
---
players were never given the information required to know what they signed up for
---
Maybe just try PvE for a few weeks until battlegrounds. I recall wpvp being pretty intense when honor came out, but I was on a full pvp server. Medium PvE server has been great for my lifestyle!
---
The cast bar is there to give you time to type it out, duh.
---
People like fucking animals?
---
this is me.  I only kill someone multiple times if they are in my farming spot and ill do /shoo so they get the point these are my mats.  otherwise its once and move on and if I bump into them again sure I'll kill them again but I wont sit there and wait for a spawn
---
You're not getting punished because of imbalance. You're being punished because you signed up for a PVP server. This is what PVP servers are. It's what they always were. The problem is that a lot of people convinced themselves that this busted system was just too difficult and *competitive* for modern casual gamers. Now that they're face to face with it again they're starting to realize how bad it really is.
---
That’s a new blizzard bullshit tweak.   It’s fucked up too but it’s not getting changed because whiners.
---
Part of me wants to say that at least half of these posts are fake and just want to accelerate game changing implications.
---
Cool story bro
---
Your priests were idiots. Any good a priest knows to start with multi dot + wand til around 60% hp then start mind blasting because threat has been established by then.
---
No and no. The person can open the doors. After the tribute is done, all of the mobs are friendly. Then you can just go straight to the end and loot the chest.
---
Chalk it up to a learning experience I suppose, cheers for the advice
---
I actually just saw a video about soloing Quartermaster today, but it needed swiftness pots, an invis pot, nifty stopwatch, and gnomish mind control cap to pull off.  And he died in the end trying to loot the boss.  Pretty expensive, took 25 minutes to run, and can only be done twice an hour anyway due to the MC cooldown.
---
Seeing a well played gnome warrior use a fap and all cds and still loosing to a run of the mill mage, depressing.
---
Honestly it's quite good from what I've read, they are super fast allowing you to stack heroic/cleave spams(watch your threat).  That +5 weapon skill is basically a 30% increase to 40% of your white damage hits. So your white damage will go up by like 12%(someone check my math) or so.  Plus it lets you replace hit gear as your cap is only 6% now.    
---
But you will complete with dagger rogues and warrior tanks for gear.
---
I actually want a dagger for tanking on my gnome, and I'm gonna farm that belt eventually.
---
Recent kids crying their asses off - same-reason retail failed, same reason classic will too
---
Honestly cool to see a GM reach out about this kind of honor farming BS. Please, next on the list : camping flight paths (I know it was mentioned in the post) and boats. You're 1 or 2 rogues at theramore, i hate your guts with a vengeance but it's fair game, you're 20 horde at light's hope chapel killing ppl that arrive one by one every 30 seconds, you're basically just embarrassing yourself.
---
What’s the other option in your opinion?
---
Why do you act as if a 15 year old is absolutely perfect in every way? The only reason why #NoChanges won is because nobody can agree on which things should be changed.
---
"Go to retail" is not an argument btw.
---
Yeah, same with greater blessings for the lvl60 prot paladins out there. Every spellcast that's holy gets threatbuff from Righteous Fury.
---
Too easy! Thank you
---
World pvp has made it pretty much impossible to quest in western or eastern plague lands sadly.
---
They were never being ironic.
---
&gt; I mean this problem stems from horde being too popular, should we nerf horde racials?
---
Always quick to punish other people instead of searching for a better solution.
---
&gt;So I’ve read a whole lot of your words on what solutions are not feasible how about you tell us your new and improved honor system?
---
Before anything about the honor system specifically, the biggest mistake was releasing the honor system without BGs.  They should have come together.  I would push out BGs as soon as possible because until we see the impact BGs have on the world, any changes may be either unnecessary or disruptive.  If BGs do not stem the tide of groups going around destroying the world I would be willing to make changes.
---
All contested zones would get layered for &lt;60s and then 60s.  Anyone leveling in a zone is safe from level 60 gank squads.  If it gets too abused with people running 59s, you can lower the layer to an "accepted" level.  Joining a group with a 60 would take the lower level into the 60 layer to prevent people from trying to invade the lower layer for ganking/farming.  This wouldn't have an effect on helping friends who are sub 60 because if the gank squad is out to kill people, the sub 60 would die regardless of the layer.  The 60 going out and "inviting" them to the 60 layer wouldn't be any different from the status quo.  All it would do it provide a safety barrier for people to finish leveling.
---
I would apply greater guard protection around the settlements, similar to those which were added to horde during vanilla when Alliance greatly outnumbered them.
---
As for the honor system itself, I would have made two different types of systems.  A rated BG system for the top end gear, and an arena based honor system for the lower level stuff.  The Aerna system would use the DM/STV arena with a PVE zone around it.  Players killed in the area give honor.  Whenever the chest/DM mob spawn there is a chance for a piece of the blue pvp set or an honor token.  Factions could fight against faction, or they fight each other.  People would still be out in the world ganking, but the incentive would be gone.  Those people would also have something to do and somewhere to go do it.
---
Would players abuse it?  Of course they would, players are going to abuse anything they can.  The issue though is that having such a severe faction imbalance renders the concept of free world pvp straight to shit.  People CAN go out in the world and just gank the fuck out of people, but there wouldn't be an incentive.  I'm sure plenty of people would hate all of this.  But do they hate it more than the game exists now?
---
If you don't care about it, then leave?
---
You think "changes" will kill the game.  Blizzard have proven time and again throughout vanilla that they can and will implement "changes" based on player support, and a recognition of the problem.
---
Deserter Debuff:  Change.
---
Corrupted Blood patch:  Change.
---
In fact, I would invite you to go here:  [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759182169](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759182169)
---
And peruse just how many times "nochanges" was violated not because of incorrect mechanics, but because of player use of said mechanics producing unintended outcomes.
---
Tell ya what, how about you petition blizzard to never change the game from here on out, and I'll petition them to allow PvP&gt;PvE transfers early, and we'll see who wins.  Loser deletes their account.
---
you're never actually threatened by the opposing faction. it's just an optional game at that point. pve servers sound incredibly boring to me for that reason. I like looking over my shoulder while mining to make sure I am safe, etc.
---
Nah, Roommate was having a shitty day and went out for the night. As he was leaving, he said "If you get a call from me later, it's because I'm either in jail or the hospital." He called and I asked how Jail was and he said "Nope, other one." He got mugged walking to his car from the bar and when his wallet was empty, the mugger stabbed him. The knife missed all organs and after they patched him up and gave him pain killers, the hospital had him call someone to come get him.
---
And sometimes fire blast when you have to nuke.. I don't want to call myself wild but you know

Dont gamble up front
---
People on my server generally solo it (not full tribute, just the free skips) , see what they get contained in the chest, then sell those.
---
If you don't have a key someone will have to let you into the instance.  Then you just need to run to the tribute chest to loot it, as anyone can loot it (not just grp members at time of kill)
---
They gotta have something to gank.
---
You did this video? I found it a few days ago trying to find ways to get gold with my spriest and I have been applying your method ever since. Thank you! I had plenty of arcane crystals thanks to you.
---
You are taking a video game way too seriously.
---
Just did Gnomeregan with my friend who plays a mage and was having red latency bar. No issues whatsoever, he had to cast just that one spell all the time.
---
Interesting how the internet can radicalize people so easily, no wonder my parents tried to keep me off the web when I was young
---
Uuuh, yeah ? It's a MMORPG dude, the chat is literally one of the most important aspects of the game.  
---
Tonight, Kazzak was spawned on my server. The chat was so fucking laggy, it was near impossible to form groups correctly.  
---
I imagine it was the same for people trying to for 5-man groups and whatnot. If you can't understand how that's a problem I don't know what to tell you.
---
3 seconds of immune to melee *Every Engagement* mean on a cheap shot, you totally break their combo, warriors fail a whirlwind, MS, Cleave, etc.
---
Its absolutely worth it just for the immunity mechanic against melee.
---
Study group.
---
Idk about elixirs, I dont think you can purge them, but it's the same with pally mounts. When I mount up it says it's a Magic effect, but priests and shamans cant dispel/purge me off the mount. Doesnt work on ALL magic effects.
---
because blizz is soft just like you little charmin.
---
Honestly, you don't need anything.
---
You can get through the first door before the instance by dying and ressing on the other side, or getting someone to open it for you.
---
After you are inside the instance, you can just follow the path to the end of DM:N, the hunter would have cleared out all the necessary packs and you can stand in certain areas to drop aggro if you hit a patrol or make an accidental pull.
---
Keep going through the instance, there's a certain point where you will be in range of the tribute chest allowing the hunter to ML it to you. Otherwise he'll draw aggro and FD so that you can get past.
---
Source?
---
Feline
---
&gt;with balance the factions would be truely warring
---
Unfortunatly not. I come from grobvulus which is pretty much a 50/50 split and the alliance sub-60s are farmed day in and day out in and around brm same way you describe, and also at winterspring/everlook because all of our ally 60s are the same as your friend. Its either "its not a big problem" or "its not my problem". Infuriating, because ally wins almost every organized pvp fight on the server, but the overworld is nigh unplayable for ally sub 60s so we are having a lot quit the game or just switch to horde instead of ever reaching 60 on ally.
---
This is a really smart point. I’ve farmed hundreds of gold in herbs, using gatherer and a nap of the nods, and found one lotus ever.
---
Cancel your Cc stat
---
You can do it, it is hard to do at 46, but as a 58 you will have a massive margin of error, go for it.
---
I've come in 4th in dps on that fight with two daggers dpsing on my impale/prot warrior.  It's a weird fight with really unreliable meters.
---
Considering it has a 30 minute cooldown, if you don't botch it, you should be good.
---
I just flat out stopped playing my priest. It's an alt and I only leveld it for gathering and got it half pre-bis, but given my spec/gear there's just nothing I can really do against pretty much any class - especially the geared as fuck gankers roaming every zone. The open world is dead to this character.
---
As I’ve been saying, I rerolled on a medium PvE server and love it. This ain’t about you, it’s about the OP. He’s crying himself to sleep. He has the option to immediately stop that and start enjoying the game he loves. I’m sorry you want to argue core features of a 15 year old game, but again OP has options, as do most the people arguing in here. Everyone getting butthurt when someone doesn’t share their opinion, you people must be a joy IRL. “Sally doesn’t like my proposed project idea, she’s shitty!”
---
Yes, more attacks = more chances to crit = more vengeance up time. It also means you need to be careful in case it DOES proc immediately in a fight. You don't want to swap in Spell power gear as filler, it really only shines if you are fully geared, AoEing, or using an attack speed/Seal of Righteousness build. It is also incredibly fun when it procs and you get seal of command crits off of it. It does proc enough, I track mine with a WeakAura and was surprised how often it does seem to trigger.
---
taunt after the mindblast.
---
Dude boo fucking hoo, pvp on a pvp server??? WoAh who would’ve thought that would happen??
---
By whispering someone in the guild and asking if they can direct you to an officer or the GM.
---
[You mean like this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_gvby8Ypjw)
---
It's still griefing. There is a horde priest doing something similar when others try to get bendiction. 
---
Still bannable. Report link, the video, move on.
---
&gt; Some of these comments make me sad. Hard to believe so many people exist without the ability to empathize.
---
I think you're failing to empathize with the people who played on PVE servers and were constantly talked down to by PVP players who thought they were superior. This whole issue is exactly what PVE players were trying to avoid. Now PVP players are having to face it themselves. Why wouldn't PVE players laugh at that?
---
I think a huge part of the reason this happened is because they had 13 servers TOTAL on NA initially and too few on other regions as well. When you keep adding more and continue to fragment the population, of course immense faction imbalance is going to happen.
---
You *can* purge elixirs.
---
Boat PvP is hilarious.
---
Lmao.. The amount of times I see thorium point full of alliance or horde is about 50/50. It's an ebb and flo. People are too fucking soft these days.
---
Is it possible for a 58 to level to 60 instead of caring about farming 2 levels before cap?
---
How is finding groups for dungeons on anathema? I leveled a chat there to 20 and it was ok putting together a VC group, but Stormwind and Ironforge were ghost towns.
---
Shifting breaks roots
---
That's not a bug. It's been repeatedly happening for days and they haven't mentionned it.  
---
They are causing this, this is a decision they made. The servers are laggy because they don't want to put the money in to fix it, they know most people will play regardless.
---
My guild ran it last night and we are doing it again tonight on our normal Raid night.
---
Talk to guild leaders and don’t miss out on an entire lockout.
---
Oh lord there's nothing funny about horde having long queues. That just means they'll have more time to sit around camping flight paths between BGs. We'd be better off if we have instant queues and their queues are as long as possible without giving them enough time to fly to their preferred flight path to camp.
---
It took me 23 deaths to get into BRD as alliance on Fairbanks this Saturday.  The moment they open up paid xfers to PvE i am going to try and convince my guild and friends group to leave. I do not mind PvP at all, but what is happening was no where near what it was in Vanilla and is basically just griefing at this point.
---
The chances of this being legit are about the same as the chances of someone using the navy seal pasta as a genuine threat.
---
This is the case on server that have good population balance.
---
Didn't they implement cross server BG's towards the end of Vanilla to combat certain servers that would never get queue pops?  Is that when the battlegroups were formed?
---
I know, right?
---
I don’t understand leveling a paladin at all either.
---
Found some triggered Care Bears in here.  
---
I have been killed lots.  It blows my mind that you could let yourself get so triggered over something as silly as being killed in WoW.  
---
Take a breath.  Walk away.
---
That's very interesting.
---
I don't think an out of combat healer drinking to mana up registers on  the aggro table unless the healer has a dot on someone who enters combat, am I wrong?
---
&gt; the whole reason PvP is so popular is because of the feeling you get when you beat someone. that outplay feeling is fantastic and gives you so much reason to keep playing.
---
PVP has *nothing* to do with "outplaying" anyone. It's a matter of choosing the right class, the right faction, putting in the prerequisite hours of grinding, and then always traveling in a ball. There is no actual skill involved.

Lock used it twice and knocked off winter's chill mage raid lead was not amused.

This is hands down the Darwin comment of the day.  Have you taken a split second to try use some brain function and figure out why most people play horde on PVP realms, and most folks play alliance on PVE realms?

RACIALS.

Yes, and you're feeding them. Also you're whining. Have you tried playing the game instead of whining? Have you tried retail? I bet you'd whine less there, it's literally catered for people like you.

It's extremely obnoxious to scroll through if you're looking to buy 20. That's why they ramped up posting costs for crafting mats in BFA, now single stacks pretty much aren't a thing anymore.

Easy part: Offer faction specific transfer

Arguable part:  Change the realm to normal

Even more arguable part:  Change it back to pvp after it balances.

Nothing you said here was even right

This. Put the horde in queues.

A casual player doesn’t ask these types of questions...
---
You're doing the important part, observing the tanks who know wtf they're doing. Tanks don't have to lead, but often they are expected to. 
---
 So you now should know the general routes in instances.  Now it's time to learn how threat works, of which there are many guides.  Read em up.
---
Tldr:. Many of your abilities do extra threat.  if 1 pt of damage is a baseline of 1 threat, you have no hope of outdmging your dps to keep threat, so you need to use the bonus threat abilities to stay on top.   Revenge and sunder are available to all specs, shield slam too if you're prot.  Max rank revenge does very little damage but does like 1k threat or something nutty like that.  So hitting an enemy with a revenge may only do 50 dmg, but it allows each of your dps members to do 1k more damage.
---
Oversimplifying but I hope you get it.
---
Also take rend off your bar, don't use it for tanking, it's a pile of crap and waste of rage.
---
Have fun waiting 2 hours in BG queues at that rate.
---
How do you mean?
---
Dude, don’t lie.  You just like the way it shows off her rotten cleavage.
---
Spending 8 points in threat reduction is a major waste. Most people sit on 0/5 and 1-2/3 and have no issues. Fury Prot tanks shouldn't have threat issues if you're playing properly.
---
Unrelated to the drama but what interface add-on is OP using?
---
Again, I wasn't there. I don't know exactly how it went down. But given the drama and my awful experiences with members of Clothing Optional, I tend to believe that they were not acting in good faith in that situation and I choose to stay away from them.

Unfortunately my friend plays warlock and still hasn’t grasped the concept of “just cast shadowbolt” even at level 32.

He Multi-DOTS every mob regardless of how quick we can kill them. He’s always running out of mana every medium-sized fight and I have to heal his dumb ass while he life-taps down to no health. 
---
Thinking of rerolling to a non-healer so he has to deal with always being OOM and learn to cast shadowbolt
---
Ahh alright! Makes sense. Thought I saw some nightelves first

lol if you believe that

Jesus what a fucking asshole

But the target can still resist right?

The one time I ran it both the MH and OH drop at the same time and a very lucky hunter left happy xD

Roaming through a zone looking for alliance, find 4 guys, all being chased down by 20 guys. If you see a pally bubbled running, there will be an entire flock of vultures following them waiting to get 3 honor on that kill. Every alliance flight point we go to already has a horde group camping it. Alliance has a few larger groups, typically guild groups that roam in sizes of 10-15 or sometimes more, theyll clear out an area then horde will come get them and overwhelm them, alliance rez and port out. Horde dominate all areas that alliance doesnt have a coordinated raid in. Farming for honor as horde on whitemane feels like being an exterminator searching for cockroaches all the while fighting against every other exterminator.  As a warlock most of my pvp experience is running to get to someone as fast as possible to open up with shadowburn just to make sure to get the tag. Have been playing super seriously and hard, got standing 68 first week, standing 75 just this week. I hate this pre BG era just as much (well prob not as much) as alliance does. Its boring, frustrating, stupid, comical. This isnt pvp, its a scavenger hunt. Maybe a couple times per day my group has some actually even fights that are legitimately enjoyable and engaging,  otherwise its obliterating people and struggling to beat other horde to get a kill.
---
More like a boomer if you ask me.
---
He plays a Horde Rogue on a Horde dominant server. How else could he have the opinion that he does?
---
For warriors who want to tank what level did you go full protection and how did that work out?
---
At least you’re Horde - so leveling in P2 is much easier
---
As a horde member, I still appreciate the nautical pun.
---
For AP, the conversion is about 14 AP = 1 DPS.  So 34AP/14 = 2.43 DPS increase.  Strength/Agi can convert into AP as well depending on what class you are, it is just a matter of doing the math.  The +5 weapon enchant is worse the slower the weapon as it is a flat +5 dmg and not +5 dps.  +5 dmg on a 1sec weapon would be 5dps, but +5 dmg on a 5second weapon would be worth 1 dps.
---
As for sword/mace spec, it's not trivial, but it's not really important while leveling or for pvp.  The only time it will be a significant issue is if you are raiding.  In the case of raiding, yes you would largely want to stick to swords/maces.
---
I have walked away. to a different server. Now being on the other side of the beatings I wonder why even do it. It is not fun or efficient.
---
Found someone who can't read in here.
---
Tell me about anathema.... last I heard it’s 75% alliance
---
The fix is easy.  Only allow evenish numbers and allow faction transfers TO THE SAME SERVER.
---
Depends on your server I guess.
---
Sorry I paniced and was trying to figure if I leave the UI in or not and the camera position. This turned out best :(

Cyclopean Band

50 runs.  9 Banthok Sashes. Didn't have the leather gloves drop once.

20% drop rate it says in Atlas loot.

Gave up on it after wasting 3 nights of duoing arenas.

I almost considered buying the Underworld band until I saw the price.

I've always been a bit of a carebear, don't really care much about pvp.. but the two phases are light and day in comparison.
---
Phase 1: Basically was like a pve server, alliance and horde often minding their own business not too much action going on below 60. At 60 it was basically horde (dominant faction) camped BRM and alliance sat in major cities.
---
Phase 2: Suddenly the server feels way more balanced. BRM is usually still in Horde hands, but the paths to BRM, the FP in LHC, Everlook, are all regularly camped and patrolled by Alliance. I've accepted that running to Strat involves a minimum 2 deaths these days. Even though I don't go out of my way to PVP and don't particularly care about killing allies, suddenly the world feels much more dangerous. If I'm fishing I'm fishing with 3 totems down, if I have to AFK For a min i find a good freaking hiding spot, if I'm trying to maintain buffs I stick to horde packs, etc.
---
Phase 2 drew the AFKing alliance out of IF and forced them to start fighting back, and it's made the server that much better for it imo.
---
Opened the thread and noticed nobody complaining about Menethil boat campers even when they manage to wipe an entire Onyxia raid with 15 people. File that under non-lame pvp I suppose
---
I've been giving a lot of thought of thought to the type of content I'd like to see if the game goes in the Classic+ direction. I think items or sets like this, that interact elegantly with preexisting mechanics but add a lot of depth and potential to the game could be really cool. 
---
If you want to get really crazy, these are in the same vein: 
---

---
[Goblin Kodo Prod](https://imgur.com/a/usE5BcW)
---
Alliance on Heartseeker as well, this is about putting the majority faction on severely imbalanced servers in que, not hating on Horde specifically.
---
&gt;  or can you try to be adult enough to keep it civil from now on?
---
Hmm 
---
&gt;But I guess we can't expect too much from some small indie company
---
So either you are going to claim you have the maturity to understand the dev cycle, or you are going to parrot the tired old "smol indie company" meme.
---
I'm not apologizing for them, but I highly doubt they are just sitting on a number of fixes waiting for Aodhyn to bitch about it on reddit before they push it.
---
You claim to understand but make moronic comments about how they should have already had a fix done for this, as if this issue that only appeared in Classic since P2 was released was somehow a priority for their team.
---
Please.
---
Virtual...furries?
---
Dude I have seen both factions dominate certain areas for extended periods of time.. A picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth a hell of a lot more.
---
sure i guess but not the way op made it sound.  10 copper deposits on single stack cloth aren't sinking anyone.
---
I find it to be more like a zombie survival mode. 
---
The horde suck enough that it’s not really a threat, but running around is a minor inconvenience
---
What if you're just wrong?
---
TIL,thanks!

---
So apparently all wow classic redditors are oppressed Alliance on Horde dominated servers? Disgusting!1
---
This is actually a *very* nice solution: if there's 80-20 horde dominance, make so that there can't be at any time anything more than a 60-40 imbalance and put the others in hours long queue. Open free transfers and let those migrate to other servers to balance it out.
---
I really hope someone makes a thread about this solution and skyrockets to the top so blizz can see it.
---
She can also be seen with Elixir of Detect Lesser Invisibility, which is fairly cheap.
---
Yeah, mostly just the UC/Org zepp tho. It's very efficient because you get auto rezzed and 2 kills per trip.
---
Intent is another question, but I doubt anything will change regarding it. Just take the boat from Ratchet instead if you're horde.
---
Why are you bullshitting
---
Yeah, a streamer on my server is pretty notorious for camping the Menethil boat.
---
It's pretty funny, he'll stream for like an hour with 5-6 friends camping the boat and killing level 40's.
---
Then an Alliance raid heading to Ony camps him like 5-6 times and forces him to spirit res, hearth or corpse run and he starts screaming how unfair it is and how only noobs gank. It's pretty funny to watch.
---
Sauce?
---
Most people have abandoned hillsbrad. Ferelas is usually the hotspot atm.
---
Easy for a horde player to say.
---
Yes. Spririt of aquamentas from a high level quest. Other earlier options too
---
Yeah, the trick is to distance your pet from yourself at the start of the duel so the rogue has to choose.
---
Yeah, if the judgement is resisted, this would be resisted. It would be one effect.
---
sub rogues with preparation is basically a guaranteed win vs frost mages too
---
What do you expect from a bunch of men who have been raised to think that emotions are stupid.
---
&gt;. After the tribute is done, all of the mobs are friendly. Then you can just go straight to the end and loot the chest.
---
This is not true.
---
The mobs are only friendly if you have the King Buff, and that's acquired at the end of the run.
---
Why ask it here then?  Do you think there aren't Alliance on ArcaniteReaper mobbing and corpse camping Horde?  You'll get a more reliable answer by finding someone actively doing it and asking them I'll bet.
---
I'm on a PvE server now, but from what I remember in the old days of vanilla there were various reasons why people HK farmed.  Some run around with the zerg but not in a group and burst all their abilities on someone to get most of the honor with practically no risk because their target is busy trying to escape.  Some don't understand how honor even works and assume more kills = good.  Some don't even care about the honor system and just like the visceral thrill of being the bully for a change in their life.  Some people want revenge on all Alliance because someone managed to kill/camp their alt and they're on a rampage with friends.  The reasons are numerous and some are more valid than others.
---
I wanted to go Horde because I was an alliance Paladin in vanilla.  I wanted to try the other side, but the people I played with wanted to be Alliance so here I am.
---
Ok horde....nice try
---
&gt; There's got to be something that can be done to limit the "my pvp experience is bad" posts flooding this sub
---
There shouldn't be a limit. That's what the game *is*.
---
Ohhh, I think I get it.
---
If you have a low bid price, your auction will appear closer to the top of the list when sorted by cost, regardless of what your buyout price is.
---
The strategy might be that the "rock-bottom bid, normal buyout" gets your auctions seen more frequently, resulting in more frequent sales. Some people may have run the numbers and determined that the sunk cost of cancelling the auctions of those that choose to bid rather than buyout is worth the higher frequency of buyout sales.
---
would be more accurate if it was 5 undeads
---
Currently an impale/prot gnome warrior tank.  I have prebis gear for tanking plus some MC upgrades with the axe from ony as my mainhand(trying to get a good dagger still)
---
I'm a tank,however I seems to spend half my raid just dpsing, mostly swapping to tank for boss OTing and Baron as I have high fire resist.
---
I'm tempted to go fury/prot and try it out, although the lack of tac mastery seems annoying. This way at least I can swap roles better.
---
At what point does 1h/shield flurry/enrage/bloodthirst outthreat shield slam/1h spec?  The raid I'm in is still progressing and is no where close to the top of threat meters so DW isn't viable.
---
remember tho, #NOCHANGES. Not realising that layering with zone pop balance for contested zones would be less of a change than the massive faction disparity and just relentless gank squads are from the original game. kek
---
Can't do openworld content due to the sheer number of Horde.
---
Can't do group group content due to a current 15 minute chat delay.
---
\- Playing Alliance on Firemaw.
---
People complaining about this are what fucked vanilla up to begin with, making guards stronger and discouraging world PVP. Go to a PVE server.
---
What are you planning on doing once all the alliance quit?
---
Not into watching gnomes fap.
---
In pvp you are right to an extent. There is a point where time invested outweighs skill in classic though. 
---
The arena system had the opposite ratio. That's partially why people who invested a lot of time but were not skilled did not like it. Arena did not reward time. Opposite of most things in WoW.
---
How is it not worth it? You just cc the warlock again with blind/vanish sap/rocket helm/a million other cc's and then kill the pet again. The warlock is now out of a cooldown and out some mana. The rogue is free to open on the lock or reset the fight minus the fel domination.
---
Where is elsewhere? Again, if you’re forcing horde to go pve just say that from the get go
---
Said it before and I'll say it again. You signed up on a PVP server, this was always a possibility. I say this as a horde that transferred to Heartseeker from Stalagg. I abandoned a level 55 and rolled on a PVE server and have been enjoying it since. 
---
Yes you have plenty of time invested in that character but no one is stopping you from switching.
---
dont like it, fix it?
---
This is subjective as fuck but imo Human is the only one that doesn’t look like a complete idiot fighting. Night Elves look lanky and clunky fighting and Dwarves always look like they’re about topple over. Humans have simple, straightforward and practical fighting animations and the plate gear looks like it was specifically modeled for their build.
---
Neither is wasting time on trying to troll for linen cloth. Try doing this on any relevant farmed items at 60.
---
Yes, we 100% know it ends with bgs.
---
The game released the honor system which rewards players for gaining honor.  Right now the way to get honor is to go around ganking everyone.  This caused the 50+ zones to be full of gank squads 
---
Once you open the BGs, the honor gained from battlegrounds is much greater than the gank squads meta in place right now.  Plus the BGs have rep items players will want.
---
This will get lost but this is one of my favorite mechanics in wow classic. Classic is Rock Paper Scissors. Assuming gear is all even as well as skill, mages should be warriors, warriors should beat rogues and rogues should beat mages. Outliers being warlocks, priests, hunters, Druid’s, shamans and paladins. Among those, it really depends on your spec and how you play that spec.  
---
TLDR: some classes do better against other classes. Just part of the game.
---
Do a cast sequence macro so it just swaps between them.
---
Again your assuming I’m grieving when the boat is full of 60’s pvping.    It’s there choice to do so.  Maybe they would of liked a different outcome then getting their ass rolled but then again they agreed to roll on pvp server along with me.    Dieing from pvp that someone participated in is not griefing.   It just makes it sound like bitching to bitch.    Maybe if players can’t handle getting rolled then they themselves should not partake in pvp nor  roll on a pvp server.    Maybe shoots and ladders is more on their level.    Furthermore they should not play a MMO when other players have a direct effect of other players playing.    Maybe people should cry on in game tickets rather then come to Reddit.    It’s a 15 year old game nothing is new not even these bitching posts.    Should of seen north dale Reddit and the pvp on that server.    Classic is nothing compared to that.
---
This is why I stick with retail and live vicariously through you guys. I just don't have the irl time or patience to put up with that amymorw

So retails system?
---
lol no.
---
It sounds like you have some difficulties understanding the point of the discussion so I will attempt to make it very simple for you:
---
1. Classic is run by a skeleton crew, and it really shows.
---
2. Blizzard can afford to have Classic not be run by a skeleton crew.
---
The boat pvp originates when horde goes to it. Ally doesn't sit around waiting for a horde raid to get on. And during that whole time you're not allowing the lowbies access to the boat.
---
Classic forums are new. You must be confusing them with vanilla.
---
Mate u havin a laff?!
---
What makes classic so good is the time sink it takes to get to these things and knowing the person who has it worked their ass off. I think an arena system should be implemented somewhere down the line but the fact of the matter is most people complaining are mad they don’t have time to put into ranking. Like, what did you think was going to happen when you subbed for classic?
---
I'm alliance and minithil to thera, minithil to auberdine, and booty bay to ratchet are all camped. I have to res like 7 times to actually get to a FP on the other side.

Beautiful! Now how do pay you money for a poster size print?! :)

When BGs come out, Enhance will be literally hated and shamed out of BGs because its all premade players who don't want to go anywhere near an enhance shaman.
---
Yea honestly I wouldnt blame you for rolling since the guy was lvl 58 anyways not like hes been grinding long. But your justification that you might use that for your third off spec one day is just garbage.
---
Nobody is upset about world PvP, what people are upset about is that they can't even play the game because people camp instance portal because they are desperate for honor.
---
Did you even see the video?  There easily 200 Horde between Thorium Point and BRD.
---
When I get home I'm going to use my wife's account to PM myself something silly and quirky and then upload it onto Reddit for karma.
---
&gt;No, queue's were not the cause
---
What was the cause current servers aren't 3.5k max pop then? I definitely don't want to stand 6h queue and I stood them at the release with 15k people max or so.
---
It's unbelievably dumb - if you see someone tame it you keep quiet, mark the time and then have a knowledge (within 1h) when he's next in the zone.
---
Lmao of course he’s in dbc. You’re right talking to cephei won’t do anything, they don’t care at all which is why it’s the guild all the toxic players end up in. At least they’re living up to their reputation.
---
What is retails system? Did they do away with PvP servers?
---
How do I downvote twice
---
Except I was left with the gold I had the day I was hacked as well.
---
LOL alliance players have been complaining about this for two weeks and are told to shut up and enjoy pvp servers. nearly half the playerbase is having this issue.
---
same exact experience for alliance on stalagg. join the club
---
I'm at the point where I'm just raid logging because it's such a bummer to play the game. Faction queues are the only game that will survive. Like what is the hordes plan once everyone either rerolls or just quits.
---
Cross-faction /duel is a thing, as long as the other player is not flagged for PvP.
---
maybe it's time for you to go back to ff14 or read more manga and watch more anime, where you belong you brigading literal who who'll quit before clearing AQ even once
---
Well can't say I disagree with you on those points.  Touche
---
I don't want this system.   But they are not going to invest in the customer service required to fix the current pvp servers.   All servers designated as PVP need to be flagged as PVE with free transfers enabled to new PVP servers.  Then consolidate the old servers.  They screwed the pooch.
---
aww haha id recommend him to just wand after putting a few corruption dots on mobs for nightfall procs in dungeons for mobs :) way less mana!! I’m always nervous to life tap bc I don’t wanna scare the healer haha
---
But there is no guarantee it will drop 3 weeks in a row. If warlock a or b think it will drop often then they can pass to whoever wants it and pick it up for free later. You are basically arguing against all loot systems here.
---
Shut the fuck up mud hutter.
---
You chose horde because you uave the same mental acuity as the retailers.
---
Force the horde to flip to alliance with faction specific queues, dont like it? Fuck off to another server.
---
5g each REEEE

Server Grobbulus? He’s a priest in my guild I believe

I agree- alliance player here
---
As a mage, i'm continuously impressed by how good other mages are. At this point i'm expecting to see "MAGE SOLOS RAID BOSS"
---
They are but clowns tripping over their own shoes to see who can honk the loudest.
---
k.
---
Glad we are able to agree. Have a nice day.
---
Fuck out of here with this casual ass bullshit. Learn how to research your fucking server choice and stop trying to blanket penalize all of the player base for your god awful decision making. 
---
If you are playing WoW and end up on a dead or imbalanced server it’s your fault and your fault alone. This isn’t some brand new game. It’s been like this since it’s inception 15 years ago.
---
I'll assume you are a warrior, but what level?
---
90% of tanking is leadership and dungeon knowledge.  Knowing the pulls,which mobs to focus, boss mechanics is huge.  Make a skull macro and bind it to a key also, make people focus it down, use it on dangerous mobs.
---
But, don't worry or be afraid to fail.   Tanks are always in demand for dungeons and just tell people you haven't tanked a dungeon and someone will be happy to help, if anything because they don't want to spend an hour trying to replace you.
---
In a game like wow, raw numbers play a huge role.
---
I would think 3/2, 6/4, or even 12/8 are WINNABLE for the losing faction.
---
But 600/400 is totally unwinnable if you ask me.
---
Warrior is up next, hunter will come some day
---
&gt; how many weeks of "half our raid is in queue for 4 hours" before they transfer, as a guild, to somewhere with no queues?
---
Honestly, 2 weeks of it and I'd just quit.
---
If the only solution Blizzard can find to balance servers is to prevent paying customers from playing the game, this man will stop being a paying customer.
---
We have the problem on our server and Horde outnumbers alliance by about 10-12%. The problem is that all the horde are busy raiding and less are pvping than alliance. What realm is this?
---
Yea grob, fellow guildie.
---
I've been stuck in STVietnam since P2 dropped. Alliance routinely siege and take over Grom'gol for hours at a time.
---
Not saying is as bad as it is for Alliance on horribly balanced servers, but it's no walk in the park, either.
---
Gaming companys need to focus on their product and ignore the internet. It's just for venting
---
It's not about fin its about ranks
---
We didn't.
---
Can you try resetting the instance when you first start and are both inside. A lot of people dont know this but if the party leader is outside of an instance and resets the dungeon the instance is actually reset. The people inside the dungeon will get a message along the lines of: your party leader has tried resetting the instance blah blah... so now when you leave the instance and re enter it, it will be reset. I'm curious if you had an alt account or a guildie do this for you with you both inside the instance if that will start the first timer earlier.
---
Definitely Shrek and Donkey.
---
generalizing it doesn't make it less bad tho
---
i mean... they wouldn't be a well played gnome warrior then if they lost.  having a fap and using cds like reck means the warrior should win unless the mage is better than them.
---
Not particularly.  I'm gambling.  You don't gamble?  It's fun; you should try it.
---
What I am taking seriously is your visceral enjoyment of other people's pain, real or virtual.  
---
I'm not a fan of red flag laws, but you're helping me to understand why they exist.
---
The thing with 60/40 is that the 40% are slowly going to quit quicker than the 60% because most fights aren't going to be in their favour. So in a month it might turn into 65/35 or even worse.
---
It takes a dedicated person to grief a fellow hunter AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE. That's one more hunter looking to tame BT over you, nice job shit-nugget.
---
I'm flattered you'd look through my posting history for dirt. I apologize for how boring it must have been.
---
Other than lower level instances like LBRS/DM:W, there are plenty of high level areas that aren't swamped with the opposing faction, try find spots that aren't:
---
- Close to an opposing factions' FP   
---
- Close to an instance entrance (e.g. Scholo/Strath)  
---
- Close to a major road the opposing faction takes to reach important areas  
---
- Close to an opposing faction's quest giver 
---
I've found some random spots like Hearthglen can be farmed for hours without anyone popping by other than to do the quest. 
---
If the above still doesn't work, go to Silithus. It's completely empty on my server except for people farming the rock elementals in one corner.
---
It turns out fapping was the answer all along
---
Depending on the cloth you're selling it could be more valuable to turn them into bandages and vendor. Mageweave and silk are examples. Mageweave vendors for 2.5s, auctions for 4.25s, bandages sell for 4s. Auction cut, posting fee and time wasted means you lose money on the auction house. Note this is only true for regular (non heavy) bandages.
---
then we will kill all your battlemasters and drag you back :)
---
Dots are way more mana efficient than shadowbolt.  They don't have to tick to the end to be worth it, not even close.  Corruption is only 18 seconds long, if it ticks about half way it was still worth casting, it can be cast earlier and not pull threat so you might as well eat the 1 second cooldown before you cast a bolt, crit, and pull aggro. 
---
Multi-dotting *everything* might cause threat issues.  
---
It's almost always worth dotting the elites, especially before you are geared to the hilt on spellpower and running with a bunch of geared players.
---
We all watched the video of the low-level hunter being there first.
---
Your hunter dude's just being a dick here.
---
Log out in dungeons or wait till BGs come out honestly. BGs aren’t far away at all
---
Not a single reason not to have dual spec.
---
There's a lot of little QOL stuff that was added later that should absolutely be in the game.
---
Not really. They are still the worst nightfall class too . Their uptime is shit. Rather have them healing in enhance spec than barely proccing NF.
---
Thats cool, what you wrote still doesnt mean that.
---
You can't measure how well you are at PvP by getting ganked at a disadvantage. If you really wanna know fight similar gear/level players in duels.
---
Same. Did MC on Sunday with about 17min delay.
---
It’s a different community. Getting ganked by someone 10 levels above you while fighting 2 mobs doesn’t mean you’re bad. It’s just the reality of playing on a pvp server in a 15 year old game.
---
Death coil is a pretty big crutch for locks, I wouldn't feel too bad although i'm sure there's room for improvement without it.
---
oh no, NPC's in EPL.
---
Bruhs, I'm long gone....I'm on a dead server loving it!
---
This guy on the internet offered his two cents in a harmless fashion...  
---
So anyway, I started blasting.
---
Nope, they're bind-on-use. You get the prompt the first time you try to summon it, much like when you equip a piece of raid gear.
---
Idk if you’re being sarcastic, but WPvP is largely about inter-class counters, gear, and who punches first, in that order, before it’s about skill
---
That really isn’t possible. A well played warrior with a FAP can beta an average mage just fine. It’s the good mages that they’ll have trouble with.
---
If this was even remotely true the server would be 100% alliance and since horde LITERALLY cannot play.
---
Of course you will be awful at level 49. You have no shot unless you’re level 60. But yes it takes some practice to compete in pvp. A lot of people played private servers for years and it’s showing in classic
---
The problem is the FIRST set of transfers, where we lost 50%+ of our Alliance, were not faction locked.
---
They were imbalanced already so the only people who ended up leaving were Alliance, making the problem even worse.
---
Someone who raids probably plays more than someone still leveling.
---
If you want to do well in world PvP while leveling/farming you have to be very careful with each mob pull. Always make sure the coast is clear first, as many gankers will only engage you when they are completely certain you can't fight back.
---
Yeah, people are dicks.
---
PvP is alive on PvE servers.
---
You can literally type /pvp, and then you're flagged for world pvp, and can look for other flagged people to fight.
---
LMAO best comment of the day :D Just do the same thing over and over and you'll be a pro in no time!
---
Blizzard wants to run less servers to save cost.   They slightly increased capacity for concurrent players on some select servers but well before any of that they had announced that classic servers would have increased capacity compared to vanilla.   Servers are just better now than they were 15 years ago so they can handle more.
---
Yea but it’s like I’m just gonna scroll through and find the cheapest. I don’t care if yours is at the top. It’s not like there’s thousands of pages. Probably just 2 pages to click through and a quick view of the price. I think it’s a strategy that isn’t thought out well
---
Yep, looks like big servers are hit a bit harder in terms of chat delay.
---
Rogue! I dwell in BRM and Thorium Point.
---
which is fine if the Q is 20 mins+ long, you're still talking 15 minutes+ of farming zones before the next BG. People are min maxing the shit out of the game on some realms, this will definitely happen
---
It is the best. For pvp and solo pve the amount of blackout procs you trigger is game changing. It even works on casters I can't count the amount of 1v1 Iv won procing a stun just as a mage is about to unload or stunning a rogue as he opens on me causing SW:P to tick away and finish him off
---
Nothing is more intimidating than that little female gnome warrior with pink hair that is decked out In epics destroying your face in AB.
---
The TSM bandits thank you for your sacrifice.
---
I was talking specifically about setting the starting bid to 1 copper.
---
a a absolutely aint an anything balanced be but can charge classes crit dead decent dispel easy else fap got have healer help hs if in intercept interrupt is it its more ms much not other perfectly pretty provided rage rpg same serker so stance supposed sure than the them there they to to truck warriors with wow you
---
^^^^downvote ^^^^to ^^^^delete
---
There's no reason to go anything but plain old DW Fury in your situation. Prot is not at all necessary for an OT role.
---
I guess in my mind 2 SS’s is more damage than a cheap shot, then I will either get the third SS and Slice and dice. If I feel threatened I will open with cheap shot but it seems like if I want the mob down faster 2 sinister strikes is the way to go
---
The fact that there's been no official acknowledgment of this issue - further goes to show how Blizzard really couldn't care less about EU realms.
---
Hey this was the idea I posted yesterday
---
Increased customer support costs decrease profitability.   Decreased subscriber counts decrease profitability.   
---
What is a better business process that you would use to stop your customer base from shrinking and to keep your support costs low?
---
Pretty sure they got sued for copyright infringement.
---
&gt;Addons utilizing the chat are also completely broken.
---
Addons utilizing the chat is most likely the root cause for these issues
---
Problem is that gun blows for the mats required. Results in low buying pressure.
---
I try to help the imbalance by being so utterly shit at PVP that I give the outnumbered horde an easy HK.
---
I get what your saying but it's no where near as bad as you or everyone else is making it but I do understand. I'm on arugal which initially the 3rd worst balanced server and the wpvp is just insane to simply put it. no where is safe, every boat, every fp, every town and even main cities are riddled with rogues and I fucken love it. taking this into account me and my friends had to completely change our approach to the game and adapt to which has let us take advantage of this situation more than the horde could ever do with their massive population imbalance. I would argue we have it better off for it, the horde now have control of most of the zones so their market will inflate creating instability. we can grind and up rank easier due to more access to honor kills. all allience need to do as adapt to the change in rules, all that content wasn't promised to you the horde allowed you access to it. just remember the death of wpvp was blizzard's response to fixing this very issue in retail, now people are literally in their very own world. thanks for your detailed reply, at most we can agree to disagree.
---
Nice logic there bucko, yeah damn those alliance for not staying on a worse ratio server than the one where they’d be staying.horde logic at its best right there
---
Are there some reasonably balanced PvE servers that I can roll on? I'm looking for balance mainly for finding dungeon groups as I go.
---
Got into a good groove doing DM:E jump runs with a basic 3 man comp:
---
* Me the tank, reserves all the Thorium veins
---
* Healer reserves all the herbs
---
* Melee/caster dps for pre-bis Bow or Neck
---
* Greed rolls for everything else except BOE epics, all need on those
---
Last night just happened to be a dud in terms of mining, only got 1 Blue Sapphire out of ~12-13 runs. But the company was good, met a bunch of cool people and my healer stuck around the whole time and was hilarious.
---
Second-to-last run, and Forer's drops. We all agree to split 4 ways and I end up just paying everyone else for the book. My epic mount can wait!
---
Throwing shade at anyone and insulting someone isn't offering two cents in a harmless fashion. Had to make a post about gnomes standing on a wall about someone he dislikes, and had to make it clear. But maybe thats just how i see it
---
I didn't specify the amount of mana added and didn't specify the amount of casts added because I don't know what rank. It was kept simple. 1 downranked spell if we're being pedantic. Obviously gaining 1 extra cast would be pointless.
---
There will be plenty for you. Our guild just created another guild for swathes of first time players and slow levelers in their 40s wanting you raid but don’t have a ton of time to commit. Yeah they’ll likely be downing Rag when we down Nef, but for them, that’s what they can fit in and will still be making progress. We’ll all have alts raiding with them likely to fill in slots etc. 
---
I wouldn’t be too put off by being behind the curve, as everyone’s is different.
---
Nope
---
Is it sad that i consider Enhancement more of a tank spec than a pvp /or dps spec?   
---
Elemental = pvp  
---
Enhancement = (badish) tanking (mostly as an off tank that buffs)  
---
Resto = healing (great healing)  
---
I really want to see more tanking shaman, I'd love to have some off tanking mobs in MC with me.
---
All the spellcleavers are 60 and raidlogging already.
---
Community: No changes
---
Blizzard: *changes max server capacity to be many times higher*
---
Community: I want to change servers.
---
Blizzard: Can't do that. It's not a pure classic experience then.
---
Community: Transfers were in vanilla.
---
Blizzard: Ok, pay up
---
Forsaken are not considered undead
---
As a druid, a good warlock with a felhunter is the hardest matchup.
---
A good priest is probably the second hardest
---
While the easiest matchups are mages (especially frost mages) warriors, and hunters.
---
Undead players are for all purposes humanoids.
---
IIRC, shackle and fear undead ***originally*** worked against them, but this was changed in a very early patch.
---
Undead vs. Forsaken.
---
Retail doesn't suck because of QOL changes, it sucks because over the years they lost everyone who played for content, and retained people who only play for the mechanics.
---
In a world
---
I never Fear warriors and essentially never lose to them as a Lock unless they pop Reck. Warriors just die too fast.
---
Yeah correct. 80g
---
Idk as the third party who doesn't really care either way you seemed to be the antagonist here.
---
Oily Blackmouth stacks dropped to 1g 
---
Feels bad man
---
I'm alliance on whitemane and it honestly feels like that. Horde dominates and controls alliance contested zone FPs, our boat between menithil and theramore, and slowly but surely IF (on average there's about 10 horde killing tagged players in IF). We can't go anywhere without, as you said, being hunted down like cockroaches.
---
Nah. Only 3 packs in the entire instance (and the minibosses) will still aggro. Everything else is red but un-attackable. They can’t attack you, and you can’t attack them.
---

Binds when used
---
I think i know who this is now. If I'm right - keep trolling scrub.
---
that's amazing.
---
Well lets be honest EVE is a game populated, run by, and made for assholes...the rest of us are just at their mercy. At least that's my memory of it.
---
So punish the dominant faction on said server? I don't think this is it, chief.
---
You can easily full heal with a bandage faster than a healer can top up with a drink. All you are doing is excusing your own laziness/selfishness here.
---
I have had the same problem whilst deciding to level a mage. 
---
Mid way through an aoe pull and another mage purposely runs through my aoe with a pack of full hop mobs to grief because they have someone else in the area, which obviously completely screws my pull :(
---
If anyone sees this player in game please make his life harder. OP should post server and name along with name of guild.
---
Sure, we don't *have* to. But we're going to. Being alone is not a magic shield. You're alone, in the wild, in a hostile world.
---
If you're going to quest alone you need to have awareness and be watching over your shoulder a lot, since there's no one to watch your back for you.
---
Hots that are put before the pull generate thread for them not the healer.    
---
That's why you can cast a hot on your tank, step back, watch them fight and drink 5s later anyways since you're still out of combat.   
---
It's actually quite nice support/assurance when going around with bad or lower level tanks.
---
Then they saw what pallys could do to undead lol.
---
Evian fdp.
---
&gt; Literally everywhere at peak hours
---
Not just peak hours. There's people everywhere ALL the time. I've seen people camping the Menethil boat at 4 am in the morning. Parties of 5-10 ganking in front of BRM at 2 am. You could wall jump into Hyjal and there'd still be someone there waiting to gank you.
---
I would bubble hs also @ 3v1 :p
---
What actions will break invisibility / cloaking device? If you start hearthing, or cast a spell, does it break immediately or only when you finish casting?
---
People RP in general chat?
---
they're doing the right thing for sure
---
Played Horde for most of ten years because I prefer the story and aesthetics. Considering that Classic is so time-intensive it’d be very unlikely for us to have more than one decently progressed character each, my friends and I knew Horde was the only choice.
---
His ass.
---
This is the nature of the game, but people are too eager to be outraged and complain. Surprised they're not boycotting Bliz already.
---
so those horde groups of 20+ players running to and from Thorium Point and Blackrock Mountain are just there for the sake of killing Alliance who happen to be in their level range for Honor Points?
---
It’s not about what we want, it’s about what they don’t want.   If we have to take a hit in world pvp to laugh because their queues are 2 hours, so be it.
---
I thought this til I rolled a druid on alliance cause thats where my friends went. Old buddy is moving in to be a room mate that plays horde and I realize I missed my shaman that damn bad. Still dunno how much im going to enjoy end game pvp cause Im on a normal server but it makes questing more enjoyable.
---
such a rare and magnificent sight
---
What I dont understand is when I log in after work and stroll through IF I see all these high rankers (top 20) fellating each other on the IF AH/bank bridge.
---
How do they have time to sit around publicly jerking each other off if this grind is so tedious and horrid?
---
If they focused on their product they wouldn't need to read the internet much. Sadly they didn't/don't, and the internet venting at them gives them a little bit of warning before everyone just quits.
---
A little more info about this guild, they *were* led by an alt-right extremist who got banned after doing an in-game depiction of the KKK and got called out by US congressman on Twitter, after posting the picture. That person was also one of the first on the server to get hand of rag. Lol
---
you cant cast anything while mind controlling someone... curious story then
---
Yeah it works perfectly fine in instances, you do more dmg than blizz alternative, like 500-1k dps more, if ur afraid someones gonna break nova, just do coc which still will do much more dmg than blizz. Ive played shatter coc build throughout my pre bis grind and the only real issue is that its more risky in terms of dmg taken. If your skilled, you can still manage this and with pre-bis healer or tank gear your absolutely fine.
---
which is strange because that means more competition on fewer resources
---
Araxom has left the building sadly 
---
If you do read the tag tho, hi Araxom we miss you
---
Agreed, if you showed this video to 99% of players they would agree they would not want someone like that on the server they play on.
---
&gt;get summoned and keep the bubble, go on a rampage
---
&gt;go attack people of the opposite faction with the bubble on (makes casters forced to run away vs melee or probably die, gives priests free shadow bombs, all other classes guaranteed initiation)
---
Both of these are pretty bad even if you make the bubble disappear in combat/make you unable to hit until removed. Paladin bubble is super broken
---
Can't wait for BG's so I can hear about people complaining about people having better gear. Maybe they'll implement full welfare PvP gear again, and class specific legendary weapons. So it will be "fair."
---
ToO mAnY HoRDe BlIzZarD FiX It
---
Because no changes is a myth, like Classic+ and the Easter Bunny.
---
For some reason people don't realize Shield Bash is a core tanking ability. It generates more threat per rage than Sunder. If you're rage limited you should use it on cooldown.
---
I'm sure some people are going to quit the game if something isn't done about it, which is why Blizzard is releasing BGs months before they intended to.
---
Terrible in organized BG's. Get's dispelled almost instantly.
---
You can spam rank 1 shadowguard and if they try to keep up dispelling it, they'll oom. If they don't, stun spam.
---
what? On my server they go for like 80s, while 1 oil is close to 60-80s... people on my server are dumb AF! I thought I could make big money with fap potions, but nah idiots rule the market!
---
charge them, use fop during the charge, enter bersi stance and make sure you always have enough rage to interrupt them if they cast sheep. If they blink have your (thorium)grenade ready to interrupt the cast or intercept. If you get sheeped you loose anyways.
---
Smh. Why are you in classic sub anyway? I thought it was bad.
---
If they aren't attacking skull and it's causing issues: Let them die. Let them die every single time they don't attack skull. Save your healer. Dps are expendable.
---
Am I the only one that thinks fighting a Mage as a Warrior is cake mode compared to fighting a good Warlock? Yet I never see Warriors complaining about locks...
---
That's not correct. If you, the healer, apply the HoT  each tick will cause you, the healer, to generate threat. As soon as a HoT tick takes place once the tank is in combat you will also be taken into combat.
---
Yeah prepared SL lock should beat SPriest pretty consistently given the right strat (CoS &gt; kite/CC while purging and mitigating damage &gt; CoA once their buffs are down &gt; run oom or just kill). Run 2 ranks of spellstone and insta remove silences and all DoTs at the same time.
---
I was really hoping that buzzard attacked you while you were logging off for extra drama. Grats!
---
That's true. At smaller numbers, individual skill is more likely to play a factor. But when you're looking at massed battles, skill only can take you so far. If we pit 3 horde raid groups against 2 alliance raid groups, your individual play cannot possibly compensate for another entire raid group.
---
I'd prefer to be able to play the entire game, not just BGs. Maybe that's just me though?
---
srsly? they're still 70-80s on our server.
---
You know you can still use flamestrike and CoC without shatter, and you wont get much use of the shatters compared to the other talents you can get instead.
---
Oh def. On pvp server it can get annoying but when it’s not peak hours you’re absolute right; those farms are great.
---
Peter Thiel is the real genius, Elon is just a charismatic smokescreen
---
Well man I got both in 2 runs and didnt even want them bc I have perditions blade + gutgore.
---
Guess I can go to a few pug onys with them and try for a viskags while hiding my daggers!
---
Well, if they're all taking a break, it's fine right
---
As much as I hate seeing such horrible faction imbalance (at least Incendius doesn't seem TOOOO bad. I've seen a surprising amount of back and forth between ally and horde open world raids), I can't help but feel like this will be the subject of some study down the line, much like the gurubashi plague (which, please blizz, let us do again for an event or something... just like 3 days of letting that bug be a thing fro a good laugh... )
---
...Actually. Wait.
---
We need the plague back.
---
I've got a Geneva convention to break.
---
Rogues are countered by Ret and Prot paladins
---
Paladins are countered by any ranged (warlock are a maybe since I can despell all but 1 dot)
---
This was almost identical to our BRD group last night!!! We did a full Emp/Princess run, but somehow it managed to take longer for all 5 of us to make it inside BRD, than it did to nearly full-clear the dungeon. Rattlegore server as Alliance:(
---
Exactly. 65/35 is "only" a 5% population swing, but now people are outnumbered 2:1. That gets rough fast.
---
Yes, the wake up call is true - but I thought maybe it's because of the gear. The scaling thing makes sense..
---
Shaman
---
Think I can manage this at 58 as a daggers rogue?
---
5g is way too small. No permanence to that at all.
---
Transfers not available to Alliance tho
---
You don't need to be fury if you can stance dance with tactical mastery.
---
Grats
---
Which really shouldn't have been a thing, if you put a low minimum bid you should be locked in if it was bid on.
---
You can play the entire game, everyone just has to wait longer.  Instead of the dominant faction making the entire game unplayable for the weaker faction, each side has a portion of the game that they have to spend longer to enjoy.
---
at least u HAVE gromgol lol
---
I will forever and always be a Shaman main. Little choice in the matter.
---
Well I'm only speaking for the situation detailed in the OP, which is pugging dungeons, which fury-prot struggles with anyway since they're rage starved, so yeah the threat reduction allows you to coast through dungeons. Raids allow for a totally different build. But I raid Disc and do pve shadow in between so it's easy for me to justify changing my talents all the time.
---
Plus the 5/5 points in disc are otherwise spent in other non-mandatory talents anyway (imp fort, imp bubble), so the loss of those talents isnt a big deal.
---
 ToO mAnY ~~HoRDe~~ aLlIANcE BlIzZarD FiX It 
---
fixed for my server.
---
iTs NoT a SyMbOl oF hAtE
---
It added a lot of inconsistency for pvp.  Could shackle/fear undead them, but poly didnt work and... I think normal fear didn't work? (since you cant fear undead mobs)  I'd have to look it up to see what all it was though.
---
I joined a group, and immediately after a guild group was starting for that same instance. I said “hey, my guildies are starting up a run. Would y’all be annoyed or upset if i left?” 
---
They all said no, and agree guild &gt; pug. They may have been annoyed and just not saying anything. but I asked, they agreed, and I didn’t just leave unannounced or without reason. So no drama, no hard feelings, and all was well. All it takes is a quick message. Even if I was the one being kicked, a simple “hey, a guildie just got on and can tank. You okay if we take him? Sorry about your time wasted :(“. Though shitty, that would still be leagues better than just kicking.
---
He thinks he is better because he hit 60 3 weeks in and raid logs now a days.
---
apparently when the guild master asked the guy what i was talking about, he told him to stfu as well
---
Yea, paid 250 for mine a couple weeks ago

"fuck u for telling me how to play the game, i like pvp and I'm not a pussy, pve is for carebears but this isn't pvp"

*-every whiny Ally on Reddit*
---
If BG's come with a queue, what will happen is people will queue for AV/WSG, then get summoned to a chokepoint thereby continuing what they were doing before.  Then they'll get ported to their BG, and when they finish, IIRC, they'll wind up right back where they ported out from.
---
So it'll be a camping chokepoints&gt;Phase Out&gt;BG Over&gt;Phase in to camping checkpoints.
---
The only way I think it can be shored up with the server populations as they are is by only having the "masters" in major cities, and forcing the player to be in that city when the call goes out.
---
How do you know you are world first?
---
We got ourselves a bad ass over here
---
It's much safer to bring a stack of swiftness, as noggenfogger has no cooldown before you can drink another.
---
Going Alliance this time around and having Blessing of Salvation is such a game changer. All the pew pew.
---
You are no way in hell doing 2k dps unless you only count the first few seconds. I dont really care im done arguing about this.
---
Well the server is allready capped that is why their is a queue, he is arguing to allow the smaller faction players to queue in before the larger faction members to get a closer to 50/50 split
---
... did you read it?
---
I Have 100 Arcanite Bars Ready! I'll post that too if you want
---
??? How was that even throwing shade or insulting someone? How could you tell that hey disliked someone?
---
Queue time is shower time.
---
But we can't dungeon level and grind when it takes just as long to get to the dungeon as it does to do it.
---
Level an alt? Why would I subject myself to the same torture of not being able to do anything in the world once I hit level for a contested zone.
---
BGs will not fix this. If anything it'll be that all the alliance there is, is gonna be in BGs; and all of the horde sitting in queue are going to be out doing wpvp on the few alliance trying to run to dungeons and questing.
---
History doesn't defend his actions.
---
Salty
---
Rank is fun in its own way.  I don't think people would play in general if it wasn't fun in some way for them.  
---
Running SM 100+ times, BRD 50 times, and LBRS another 50 times wasn't necessarily "fun" on an individual run basis either, but I enjoy having the gear for raid and it was worth the grind.
---
6 is the usual for a non stealth class
---
Do you play this mmo solo?
---
Gz to you man!
---
Not being able to play at all is much worse than not being able to play with your friends.
---
Jesus Christ lol. How though
---
you can play....I know you don't want to start over on another server but the reality is most people who picked their servers in the first week are going to have to start over if they want a good experience. You will need to research the servers and find one with close to even populations because trust me when I say its not fun being on either side of the imbalance. Can't rank because there are no horde to kill anywhere. We could use some more horde over on arcanite reaper btw so if you do decide to start over so you can actually play feel free to come over here. Its probably 55-45 or maybe 60-40 over here right now. It seems close.
---
Havent seen it here yet, but Resto Pots are crazy good vs mages, still a lopsided matchup though.
---
Nono, that doesn’t exist sir. Alliance are the victims. They called dibs first we must sympathize and appease
---
A horde player on grobb which has a 50/50 split.
---
Sure, it's nothing like herod, but there've been plenty of times where alliance was holding LHC or BRM for hours while we had to corpse run in. Annoying? Sure. But 10-15 mins of corpse running for a few hours of dungeon grinding? Calling that "unplayable" is a stretch.
---
I was actually thinking about a reckoning build, where I strike five times at once when fully stacked, each strike with chance to proc. Causing potentially high amount of burst.
---
It's part of the game and doesn't cost me any repairs I release and move on lol
---
And a warrior without opener only wins vs a rogue that isn't fully PvP specced or got no cds up.    
---
Even if the warrior uses insignia or gets a lucky crit. Blind + sprint lets the rogue escape and try again later.    
---
Bad rogues are victims though, I agree.   
---
Easiest to me in 1vs1 as Warry are hunters so far
---
Key word: "usually". There are several servers that got dumped on by Blizz during P2 because all of the alliance wanted out of their day 1 horde dominant servers... The Alliance act just as poorly. Which was what these people were saying.
---
Because he was making a joke.. he isn't literally crying himself to sleep
---
I know each server is different, but I've had trouble doing literally everything in game in P2. Every flight path is camped by a raid, every dungeon entrance has a gauntlet of MCing priests that just bring you backwards over and over, etc. Can't even sneak out of a city and try to quest without being chased down and camped by 5+ dudes. 
---
So I'd rather cut that back by letting them get into BGs in a reasonable time. I'm not over here getting off on hurting their game experience despite the fact that they are clearly getting off on doing that to me.
---
You didn't seize the opportunity and now it's too late! Ty for karma btw
---
Are you GM for your guild?
---
That's how it goes
---
You actually have 0 idea if he was lol.
---
"World First" 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Still delusional as always. Your achievements mean nothing to me.
---
Also haven't played in months, work too much. Good job though, glad you enjoy yourself. :)
---
It's rough. Best I can usually do vs 60s as leveling Priest is Psychic Scream and hope it buys me enough time to bail lol
---
Absolutely, but why not attempt to work out a solution that fixes the problem without create a new problem?
---
I wish they wouldn't. These people obviously shouldn't have rolled PVP. This is backed up by the thousands of people commenting how they are glad they switched to PVE, or people saying they knew they didn't want on a PVP server in the first place. These people created the problem and are now relying on Blizzard to create the solution. Pretty pathetic if you ask me. Can you say *Entitled*?
---
Same on Finkle.
---
Not 10min but a good 1min. Only for bnet messages tho, guild chat seemed OK
---
A couple of years ago I logged in to play a bit after having been away from the game for quite a while. I was trying to clear some bag space and found that I had a [Zulian Ceremonial Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20258/zulian-ceremonial-staff) that I had never equipped. I checked prices on wowuction.com and it said it was going for over 300,000g. I was like "no way is anything selling that high" and listed it for around 30,000g... instant sell... instant regret.
---
I posted the same thing about a week ago and it was removed due to violation of rule 7.

OUCH

Did you get lucky in pugs? Or did your guild allow rogues to roll on it?
---
Guilty.
---
I’ve been playing on Benediction for a while and it’s pretty balanced.
---
Corpse running 10 times to get through 5 horde raids is not enjoyable. This could easily be fixed by implementing a 1 minute pvp immunity for newly rezed players. Will this idea be popular to horde? Probably not. But then again I'm sure losing massive amounts of alternate faction members isn't popular either. 
---
I love pvp. I thrive on pvp ever since the days of ultima online... but what this classic experience is in phase 2 is a joke.
---
Truth its a vanity item outside a tanks hands.
---
Funny seeing people you grouped with on reddit! Alonis - warlock from last night in STV
---
Hey was just thinking, since WF is too RNG, what if you were to use rockbiter? You deal a shit ton of dmg per hit at least
---
There's nothing really wrong with surprise corpse runs imo.  It begins to be a problem when it's endless corpse runs.
---
bs!
---
Nah man, Mage just straight up out-kits Warrior in a 1v1 if equal skill. Blink while the Warrior is \*mid\* Intercept, you break the stun, and they also don't get in range for a Hamstring, or even a Piercing Howl. You have a FAPS rolling, but now you're going to eat a full duration Polymorph. Kiss that 5g goodbye, see you at the spirit healer.  
---
A well played mage is capable of taking down an even better played warrior without them being able to take a single swing, regardless of if you use CD's and Consumables. The only exception is outside intervention, or the mage fucking up. The mage has 100% of the agency in the matchup. You can't Charge because if the mage is smart you'll be combat-tagged by a 30yd Blizzard before you're in 25yd Charge Range. If they then Blink the intercept, you lose. There are 0 options for you to recover here. You can try Iron Grenading the Polymorph while you're trying to gapclose, but you need to make up 20yards in the 1.5s Sheep cast time (if they are max range) before you can even start the grenade cast.  
---
It's just not a matchup you can realistically win, even when considering FAPs.  
---

\*That's\* how you kill a Mage as a Warrior.

Warlocks in your raid must be crying from missing out on 15% free shadow damage
---
*REEEEEEEEEEE*
---
Gonna repost it without credit huh?
---
How about free transfer to a pve realm?
---
People say stalagg is really one sided but I have been in the same exact experience in that video being horde on stalagg.  Sometimes one faction just owns the mountain for a few hours.
---
people complaining about faction imbalance - wont this just result in long-ass Q times for Horde come BG's while Alliance get insta Q? Would this balance out eventually?
---
First off, thanks for the reply. 
---
And I figured it's just an awkward level to pvp as a druid. My gear sucks, and I can't fully take advantage of my skill tree. 
---
My plan was to go balance after getting Leader of the Pack for those sweet kitty talents and then respecc around 55 to HotW/Resto. 
---
JW is your main focus PvP, Healing or Tanking? cause I was hoping to do all 3 at 60 but don't know how difficult it is to create three sets at once
---
Yeah and so all that work just to see when someone’s about to res is pointless. You can pretty much guess when they’ll res based off the run distance
---
I didn't know you could only PVP in BGs' against Palis and Priests considering I've been using it for 3 months. 
---
It's made many 1v1s and even 1v2s incredibly easier due to not having to pop out of shadowform. It may seem unlikely but you'll encounter classes besides Palis/Priests in WPVP.
---
Didn't know it was such a hot button for some people. My mistake for making a joke on reddit.
---
I'm going to be real with you: if you're crying yourself to sleep because you can't play a video game the way you want you have some other issues you need to work on. I'm not trying to be a prick, but that is not healthy behaviour in the slightest
---
I'm horde faerlina and to me it feels like the alliance control most dungeons.  If I want to do FM I have to corpse run from before the dungeon entrance all the way to the instance portal which is between 6-10 death runs depending on how early alliance start their corpse camping
---
Tested this. Out of group, healing gives no share in any hk or dk. If you’re part of the group, the whole group will share the honor or get a dk regardless if you do damage to a civ or heal someone who does damage to a civ or not. 
---
So solo, no party healing, you are not at risk of a dk unless you do any damage the civilian.  We tested buffs, hots before and during the slaughter, healing touch after tagging. None gave me a dk.

Please keep camping the boats - my portal sales have gone through the roof. The Azerothian Military Industrial Complex paid for 3 epic mounts, a mansion with its own ski lift in Winterspring and a summer property just outside of Booty Bay.
---
Sure, https://wago.io/71MV_Wp9I/1
---
Yeah just curious how many people from the majority will transfer ours feel like the transfer might just reduce the minority
---
Anyone have objections to the following plan?  
---
1) Find matching servers with opposite ratios  
---
2) Merge servers 8/1 A/H + 1/8 A/H = big server with good ratio  
---
3) Simultaneously open up free transfers from the new merged big server to a separate low pop server that has somewhat reasonable population balance to help keep the new merged server from being over-populated.  
---
This maintains an element of choice in regards to potentially moving to a smaller server or staying on the larger server. It fixes two servers with horrendous population imbalances and it helps a third server that's under populated.  
---
The numbers may work out that more than 2 servers have to be merged in this manner, or potentially transfers need to be opened up to more than 1 low pop server.
---
Why do we have these types of post? I don’t understand the need to post a photo and say,  “I know it’s not much but we killed an easy boss.” Lmao
---
Sure I am, around 1.5-2k dps aoe packs but normally u wait for the full setup then go rambo which will kill the pack very quick but also give u agro. I'm only arguing since ur so determinded ur right when in fact you are wrong and not only I can atest to that but also many of the pro mages on YT. Shatter aoe is the most reliable and the most dmg dealing method of aoeing, works perfect in PVP, PVE and AOE solo so for anyone wanting a hybrid build with PVP PVE AOE, I suggest Winter chill frost/fire mage with shatter, this will keep ur guild happy and enable you to do what u want in the game.
---
Ive played since vanilla and 100% of the time I got scammed I got my items/gold back from blizz CS. This situation is fucked up because WoW was always one of the few mmos where you can have a base level of trust that youre not getting ripped off in common transactions like enchanting and crafting.
---
Undead lock.  Not much of an issue.  ;-)  And yeah, wotf+trinket is a powerful setup but many rogues will use them at the wrong times, e.g. on a deathcoil.
---
Only faction with minotaurs
---
Well one for mitigation and one for threat and one for fire resist but obviously threat is the most useful bis
---
Aw yes that makes sense, I was only thinking about the current state of the game and hadn't considered the future enchants. Thank you for enlightening me on this.
---
I'm a no lifer currently with 8-14 hours to play most days.
---
I've still got better shit to do than hang around camping people.
---
thanks for explanation. makes sense I guess. Still the mats cost is kinda in the insane category, and personally I'd permanently feel bad wearing this in any kind of PVP unless I could specifically switch it in for a rogue fight...
---
mostly the problem is the cost, it's just such an insane investment for anyone that's not just swimming in gold for some reason
---
Your the dominating faction: Farm honor 
---
Your the dominated faction: Farm karma
---
Remember when reddit pleaded for faction based transfers? Alliance are locked to their hell now. Good job reddit.
---
BGs being cross realm only makes the problem worse when you consider that nearly every server is horde dominant. Horde will definitely be stuck in BG queues, there is no doubt about that. With that I can assure you there will be horde still roaming around doing wpvp because it can be more honor/hour than waiting for BGs.
---
All server transfers are going to do is create more faction imbalance with all of the alliance leaving to go to pve realms or the one of 5 servers that have an alliance dominance.
---
No changes is going back to 2k server populations then. The cat is out of the bag on no changes.
---
I thinking clicking on every mob when aoe grinding is super satisfying actually. Let the gold flow!
---
Because if people do collude and they end up using the item they got "for free" in an actual raid setting, they'd get called out for it. EP/GP is not synonymous with shitty leadership, there's enough knowledge of the game and itemization that it's pretty clear which pieces are an upgrade and which are not. All loot councils and guild leadership should be aware of that already.
---
I do that in less than an hour of DME farming.  Lock life.
---
Every now and then my muscle memory does get me in trouble and leaves me without an interrupt available.
---
By 3 you have BWL, so Core Hound Tooth and that axe from BWL is prolly better.
---
OK. Notice how the people playing with guard rails are having themselves a grand ol time while the tough guys with no guard rails are throwing their bowling balls into each others' lanes and ruining the experience for both lanes, then whining to the bowling alley propietor that they haven't set up an ideal bowling environment. But I'm sure you all think you're the pro bowling 300 every game. Toplel.
---
Blind doesnt have DR's. KS doesnt share DR's with any other stun. But if I were to sap - CS - gouge, the gouge will have the DR as sap and gouge share a DR.
---
It's not there for me. I updated the addon today.
---
That person only killed that mob to be an asshole, thus griefing, you dumb fuck.
---
&gt; Prot warriors are punching bags if 1v1. I know because ***I am spec one for raids*** 😞
---
Nice. I might need to hang out in TP more.
---
6? Those are rookie numbers! - Skeram Alliance
---
&gt; I got my taste of vanilla WPvP on Mal'Ganis and it was a lesson learned.
---
I was originally horde on mal'ganis.  People act like this is something new, but that's the way that server was from the start.  It's a good story though, because eventually a couple very strong alliance guilds transferred to Mal'Ganis seeing it as a challenge, and they actually had a lot of success. I got ganked pretty much any time I was out alone by them in important/popular zones.  
---
PVP the way it is now is scaled up from vanilla, but the same thing was happening back then too.  All this talk about punishing people for being on the advantageous faction lacks just as much empathy as the people saying those pvping lack though.  Blizzard really did screw up when they allowed the lower faction to transfer away.  They should have put hard population limits on servers from the start, and opened up transfers off to the dominant faction and not the weak one from the beginning.  This failing is not the player's fault.
---
I've had two separate players (both from the same guild) on seperate ocassions come and each ninja a rich thorium vein from me while I was fighting a mob and they both left me for dead instead of helping me.
---
Same faction as me. I hate them.
---
Imagine being so much of a snowflake asshole that this sweet interaction causes a physical revulsion AND an overwhelming urge to let everyone know.
---
Orc +5 axes, 25% stun resist, and windfury
---
Yeah sometimes I'm a dick, it can be fun. Where im the TOS does it say that someone can't kill broken tooth? What rules specifically are you holding people to? The opinions of some GM? Not slippery at all.
---
You out-sustain them. Rejuv on yourself, Moonfire and Swarm on mage. Repeat for 2-3 minutes, mage dead.  
---
He can't control you with Frost Nova, can't runaway with blink.
---
If you have more money than you know what to do with, then yes. I don't think anyone but the most hardcore guilds would hold it against you if you waited until you had BiS before investing in that enchant, tough.
---
Fuck you it has to due with classic
---
You just prove you commented on a post out of hate without reading it. I dont give a shit about your ego 10vs1 winning situation; im tring to defend and promote a healthy version of Classic WoW as I love the game
---
I've seen this myself and wasn't sure how to explain what happened.  Must be some range calc issue?  Latency to server?
---
Aaah, I see, you admit to being a dick, thus there is no point of arguing since you won't understand nor change your mind despite admitting to being wrong.
---
Take care.
---
This is boiled down to every horde player ive seen.
---
Spoken as a alliance player, where people arent dicks or children ❤️
---
This is funny. Too bad the mods will kill it for “low effort meme”.
---
Everything is crazy expensive on whitemane
---
1) Open character screen
---
2) Click Mageblade
---
3) Move Mageblade to mainhand slot.
---
4) Profit
---
(You also need to have trained swords in UC as Horde, or SW as Alliance.)
---
We get it, rogues have cold blood.
---
Again, good luck convincing your raid to hand out core hounds tooth to a hunter before the fury prot warriors and dagger rogues. And I play horde, so good luck convincing the raid you should get an axe before all the orc warriors. I am well aware there are weapons that are good that hunters can use, but the reality of the situation is hunters are bottom of the barrel in priority list when it comes to melee weapons.
---
reckon I could do this as a oomkin?
---
I would use a dagger if i had a good one. One shot potential.
---
Oh god, that guy is a bastard. 
---
If there are two things that every hunter must respect is another hunter taming and another hunter fightin one of the four demons.
---
&gt; I think the problem is not with the honor system, but how it dropped. IMO it would have been much better to roll out honor system from day 1
---
Yep.  In vanilla nobody set around waiting and preparing for months to be able to do this.  They just kind of decided whether or not they wanted to.  Or some people, like me, were in the middle and pvp'd when we wanted to.  Ranked to the middle ground, and didn't obsessively treat it as the point of the game.
---
Well then I commend you on your determination and amount of free time that you have
---
It's rough on warlock in my experience.  Can't fear at all, and their damage output is way too high to allow you to address them effectively.
---
Check the streamers and you will see they arent like that :D Just normal chill people that want honor and enjoy pvp .
---
Lmk when you hit 60 so I can come camp you with 40+ other people. :)
---
Nah, no one continues to do whatever they were doing once a tank is found. They all head to the dungeon. I don't view it as a waste of time but as time investment. People should have repercussions for being assholes. You can take the high road all day, this isn't something that happened out of necessity.
---
Try to find him in your realms discord (if it has one)
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
In a 1v1 situation (which as it stands now in WPvP pretty rare) warstomp could be argued as superior but between all the different stuns out there (and there's a lot) and grenades being able to resist 1/4 of them on no cooldown is pretty huge and easily tilts a fight in your favor. 
---
Warstomp is great no doubt but I personally believe that hardiness edges it out in the long run.
---
There are benchmarks I'd you choose to only take four healers
---
??? The point is you dont use ckeave to do less threat ever. Thats all.

A friend of mine actually sat down with a stopwatch last week, he had sub-10 minute actual gameplay (as in, being alive) in almost 2 hours, because there was nowhere he could go without being killed on sight. Impossible to do a dungeon, impossible to do open world stuff, impossible to stay alive for more than a minute. He cancelled his sub that day.
---
&gt; But 600/400 is totally unwinnable if you ask me.
---
That's not really true with classic though.  I'll take an organized 400 with lots of mages and sappers over an unorganized 600 any day.
---
So the temperature of their serum would be best described as?
---
That is a beautiful motherfucking thing
---
There's only one way to find out ;)
---
You must play horde, or if not, you must not have tried running to literally any end game dungeon as alliance. Doesn't matter how many times I've been killed. People legit camp nonstop. I had the same 5 people kill me from the first ramp up to DM all the way until the DMN entrance. Well over 5 times. 2 min res timer. 
---
Definitely not worth any honor but got ganked by the same rogue and jumped by the rest of their crew every res. The whole way. I just don't understand the point. 
---
Was their day so bad that they needed to take out the frustration on me? It's actually anti-social behavior imo. And I'm not even salty (I know most of you won't believe this but seriously, more than anything I'm just confused). I kind of feel bad because at that point its not about the honor grind. It's just chasing the feeling of superiority except there's literally nothing to brag about when its 5 on 1 and you have 50% hp. 
---
I'm sure someone is going to respond to this with "lol ally tears!!1! horde r00lz!" but like, I actually don't understand the point.
---
&gt;because eventually a couple very strong alliance guilds transferred to Mal'Ganis seeing it as a challenge, and they actually had a lot of success.
---
Yeah I remember that, one of the top Alliance Guilds "Ret" transferred to Mal'Ganis.  I remember that because they were so used to BG queues that they no life'd the instant queues we had for the first couple of weeks and it fucked up people that were aiming for R14 (one of my friends)
---
I'm a rogue and also the top DPS of my raid.. and pretty much every raid I've been in for 15 years, I promise you that they'd lose pretty heavily to any equally geared combat rogues that knew what they were doing. Which sucks, because combat is boring as hell.
---
You can do all the content for sure, but if you want to do something as well as can be done, you lose out on other aspects of the game. It sucks.
---
I don't honestly know why people are against it, it only adds to the game.

---
Yeah definitely not a full threat wipe
---
Blizzard's support for classic is really bad. This really sucks, thankfully the only issue I've run into that I opened a ticket for was not being able to turn a quest in because the object that was supposed to appear after finishing to turn it in at didn't. I was told to abandon the quest and do it again, and a link to wowhead on how to complete the quest as if I'm a complete buffoon, completely useless response.
---
And yet everyone here was so happy they were going to delay BGs so they could get ThE ReAL WoRld PVp eXpERiEncE. Then when they don't like what they got they want a refund real quick. 😂
---
We definitely own Everlook, but I hear constant asks for help from my guildies trying to get into BRM. We all have our own biases, but I would be utterly shocked if we even had greater than 60% control. I'm betting Hurricane members would be offended if you told them that the Alliance was getting crushed there, I know their raids have run me over there a ton of times.  
---
There are definitely a ton of griefers. My favorite sort of pvp is following my guildies that need help in stealth, and kill anyone who initiates on them. Feels good killing people who deserve it.   
---
Not to take away from your complaints, but I really do think it will calm down at least a bit over time. Maybe BGs won't be the primary catalyst, but people get bored of the more grief based aspects of PVP.
---
Oh fuck off if you're going to just change the argument every time you don't have an answer.
---
Like, acknowledging that it's the subpar choice and choosing it anyways is totally fine.
---
WOTF is also inferior on priest because their trinket specifically removes fear. 
---
But if you think it's cool to be UD that's fine. Just don't pretend like it's the superior choice. Especially if you're a healer, where it's actually considerably worse.
---
They should've done that ages ago. Herod has been in a bad state for the longest time.
---
Hunter at max range will beat a warlock, they can virtually prevent you from doing anything.
---
Warlock comes down to what pet you have out.
---
The saying "nice guys finish last" is absolutely true. When you play by the rules people who break the rules take advantage of you and trample over you. We need more Hank Hills in the world. Hank Hill wouldn't have done this.
---
Ahh, a tale as old as time...
---
Because I like the undead
---
Sounds like you should learn to say something other than "if you disagree with me go to retail".
---
Your logic is thousands of ally/horde who are part of the minority faction on the imbalanced servers aren't having their game time restricted because of the faction they chose?
---
Often your healer will only go in to combat with those mobs after healing the tank or maybe if they’re super close, so i believe the tank is usually fine doing that.
---
I like 200 the most.
---
Its not fun if you're level 50 and trying to level. Entire nights are lost trying to get into one dungeon.
---
&gt;When BGs come out, Enhance will be literally hated and shamed out of BGs because its all premade players who don't want to go anywhere near an enhance shaman.
---
I really doubt this. Yeah they might not get into premades, but thats not going to be the whole BG scene at all.
---
Leatrix or bagnon maybe
---
It's not too bad if you get the jump on them with a charge, as you can get 1-2 hits in during the stun. Pop a free action potion and pummel the polymorph, and the fight is yours.
---
Yeah, unfortunately no matter how good a loot system is. If the leadership is bad and not knowledgeable about classes it's gonna be shit and get abused.
---
&gt; here is no fix to that issue
---
I'm on a high but not insanely high pop server.  It's already substantially calmed down, but everyone knew that from the start.  It takes a unique kind of person to continue grinding in world pvp.  Anecdotally, I'd estimate that about 20% of the people that claimed they would are still working on it with the same amount of effort.  And we're only 2 weeks away from BGs, which will cause most of those 20% to stop WPVPing almost entirely.  It will be much more efficient to rank in them.
---
Pvping in the mountain, one our raiders jumped to chase jumpers into the lava and entered another raid groups id. We were raiding the next day. He did the live chat and got it reset as well, but was told it was an exception and to be more careful. So YMMV.
---
Why is Silver ore so much more expensive than the bars? I was trying to smelt my way to 125 mining but the ore goes for 30s and the bars only sell for 2s
---
Are they part of some quest or is everyone else just trying to smelt them for levels too?
---
Gotcha yea I like dagger main hand because I have access to skills like ambush/backstab but this build is more focused on getting 5 combo points fast so mainly you supposed to use S.S. so the higher base damage the better but putting perditions on off hands 50% reduced damage feels like a waste
---
Yes they can.
---
frost bolt
---
nova
---
blink
---
frost bolt 
---
When I moved into my apartment I didn't have verizon setup yet. So instead, I played Smite, Wow, and Fortnite on my mobile hotspot with almost no lag.
---
Isnt that what we are doing here?
---
What does "good rank" mean?  Unless you're trying to be realm first GM/HWL or hit some other arbitrary goal and rank could be "good".  What's your goal with pvp?
---
3 - My dust-gathering shaman on Grobby will maybe get played again some day.
---
The 2nd one. The bars aren't needed for really anything while the ore can level mining.
---
Remind me the add on that shows the countdown for your cc?
---
The poster you replied to was sobbing? You must have a funny definition. Sounded to me like they were perfectly happy with the results of their decision. Only people who aren't are the supposed tough guy PVPers lmao.
---
Why should your time be more important than mine, simply because you chose the less dominant faction on said server?
---
Good dagger rogues destroy me if they get the opener, I pretty much kill everything else (I'm UD). Also rogue with shadow reflector is gg city.
---
This is why I made a second account, horde rogue because of people like this cunt. Sorry that happened to you man. Karma will get him.
---
See when people tell you nice guys finish last what they don't tell you is finishing as a nice guy is much more fulfilling even when there are assholes
---
A billionaire being mocked on the internet by thousands of people? That's something that money doesn't solve.
---
You gave him the wrong advice, give him the advice they've been giving us since we started bringing up the imbalance.
---
"reroll lul"
---
You can raid as anything you like, I don't recall saying you couldn't. 
---
Also I get really tired of this argument... "people shouldn't be able to respec so easily as it takes away from the game, but also it's so easy to get 50g you can respec any time you like anyway".
---
Dual spec is in the game for people who farm up the gold for it and it breaks nothing.
---
I did it and I have no regrets. My guild has 6 mages and it's probably going to be awhile before I get mageblade or staff of dominance. I chose ROTOM because I also pvp a lot and the stats are very good.
---
As a lock I think you should be able to farm the mats efficiently--getting the most expensive yourself and then paying for the cheap ones.
---
Either a zoomer or a boomer. Me, I'm a moomer.
---
There should be a weakauras icon somewhere on your minimap.
---
I honestly thought the maintenance last night would fix this but it was the same issue today as well. To do anything in a group you're forced to move into voice comms, but this makes me really worried about our upcoming raid this week. I'm on Gehennas EU btw.
---
It's amazing how easy it is to wait until after someone has killed and looted the thing to gank them.
---
Feel free to actually site a source, otherwise get rekt
---
Congrats! Just got mine a day or two ago as well. Still super excited!
---
Not sure but I made starter accounts and it wouldnt let me log into classic unless I can an active sub.
---
I must have missed that. What exactly do you mean?
---
You obviously don't understand people.  Like at all.
---
&gt; I'm sure they'll cry themselves to sleep wiping their tears with all your money.
---
Activision will.  The devs for whom classic is a continual reminder of there failures sure wont.
---
Im just concerned that, as many voices in trade chat suggest, peoples reaction to this abuse will be to quit the game en masse or join the other faction macting the game drastically less healthy overall
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true
---
Not true.
---
I carry it and put it on for DPS/soloing.
---
Now this is classic+ not no fuckin training wheels for x class
---
300
---
Dual spec pls
---
FYI, you have a second better flightpath option as a horde at least.
---
So there are 2 types of stun DRs, targetted stuns and non targetted stuns.  Non targetted stuns are things like mace spec stun for warrior and rogue, weapon procs, etc.  For some reason, kidney shot is on that DR so it doesn't share DR with all of the other stuns (hoj, cheap shot, intercept, etc).
---
Rogues I believe have to sap after they resealth on blind specifically because they need a few more seconds for the DR window to reset.  Sap is of course on another DR with rocket helm, gouge, etc.
---
Roots never had DR until a patch mid tbc.
---
Poly is on its own DR which is 20/10/5 sec.
---
DR takes either 16 or 18 seconds to reset, can't remember off the top of my head.  At the end of the day, nothing is actually bugged with DR.  In vanilla, different effects shared DR only with abilities that have the same effect.
---
&gt; Outliers being warlocks, priests, hunters, Druid’s, shamans and paladins.
---
So most classes
---
Sad :(
---
300 if its just pointless walking from one direction to another, 200 for anything where youre interacting with stuff
---
I didn't claim it was the superior choice. Will of the forsaken is still one of the best racials in the game. For priest? debatable.
---
You rolled in with your elitism and min/maxing strats on a joke comment. No one asked for opinion but you decided to butt in. 
---
Like I said, I. don't. care.
---
What is the solution though? The players create this problem because they want to play on a server where their faction dominates. Because players dont want to have the experience you are having. So more people move to that server to play the dominant faction and people from the outnumbered faction leave.
---
Blizzard have tried offering transfers to players to balance realm populations. The players have decided that is not something they want to be a part of.
---
Restrict new players from creating character of a particular faction? Well now you're potentially stopping friends from playing together, I suppose you could say that the players could transfer to an unbalanced realm where their friends can make a character of that faction, but how much change could this edge case really make?
---
If you forcibly move people between servers then you break up guilds, and friends. This would make people unsubscribe. The friends you make and the communities you become a part of are so important to the classic WoW experience.
---
Honestly, the best solution for this problem is already on its way, they're called Battlegrounds and while they wont fix the issue they will dramatically reduce this problem that disproportionate servers create.
---
This is my plan, herb + mine + DE + book spawn.
---
So you punish others who have no idea a guildie did something like this? It's 100% a waste of your time, you're still literally traveling to them and going into a dungeon, dying, typing to them. All to what? Feel better about being kicked from a dungeon group? Lol, dude relax and just enjoy the game, if you have an issue with a player or guild contact one of their officers or gm and talk to them. They rectify the issues. I had an issue with another guild where one of their guys was being a douche during some pvp. The GM and I had a long discussion, and ended up being a good rapport with that guild. They've asked me to come a long to dungeons/raids (if needed) and a lot of pvp, and I've made plenty of people where I don't need to pug ever. 
---
  But hey if you wanna waste your time go on ahead, I'm not here to change how you play, but it's seems pretty substandard.
---
If you are in a position where Azuresong/SoD is available to you, I'd say hold off as the mats are quite expensive on my server.
---
If you don't see an Azuresong/SoD falling into your lap anytime soon, I'd say throw the +30SP enchant on the Rod, it's an incredibly good item for casters.
---
Oh cmon dude
---
I never mentioned anyone gloating, that's all you.
---
Yup. Goodbye to exploration. The horde has the fucking boat in feralas camped on my server. Nowhere except inside an instance is safe, so the world is... fucking tiny now.
---
BRD full runs are decent XP actually.  Gorshak event farm groups too, though usually that may just stack mages.
---
Friend and I have done almost exclusively BRD from like 52 to 58 ish.  We did lbrs once as well, which he tanked fine at 56.
---
Yeah now...
---
Arugal only had 15k max logged in at a time even with layers. I confirmed this as much as possible with a mate on horde by both running a clean census at peak time multiple nights in a row)
---
Port to IF, interface options enable helmet, role play as city guard!
---
Guess it depends.  If PVE and PVP realms share a queue, I'm not sure it will be so 1 sided.  And don't you want them to have short queues anyway?  So they're not outside ganking you while waiting.
---
Ret Paladins in a raid are an issue for me. We already have other healing paladins, what good is a Retadin? Blessings are out because your paladin healers can cover that. Is might aura worth it over a hunter's Mark aura, or a druid's crit?
---
Found the guy who does this.
---
The latter. Silver bars have little practical use, just a few low-level items that nobody really uses. Even for leveling blacksmithing, its usage is limited because you have alternatives that use more common materials. So there's little demand for silver bars. But leveling mining is time-consuming enough that lots of people are willing to pay for ore to smelt for mining skillups.
---
The mage gets 0 because he doesn't need an offspec set lol. A dps druid getting free resto gear has 0 impact on the raid.
---
how do i not die during onyxia?
---
&gt; Both factions cannot have insta ques at the same time.
---
Sure they can.  It's just unlikely.
---
It was balanced for a while but it's starting to get horde heavy...I think it's approaching 60/40 H:A.

If you list 6 out of 9 classes as outliers I got news for you.
---
War generally loses every matchup. Can win against mediocre hunter if they get the opener and can win against non-pvp/bad rogue. Any rogue with a brain is bleed kiting warriors in deadzone.
---
Most of them are Horde.  Off the top of my head, can only think of a few on the Alliance side (Asmon, Swifty, Staysafe, Esfand) vs Horde (Venruki, Ziqo, Tips, Xaryu, Cdew, Sodapoppin, Payo, Savix, Frostadamus).
---
I hope youre right. But classic had been just like private so far, and private bgs were completely dominated by premades.
---
I read it,  it's the same as what we've seen hundreds of times this week. Do you read other threads here?
---
And no i don't have a 10vs1 ego thing going on, I have a character on a PVP realm and a PVE realm and have been playing me PVE realm more while this is happening to avoid it like many others have done.
---
Send him infinity letters so he has to manually collect and delete everyone before he can get to the stuff in his mail that he really wants
---
It's a childish mindset. Sure, not everyone grows out of it. Which is why my original comment was saying it's either a kid or a manchild.
---
So allies get instant ques and horde have ques. So allies will all be in BGs while horde starts roaming the world for more HKs per hour than waiting for BGs... when there are no alliance out in the world because they're all insta popping in BGs... 
---
Servers are horde dominated overall, yes, but not by insane margins like you see on Herod. So it'll be a much bigger incentive for people to wait in que on those servers vs. WPvP because there will be virtually no allies out in the world in comparison. So for the rank grind, WPvP will be an absolute waste of time on the worst servers.
---
At worst, they could just merge all BGs into one pool. Allies outnumber horde massively overall when you add in PvE servers.
---
I just liked cannabalize with my life tap for leveling, tbh.
---
I would say no unless you are a super tri-hard.  When you have Rag on farm status no need to waste mats/consumables.
---
Is it hard playing the game through a telescope on the moon?
---
Which part is giving you trouble?
---
It's waaaaay easier to murder us horde trying to use the zep from org to UC than it is for us to kill alliance taking the tram from IF to SW. Alliance has safer public transit, and that's fact.
---
Do you not understand English? Shadow priest are free honor for me

How can I know what to sell to the auction house and for what price? I didn’t know it was a thing and would sell all my loot to shopkeepers

I've yet to finish so I'll let you know how satisfying it is.

Yay 15 years after everyone, GG
---
Warriors generally lose _every_ matchup. If I have dispel buddy guess who gets poly'd first.
---
It’s not this bad on my server but still if I want to do anything but run instances I better have a crew cause I’m going to get run over by 5-20 alliance. I’m already annoyed and if it was any worse I’d be miserable
---
Names look like familiar. Thunderfury?
---
Because it's a further disincentive not to take res sickness.
---
Such an excellent rebuttal!
---
You wouldn’t see any level 60’s until you were level 60? Or grouped with a level 60?
---
And to your idea of avoiding “punishing” horde a similar effect is gained by budding alliance racials, is that not objectionable to you?
---
You also haven’t “tuned” the game to be more balanced. You’ve constructed a new game, it’s not even clear if any pvp outside of rated BG’s (so pub BG’s are gone?) and your 2 arenas has any value or incentive
---
One of the things vanilla players have prized for a long time is world coherency and your new systems (permanent layering, only 2 pvp zones each only 100 yards across) flies in the face of this.
---
At what rate do hunter pets regenerate focus? How often does it tick, and how much focus per tick?
---
You're assuming they have competent leadership that's also knowledgeable about different classes.
---
What was the name of that garbage human being?

You should look at some of the longer comments that break down dkp/ep etc systems and point out the benefits and the flaws. The idea is that in this instance, OP would have an advantage if he didn't have to spend any points for tier gear. Lets imagine a mage wants some of his tier gear for PvP. They would have to spend the full amount for T gear, (unless OPs guild considers some of the T gear to be OS because it isn't BiS.) They would not be getting free pieces of gear, and thus losing their points for something "OS" aka PvP. That would then put them behind other players in competition for a weapon like dominance. Now, becaue there are no other druids to gear out, OP is saying he should not have to spend his points for it, even though it is 25% for OS, purely because there is no other druid. This would allow him to horde his points and not have to take cuts for getting additional gear, putting him at an advantage over the other players. Other classes have much more competition for their gear, and would be forced into a decision of getting upgrades/OS gear and losing their competition for Dominance. As many pointed out, this shows the obvious flaw in the system because it incentivizes players to horde points for weapons instead of spending it for straight upgrades. While this is annoying, and can lead to gear being DE, that is the manner in which the systems function. OP raised a shit show despite this being pretty cut and dry and wasn't given the gear he was entitled to. Does this suck and waste loot? Yes. But this is the guilds system. He could have stated his case, and done so diplomatically. Instead he clearly tried to make a big deal and get others to side with him and create drama in the guild. Which resulted in him gquitting. The reality is, it could be tough for him to find a spot as a boomkin, and in a new guild he will be behind in their point system or if it is LC, he will definitely get passed over in favor of other dps classes for weapons. OP basically shot himself in the foot and then shot his other foot. He could have stayed in the guild, used his points for dominance, since he claimed the T gear was irrelevant, then spent the cheap 25% pts for it afterwards. Or, maybe waited to see if the guild would change their mind and throw it over to him. Instead he came crying to Reddit and named the guild hoping for people to take his side.
---
Not sure the "more money than you know what to do with" line really applies, here. There's no more cost-effective power boost that money can buy. That enchant shouldn't be the last thing you buy, it should be the first...
---
Man, it's as if you should level some more instead of going on reddit to tell the world that it's not fair that pvp happens on your pvp server. Reddit posts should give xp.
---
They thought they wanted it...
---
The topic has been discussed to death - if you do the math, totem twisting and improved windfury totem actually don't add that much. Resto is arguably just better, the loss of stronger melee buffs is minor because the base effects are strong and the improvements not as impactful. Totem twisting happens to be the optimal thing for Enhancement to do because there simply isn't anything else (outside of niche support things like despells/purge and off healing with a sad little mana pool) that would not push them oom quickly, steal debuff slots or force them to channel spells/stop auto attacking.  
---
Talking about "resto shamans cannot totem twist as well" is really pointless. They do more impactful things with their mana. They could also totem twist more efficienty due to a much bigger mana pool and the option to just spec into the same support talents while sacrificing only Mana Tide Totem and Healing Wave improvements -  but there is little incentive for a resto shaman to waste time and mana this way.  
---
Assuming the illusory 100% uptime, a totem twisting Enhancer adds another \~4.5% crit to due to the additional and improved Grace of Air buff (88agi) while the improved totem talent for Strength of Earth amounts to a monumental 11 strength difference (77str base value, what every resto provides +15% =&gt; 88str with 2 talent point investment) and improved windfury totem adds \~38 attack power on average (30% buff to the 2 extra swings with base value of 315 bonus attack power for the 20% chance of a windfury procc).  
---
So an Enhancer in full raid support spec (that fills a slot where a resto shaman could be) adds the following:  
---
\~4% crit, 38 attack power, 11 strength  
---
for 4 people.  
---
Enhancement DPS by themselves is so low that even without the contrast of their buffs to a Resto shaman, the full value of their buffs does not necessarily bridge the gap that opens between their numbers and the base dps of actually good dmg classes - classes that also add their own utility to the mix.  
---
It becomes a decent concession as soon as you need someone to keep up Nightfall in phase 3 and onwards, especially if you gear some melee dps with preference for faster progress and stack the group this way. But overall, Resto Shamans outperform from a support perspective while real dps classes outperform from a dmg perspective. Warriors and Hunters actually make better Nightfall wielders as well, but mentioning that is usually just perceived as kicking someone who is already lying on the ground.  
---
**TL;DR:** from a raid optimization perspective, there is little reason to actually bring an enhancement shaman. Playing this spec is mostly about player preference, not efficiency. That is okay, especially in the early phases where none of this optimization stuff matters too much. But damn, everyone who thinks Enhancement is actually a real improvement over a resto shaman slot should ask themselves why no one ever is looking for Enhancers in the optimized, BiS list plagued and fully figured out landscape of classic wow.
---
That would only  happen if both factions have almost the exact same number of people queueing for bgs at the same time.
---
&gt; The warrior just needs to have his paladin
---
I actually don't. I'm just not a pussy.
---
Just to mention that it's not a new issue from blizzard's side as it's a very common thing that's been happening on Draenor-EU @ retail way before classic wow (and I suppose it's also occuring on other high population realms as well).
---
But help him get to level 48 first like a gracious monster.
---
I think paladins and Druids are the ones that get fucked the most by hardiness but those two are traditionally healers. Rogues definitely get dicked on by it too, but in a 1v1 can just reset and run or in group pvp simply save the orc for last.
---
Nade resists are what make it super good imo, but I really don’t see any nades in wpvp. I use them and sometimes I’ll see them thrown but it’s super rare on my server at least. 
---
Spriests/hunters/mages barely care I think. Warriors only care when it’s vs a warlock (you can still hamstring after charge/intercept thanks to leeway so orc hunters aren’t a big deal). 
---
If nades were more commonly used I think it’d be a bit more valuable, and I definitely think hardiness is good. But I just don’t think it’s the end all be all racial (until arenas come out of course)
---
&lt;Dankk Budz Collective&gt; always been toxic in the private server scene.
---
I feel ya there. Over the past 2 weeks there is constantly a raid outside org, inside org, sometimes even just on the roof of the bank killing people. Shits out of control haha. I've moved my home city to thunderbluff to save frustration.
---
Also, the game as of 1.12 is not the same as 1.3 or whatever patch people picked their races.  We've learned a lot over the years and that influences what people pick when starting from scratch.
---
Cuz it's only some warlock specs, so u do win some, whereas a large majority of mages will be in pvp or close to a pvp spec and u lose.
---
This is correct. Until you are in combat with the mobs, you do not build any threat. 
---
Remember that in most raid encounters as soon as the boss is aggro'd everyone is in combat. Few weeks back we pulled Baron into Garr's room and after the pull while he was making his way to us, I gained aggro by using Bloodrage.
---
Take my down vote, everything about this post earned it.
---
Is this /s? Or do people actually think this way? Like obviously you get the same range of good people to assholes on both sides.. sorry if im being whooshed
---
"You guys" is generally used as a colloquial and figurative term rather than literal.
---
Boiling PvE servers down to "collecting flowers" is disingenuous at best, and you know that. With limited time to play, not taking 45 minutes to even make it to BRM on any given day is a blessing.
---
I've also been seeing a lot of PvP refugees crop up on my server and we've actually started to have a queue because of it.
---
My guess is either phase 4 if people are still not having fun on their server or nothing else has fixed it yet. Or it will be in phase 6 if things balanced out before that.
---
I dont think it will be in phase 5 during the AQ war effort. Too many people would transfer just to ring the gong.
---
You are the one thinking your time is more valuable, not me. I am pointing out that “a queue means I can’t play anymore” isn’t a defense because in most ways, alliance can’t play right now either. I’d gladly sit in a queue for an hour to login and be able to quest, farm, get to a dungeon etc without corpse hopping. 
---
I don’t want anyone’s play experience to be ruined. Blizzard has options but aren’t doing anything. Faction queues plus free transfers plus free faction change would be the most ideal. Buffing guards and flight masters, increasing the resurrection distance significantly, lowering the honor level range could also help, but Blizz does nothing.
---
Hoj is bis until naxx.  An extra attack means another chance for vengeance, to proc a soc, which can also proc again off the extra soc hit.
---
uh.. the warrior opens the fight with charge -&gt; hamstring.  mage can counter this by timing a jump while mounted, but that's very different than somehow assuming blink -&gt; intercept is the beginning of the fight.  the mage should attempt nova -&gt; sheep, which is where escape artist/fap comes into play.
---
if you really think every mage fight starts with a 30 yrd rank 1 blizz tagging out of combat warriors.. why not just uh.. turn around...?  and get out of combat again?  do you think mages just run around waiting to r1 blizz warriors..?
---
warriors can use trinkets and consumables besides iron grenade such as spider belt, rocket helm, intimidating shout as a cast interrupt, skull of impending doom to break poly...
---
not saying warrior v mage is fair (its obviously in favor of the mage) but if we're talking free action potion, gnome, and crazy long CDs like recklessness?  yeah, the warrior can win that.
---
? No probs here in EU like ever!?
---
Who exactly do you think is playing classic?
---
I killed my group twice in a row by not understanding this. I jumped down a ledge in sunken temple, started eating, aggroed, we all died
---
If we want to get this trivial about it how about we just stop posting firsts all together and just post our /played game time once a day.
---
If she targets you, specifically, with a fireball, the damage is pretty much unavoidable. You can mitigate it by using a greater fire protection potion.
---
You can avoid getting hit by fireballs targeting other people by keeping your distance from other people. Also, everyone in your raid should have DBM installed and DBM, by default, makes a character /say when they're being targeted by a fireball, so if a player near you says they're being targeted you should be able to get away from them.
---
You should be able to survive one fireball just fine as long as you aren't too aggressive with your life tapping, they do a max of like 2300 damage, so be sure not to life tap below that.
---
Actually yeah that broken pillar works too! Though as for getting to Quartermaster without an invis pot...Let's just say that with 3 mages, anything is possible lol
---
If that happens just ledge jump to keep them aggro on you and try again with frost nova off cd.
---
Bandaging means spending time leveling an entire profession, and time spent bandaging. Food means buying the really expensive food, which still doesn't heal fast enough.

Renew is a single global that heals me on the way to the next pack.

Lmao. What the hell triggered you so hard about his comment? Are you part of this toxic loser guild or something?
---
True, I do not consider myself a casual player. But I do consider the people I play with casual. So this is sort of my way of scratching the min-max itch without ditching my friends. :-)
---
And I find it interesting, because it is a different conversation with different considerations than the typical try hard min max analysis. It isn't what race is best for a skilled raid... which is analyzed to death... it is, which race is best for an unskilled party/raid.
---
I've heard this happen to 4 people already. In feralas there is a mob by the faerie dragon cages that's a civ. Don't aoe it.

Did he slap you with a +4 stam, +4 strength leather belt after?

You use FAP and you just get poly'd for the duration.

Small group pvp is the ideal pvp
---
after today's patch what is DOTA 2 even anymore
---
As I said before in the post you chose not to read, a smart mage combat tags with Blizzard at 30 yards. Charge has a 25 yard range. You are not getting a Charge off against a good mage.
---
Smh man.
---
To be honest it seems like a lot of responsible adults who played WoW between 10 and 15 years ago and are treating Classic as a vacation from the daily grind.
---
Redditors are born triggered, you've been warned.

Pummel. You aren’t the good mages these guys are talking about obviously. You would go down easy with a fap.

How wide spread were they? I knew from my childhood days growing up in the Quad Cities in Iowa.
---
Totems and hots are great at getting healers in combat.
---
Since PVE realms really just means the choice to PVP is up to the players, can we just turn all realms into PVE+ servers (for example: something like after being killed by the opposing faction three times in 10 minutes, you can turn PVP off for your play session or an hour...something to that effect)? I know that will make the pure PVP players really mad, especially for the ones that dominate a server, but at least that will alleviate some of the gankfest while still having it initially retain a pure PVP mechanic.
---
Sure that isn't in line with the #nochanges group, but 1) we are well beyond that point and 2) those people can pound sand. If you are going to trap me and others on an unbalanced server where my only options are to quit or reroll, then throw us a fricken' bone here to retain a presence on the server!

I'm a metal head. Undeads just fit way better to what I like and think is cool. Playing an undead warlock named after a metal band feels f\*cking badass sometimes. I also love the animations. Played Human Warlock back in vanilla and do not regret my switch at all. \\m/

Misgnomer can craft it on Alliance side.

Go mining and engy, but drop mining on your mage for something else, tailoring for RoA or if you have it you can go herb until ZG blood vine set is in and get tailoring again, if you don't intend to get tailoring at all then just any Prof or keep mining isn't bad

&gt; I know classic wow didn't launch with honor, but it rolled out way later, when most people already had 60s
---
Wasnt it the opposite? From what I recall from vanilla when the honor system launched was that there was initially a lot of wPvP between a lot of low lvls, and the occasional high lvl, most people didnt even have mounts I think. Might be remembering it wrong though.
---
Anyway what I think they screwed up in classic is that they released honor when a lot of people are pre-raid capped or even capped for T1 lvl items. Those people were already lacking stuff to do.

Yes, the ranged character has range on you before you use your gap closer...

---
They just need to allow free xfers to pve servers. I’m not of the crowd saying “you rolled pvp, deal.” I realize that no one who didn’t play on private servers knew this was coming.
---
I suffered enough on those to realize people go sick. For example there was a rogue that camped alliance that went to run RFD because (i think) it is the longest GY run in the game for them. Nearly an hr after arriving at the meeting stone, we corpse ran our way into the instance. I went to run it again 2 days in a row. Same rogue there, every time. I realized then if I played classic it would be on a PvE server.
---
That being said, if it is happening, it seems Blizzard doesn’t ban it. The only solution seems to be to go to a PVE server. I rolled on one because I expected things to be over the top. I still never expected anything near the videos I’ve been seeing. Some people’s fun is taking it away from other people.
---
Yes, you know what's a pretty major incentive? Playing with people you know outside the game. As if the only thing people consider when making their first toon is PVP/PVE and Horde/Alliance. Get real.
---
After killing the king all ogre-related mobs in the instance will be unattackable, save the minibosses and, that I know, 2 packs: The third pack of mobs to the left of the entrance and the pack at the narrow corridor after the second locked door.

I don't kill the bugs, so when the person comes over we kill it together. And them an invisi pot just to be safe at Guard Slip'kik. The last pack the person usually run with agro until the guy who gives the buff that says that you're the king.

With the rate I make money, I'm not willing to buy an expensive enchant like +30 spellpower for an item that I could be upgrading next week. It all depends on how much the money means to you. If you make 1000 gold a week then it's probably no big deal to drop a couple hundred gold on something you could be replacing soon. If you only make 100 gold a week and have other expenses to consider like your epic mount then you'll want to be sure you'll get a lot out of that kind of investment before you commit to it, so you should wait until you get a weapon you know you'll be hanging onto a long time before you enchant it.
---
"I refuse to spend gold on consumables or time leveling a profession that is essential to *every class* in raids but expect the healer to spend gold on consumables to heal me."
---
That sucks. Take solace in knowing that warrior is dumb. The extra 5 to axe skill makes Flurry Axe - a BOE that sells for less than 400g on most servers - a better offhand. If he's main handing Brutality he is even more foolish.

vocal minorities always cause the most shit. This is why guards are nearly invincible in retail(or were for a while when I last played) which made raiding towns impossible, and also why world pvp was dead.. Also why there are shit tier legendary class specific weapons everyone gets for free and welfare pvp armor. These people can't see past the tips of their noses and need to play a different game.
---
You. Don’t. Say.
---
Get a 10 - 15 or more man raid together and choose any zone. Make sure to have a mage or more to port out when you get outnumbered.  On whitemane, alliance groups take down every zone because horde are in groups of 2-5 or solo. Horde eventually overwhelms then and they port out but they wipe everyone out for a good 30 min until then and choose a new zone to go to. You are outnumbered overall but not outnumbered in group size. Horde doesnt run in groups that large since being in a 15-20 man raid when you massively outnumber the enemy is shit honor. Get on discord and get organized.
---
so much decision going on using one button tho
---
Do you really think they give a shit? You're on the one server where this is an issue for the Horde, every other server this is how it is for Alliance. They do not care about you, they do not care about me, they don't care about any of the faction imbalances.
---
It was same in vanilla war and chaos everywhere.Many servers are still balanced but yeah i understand that it sucks for some who have the unbalanced servers
---
Back in vanilla people didn't rush on forums to complain but logged on and just enjoyed the game
---
Well that's just not true.  They prosper regularly.
---
so ally players on horde heavy servers are supposed to do what? Not play the game?
---
100% you will get banned.
---
He made an alt is what I’m guessing
---
You dont have to have played BFA to have retail mentality. 
---
You are advocating for changes that were puzzle pieces of what ruined the game.
---
I'm sorry you're going through this.  It blows.  Your options are roll PvE or reroll somewhere on a PvP server that has the balance you want, but keep in mind it won't stay balanced because Blizzard sucks at managing PvP faction balance.  That or just keep being a punching bag for assholes. 
---
These kinds of problems were inevitable.  Blizzard doesn't know how to manage world pvp.  It's why they gave up and gave everyone the option to shut it off.  I didn't want to try and figure out if the server I rolled on would have reasonable faction balance so I just rolled PvE because while PvP can add a little zest to the game, it can also ruin it completely and who needs that crap.
---
My comment was in how they are proposing a solution that is, functionally, the *exact same as the one he is saying there are better solutions for*.  /u/Cholosolo didn't offer any specifics other than a 'cap' and 'forcing horde (the dominant population on most PvP servers) off'.
---
No, this is all wrong.
---
As an SL Warlock, I consistently lose fights to rogues who sap me and kill my pet. A good rogue will also kick seduce before it goes off.
---
I've basically given up killing good rogues 1 vs. 1.
---
don't really  have to bench them, they can come along and smite/feral/crit-kin or move to one of our other raid groups. hardcore raiders will make use of this bug if it isn't fixed, not sure what your point is
---
It was upvoted because a non-negligible portion of people playing this game have zero comprehension of the real world, existing only as a perpetual man child that believes everyone else is a perpetual man child as well.
---
I only have one toon and its level 46. I wish I had more time to play.
---
No, I think that's correct - infernal starts out enslaved, doomguard doesn't.
---
So u could make profit by doing this and selling on AH?
---
This all goes to shit if the Mage pops a FAP in response to your FAP.
---
Well, go ahead then, no one is stopping you.
---
Oh yeah, Haha.
---
a good lock will keep rank 1 corruption handy for those mana-draining dispels
---
You’re a genius hahahahaha
---
The going price is something like over $20 for 100g...
---
I bet his Gnome Mage has a pink beard.
---
I literally just told you it. 50g to one class is not 50g to another.
---
Are you intending on actually listening to anything I say?
---
Don't bother projecting your own anger, thanks.
---
And this isn't about raids, raids are different environments to dungeon groups and have accordingly different rules. Although if, as you seem to be implying, you are a *raiding warlock* who hasn't even taken the time to *level first aid,* all I can do is laugh at you and your "mountains of content."
---
Hunter damage doesn’t scale. 
---
Some abilities hit for a flat amount (x-xx dmg)
---
Some abilities hit for a scaling amount (weapon damage + 75)
---
Flat amount is good at the beginning, but quickly falls behind when more gear unlocks. Flat amount will always be x-xx, whereas weapon damage + 75 will increase as more weapons and better gear unlocks
---
any infos on this? so none managed to buy gold and live to tell the tale on classic wow?
---
i fear the latency more
---
Charge is 25 yards and they’re at 20. What’s the issue?
---
It is... Well, not always, but in this case it is.
---
allies have always been like this tho. im fairly certain it's majority ally players who turned the game into retail so its hard to tell was real and whats not with them lol.
---
That’s the whole point, I’m sorry if I did not word the beginning properly. There are many questions that needs answers to, so that this problem can be fixed. But everyone chooses to ignore them and say “why can’t you just do this”, like it’s some simple thing like flipping a switch. 
---
Also to say private servers can do it is a bit naive. Again, the current wow client, if I remember correctly is the one that’s been used since legion. Which is able to do both, and is something private servers werent. It’s a different beast and to say they are the same is :/
---
The one he's using is the updated census that is more accurate due to the removal of layering and more frequent scans.
---
For what? Killing a mob he tagged? Or report the one that Sheeped it to heal an already tagged mob?
---
Confused, who broke the rules here? NO one is enitited to a darn mob unless it's tagged.
---
I am a priest, you Can’ MC + Shield, look the tooltip
---
Wait, are you a dwarf warrior with a name that starts on H?
---

---
And spell batching on top of it. Blizzard might take a second to hit
---
You would be right.
---
this post really took me back man thanks. very similar memories.
---
You ever tried raiding as a blood elf paladin? Try timing your seal of blood procs. Its not luck. Its all skill.
---
Either an adult without coffee or a teen with their first coffee.
---
Woah there bud
---
Will work vs SM/ruin and destro locks, but if you see soul link just run away
---
Their detection rate on gold buying is VERY high, and it will likely result in an instant ban.  Blizz has systems that monitor for all the "gold-laundering" strategies sellers use, and most of the gold sold is obtained from hacking peoples' accounts anyways.
---
I am also on gandling as alliance. I tried to get some souls shards today. I will try again in a week. Getting raped immediately whenever i step outside a main city:P Now I only play once per week to do onyxia and mc. I like pvp and i usally love world pvp when its even or close to even. But this is a little to much. All the boats are filled to the brim with horde and every flightmaster is dead. But its nice to get a little break from wow. More time to play red dead redemption 2:)
---
Oh so the "slippery slope" argument. Great.
---
Dual specs as originally implemented were the most commonly requested feature in vanilla and universally loved when released. They would not hurt anything even if what they were eventually turned in to hurt the game.
---
Oh and you do realise that "doesn't agree with me" and "retail mentality" are not the same thing right?
---
Cute of you to assume a good Spriest would trinket kidney shot. 
---
Shadow form + talented shield + talented Inner Fire is enough damage mitigation to survive. Obviously gear plays a factor here but if the priest survives, you're dead. They don't even need a trinket.
---
Well I liked it. That’s not constructive nor criticism but there ya go.
---
Guys a jabroni. Dead spots arent exploits. If they were they would just make sure mobs had a "run over all terrain" mode. It's been done a ton, its been streamed a ton, and no one has been banned.
---
That’s worth it to lower level players I’d guess. Considering how much older the classic crowd is it’s reasonable to say many of them have professional jobs where they average that in under an hour of work. If your level 40 have 50g and make $50,000 a year it would make sense unless you are worried about getting banned/want to play the game without cheating.
---
DR is checked by the server every 5 seconds, and if it's been 15+ seconds since the last effect ended when it checks then it resets the DR. So DR resets anywhere between 15 to 20 seconds after the CC ends.
---
thank you for taking time to watch it I appreciate it ! :)
---
[Balance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0)
---
It is also account-based. Once you hit 5 ids, for example from farming brd arena, you can't enter any dungeons on an alt.
---
It's about 130€ for 1000g, worth it for me. Farming 1000G would take more time than "farming" 130€ irl
---
It’s $185 for 100g
---
The problem is that the changes would invariably be "Blizz-like" -- polishing out the idiosyncrasies that make Vanilla different from all of the expansions.  If we could change some of the elements of Vanilla with a random number generator, sure that would throw min-maxing for a loop and the game wouldn't be worse.  But that is not realistic.
---
Incidentally, Vanilla is much less solved than people think.  Some of the guides, BiS lists, and spreadsheets I've seen do not consider strategies that are better than those listed.
---
That’s multiboxing
---
camping gives shit honor / hour though, so does hanging in a 5+ man ganksquad (the honor is split per person). I lmao at all those zergs roaming around killing lvl 55's getting a few honor per kill, they might reach rank 10 in 6 months like that
---
Report to blizz
---
Is this new I did it once literally 10 years ago my friends did as well and none of us got caught.
---
Out of context? WHY? It's right there
---
&gt;Had this happen too. I ended up killing him because fuck the other hunter.
---
Are you saying he should had allowed the other hunter to act like a dick? Learn to read.
---
Oh yeah, meant for 10g
---
Done it a couple times, never banned. Always pretended like I knew the guy and invited them over to drink beer eat pizza play Nintendo listen to some Jack Johnson and fuck afterwards... Works every time
---
If you buy from guildie or friend You’re fine. If buy from a corporation. Yeah the chanses* increase.
---
Would you believe me if I told you its a constant 700+ ?
---
They removed the old EULA in wrath or something. The new one mentions almost nothing about any sort of griefing. I'd want to see them make a new one before they take action against anybody. As far as we know, currently most types of "griefing" is allowed as long as you're not breaking the game to do it. There's no real examples set by Blizzard on what is allowed and what isn't allowed. Without a new EULA it will probably lead to inconsistent bans.
---
You've never seen multi boxers before?
---
Lucky warlock if you get to use corruption. how do you determine which of the warlocks is the happy camper? They can't all get a slot for corruption.
---
Not just mind blast but any shadow spell for some reason always causes more threat. Mb does generate more threat as well but I could just flay and pull aggro sometimes too
---
Yeah lets hope the chips are good :)
---
But anyway I know not a single one that got banned for abusing the safe spots in zf, my mate does it to this day!
---
False
---
Did you apply renew along with shield unpess they get lucky crits.
---
It's still pretty easy. Just takes a little bit of practice.
---
It's not qol it's reworking a system 15 years old that was never good. Wow pvp has historically always been awful.
---
I actually have not, until yesterday
---
I'm not obsessed with defining who is and isn't white. Jews aren't white, though. Did you even read my posts?

&gt; Dual specs as originally implemented were the most commonly requested feature in vanilla and universally loved when released.

Oh so the "argumentum ad populum" argument. Great
---
Ayyyyye nice.
---
Keanu_winks_from_car.gif
---
Be even crazier if we actually know each other. Lol
---
If you really feel that way there is A perfect version of the game for you, its just not classic.
---
I've looked into selling and buying gold, talked to quite a few buyers and sellers and it seems to be a toss up. Do it smart or "sell" an item. Could even use AH and it's really hard to prove. Easy to flag, hard to prove.
---
Yes, I agreed it's a scam.
---
My point is that it's a worse world to live in if people can undo a trade they accepted after the fact. They should check the trade carefully before. Otherwise, you open up a variety of even worse scams.
---
Obviously not ALL encounters are going to start like that, but assuming a 1v1 where both classes are aware they're about to fight? Yes, you're getting Blizzard tagged before you're in Charge range unless the Mage doesn't know that trick. 
---
Sure, you can use Goblin Helm, Spider Silk, Tidal Charm, Bomb Dispenser, and the whole host of gadgets you've collected! So can the Mage though. Shit, one of y'all could have watched a Rextroy video and comboed for 8k damage for the one shot! Maybe you both did it together at the same time and killed eachother! 
---
Sure, we can concede this discussion to "Oh, if you have every possible Engineering item ready, equipped, off cooldown, and the enemy doesn't, you can win!" But it's very disingenuous to the conversation as a whole. 
---
I'm fine with FAPs in the equation, but even then we make the assumption that the enemy isn't using a comparable combat potion such as LIPs.
---
Daisy in shimmering flats got nerfed.
---
Okay then logout
---
But charlie you ARE the boonanner king
---
I expect so. Hoping Un’Goro is emptier.
---
Cringe.
---
Well now it’s my turn to laugh. Haha cute of you to assume a good rogue would even open up on you with a shield. I’d just sap you until the shield falls off. Which saves quite a bit about of time in murdering you :D
---
You could have saved time with your comment.
---
You could have just said: "I am a piece of shit like that guy".
---
You can't trinket a deathcoil. It's a horror ability. Ideally I would just open hard enough to force a sac then blind and sap off the sac.
---
Don’t feel bad. If the heals isn’t getting hit chances are it’s a dps issue. 
---
What I have noticed tanking and I’m a bear which has much better on demand agro then warrs
---
-ret paladins
---
-spriest
---
These two classes have absurd agro issues. It seems as tho they do so much threat it’s actually incredible. Obviously barring some incredible crits and lucky procs these two specs just do dumb amounts of threat.
---
So your point is JUST to complain about different classes having access to different ways of making money?
---
You are not even suggesting anything?
---
Wow you actually were serious... Did you ever consider that its the faction imbalance issues that make you think this way? See alliance favored servers.. its what you say, but flipped the other way.. does that not tell you anything? People that are assholes arent more inclined to roll horde or alliance... and same with people who will be more inclined to be a whiney baby.. its all just people.. on both sides
---
I'll do you one better and just unsub - Blizz fucked up big time with the launch on Classic and honestly I don't see it ever being enjoyable again at this point, it's just a private server with the added joy of having to pay a multibillion dollar company for the privilege of logging in. I don't pay fifteen bucks a month to be a chew toy every night for the 6000 horde on my server when that's already twice the population of what a real vanilla server was, and I don't know why anyone else would either.
---
Welp that is pretty insane. Makes sense though, as I am a few crit off without the buffs. That makes a lot of sense though. It is funny, because my guild forced all us tanks to reroll to fury prot (with the MT only at 3% hit). I was against it but they basically said tanking spots could be assigned differently so I respecced. Lo and behold there is no significant improvement, and we couldn't even down Rag.... the guild ended up getting blasted on FC for this and laughed at our logs and then the Raid lead said we should all switch back to prot, which is what I desired to begin with. Pretty funny yet annoying tbh. Now they researched how itemization works as well as rotations, and tried to school me on that even though I had been following FC for 3 months and had all BiS threat and hit cap with edgemasters (still didn't let me tank after we died to onyxia 9 times after I tried to demonstrate my gear was better). Anyways its good to know more of the math and phases since I have never played before.
---
a stupid ass meme that was never funny ever, but 12 year olds are adamant that it is
---
How much of a pinch can you be in to want to violate the ToU to buy gold? Nothing is forcing you to have gold.
---
What do people's natural born genders have to with their sexual orientation?
---
You seem like an ESL bigot with insufficient mastery of English to distinguish in writing between the various groups that disgust them.
---
Try again and explain how what you originally wrote, that homosexuals cannot reproduce without the aid of heterosexuals:
---
&gt; Kind of like how gay people rely on straight people to make more gay people?
---
I interpreted the comment as him coming across a hunter taming Broken Tooth essentially being the bad guy in the video above.
---
This is how alliance is on every other server. It's pretty aids.
---
Lol please do and tell me how wrong I am when that day comes. Right now I am going to tell you how wrong you are. I don't know how big the battlegroups will be, probably 4 realms put together. Horde have 1106285 players and alliance have  1084596 across all NA servers. These numbers are directly from  wow head at [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) 
---
This is a nearly perfect 50/50  split. Alliance tend to stay away from PvP more than horde, but by looking at these numbers everything is going to be fine, dare I even say perfect if the alliance aren't too scared to protect the Ashenvale forest, their resources and their pathetic Vanndar Stormpike.
---
Blessing of wisdom is a threat gain?
---
You remind me of that scene in Joker where he's at the comedy club laughing at all the wrong times.  You don't really get people, do you?
---
Sorry about the confusion.  I assumed you were admitting to trolling another hunter's tame.
---
I'm just a fool living in a bubble of hope. I'm only here for classic, I stopped playing retail years ago and I'm not even looking at shadowlands. I was hoping they would keep guys like me on the sideline on classic while doing their shadowlands thing.
---
Don’t transfer. I’m horde on Whitemane and I feel like it has a healthy population balance. Guilds like Smorc usually play at a different time frame.
---
Do night elves get sent to wailing caverns at all?
---
Any decent mage can juke a pummel.
---
Have you not sent the posts of players being contacted by GMs?
---
They restored my LOOT to how it was a week ago, left me with the 60g I had in my bag, and had 115g in the mail from a GM, which was the amount of gold I had a week ago. I made around 100g after taking into consideration some lost consumables from the loot reset and the lost PvP trinket. The end.
---
That’s not quite not existing lol
---
Anything of note there?
---
You'd want to use the savory deviate delight as soon as you finish the first run
---
Sounds expensive now I used to think it was cheap and I was like 13 when I bought it.
---
Ya you’re right I don’t get people because of a wall of text. How small can your IQ be?
---
Sounds like a bandage and a rage potion would be a nice combo right then.  Our tanks already have Ony on farm but good to know for when I eventually try and tank 'er
---
That gm is getting banned
---
Go make the trek to Blackrock Mountain.
---
roots not having DR is pretty insane when you consider how many are floating around out there
---
Hey now, I was able to kill several furlbogs today at 5 am server time before a was taken out by a pack of roaming horde.
---
It’s totally unplayable in any form from 6-9 at the moment though.
---
Mob grinding can always be switched out for instance runs. I like this one but it does include grinds: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFVcHPVjrskymxYOG9tIvzGQw63NUii7zWYXguHCG5Q/edit
---
90 runs, dropped twice, lost twice. last run I didnt reserve was #62 after I lost the roll. I like pairing with warriors farming sgc and healers farming 2nd wind. as long as the tank/dps are well geared, I've had little issue with lv52 healers
---
The family that plays raids together stays together
---
&gt;You’re comparing pro sports to teenagers playing video games
---
Most streamers are not teenagers
---
&gt;We’re talking about some idiot kid being an ass in an online video game vs pro’s who donate, do charity camps
---
PLENTY of streamers donate to charities. Alot of them donated to hurricane relief funds and team trees, among plenty of others. 
---
&gt;Many kids do play sports as well as watch
---
Most people who watch a streamers also play the games the streamer does
---
You're just upset I made fun of your enjoyment of watching grown ass men slide around on ice with sticks slapping at a rubber circle. Then they fight each other but it looks stupid because they are on ice and they are basically fighting like 2 teenage girls. Just holding onto each other and flailing around. 
---
Watching streamers is a valid form of entertainment. Just as much as hockey is (if not more lol)
---
What's the point of playing at all?
---
&gt;As I said before in the post you chose not to read, a smart mage combat tags with Blizzard at 30 yards. Charge has a 25 yard range. You are not getting a Charge off against a good mage. Smh man.
---
He’s a good RP’er, respect!
---
The fact that's all you have is almost as sad as the word enbies
---
When those people make up about 5% of the playerbase and their demands are detrimental to the game, yes they are worth ignoring.
---
Also private servers were more curated to fit a specific experience which, once again, never existed in vanilla.
---
&gt; PvE servers?
---
But they are for casual players. If you have limited play time you will remain "casual scrub" level in all aspects of the game from gold to gear to social interactions. Not that its a bad thing but you will not mesh or be able to play with people who can play 5+ hours a day.
---
Not on this server. People have been trying to sell shit for WAAAAAY over market price and wonder why nothing sells for weeks on end.
---
Your incentive will only cause more mass whining and complaining than we see now. People being able to play 50% grayscreen still &gt; people unable to play at all. It's laughable you can't predict this given how much you claim to understand human psychology.
---
Couldn't you use a restorative potion pre-emptively? Never seen people talk about using them for pvp, but combining them with free action potions seems like it would make you practically immune to cc for the duration.
---
He's friendly as horde too.
---
Oh son, most players have more than one account. And my 2nd account was opened to boost a bank mage to 40 so i could tp and make max profession like alch and tailor.
---
But its amazing to hear a true horde speak, putting a nail in his own coffin.
---
Cant watch right now. But is wall jumping a thing? I thought they said it wouldnt be. I used to explore so much. 1/3 of eastern kingdoms i undeveloped
---
Your great &lt;3
---
One hundred percent you can be banned.. It literally just happened to a guildie about a week ago.. 6 month ban.
---
All the value is in the smelting skillups since few useful recipes use it. People buy, smelt and resell. Smelting it destroys the value.
---
why? that set is... bad. and the tier 0.5 isn't any better
---
No RP’er would make an alt. How dare you.
---
&gt;I knew what I signed up for rolling on a PvP server but running into gaggles of kids like yourself that have nothing else to do but prevent others from enjoying this game isn't it.
---
Chill dude, you got more salt than tue dead sea.
---
You clearly didnt know what you signed up for. Thats a PvP server. Were not sitting and camping you, but if youre out in a PvP zone, you need to expect PvP.
---
Were PvPing. It gets us honor. Thats part of the game. When BGs open well be in those more but were still going to do hunting parties.
---
It sounds like you should have rolled on a Pve server. Thats what you want, to play the game in peace.
---
It's literally not.
---
Not sure when they put it in, because everything I find out about it is from peoples' support cases they post in misc wow classic communities.
---
I know they monitor auction house transactions, and sent mail/cods, so putting a single bullet on the AH for 1000g and the gold seller buying it will get you caught.  Having the gold mailed to you will likely get you caught (and best case you just lose the gold).
---
It's an 11 minute video that shows you can get in to BRD in ~6-8 minutes if you don't spend half the time narrating and spectating.
---
&gt; (within 1h)
---
Actually that's not entirely correct.
---
You could wait up to just over 2.5 hours even if you know the exact previous timestamp and earliest spawn of his random window.
---
I've very likely tracked BT more than any other person in the game. Have tracked all variables of like 50 spawns and helped around 40 people tame him.
---
Dude wtf thats so cringy.
---
And faction imbalance might not be caused by systems within the game but moreso lack of. There are certainly things that could be done to lessen the damage of faction imbalance for sure.
---
how much did he buy and from who?
---
I’ve been trying to apply this theory to RL but they won’t let me unsubscribe.
---
definitely looks like speedhacking but its almost borderline looks like it could be lag...need to see him run in a straighter line to be sure
---
As a warrior this makes my heart so happy
---
This
---
You could still probably pull your weight in cat form in 5s through sheer utility and wipe prevention, but it won't be through raw DPS numbers.
---
In Western Plaguelands? It's been a long time (more than 10 years ago) I can't really remember.
---
All I know was seeing a level "??" for the first time. I had no idea what it was so of course I got close to investigate. And then I died.
---
Playing a Druid. Been tanking. Faerie fire to pull a group of 3, and all the dps immediately start hitting different mobs before they get to me and I can get some rage built up. 
---
Fucking makes me be a ping pong trying to gather the mobs together to keep aggro. Just be a little patient and we can go faster. I occasionally hit too soon on my lock before that. Not all the time, just wasn’t as aware of it. But now, I’m definitely more aware and don’t dps as soon. I still pull aggro when I crit sometimes, but it’s much cleaner.
---
Naivete is believing people wouldn't want a project that embarrasses them to fail.
---
Nono you put Doom on critters to pad your stats.
---
Not if you're a warrior as I found out
---
That’s the 31 point Druid talent
---
Loved it man write more stories please
---
thats it?!
---
Did you forget a /s on the end there buddy? If not I dont know what to say.
---
I WISH I could transfer to a PvE server from Heartseeker. It's awful. I already just finished leveling one 60 and have another 57 warrior... no way I'm rerolling that much work to scratch.
---
Not exactly sure from who or how much.. I’d assume China.. but it sucks for all of us because we are Loot Council and he was almost full tier
---
Or 1, if you're extremely lucky
---
The hunter will let you in and show you exactly what to do.
---
You should still get your own key though. Just gotta run DM East once, not a big deal.
---
Hunter rogues and warrior use entangling roots and you’re goochie
---
People must be dense on your server. How many deposits must they lose before lowering prices? 
---
That sucks.
---
He griefed someone.
---
Sorry for you, but Horde in nutshell : )
---
\&gt; Fury warriors, to further distinguish spec identity, will now have no arms 
---
That's why they're so angry
---
When you’ve been playing this game for 15 years you start to run out of ways to have “fun”. 
---
Also most people make way more money now than they did when they were teenagers
---
This is the kind of person that you’d want to tell the guards and keep away from the Stormwind schoolhouse.
---
Would not make the instance before boarding
---
Even the explanation I could find was hard to interpret. It sounds like you start a duel with your buddy, and while the duel is ongoing you MC the target and make him hit your buddy, removing the honorless buff.
---
Normally, your buddy would appear as friendly to the target but since you're dueling him, he's hostile.
---
Terrible advice. Sometimes you need downtime, and video games make me happy. :)
---
Ive been in dungeons for about 2 weeks now, not since p2 released have I quested, not for any other reason than I enjoy the level 40-50 dungeons. 
---
Decided to go to Hinterlands to do some Elite quests cause the gear is really good. Even on a Horde dominated server we spent as much time dead as alive getting killed by roaming 60 gank squads. Got about half a quest down then back to Mara.
---
Same here. Tanking on my Druid, warlock sitting 100% health 20% mana after each fight when after every or every other pack I say life tap and cast a healing touch and regrowth each time. Never understood :( cast a hot at 90% life, start tapping while we move on to next pack.
---
How do you delete other peoples you tube videos?
---
I advise against farming any specific items while leveling. If you do the run for quests and XP and get it that's great, but don't stick around too long. Very few items pay off. Biggest offender being the Whirlwind Axe.
---
Well they are gathering a lot and selling it below market value. He's probably not paying anything for his subscription plus he gets play the game with one of them.
---
It's an 11 minute video that has multiple edits and from the perspective of a class which has access to stealth.  If you were playing a class that did not have stealth you would be instantly stunned or rooted the instant you rezzed, you'd be lucky if you were able to take two steps before dying again.  Your progress towards the instance would be exactly the max distance you can rez from your corpse every 2 minutes.
---
Disagreements: Majors are a waste of (on my server) 2 gold each. Superiors are 100% good enough with current content. Same for Nightfin soup. Greater Sagefish are a whole two less MP5 and cost a fraction as much. 
---
I've yet to use any elixirs, runes, or green grogs. The occasional Deviate and Winterfall for the lulz though.
---
That’s the only way you win. A good warrior won’t pummel at the start of the cast either. How many polys are you going to cancel with a warrior with recklessness on top of you?
---
They do.
---
Frost shock, keep lightning shield up, fire totem. You basically whittle then down and create some space to get 1-2 casts off.
---
Yeahhh it is cringy, whatever.  Give me an example of something that can be done to lessen the damage
---
I always make jokes to my healing buddy I have two mana bars.
---
ive stopped progressing altogether irl cause ive realized that stuff has no interest to me.
---
How much gold have you made from it? A rough estimate will do if you don’t have exact numbers.
---
Get more stamina. 100% Glass cannon isn't Best-In-Anything.
---
Do I smash the living hell out of my 2 button like a barbarian, or do I gently caress it like a gentleman? 
---
Tough call, mage is hard.
---
They would need to monitor the account. Theirs obviously a chance your buddy IRL might mail you 1000 gold.
---
World PvP is bad and doesn't work, end of story
---
Read your post lol. You said yourself the mage has only 20y on the warrior. Smh
---
Well i am part of a group of 6 hordies who just ditched faerlina yesterday. I say we encourage my horde to join Earthfury cause tbh that place isnt very nice
---
It’s bis for hunters
---
some people are just fucked in the head
---
**DEER NOISES**
---
This is where I think something like an immunity timer (after a PvP death) as a hotfix until BG would really help fix things. Obviously tested by Blizzard so players couldn’t abuse but you get the idea. 
---
Or fix the 2:1 server populations by capping population of each side or something. Idk but it’s getting ridiculous for you guys on PvP servers.
---
Man paladins killing themselves with SoB while bursting never failed to get a laugh :p
---
The aesthetic and I've always preferred horde over alli since wc2... it's just more badass. If alliance had a race I thought was cool I would play it, they are just boring tho imo
---
Unsure if i should Level my 40 Orc Warrior to 60, or just gear my 60 UD Warrior
---
Being Orc feels kind BiS in PvP
---
Stealth mage.

Stubility and frost

As someone who strictly PvPs in OSRS, the voting system is a fucking plague. ANY PvP update gets downvoted, even if it doesn't affect non-PvPers. PvM players in OSRS will literally just shit on any PvP suggestion if it isn't convenient for them. Also, the day they added the grand exchange, the community died. As much as people have whined about phase 2 on this reddit with trending posts virtually every day, and the fact that huge streamers like Asmongold also whine about it, if classic had a voting system we would absolutely at some point have warmode in classic, effectively making all servers PvE servers. Fuck letting the community decide. Community input is what made classic go to retail. I'd rather give the WoW team the reins and let them figure out what is reasonable without much community input.
---
Honestly, I really wish the "Honor" system was A LOT more developed than just a kill point system, with Honorable and Dishonorable paths, with multiple tie-ins with reputation. Kill someone, have instant reputation repercussions depending on whether the kill was justified or not.
---
Every action would have its weight, and you'd have to live with the consequences. Could be really awesome.
---
Unless your warlock doesn’t realize you just gave them 2 hots. One to heal them from 70%, then, both to continue healing so they can tap a few more times. It pains me as a lock main :(
---
Leaving a comment to find the link later.
---
After orcs.
---
I tried offering advice, but I guess I should have just said " You had over 2 months to hit 60, It's your own fault for not being 60 already."
---
“Same game” lol
---
lol "wash," please.
---
..
---
No seriously, please wash.
---
I'm still just 54, but was considering moving over to protection for leveling dungeons, but maybe ~57+ would be better.
---
You have ZERO reading comprehension dude.
---
We started this conversation talking about Intercept. If we're talking about Intercept, this relies on the assumption that we are currently in combat. You make the statement that a Warrior will not Intercept until he sees the blink. I make a counterpoint that the mage has range on you. I then pose a rhetorical question:
---
What's currently happening in this duel?
---
It's rhetorical because the answer is you're being kited to death. If you are in Combat and cannot Charge, and you are saving Intercept for Blink, and you are out of range, you are dying.
---
You then attempt to BACKTRACK to Charge, despite the fact that we were talking about Intercept. I'd addressed why you can't get the Charge in this theoretical. This hypothetical mage is smart enough to blizzard you out of range.
---
And ever since, you've been using circular reasoning, bringing me back to the same point's I've already told you. It's ridiculous dude, learn to cede a little ground. Here, I'll cede all of it!
---
You get the Charge off! You have a FAP popped! Recklessness is UP! You're ON THE MAGE!
---
\*Mage pops LIP. You eat a full duration Polymorph.\*
---
I use to sheep people and walk away. Now I slay everyone. 10 corpse runs a day to get into brd will do what to you.
---
Several things send up ted flags to me.  This looks fake.
---
It is one of the best items available for a dagger tank (ie a tank without an otherwise useful weapon skill racial may use dagger weapon skill items). 
---
And its one of the best 1H items for hunter melee options.
---
But rogues will benefit the most by far and should at least be prioritised in a guild group if not elsewhere.
---
Server wide disconnects every 4 minutes so we forget about the chat not working :)
---
Lmaoo I busted out laughing
---
Well, maybe I just have a good guild, but if I am ever having trouble, I can get a group of 10-15 other Allies to help me out in high traffic contested zones, because we have quite a few people on the honor grind. If there's too many to horde to fight (happens often), we usually can port out with the help of a mage. 
---
We just lost a Kazzak spawn, but not before wiping the horde for about an hour. 
---
It's about perspective. We're obviously outnumbered in a lot of situations, but that's more of a reason to seek help and band together, rather than corpse running to a destination solo. You don't have to be 60 to do this either, just invite people out in your leveling zone.
---
What do I benefit from? I am an alliance on 30-70 (30 alliance 70 horde) realm in EU. I can't even fly to fucking lakeshire without dying there. These days the only thing i can do is raidlog( and die 5x before i can enter dire maul for buffs), in addition to even get to MC we need to cooperate multiple guilds so we can even enter. Last straw is that casual guilds
---
I would like to see a gearlist aswell!
---
Can’t you see that OP is HORDE, the problem is server balance not just “force horde off”
---
Druids - any class that can fear you, as they cannot break fear. Mainly this is warlocks and shadow priests, but hunters too when facing feral druids.
---
Really, the only way for a druid to deal with this, when facing good players, is to have both the PvP trinket to break the first fear, the blacksmith trinket for 30 sec of fear immunity, or a stack of restorative potions.
---
Even then, druids need the PvP blue 4 set bonus of +15% speed in all forms, as this is the only way as a feral to deal with hunters, as a good hunter will OOM a druid via kiting (the druid can either eat the damage in bear form, or run out of mana shifting). The +15% speed solves this by making bear form harder to kite, and cat form much harder to kite.
---
Lastly, a feral druid needs all around gear most of the time to PvP, and very few pieces outside of the PvP set has enough melee and spell damage stats for PvP. It means a lot of matchups will be tough until you get that rank 10 PvP set.
---
One of the top alliance guilds on my server has several alts parked there for summoning their players as it's a decent grinding spot with no competition.  
---
Ive gone a couple times to make them miserable xD
---
ON YOUR KNEES, INSECT!
---
The game was already downhill at that point
---
Serious question
---
So if this site is even a little accurate why do people keep saying the horde BG queues will be so bad. It looks to me like it’s kinda of even overall.
---
Other way around for me. But it pains me trying to help the warlock/healer when bear tanking and healing between pulls but the lock won’t understand or catch the pattern :(
---
I think my server has a Horde advantage, but with the honor system being out and 5x the population actual Vanilla servers had, zones just trade back and forth between factions. Worse on severely imbalanced servers.
---
You really can't quest anywhere, since at any point a group of 3+ enemies can roll through and destroy you. Shit, even if I was 60, there's just nothing you can do if you get run over by an entire group.
---
People can "Hurr, yOu PiCkeD a PvP seRVeR!" all day, but this was clearly not intended. I have no problem getting jumped by someone my level or a group occasionally: I expect that. I expect to do that when I am farming or questing with friends.
---
But an endless stream of enemy faction players just camping a zone is not fun. I can't imagine it is much fun for them either: they're just trying to farm Honor the only way they can right now.
---
im at 107 same here. i just gona give up and throw my dkp on a BB or Pred...
---
It's difficult to speculate, but I have only respec'd once so far as a warrior; at 55 to switch from Arms to Fury. I would totally have been switching to a prot build during my dungeon farming recently when i got called on to tank. Instead I've stuck with fury and just did my best with tanking gear on.
---
Usually to get good aggro to begin with, I will go in zerker stance to use berserker rage and then go to arms and charge.  After first hit use thunder clap and immediately stance dance to defensive and hit Bloodrqge to get rage and demo shout.
---
Knowing if someone is going to dps hard from the get go, as with spriests that don’t wait, you can always make sure to concussion blow that mob and start tab sundering other jobs.  Make sure to not use taunt yet on the mob you know is getting aggroed on by the spriest.  Once the concussion blow is gone, use taunt since it will match your threat to the spriest and continue sundering there.
---
That’s how I deal with people that I know will not wait for threat.  Hope this helps.
---
If you're alliance its THE most secluded farming spot in the game that very rarely has any horde players visiting because even the ones that know about it can't actually farm there as the mobs are friendly to them.
---
What a bunch of spin. This incident is all on your stupid hunter.
---
:) congrats hunter bro!
---
First time I received a cross faction whisper it blew my mind. The guy had been fighting a quest turtle in the hinterlands as an alliance warrior but he was lower level than he should have been and was clearly about to die. I, a 60 warrior, taunted the turtle and let him kill it while it beat on me. It was funny when he saw me come up and started running initially, thinking I was just going to gank him. after it died he said thanks
---
(I think he friended me via real ID but I'm honestly not 100%)
---
OP. The game is not broke. You, and many, many other players made the mistake of rolling on a PvP server without adequately preparing for phase 2. Transfer to a PvE server and stop complaining to others about your lack of foresight. If you didnt see this coming, you werent paying attention. You are being punished because you made a series of bad decisions that led to you being camped with no recourse. 
---
Move to PvE/Normal/RP servers, people like you are why they exist.
---
The thing that people haven’t talked about on this topic is that even a smaller discrepancy is pretty bad. On Kurrinaxx - one of the bigger west coast servers - I would say the balance is less than 60/40 in favor of horde, and the game is still completely unplayable. I have an identical story to this from just last night - logged in twice during the day to try and do some dungeons. Took a jed/rend run around 60 min to get into the instance. Later in the evening, we tried to do DM:N and I died NINETEEN times between IF and zoning into the instance. Took well over an hour, and by the time all 5 of us zoned in the mood was so bad the run collapsed 15 min into it. And this is on what I expect is no more than a 58% horde populated server (according to early census...but maybe the sample size is too small and P2 might have skewed it more).
---
I mean youre looking at the character ass the whole time. Might as well look at some tauren female booty all day long
---
Exactly this IMO.
---
how do you turn the pvp flag on/off
---
I’m a level 50 mage and I’ve had lvl 60 warriors decked in more than average gear try to gank me. While I can’t kill them I can for the most part escape without dying. Enough said.
---
They should just allow the entire alliance on your server to bail out, and see how much fun you have.
---
Ah yes I was only including heal power from gear. (At work so looking at Sixtyupgrades.)
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 
---
After every pack “life tap”. They still had to be reminded the whole dungeon
---
I do that all the time. The spit. Not make an alt and cry just the spit
---
Thats amazing, very good meme template aswell
---
No greater than a 60:40 split logged in. That'd help the severely imbalanced servers.
---
MC has better options for hunters
---
Yup. Faction imbalance is always frustrating so why make it worst with a PvP server? Way back in Vanilla, I rolled PvE because I had played PvP during beta and it felt insanely imbalanced to play certain classes as then classes had not been fully tuned and some even had talents before others. And that is with the factions being fairly even. It gave me an idea of what it COULD be like when PvP was imbalanced for your faction or class so for the actual release of Vanilla I chose PvE.
---
Now I am on a PvE server as Horde where the Alliance outnumber then 4:1 (Pagle btw). If this was a PvP server, I would be in hell like OP described. Instead, when Alliance are rampaging around Orgrimmar, I can choose not to fight them. While it is still annoying when they kill the auctioneer to try to bait the fight, I can just afk for a bit or conduct other business in game like farming herbs. Yeah, it is still frustrating that due to the number of people on their server they have patterns Horde doesn't (like Lionheart Helm) or that they hog more of the server resources like Black Lotus or Arcanite Crystals. But I can still play.  
---
And then when I choose to PvP, I can PvP. I love to PvP. I am #21 in the overall standings this week and #47 last week. I run around unflagged in the open world as many of us do. In fact, I typically organize an Orgrimmar defense raid every night to go back and forth with Alliance and we are able to do fun tactics like synchronized warlock infernals or flanking Alliance out the side gate. Shit is fun as hell. Is it optimal honor gain to be in a raid? No, but that's the other thing I've found on Horde side of my server - we typically care more about just killing people and having a good time than min-maxing our rank. I think many people don't realize that this really should be the golden age of world PvP and it is a shame that actual PvP servers can't experience it due to faction imbalance. 
---
And then when I am done, I can be done. Best of both worlds.
---
After all the dagger rogues have you can give to tank
---
Try this: don’t play with idiots that buy gold... literally ASKING for a ban
---
And what would you say about a fury warrior if he needed it on it .
---
The whole “low effort” rule is so stupid, it basically says it’s against the rules to relate real life memes to classic wow
---
Darn port fucking sucks for ony tho
---
Check it out when using reckoning too! Chance for like 6+ hits! With SoC!
---
And less casual players happily respec before and after every raid for 100g. Even on alts.
---
Paladin is a free kill for warlock. Fear + DPS then run away while waiting for fear DR and rinse/repeat until dead.
---
I switched at 58 from Arms to Prot. I had a hard time adjusting to not having the aoe of sweeping strikes at first, but i found it to be quite powerful and useful for dungeons. Shield Slam is a huge threat attack, and the stuns in prot are really nice for slowing down the damage you take.
---
if hes not a race that has weaponskill-perks, sure
---
I recommend thinking about tanking as a druid. Feral tank is really casual friendly and easy to gear compared to warriors. (Raid performance is better/worse than warrior depending on current phase). 
---
If you want to have feral tanking material, look up skarns guide.
---
Any idea of a build/gear you were using? Was it spellpower x thunderstrike ?
---
Or maybe just play the game as it is supposed to be played instead of buying gold?
---
Friends rolled horde. Cannabalize with life tap is op.
---
I want to be a prot warrior with points in combat. GIVE ME RIPOSTE, COWARDS! I guess a 3 minute cooldown evasion would be nice too.
---
It’s BIS for hunter but it’s just a stat stick for hunters. Rouges should have priority since it increases rouges offhand DPS in addition to the stats. The analog be like giving an epic bow to a non hunter when there were hunters that still were using blue quality bows. Makes the most sense to give weapons to the users for primary weapons first and then stat sticks to the people who need them later. My two cents as a hunter.
---
Shit like this is exactly why I'm glad I rolled PvE this time around.
---
What leatherworking spec should I go as an enhancement shaman?
---
Niçe
---
Camping that boat is honestly bullshit and blizzard needs to so something about it. Anyone the horde catch on that boat will be stuck in a permanenet rez-death look until they spirit rez.
---
Seems more like he just got robbed. Scams are usually somwhat complex.
---
Thats when you contact his gleader.  Had a really douche player like that and someone else told their gleader what they were doing.. Instant gkick from a good guild.
---
True, thunderstrike is true bis
---
are you sure the fireball is killing you and not the deep breath?
---
&gt; The bottom line is that this wouldn't be acceptable in other multiplayer games.
---
You know what you sign up for when you go onto a PvP server.
---
Heartseeker, you know, the server that's in the title of the post?
---
He was a human and won.
---
Actually, that one is simple. When the server doesn't perform dozens of checks for each piece of data sent by the client, the game experience can be much smoother. But there's a reason for the saying "**NEVER** trust the client".
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/6bpid7/never_trust_the_client/
---
Yeah, come on. At least have the decency to just blackmail for a bit of gold instead.
---
LUL EU
---
I remember LOVING pvp in vanilla (played at launch). Huge battles. Mostly fair. It wasn't like it is now. I don't know.. maybe it was just because I had more time to put up the BS back then.
---
If the mage is smart he doesn't even try using frost nova since you have a free action potion up
---
How do you use the auction house?
---
The only enhancement shaman I've raided with just ooms himself doing bad DPS and never keeps windfury up so....
---
I started WoW Classic in September, rolled a Horde Troll Shaman on Kirtonos named Sharani! My fiance, a decade-WoW-veteran, showed me all the ropes on his Orc Warrior Zall. At first the game was exasperating for me because I couldn't figure out how to take on multiple mobs without dying (you just don't at level 5 lol), how to position myself, how much walking there was (a lot) but... it definitely grew on me. Wild moments in dungeons, incredibly friendly and helpful players and even nice Alliance passerby (until phase 2), and colorful loot! I'm level 58 now and looking forward to what FORTY-gamer raids will be like :o
---
I drew this fanart to picture Sharani and Zall water-walking on the northwest coast of Desolace after getting camped by Alliance at the sunken ship lol. Even though Zall often "carried
---
 Sharani, I'd like to think at times like these Sharani's spell-casting carried Zall.
---
Literally everyone I know who isn't a raidlogger and plays max 10-15 hours a week happily respecs before and after raid. Why should they cater the game towards casuals? That's literally what they did with retail and it didn't end well at all.
---
On thunderfury as well. I feel like alliance may even have the slight edge. In neutral zones a usually see more alliance than horde
---
This is in line with what people were saying back in September but a lot fewer are allowed on each realm now, right?
---
Ahahah yes, he’s fattening the calf for the slaughter.
---
I do appreciate your feedback :D
---
They were 4-6g per stack on my server until this week.
---
How did the Anal [insert spell name] meme begin. Enlighten me about all things Anal [insert spell name].
---
Inb4 your post has been removed
---
Rule 7 of this sub is complete trash
---
What's that one enchanting item that's required for a quest?
---
Yeah basically. I play on a PvP server. I did 30+ corpse runs to complete the Ony quest chain in BRD during phase 2. It added an additional 1 - 2 hours to my playtime that most casuals don't have.
---
I didn't rage quit because I had plenty of time to do those corpse runs. I literally did not care how many times I died. 
---
Sounds like you have an issue with getting ganked. Why? Is it the time it takes?
---
&gt;8-10
---
Higher than that! https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/14381289405
---
Lol this scenario is too real. I'm on a PvP server and was level 54 when Phase 2 started. ~ Not what I expected ~
---
The stun is also huge if you treat it as a taunt for losing off mob aggro to your healer. In vanilla, I was a Tauren warrior and it really helped to have a few stuns in addition to taunt.
---
In a 1v1 the rogue will bleed you, slow you, and kite you around till they have to reapply bleed... No rogue worth their salt will stand and fight you or try to burst you
---
Sounds like an offended mage ;)
---
Faction specific queues, lower overall population caps and faction specific transfers till every server naturally balanced out at the ~60/40 ratio that we currently have across all servers.
---
"Mage exploit" lol. This post reeks of being jealous mages can farm this. And no it's not an exploit and no one's been banned for it.
---
Lmao at thinking a frog is a symbol of "hate"
---
but it's totally okay to be prejudiced against people who choose a specific avatar! /s
---
Isn't there a moonwell in SW?
---
Im running my decked out level 29 gnome rogue twink up in Hillsbrad Fields. Having a blast griefing questers and aoe-grinders, killing them several times in a row. Often one ambush is enough. Got 280 kills already, getting PvP Trinket this wednesday.
---
Just some perspective from a corpse camper, albeit a low level one :)
---
A fucking men
---
Do they not kite him? Bleeds aren't affected by armor
---
What would one farm there? Runecloth and random BoE drops are the only thing of note in the loot table.
---
Maybe it will incentivise the over populated to transfer and help balance. Most are too lazy and having too much fun 5v1 honor to even think about transferring. Give them a queue and let them think about it with a free transfer option.
---
I have a mage friend in kargath on my server. He waves at everyone he gives a port to. I wave on all my characters. He sometimes won’t accept my money, so I mail it. He then returns it with 2x the amount I sent. I return that and it turns into a little game with funny notes. I sold him a bunch of rune cloth I bought cause I saw him in trade looking when I was on my bank. Sold it for about 30s less per stack than current market (what I bought it for). 
---
Not all mages just click open trade and take your money. But it’s a two way interaction and you can built a rapport. If I’m there and I need a port, I go to him 100% of the time. I’m a loyal customer.
---
If you are in the majority, you arent going to move to the opposite. All you are going to do is end up with faction specific realms
---
I really want to combine that with piercing howl and 2wf from fury but I'd have to go without anger management. I think in most situations I would be fine but it would take more focused moves. Charge in, piercing howl, a sunder or whatever uses up rage, then switch to defense stance.
---
There are probably valid and logical reasons to not do this but it sounds like fun.
---
Back off, Jack Johnson is a treasure
---
I’m on a less populated server and made it in 3 last time as a hunter
---
Got a 60 UD Warrior, and a 40 Orc Warrior, do you think It's worth leveling the Orc? For PvP purposes
---
Meme specs yayyy
---
I'm away from my char right now for the holidays so maybe I misremembered or I'm forgetting something so maybe its roughly 22% nature crit (with talents of course). As far as trinkets go I can't make my mind up. I generally rock briarwood all the time and rotate between the crit one, class SP trinket, or engineering trinkets.

---
Rogue has 2 surefire cookie cutter specs en, Combat swords and dagger, after AQ40, Seal fate daggers too. However, Combat swords is always the best cookie cutter spec overall in classic.
---
I have grouped with quite a lot of warriors thus far who have absolutely no clue how taunt works and will start the pulls of by taunting skull before anyone has even damaged it. So do yourself a favor and make sure you know the function of taunt it can actually make a huge difference.
---
Heart seeker is gonna fill up crazy fast. There are more horde pvp players than alliance.
---
Shouldn't you be the one providing arguments since you're the one suggesting a change? Why do I have to defend keeping things the way they were in classic?
---
But respecs are a meaningful gold sink in the game and they also make your spec more meaningful. Means that for example every mage you invite to your group is not identical. There are other reasons I could come up with, but you're the one who is supposed to be providing the arguments, not me.
---
Real talk, this is a marvel.  Think of all the labour that went into making this. Pretty fucking deadly if you think about it
---
You replied to a post disagreeing that Shadowguard is the best priest racial.
---
I just wanted to help you understand why you were wrong.
---
If you want to pick the subpar choice for funsy-doodles, more power to you!
---
If you’re a Druid, the trick is to cast an innervate on a mage conjuring water. I’ve gotten so many free stacks of water in a city or kargath without even asking.
---
The thing is it wouldn't be 60/40 total, it would be 60/40 current. A server could be 60/40 total but may be, at any given moment, 80/20.
---
Even if it were 50/50 there's no guarantee that the horde aren't just in a PvP mood and the alliance aren't. It happens. It's part and parcel of a PvP server.
---
I agree with your point about stalagg. I'm not there anymore, but a lot of streamers I follow are grinding pvp hard on that server, and I can see how Horde might feel that alliance holding up really well. However, that only works for absolute pvp tryhards, and even then those can get burned out from having their 2v2s turn into 2v10s all the time (ahmpy comes to mind, he wants to solo farm honor but is tried of the corpse-walks).
---
However, as an alliance on heartseeker, I also think people underestimate how bad the minority faction has it. A lot of alliance on HS think the horde is doing well, because they prevent them from leveling in un'goro, or they run into 5-man ganksquads on the way to DM every time. That's because all the horde they see are the couple hundreds of PvP tryhards grinding it out every day. They're not seeing the people like OP who are literally getting farmed in the middle of Orgrimmar by alliance rogues desperate to find some action.
---
Hunters scan suck a dick if they think they're getting strikers mark over a melee because they have blues
---
Can someone confirm hitcap for white dmg for rogues? The official discord says hit continues to be useful above 9%, as it improves hitchance for dual wielding. Dual wielding adds 19% miss chance. 
---
However, they have a pinned doc that calculates crit Chance. In that doc, additional hit chance does not affect the Chance to hit. Because the 19% miss added by dual wielding used to be flat and unchangeable - only after patch 1.8 did hit affect dual wielding hit chance. But classic is supposed to be based on 1.12
---
I could not find evidence of which is true in classic. Hope I understood the subject correctly, otherwise I'd be happy to be enlightened :)
---
In a duel you're supposed to let the rogue open on you, if we're talking about 1v1 organized. In the open world anything goes but a good rogue is going to pick and choose their battles and when to open so they are rarely gonna get yanked
---
I mean it’s pretty easy to see why people don’t want changes.  Blizzard has a track record of turning a great game into a terrible one, one cut at a time.
---
classic isn't for everyone, retail isn't for everyone. 
---
Personally, when I am done with classic, I am unsubbing. Retail has no appeal to me.
---
3 accounts is nothing. There’s a dude out there literally 40 boxing
---
What class are you?
---
I was a BE pally in BC. SoB procced in every auto when I played
---
You're missing his point. Tanks usually don't farm the 1% drop items, the DPS do.
---
Some people sell the other four accounts when they get to 60. Others like the effect it has in pve/pvp.
---
I'm not sure exact what you expected. Even if pops were vanilla-like, people would still have camped fps. It was a thing in vanilla.
---
If the pop is too high for you, you'll have to transfer.
---
Like people did in vanilla
---
strikers mark is obviously a different story due to it being super fast and thus not useful for hunters.
---
ye, people tend to have so much dps so if all dps targets a cater it insta dies and tank can focus on all other
---
Horde gets their asses stuffed 24/7 on grobb
---
Sucks to be stereotyped, doesn't it?
---
It should go to Rogues, Fury DPS, and any tanks that want it before it ends up in the hands of a hunter. Any of you huntards that are blindly following BiS lists posted on any number of sites need to pull your heads out of your asses and realize why they even list them as options in the first place. Once you've figured it out, it's easy to see why you don't need it right now. HINT: It's the same reason why rolling on Dal'Rend's is fucking stupid.
---
/rant
---
Thanks, I feel better getting that off my chest.
---
Learn to range pull instead of charging everything in the dick.
---
Ha. I rolled Horde for classic but was always Alliance back in Vanilla days.  
---
I had completely forgotten about Woo Ping.
---
You seem like someone with nothing to contribute to the conversation.
---
Wait, really? Im horde on Bigglesworth and to me it feels like Alliance are dominating! lol. Alliance death balls can consistently be found at the Bulwark, right outside UC, in and around BRD/MC entrance, Kargath, that chokepoint in Feralas, and a few other places. Its interesting to hear an opinion from the otherside because this whole time I thought we were outnumbered lol.
---
It actually is bis for hunters. But obviously that doesn't mean you should give it to them.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Pretty much any channeling or spell breaks it. Some rogue things like poisons sprint etc. say in their tooltip that it doesn't break stealth but that's all.
---
Well I’m sorry I have a life and had to stop playing for a while so I could focus on other things.  I guess if I take a break I’m not allowed to go on the games subreddit anymore
---
Talk about r/gatekeeping , oh my god.
---
It's not even the same because every other MC run gives hunters a better and free bow + staff. Imagine if rogues had a sword combo better than viskag/brut that dropped every other MC run, AND there were half as many rogues by default. I'd be comfortable letting fury warriors take them over rogues. We've been selling all leaf and sinew drops for weeks in both our MC groups and all 4 of our ony groups and sometimes bring hunter alts instead.
---
Put skull on a soft target such as non elite and casters, they dont hit no where near as hard as mele elites. Then just let it run away, can taunt if they bring it to you.
---
Who wants kids?
---
You must be an Alliance player. I, too, have spent a lot of time in the graveyard.
---
I would probably quit the game if I dealt with half the shit you describe. I rolled in a PvE server and am glad. PvP is there if you want it and you do your thing without getting harrassed. I hope you get it figured out because the game is no fun when you can't play due to griefers.
---
Considering switching myself, my warrior is level 57, I have put so much into it but I honestly do not think I can tolerate 1 hour corpse hopping to get into instances anymore
---
Or you can be a pala tank and GBK spam after she fireballs you
---
Wow imagine being this soft over online behaviour in a video game about pvp
---
Got cruel barb on my rogue in vanilla, friend put a minor beastslaying on it for me and i thought having a red glowing sword was the coolest.
---
Nah, this is for (non human) warriors because they need edgemasters to hit 305 weapon skill. Rogues get it from talents anyway so you’re fine.
---
Well I'm alliance and I would say the same about horde lol but this is what I'm talking about. Everytime I see our server brought up its this lol.
---
Groupwide
---
I'm pretty sure that as long as you have black smiting and mining, your experience won't be too bad. Hell, it might even be enjoyable to craft an item just to give it out to a fortunate low level pali or a fellow warrior. At least, that's my experience so far..
---
Question about tanking high level dungeons like scholo/Strath/ubrs without being a tank spec.
---
So I just hit 60 and have pretty decent preraid BiS gear but it's pretty squishy armor like leather and mail. So I have another set of armor that's all plate and has defense rating on almost all of them. 
---
Now Im wondering if I could tank high level dungeons like UBRS without being a tank spec, and with just my tanking gear. I've basically tanked every instance but I'm pretty scared of UBRS bc I'm not the proper spec.
---
Does any of this matter? Or does it just matter if you know the dungeon and if you have a decent healer?
---
Well yeah I know that, but the wee lad at level 10 doesn’t have a ranged weapon yet lol.
---
The trick was to switch from seal of command, to seal of blood and command would proc off of blood, and youd have better proc chances. If you timed it at the right moment of the swing, you could do massive damage. 
---
It was the only way to stay competitive as raiding DPS pally. Horde only.
---
Im alliance on benediction and I've never been camped before. I must be lucky.
---
How is making 50 gold a good night? If you're trying to make gold that's like 60-75 minutes of concentrated farming
---
It’s a god damn video game sub and they want to be all high-horse about their fucking memes...
---
Should? No. Can? Sure. Though I’ve never personally charged or said a cost. Ive just always been tipped without asking. Nothing wrong with just being helpful to another human being on the other side of the monitor.
---
True. I meant using Nova after the charge if the warrior hasn't FAPed yet. If you catch them with the Nova prior to the FAP, they are proper fucked.
---
If the warrior has already used FAP, just wait them out and try to get any distance you can. Ice Blocks and Shields are going to keep you in good shape and if you create the space to cast poly, you win. If you can stay alive until the FAP is done, you win. If the warrior is overlevled/geared or gets some lucky crits, you might lose...but you'll win a majority of fights even against charging, fapping warriors.
---
Got some news for you: the solution is rolling Alliance as the underdog.
---
I'm assuming you are combat, which means you only need 1% hit from gear then the value of hit falls off fast.
---
Private server code was different than classic so hit was more valuable on PS than it is in classic.
---
Shame it's on a troll.
---
Sounds like someone's butthurt over rolling on a PvP. Quit crying and re-roll.
---
Should prolly reroll to a non-Zerg realm/faction then
---
Consider getting a mage to open a portal for you. You should usually be able to get portals from random mages for like 1g tip, but if you have friends or guildies you can probably get them to do it for free. Warlock friends or guildies can also sometimes portal you to them.
---
you're thinking way too inside the box buddy
---
Its the best tanking weapon available to non-humans presently
---
i mean its a tough fight. 1v1 vs a lock i win like 50% of the time
---
what the model @ tho (bottom left not bottom right)
---
my guild just had this issue, too. the rogues thought that no one else was rolling and he just min bid. then the fury warrior far outbid him.
---
in his defense, the previous week the GM said CHT and perds were rogue prio, and then let a fury win it the next week.
---
Also the best offhand for non-human dps warr
---
It isn't a perfect solution but it's the only one I've seen that actually moves towards fixing the problem.
---
As long as the dominant faction can get free transfers off the server it is MILES better than doing nothing but locking the weaker faction on the server like they have been doing.
---
That's pretty much it, but you can often if not always do it uninterrupted because of the lack of competition. Switch off your brain and spam your damage button.
---
Detect magic basically makes it useless
---
faction queues solve the problem
---
Couldn't agree more. I am close to unsubbing and that's coming from someone who loves pvp. But on a server like mine that is horde dominated, the game is just unplayable for alliance. Yes, I signed up for pvp... But you cannot call 10v1 at every flight path "pvp".
---
Modern gaming has taught children to be mad in video games when they die
---
fyi, you can take the gnomer port from Booty Bay, run east to loch modan and and south into badlands. Much easier than running through burning steppes, the mountain and searing gorge (aka the gauntlet).
---
3 hours of farming at 60 worth? How many resets have you done? Seems pretty unlucky
---
You guys actually think this is a real GM convo?
---
Play what you enjoy playing. I was sure I was rolling a priest in classic (I play heals) but when it came to sitting on that character selection screen I couldn’t do it. I rolled the Druid which everyone looks down on in classic. At the end of the day I truly love the Druid hot healing play style and life’s too short to waste playing a game when your playing something you feel your meant to rather than what you actually want.
---
Orcs are not an alliance race
---
Blizzard: lol what you gonna do? Quit? HA!
---
I haven’t cared about the gold at all. The xp is insane.
---
LOL. "At the gates of ironforge we are the underdogs..." Do you even hear yourself?
---
When BWL drops, you’ll be happy to be an orc, though
---
Good luck, haven seen a BB or Vis drop in 10 raids :( I said fuck it and bought a krol/mirah for now but God damn.
---
Yup, in the park.
---
The mage can just spam detect magic
---
I really like Hasselhoof.
---
Funnily enough that's Felstriker and it's like 60:40 at worst. It's really not heavily horde dominated. BRM looks like the above video for us sometimes too. I could only imagine what an actual 75:25 or worse server would be like.
---
It might have been the nature of the game back when servers could only hold 2500-3000 people.  Back in 2004 this meant a 60/40 server was 1600 vs 1200.  A difference of 400 people.
---
Now servers can handle 4 to 5 times the players.  So I'll just say 12000 concurrent people on at one time.  ON a 60/40 server that's 7200 vs 4800, 2400 people more.  
---
Blizzard really fucked up when they decided to do layering instead of actually having a bigger list of servers from the start.
---
You DO realise that im not asking for skills or balanced passives but a few npcs on the main town and to not have driverless&amp;crewless boats and zepelins; Horde have transportation near the capitals but Menethil and Theramore are 30-40 zones but those lvl defenders. You Do realise that this behaviour will lead to mono faction server which are not fun to anyone. Where do you get that I ask Blizz to accomodate the game to me?
---
Sorry, I didn't get on much after this, although if I were to resub maybe I'd be able to check.
---
So your solution random people who probably arent the problem should be inconvenienced because you are?
---
Until they decide to leave?
---
Surely wouldn't the easier solution be allow people who dont want to be on a unbalanced PVP server to migrate to a PVE server where they can control how and when then engage in PVP?
---
Very true in what you said. I feel I need to get rid of the retail mentality of how quick it is to level and having 20 alts lol. Thanks for the info.
---
Never knew that. Raided as a fire mage mostly, but i did Kara and stuff as that pally. Had a lot of fun
---
That may be a good idea
---
If you have proper gear I'd say you can tank all the endgame dungeons dps specced excluding full ubrs. After Rend the pulls are pretty hard and you need either God healers or prot/feral maintank (you can help offtank in those pulls)
---
Yes they are Gen Z also. The oldest Gen Z are just entering college the last couple years. The vast majority of them are elementary-high school right now.
---
true lol but as long as it gets the message across, I'm happy
---
When we're they added? I definitely used them in tbc
---
Wear proper tank gear and you'll be fine.
---
Pvp to Pve server transfers is the only thing that will save most people from this.
---
Why are you tagging with r1 blizzard? You’re giving the warrior more time than if you just CS. 
---
Not sure why you think that. No one is even gonna read the rest of what you say when you start off by saying blizzard a warrior.
---
Could you start playing alliance on a horde dominated server or shut the fuck up?
---
Most PvP Servers were imbalanced back in 2005/2006, just not as crowded. Since then, Horde has become even more popular with the PvP tards due to "muh PvP racials". I saw it coming from 1 billion miles away and picked PvE. You laughed at us, now we laugh at you.
---
Ah so you just meant items, pretty weird stuff. Thanks for the responses.
---
Anytime I see these kinds of post it just reminds me how glad I am to enjoy playing on a PVE server.
---
A mix between pvp and pve
---
why didn't you kill him instead of letting him get it... oh my blood is boiling
---
&gt; I think they need to open faction specific transfers for realms with unbalanced populations.
---
They have done this and it did nothing. There needs to be a reason for the dominant faction to take a transfer, or they just won't.
---
Jokes on the Alliance, our girls roll Horde as well. Filthy elves and humans.
---
2 warlocks, shaman, druid, spriest. Can replace priest with another dps shaman. Wipe protection. Spriest keeps warlocks healed, lots of dps.
---
ngl if they offer to take more of my money for me to be allowed to play the game I'm fuckin out
---
Casual =/= time investment. It's not the same thing. It can also mean that you have a very casual attitude towards the game and don't care what others around you do or achieve. You could casually play 8 hours a day because you have nothing else you need to do. When I was in last year of highschool I only had 3-4 hour school days for the last half a year. It's not as if I never hung out with friends, but most of the time I enjoy being alone over socializing with people, meaning on a lot of days I had nothing better to do than play videogames for 8-12 hours a day as I didn't need more than 1-2 hours a day max to prepare for finals. Someone like me could easily play classic and have a casual attitude towards it.
---
Where'd you get that photo of me?
---
It's even easier as a Druid because you don't need invis pots. Just stealth.
---
You've already gone that far…
---
&gt;That's literally the point. You force people to consider transferring by inconveniencing them with the imbalance.
---
Or you allow the people who dont like the situation to transfer off?
---
Heres the thing, say im Horde on a Horde majority server. I dont PVP much. Your solution would mean that when it comes to raid night ... I run the risk of missing out because you think i should be punished because of something that happened to you, that didnt involve me?
---
Thats about the size of it?
---
Lmao I truly don't care who or what you stereotype. It's just funny AF to point out that your engaging in the very prejudice that you pretend to be better than.
---
&gt;"I don't care about having my time wasted so why do you lol"
---
Just because you have plenty of time doesn't mean it's okay to have it wasted. Wasted time is wasted time, regardless of how much free time you have.
---
I'd explain my position but it seems your mind is already made up and you're just here to try and taunt me, like most PvP server elitists.
---
I realized that I enjoy melee DPS much more than ranged. I was thinking between rogue and warrior. I've heard rogue described as much, much less work than warrior to be impactful and relevant in DPS (rogues being mostly weapon-reliant while warriors require much more).
---
Would this be true? Is rogue the class to roll if I want to have an easier time doing deeps as a melee? I'll be on a PvE server, so WPvP doesn't matter as much to me. I will participate in BGs however.
---
Wow, didn't expect to see myself on Reddit..
---
P2 only changed things if you rolled on a PVP server.
---
Whoa look at this guy!
---
Why level two of the same class in the same faction?
---
You can always try a new class, or a new class in the other faction.
---
I've seen a couple ally hunters doing the demon in Un'Goro. Both times I cheered them on and watched and then tagged the demon at 5%. Fuck hunters!
---
Would probably let a non dwarf priest doing Bene live, but if you're a dwarf priest then you die for sure.
---
&gt; The devs for whom classic is a continual reminder of there failures sure wont.
---
Most of the development team probably played classic wow when they were younger. You have no idea what you're talking about. Classic is nothing but good for Blizzard devs, businessmen and shareholders alike, it's beyond stupid to think that they would want it to fail, let alone SABOTAGE it.
---
One is not quite done with classic...
---
excellent point, im glad you were able to contribute something useful to the conversation instead of saying something vapid and useless.
---
Good luck with that.. they got ya! As the saying goes “hook, line, and sinker”.
---
Buckle up buddy.
---
PS: other servers exist..  it all are that bad by any means.
---
For TBC I re-rolled from a being a AQ geared healer priest , to a BE Ret Pally. My guild never truly forgave me, but they still let me bring the sweet pally dips
---
This post is doing exactly that lol.
---
Isn't DM:E doable with two people?
---
Yes, but pls can you read the other comments as well. The way you describe is if you farm solo. And then you'll have to wait 2min. But op farms as a duo and there you can minimize the waiting time by doing what I described.
---
Yeah I mean engineering is probably ideal for both. I can’t really speak too much on professions for PvE since I haven’t used them for it since way back when herb and other profs gave you a passive buff you could use towards PvE.
---
The difficulty is what makes it appealing. 
---
Also the fact that PVP server still exist in classic. Retail seems like it’s with every year more tailored towards the youngest generation, like they’re trying to make a Disney clone or something. (Removing the hanging bodies from trees, killing off horde leaders until the horde is “honorable”).
---
Even though retail might have more content, it still seems watered down
---
more like Goneclave.  that shit guild got disbanded and their leader quit the game entirely.  its unfortunate that they seem to have been the major alliance force coordinating PVP on our server.  still some really good ally guilds doing stuff but they just don't compare in terms of sheer numbers.
---
still, absolutely worth it to have the bulk of those neckbeards gone.
---
Dwarf works ok as well, your feet just clip into the floor.
---
I disagree because I think people make two big mistakes:
---
* Considering that Vanilla was genius balance of gameplay that any touch could break when it’s mostly a happy little mess that can be changed easily without much risks.
---
* Thinking that changes = retail = bad when current WoW is just one among dozen of things the game could have become.
---
They could have make MC a bit harder and add a few new abilities for fun without any risk of “breaking” MC, They could have changed Shaman/Paladin tank spec and add a few item and the lack of tank would have been way less problematic by just fixing something Vanilla wanted to do but failed, they could have add some spice to blacksmith and tailoring so ‘engineer’ isn’t the only profession truly worth it,they could have removed honor from player below your level and game wouldn’t be any less fun, they could have put many thing  to fight faction unbalance  that would have benefit everyone like giving buff when you are severely outnumbered in an area, divided a faction in multiple sub-group that could fight between each other. a 70/30 server would turn into 35/35/30 triangle.
---
I said Devouring Plague wanted to speak to your manager. It was a joke about peopling asking to speak to managers when they hear things they don't want to hear. 
---
I didn't write multiple sentences like you have to explain why X is Y.
---
It was a joke but you took like a huge cock in the ass. 
---
Sound like a real dumbass saying "subpar" choices especially when your sense of humor is next to nothing.
---
(normalized for PvE)
---
Why was he allowed to roll at all? None of my pugs would let hunters get that.
---
What about merging servers of high horde/alliance majorites and the ones with minorities? This would let people together with their friends while fixing the problem.
---
Might as well care about the gold too... I made a mage alt to farm for my raid toon (druid) and I spent legit 80 hours in ZF. Fuck those zombies lol
---
This seems likely
---
What about merging servers of high horde/alliance majorites and the ones with minorities? This would let people stay together with their friends while fixing the problem.
---
Imagine going to play paintball. And you look forward to a nice somewhat coordinated battle and some relative chaos. Then you get there and its 30 people circling you the whole game shooting you between the eyes and in the throat and never leaving you alone.
---
So you go to the owner and say "man this is fucked, can you do something so those 30 people?" 
---
Imagine if the owner said "pff, dont play paintball". Its like, what I played wasn't paintball. That was a massacre.
---
That's ridiculous. They led with unprovoked aggression and should expect the worst back.
---
The best idea so far is faction queues. If the server is currently 55:45, the 55 will have to queue until it evens out. Of course this may cause some horde to be unable to play but, right now the alliance are unable to play. On some servers.
---
Gogo nettle :D
---
Yes unless you are next in line for an MC caster weapon. I've seen 3 dead golemaggs and only one caster weapon dropped from him. And I am not getting the next one or probably the one after that. I put spell power on ogre magi weeks ago, and will be using it for a few more months probably.
---
&gt; A billionaire being mocked on the internet by thousands of people?
---
Yeah, because that started when classic launched. It never happened before and they're TOTALLY unprepared to deal with it. This is just Reddit projecting their own ego's on to people they know nothing about.
---
qed
---
That script worked in the beta and early days of classic. Blizzard then patched it, saying that in vanilla it was 20 yard range so that's what it should be in Classic.
---
I agree. 
---
But I'm not talking about arena.
---
Mage, I got ganked 3 times within less than 5 minutes at the entrance to EPL and several more times in the Hinterlands before giving up to play on alts
---
No irony here. Honour is a currency. What do you think people will do for it? And if bad stuff nets more currency, would you do it if the market is highly competitive and 1 bad day means youre off the tables for good? Capitalism is a good system that works, but there are some parts of life where it needs to be moderated, controlled, or removed. I’m looking at you vets and dentists ʕ ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°ʔ
---
Yeah this bums be out. I just started using /greet
---
I've quit 2 guilds on alts because they let hunters roll on core hound tooth and brutality blade (before all rogues/wars had either). That level of stupidity deserves a special place in hell
---
QQ bitch
---
I've previously played all classes
---
You can tank them, it's just not ideal. You will have an extra bad time in UBRS for anything past Rend. Baron will also eat you up so your healer better be on their toes.
---
Druids can get away with it a bit easier.
---
&gt; Triggered so easily too, and straight to raging. Classic snowflake lol
---
Ironic, considering how butthurt getting called a snowflake has made you.  Cry more lol
---
PvE players will spam bgs like they always did. They need the items. There wont be even 20min queues.
---
Have you been on this subreddit lately? everyday there's 5+ posts of alliance complaining about their server. There's even more on the Classic forums if you want to take a look. This post is necessary because it shows this isn't a single faction issue, both Horde and Alliance are assholes to each other whenever one or the other faction gains the upper hand, and this is coming from a player on a balanced server, FP's are camped here too for both factions.
---
Nice, some of the best times ive ever had, were with my guild during a raid.
---
My partner was able to tank a full BRD run at 55 in Arms spec. I think if you have decent gear and a good group you don't need to respec.
---
If more than one rogue is present, what are we even discussing. Let's scratch that part when discussing matchups.
---
Anyway, since prot warriors have a bazillion armor, rogues will always lose when strictly trading blow for blow. What a *good* rogue will do though, is kite the warrior using crippling poison while continuously applying bleeds (garrote and rupture ignores armor).
---
&gt;Ok so in a perfect world, this kind of behaviour would get you punished in the game, just like it does in real life
---
my point is that the rules in game dont apply to real life, i am making fun of your stupid assertion that mods should step in because irl this wouldnt be allowed. it is a game the rules are different and killing a mob someone is trying to tame isnt ban worthy
---
It’s a sublime song called smoke two joints. I don’t think they’d sue
---
Yeah, I agree. I think that would definitely upset some players but at the least upset would be balanced. I like your perspective on it. As it stands right now (I’m most servers) horde players are having the time of their lives, and alliance quite literally cannot log in and play without spending hours trying to do simple tasks. So by having queues it would just mean the upset would be balanced until BG come out and WPvP slows down.
---
You’re one of those people in game who equates camping to being raped, aren’t you
---
maraudon. tinkerer + princess + herbs/mining. moonfire princess, refresh when dot runs out, kite in a loop around the water the entire time, when she gets to u: bear form, repeat
---
I tank a lot of dungeons and disenchant/sell any drops I get...
---
And mine rich thorium late night when the mass of horde has gone to bed. 
---
But ya... farming is tough since wpvp came out. Horse have like every single zone camped. It’s pretty impossible to do anything at the moment
---
Anyone playing a warrior as something like 31/5/15? You don't lose much out of fury and the 15 points in prot get you last stand and more threat gen.
---
Spy hasn't had an update that is that recent, neither has any of the other popular addons that use the chat, which is why I really think it's Blizzard screwing something up as we know they have made updates to their launcher last weekend.
---
Note also this isn’t a horde only thing
---
This would have helped me when I was tanking SM cath as a rogue.
---
Not a dwarf one, for sure.
---
Only way to attack your own faction is arena in STV and DM or duels.
---
How does detect magic even work? I've never casted it as a mage... I assumed it would just... Detect the magic the target has? How does that foil a resto potion?
---
Before you find a spot. 
---
You should grab a group of 40 max level hordes for 1 sub lvl 60 alliance. That would make it a fair fight
---
Or, and hear me out now, that's what YOU want.   
---
Changes others, such as myself, want to see  
---
* You rerolling on a PVE server and not posting on Reddits forums any longer about something that is literally in your  capability to change. 
---
Oh, wow that seems to be it. 
---
man, weird.
---
If somebody sold you a Darnassus tiger (epic mount, that is), do you still need to be exalted with the city to use the mount or you just need to learn the tiger riding skill?
---
I mean, the gold is nice. But my goal right now is to get 60. Then my gold farming potential will increase.
---
Coming from Incendius, a fairly balanced high pop server (was also Layered up until the last day), this is not at all the case. I sympathize with your plight, this is more of a response to the large number of people complaining on this post of the faction imbalance not being the problem.
---
Week 1 was a bit nuts, everyone was logged on trying to PvP. 200v200 raids in Hillsbrad and wPvP EVERYWHERE in raid sized quantities. While it was really neat for those 4 days, but I wouldnt say it was a healthy game state at that time. 
---
It got a little more reasonable after the weekend and after Tuesday when people got their R2-3, there was an enormous drop off. Hillsbrad PvP is just flat out gone, its actually went from an absolute warzone to a very average PvP zone, akin to what you would see in retail vanilla or on a pserver. Occasionally a level 30 ally will come through and wipe out some 25 Hordes, fair fights going on sporadically, people leveling, normal stuff.
---
During low activity hours, theres almost no PvP anywhere, for some reason on Incendius, the best PvP zone seems to be Winterspring, where Allys and Horde just kind of circle around killing eachother, sometimes Horde have the upper hand, sometimes Allys, depends on luck. At the start of last week, BRM and SG seemed to be dominated by Alliance, but since the weekend, BRM has flipped to Horde and SG seems contested most often. As for the rest of the world, gank squads are common around FPs (Tanaris, Azshara and EPL are particularly bad for this), but thats about it, once I clear away from the FPs, things seem fairly clear. 
---
The only places I noticed seem difficult for leveling seem to be the 48-55 zones, obviously for 60 honor farming. Bulwark is often camped to the point where no one can even get through to WPL, ditto for Chillwind point FP. Usually a gank squad running N-S in Felwood on the main path. Un'goro actually seems surprisingly clear, havent even seen the FP camped when i was through there.
---
But again, with the exception of Felwood (which is an extremely linear zone) and Searing Gorge, I dont really see gank squads roaming around, just holding choke points and FPs
---
Good to know that Scholo is feasible
---
I'm a shadow priest and I'm used to tanking tbh, idk how they were surprised. U may have not been doing anything wrong, but could've, if u wiped on rattlegore mobs that's their fault, those are hard hitting and they should've known they can't afford to oveaggro and go full dps.   
---
Most shadow priest, don't take talents that reduce threat(or not all points), since you have to sacrifice silence and stun for that. With shadow priest in group just try to get some aggro on every mob, since we dot everything and I find myself often overaggroing with just a dot, mind blast does a massive threat we can't use it mindlessly, but often I don't use it and still get aggro.   
---
Tip: Don't waste ur time with getting a lot of aggro on the main target, just get some on the others mainly melees, don't bother too much with caster mobs and maybe taunt that main one later, they can handle tanking one mob (or more, usually). Also don't bother putting a skull it's just isn't worth it for shadow priest dps wise unless u want them to 3 times less dmg, no sp will accept that and they will overaggro that skull anyway since they'll expect u to have a lot of aggro there and use mind blast, and most likely overaggro others with dots.
---
What he means to say is "I don't like i can die in Bg's i much prefer 10v1 gank fests where we spam "g o t o r e t a i l"
---
Ofc it will depend on the quality of the raid, but here is what I usually bring:
---
- 0 flask of distilled :)
---
- 10 major mana pots (usually use like 3 in mc and 3 ony)
---
- 10x nightfin soup for the longer bossfights
---
- 1 stack of runn tum tuber surprise for trash/short boss fights
---
- 1 stack Kreeg’s stout beatdown, chug
---
- 20x greater mana pots. Cheap for mana upkeep on trash
---
- 5 runes, usually popping these and major mana pots as often as possible during ony fight
---
- elixir of fortitude on ony
---
- 1 greater fire prot rag and 1 fire prot for ony (assuming no wipes)
---
- a stack of (greater) arcane elixir
---
You will figure out how many that will suit for your guild runs :), gl !
---
Any server with 2:1 balance now will become a 10:1 in the future.
---
They fucked up royally by not restricting character creation and with their weak layer approach.
---
They could have kept multiples of one server (Lucifron-1 Lucifron-2 etc.) with unique name restrictions and no layering. The goal would be to merge those with insufficient players, if they stay populated keep these separated.
---
Sure it's not perfect but it would be more authentic and with less problems then the shitshow they managed to deliver.
---
Really disappointed with how they're handling it, unbalanced PvP servers are garbage. 
---
Unfortunately I see no realistic way how they can get on track now.
---
lmfao, thanks for proving my point brainlet
---
There's another more in depth version that I can't find that gives every class it's own "thing". Ends up with a  LOT of lines. Its equally as good, I'm sad I can't find it.
---
A bunch of my friends are transferring off my server (Blaumeux) to another server (Earthfury), how do I about transferring characters from one server to another - because it is becoming hard to find groups for dungeons due the lack of people on my server. Also, where can I go to look at the populations of different servers like horde to ally ratio?
---
A good spriest will be using r1 SW:P and getting stun procs like crazy as well.
---
Make sure it's at he END of the chicken quest.
---
I like to click from the spell book and RP I’m reading incantations from it
---
Yeah but in an evening of 3 hours playing I do 1 hour of getting to BRD and hours of playing. I’m guessing that 3 hours in scholo is better exp overall
---
What is LHC?
---
&gt; horde undead warrior on a horde dominated server
---
You already rolled pve.
---
I can't wait in a week or two when Horde are posting tons of threads complaining because so many alliance quit or changed servers, they can't get honor anywhere.
---
Opposite faction only. You can friendly duel other alliance by requesting a duel. Faerlina is not recommended by most on this sub.. its a "streamer server".. thus the annoying queue times because all the fanboys want to be on the server with their favorite streamers
---
There’s many servers, stop crying
---
Idk unless it's aoe sp usually does more dmg in dungeons.
---
Thicc orc thighs
---
Locks and fury warriors generally will take dps spots #2 through 8 in Naxx with a rogue somewhere in there. Only one mage with the ignite debuff will be number one. Remove the debuff from the equation and mages start around #9 down the list. 
---
This is “generally” speaking- skill, gear, buffs, procs all play a part but in a perfect world with everyone having equivalent gear and skill those are the numbers based on scaling and what the developers decided to do. Hence the reason why every expansion is different for most classes. 
---
Locks scale really well once they get more hit/crit gear. Fury warriors are vanilla machines all cross the board.
---
I mean, being Server second on my faction to clear both available raids, and being second to top DPS in my kills tells me I'm doing things correctly.
---
Nevermind the part where, again, no one has ever, not even once, complained.
---
But sure. Build that strawman. Be angry.
---
I like it. I am a warlock after all. Your suffering is my joy.
---
Feels like you want Reddit to know youre tilted. Answer is ANY contested 20-40 zone. But you knew that, didnt you?
---
Seriously this.
---
Like obviously people are going to transfer to a more dominant server so they don't get the same shit again.
---
In the end they're just making imbalanced server even more imbalanced.
---
Killing someone near the end of the escort is probably one of the worst things you can do to another player.
---
Waiting for them to ress, attempt the escort again and killing them at the same spot is probably the worst.
---
I hate sand, it gets everywhere.
---
Imagine poopsocking a 15 year old game. Imagine tanking your own life for video game accolades.
---
I had a frost mage spamming duel with me outside of scholo the other day, after 5 declines I finally said, "Fuck off, you're frost, I'm prot."
---
Thanks for the update. This is helpful
---
Lights Hope chapel. It's a Neutral Flight Path in EPL. There's no FP in WPL.
---
Nah. If I kill 2 alliance, there will be a 40 man raid killing me in no time. 
---
I'm not even kidding. I'm actually impressed how easy alliance can assemble players.
---
Yeah it sucks.. we obviously didn’t know he was doing it.. oh well, the raids must go on
---
Being forced to go and do something else, because of something you cannot control, is really fucking obnoxious.
---
Imagine if there was an alternate version of Super Mario Bros that forcefully paused the game at random times with no way to un-pause it. "Oh it's okay I can just go play another game", right? No, that doesn't make it okay.
---
That's literally all ganking is: a time waster. It wastes your time and there's no way to avoid it. I don't know how anyone finds it fun or challenging to have your time wasted against your will.
---
what is the max difference level that i can be to start gaining exp from mobs? i.e can level 20 gain exp from lvl 30 mob?
---
Yes, 3 hour ques at peak.
---
No. You will be ganked
---
Yea well no shit its terrible, atleast in classic dungeon grinding is really viable. It was like this levelling as horde on northdale too stonetalon camped by 60 rogues 24/7 crossroads randomly ganked by APES, ashenvale complete shitshow etc. The only people crying are new players. You’ll Get used to it and learn to not get too frustrated
---
Imo the guild's that put in the most work in glamouring up their pitch are the worst out there. Everytime I've joined a guild because I liked their message/philosophy, it turned out to be garbage.
---
Someone hasn't paid attention to classic development for very long or paid attention to developers comments that insinuate they do indeed hate classic.
---
Blizzard developers DO NOT like classic, they believe it to be a toxic game that enables toxic player behaviour.
---
They also think it's extremely buggy and un refined, to today's developers the old classic is an abomination.
---
Classic wow is a living testament to how terrible retails is and how today's developers have ruined og Warcraft with their misguided ideas.
---
If you can't understand why today's developers wouldn't like classic you're clueless.
---
Suuuure, the underpopulated faction can def pull that off. 
---
meanwhile every post here on this sub reddit shows horde 3v1ing alliance players
---
You can report him for breaking tos if you really wanna lol
---
Lol I'm on a horde server that's around 40 ally /60 horde  (Benediction).
---
Got to love the incel jab. Dude I’m happily married. 
---
If I was only a butch chad like you smashing poon left and right... Nice “I have a real life unlike you losers” line while you sit on a WoW message board complaining about getting camped... you are so manly. Look out folks, this guy... this guy fucks. 
---
You’re spare parts bud.
---
Nethergarde Keep is super populated on Alliance. I'd highly recommend it.
---
I think it's 65% Alliance.
---
how often to do world pvp with a succubus? Or I assume you've got fel dom?
---
The servers were lagging so bad it took over 10 minutes to get the buff even after the quest was turned in. Probably at least 1000 players in Org :D
---
Since EPL is such a warzone on my server, I just sucked it up and did the Tirion quest chain with some guildies. It was like 2-3 hours of murdering mobs with the constant ganks, but it was good exp and plenty  of good herbs around EPL. 
---
Also aren't you safer going from Red Ridge to get to BRM?
---
&gt; Or find a corner of some lame zone and grind mobs.
---
This is what I have been doing for the past 2 weeks.
---
last night my little refuge was found by a warrior. Been camped 3 times now by that fucker. he just roams in a large loop around the zone, probably mining or herbing, then picks me off when Im just trying to grind the last few levels out.
---
U never played there.
---
Nah not upset, thought it was funny lmfao
---
 Blaumeux is not a low population server. Transfering off of Blaumeux would result in you going to a low pop server and increase the difficulty to find a group for dungeons. It is becoming harder to find groups to dungeons because fewer people are leveling and more people have already obtained pre-raid BIS. As for Horde/Alliance ratios - nothing official but there are some addons, surveys etc that you can look up.
---
At the end of the day - have fun.  If your friends have transferred and you miss playing with them, transfer.
---
Nope, that was me refuting your point. My suggestion was dual specs. 
---
Are you even paying attention?
---
