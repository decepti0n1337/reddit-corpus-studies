For TBC I had to work overtime. A week before WotLK I got a letter to my door telling me my electricity would be out for the release date. Ive had shit like this happen alot, I feel your pain.

WAIT FOR THREE STACKS OF SUNDER ARMOR

---
Thank me later. 
---
&gt; To many people, myself included, it doesn't matter what we want, like or even what we think is better/worse. What matters is getting a true representation of Vanilla, as close to (if not exact) as it can possibly be.
---
There's an amusing irony in you telling us that it doesn't matter what you want... but that it is absolutely critical that you get exactly what you want exactly the way you want it.
---
No problem, please share the results with us later
---
I'm coming up with 32.33% repeating, of course.
---
I just want you to know. Your very understanding of economics got you my up vote for what it is worth. As you said "Market Dominance" is not a monopoly. Other people where making MMO's too. It's just no one wanted to play them because Blizz had the best one. Well being the best allows for some fuckery. People can hate blizzard but, they are still choosing to play their MMO. Monopoly by definition means a lack of choice and, is normally created by government regulation bullying the smalls out of the market.
---
Thank you for not being an idiot for what it is worth. 
---
Be safe and break-up with your girlfriend
---
That’s better than we usually get
---
*Laughs in southern hemispherian*
---
&gt; It’s precisely because of its flaws and foibles that it became as popular as it did
---
Evidence?
---
I think it became popular because it was very easy, accessible and softcore compared to Everquest or Ultima Online. I don't remember anyone back in 2004-2006 saying "you have to play WoW guys, it's amazing, class balance is fucked and the itemisation is super wonky!".
---
Given what you say about some classes having "conditionally viable", what do you think about introducing dual spec to classic? I'm personally ok with it and you've just given me another piece of ammo to back that up. 
---
&gt;"Should" is a wonderfully ambiguous word. If you had said "both sides **will**  have some well geared people" then you would have been factually wrong,  of course, but then your argument would work. But by saying they  "should" have well geared people you in fact say nothing at all.
---
It says that this is on average the most likely outcome. Of course, one side can have only people in green gear who backpeddle and keyboard turn while the other side has only Naxx geared players who have been playing their class in PvP for 10 years. That's not a likely scenario though. 
---
&gt;Since you admit to 19 twinking you know you  are full of shit. The only option a 500 health hunter whose autoshots  do thirty damage has when a 1200 health hunter whose autoshots do closer  to one hundred damage and who dodges a third of their attacks rocks up  is to be an honour kill or run away.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; You can make up stories about how a lowbie  mage or warlock or something can CC a twink, but realistically they're  going to feed them far more HKs trying than it is worth if the twinker  is remotely competent.
---
I was still talking about lvl 60 PvP. Regardless, BGs are about completing objectives, not farming HKs.
---
&gt;It is amazing the ingenuity twinkers have  in coming up with narratives in which they are totally not the bad guy.  And indeed, if every twinker played level 10 toons no more powerful than  a normally geared levelling toon nobody would have a problem with them.  But we both know that is not what they do, don't we? It's not about  this disingenuous pretence to be interested in "seeing your character  grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me by the game  designers", it's about seeing your character grow and perform in ways  that were not laid down for me by the game designers *and* which let you fuck over levellers and noobs for your own gratification.
---
You really do enjoy to speak in absolutes, don't you? Unless you think that I'm the only twinker who doesn't enjoy twinking because it makes people angry, there are probably people who don't fit the profile that you outlined.
---
&gt; Otherwise you'd be equally happy "seeing  your character grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me  by the game designers" by beating up PvE mobs with a melee priest or a  bow warrior or something.
---
Coming up with silly PvE shit can be fun too. Hell, I once made it my pet project to create a lvl 1 twink that could solo rare/elite mobs (and gank lvl 10-20 players around Crossroads). On the other hand, having more choices is great and PvP is always much more engaging than PvE.
---
You need to learn what a Monopoly is before you comment. A company providing a product so good you feel compelled to choose it over it's competition is not a monopoly. A monopoly is something formed because there is no other choice. Normally a monopoly is caused by government regulation. 
---
You didn't have to play wow. At the time WOW introduced it's online store. Many other MMO"s had been made. You just liked wow more so you choose to play it. Well guess what? You liking the game the most don't make it a monopoly and, doesn't give you the right to decide how it should be run. You don't like how Blizzard handles it's own IP's do what I did and, quit. I've played LOTRO, AOC and, SWTOR. All of which are fun MMO's all of which exist as contemporaries to wow. Blizzard did not break the law or pass regulations ensuring they have no competition. They just put out by far the best product.
---
Malorak all of that may be true but, how does that make "Blizzard" a monopoly? What countries did they pay off to kill off their competition? As far as I can tell all they did was make a product so damn good. It was a license to print money.
---
Thank you for taking one for the team, I will remember you when I'm shit posting in the barrens while you’re on space mountain 
---
Sure.  Here's an example: [Achivist Cape of Healing](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13386) was added in patch 1.11.  It is on par with Hide of the Wild (also added in 1.11; easy to craft).  Only three cloaks are better for a resto druid: one from Flamegor in BWL (which every healer wants), one from C'Thun in AQ40, and one from Patchwerk in Naxxramas.
---
[Robes of the Exalted](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346) from Baron Rivendare in Stratholme is only outdone by a robe from Fankriss in AQ40 or the Tier 3 set from Naxxramas.
---
[These shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22234) are about equal in value to Cenarion Spaulders (tier 1 MC) and [these from BWL](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19370).  The blue shoulders are from a level 51 elite which a level 60 druid can stealth to and solo kill.  I got a pair of them after 2 dungeon resets.
---
If, like on private servers, these items are available to players immediately on release, then all raids will be trivial.  It's very easy as a healer to get +400 or +500 healing which is a dramatic buff because it lets you scale down all your spells to use significantly less mana.
---
The BIS lists for other classes have similar oddities.  The new blue items have a lot of highly desirable stats like hit and crit on them.
---
Alright let’s do this. 
---
It’s not a good thing in itself. It’s that the feel of the class could easily be skewed, and as someone who’s playing a class with 2 gimp specs, I don’t want them to give ret Crusader strike or something, so that they have an actual rotation. Or Divine Attunement so prot has decent mana regen. Those are BC fixes for the BC game. 
---
Plus, many specs that aren’t optimal for raids can still destroy in PVP. People have so easily suggested, “just give boomies/ele shaman 100% extra mana regen.” Well, OK, now you have 2 destroying classes with infinite mana now, and the potential to be a better healer than their healing spec.
---
quality content that this sub needs
---
You're right in that they viewed it as a failure - but as John Staats himself said, they decided to prioritise on polishing and balancing the specs that were raid viable, and then leaving the ones that had no raid position as they were because people WERE still playing them effectively in other content.
---
Thing is, if you take what they really wanted WoW to be then you'd end up with a build that looked a lot more like the mid period TBC, which was great, but also a very different animal.
---
As said, I'm not saying you're wrong in the desire to want class parity, just that one of Vanilla's quirks was having specs that werent suitable for raiding. As soon as you start wanting to polish this, you stop Classic from being "a museum piece" to play WoW as it was, and start designing "TBC Version 2" but at level 60.
---
Personally i'd WANT that, but it wouldnt be Classic. it would be something different. Better possibly, but where do you start and finish the tweaks without effectively putting an entirely full team on and developing the game with as much fervence as the live game.
---
Confirmed, that's also my girlfriend's birthday so I'll be out at some restaurant or something all night instead of being productive in game :(
---
While I am on your team about the bind on pickup being better. "no one had a problem with the previous system" Is just an absurd statement lol. Loot whining was a past time in classic lol
---
Haven't you heard? Classic will be subscription based which means you will get it for "free", there won't be any hard copies. You will subscribe to retail WoW, pick classic WoW in the battle net launcher and press play
---
Christ. That's a fuck load of pvp to be 40 something with 50 days played.
---
Normally I’d be in favour of this sort of min-maxing...but I think this is actually overthinking it. Unless you’re buying greens off the AH your gear is gonna be a strange mix of stats. I think you’ll be picking the higher level item with more stats, not focusing on whether it has agi or str.
---
So i’d just go with the flow and mix up your gear a bit so that you have a healthy balance. Stam + armour for tanking, intellect for healing. Pick up str and agi where you can. Sacrifice tank stats if you must...you can compensate in dungeons by bringing cc, pre healing, stuns, or just going up one extra level before doing the dungeon.
---
Can’t compensate with healing if your mana pool is super empty though! Other than being well stocked with water and mana potions. 
---
I used to think Dual Spec would be the one "nochange" change that I'd be okay with. But then I thought about it.
---
One thing that was unique to Vanilla compared to other expansions was the fact that you DIDNT need to be a particular spec in order to do the ROLE of that spec, and there was a lot less difference between the specs. The talent trees encouraged spreading points around a bit.
---
This meant that it was common for players to design their own "middle ground" spec that could do multiple roles, and this was part of the charm that gave individual specs personality.
---
Take Paladins. If you had Dual Spec, you'd probably run, say, a Retribution PvP-focussed spec, and a pure holy spec. Or you could run a full prot spec and a pvp-focussed healer spec. However, this would pretty much enforce the concept that you should be minmaxing your talent build to do the content, which was fine but wasnt really the "spirit" of classic.
---
Instead you had hybrid builds. You had the 30 holy 21 prot healer build that could also tank instances. You had the 21 holy 30 ret all-round build that could heal and dps in pvp and pve just fine with some minor sacrifices. If you chose to nail your flag to the 31+ Prot pole, you'd end up having very limited healing power.
---
That was part of the charm I guess... Warriors would run the 31/5/15 Arms-with-Defiance spec to do Raiding AND PvP in one spec. This spec probably wouldnt exist with Dual Spec, you'd just have a cookie cutter arms PVP spec and a prot tank spec.
---
Without dual spec, everyone was really only expected to have one spec at any time, and you just changed gearsets to do whatever you could as that spec. Only the absolute most hardcore raid guilds would enforce minmaxed pure pve specs, and even they would probably do the raid Last day then First day alternating week raid schedule to let the group spec pvp after 2-3 heavy raiding days.
---
Again, personally I'd be fine with Dual Spec added in, I think everyone lieks it, but there's definitely an argument that the LACK of dual spec was what made the talent system and its versatility so interesting.
---
Other people have already addressed the biggest points in your post so I want to take a second and go over one I saw. 
---
You talked about vanilla having its own expansions which piqued my interest a bit. 
---
Inside the game code there was already content that wasnt released or finished until later, such as mount hyjal. I would've liked to see the unfinished works that was already in the game to be completed and released as vanilla content. I mean we had a staff to teleport to karazhan that was intended as a vanilla raid. Felt like bad game design to obsolete vanilla content that wasn't completed even though it was so strongly connected.
---
Just my two bits, oh also: grim batol, dragon isles, etc.... 
---
of course I want to experience base vanilla content but I often think about the "what it could have been" aspect had it not departed to the realm of paying for content via expansions that was already paid for via subscription. 
---
But Activision Blizzard can leverage their existing sharding technology to improve the experience... 
---
Yeah man 40s bracket was a great time. I was a gnome rogue, met a random shadowpriest at level 40 (Martina), and we pvp'd constantly until token turn-ins eventually leveled us to 50. The rogue/sp combo was redonkulous, personal stunbot for the priest, sweet sweet heals and ranged finishing for the stunbot. Did the same on my BM hunter, and flag running resto druid. Went through many rivals. First step of any BG was bringing up the scoresheet to see which of your rivals were on the other team. Or trying to figure out if that new unfamiliar name is going to be a lvl 40 scrub or a new rival. Best times of my WoW life without question.
---
Yeah! Awesome new stuff! Flying mounts! Then we can enjoy Cataclysm! MoP and WoD! And so much cool new stuff in BfA!
---
Classic is *boring.*
---
They could still sell boxed copies for the collectors. It's cheap money.
---
"What class will you be playing in Classic?"

[MFW](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/raining_david_tennant.gif&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.reactiongifs.us/sad-in-the-rain-doctor-who/&amp;h=264&amp;w=500&amp;tbnid=DYn6G2b9b-f_iM&amp;tbnh=163&amp;tbnw=309&amp;usg=AI4_-kRu5ZkSGfMXbBhTmFBZMpYglCFjOA&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=M5LPk7nz5MugOM) I can only select one.
---
You can submit multiple submissions.
---
They could, but I wouldn't count on it
---
Probably early on, but it wasn't like something that was intended for launch and just missed out.  At some point they likely realized that the elven areas would need serious work, beyond what they already needed to deliver.
---
In pvp there's always several builds competing.  Sometimes they are similar to each other, other times they are pretty different.  
---
In pve, there's usually just one spec for a given role (ex, dps) that is optimal *given a set of gear and content*.  For instance, if you are fighting bosses immune to fire, fire is not a great spec.  Likewise if you are progressing on something immune to poison, there's not much argument for a build spending points in improved poisons.  
---
You don't have to like it, but that is how it is.
---
I will be astonished if they don't have a neo-collector's edition.  Not only is that "Blizz-like", since they [actually did it back then](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Collector%27s_Edition), one of the perqs was a vanity pet: Zergling, Panda Cub, or Mini Diablo.  I can't imagine Actiblizz passing up a chance to upsell something by throwing in a vanity item, especially when it's 100% defensible as Classic.
---
We need a hub for guild recruitment for sure.
---
Blizzard. Ruining holidays since '91.
---
I feel OP may have not played Horde, just Human. If you are referring to the crowding in that single Kobold cave in Northshire Abbey, then sure.
---
Sounds awful but if you're going to do this, when you go into ret at the start get Pursuit of Justice. Makes leveling so much more tolerable.
---
Done. 
---
I'll be a mage frost spec. Not much else to choose since fire is useless for the first 2 raids.
---
I noticed that, but I don't want to skew /u/HotaruShidareSama's results, so I just chose druid, as that will (probably) be my main(ish).
---
last system you had to click need, then ALSO had to click "yes I'm sure"
---
not a single retard ever looted a BoP by accident 
---
Blizz introducing this system to fix accidental BoPs is perfect analogy of 2019 Blizz: wasting valuable resources on shit that no one wants, needs or cares about
---
Just wondering, but what are you trying to prove using the data from this survey? A correlation between class/age? If so, I'm curious to see what the results show!
---
So you only game half the year? Your friends only go out for drinks half the year? You don't turn your computer on in the summer because you don't have ac so Blizzard should postpone the release date 6 months? 
---
This is the dumbest fucking argument I've heard all day, and I just left a political thread about the shutdown.
---
I was a first time vanilla player but familiar to WoW. The rogue that I leveled in a relaxed way, doing dungeon quests and leveling professions as I could, and I ended up with about 11 days played time. 
---
That is interesting they didn't plan on having it at launch but really fleshed out the Night Elves and all their zones when they were only introduced in WC3. I wonder what made them decide to have the night elves as apart of the alliance over any high elf remnant faction.
---
having 16 right out the gate will trivialize MC and all the other raids that people originally did with 8.
---
Classic gotta stay Classic, not become yet another fuck up by Blizzard

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Here are the results, the survey is still open. The data will update itself as new respondents answer. 
---
Because the pure classes perform better and people often associate feelings of superiority with success.
---
I’m totally fine with that, as it means less gear competition for me.
---
Yeah I thought the same but I'm so undecided I couldn't pick just one haha
---
lol fear &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sheep
---
not necessarily class/age 
---
just the age range of people who play classic
---
and the classes they are looking forward to the most. 
---
for my Statistics class I needed a quantitative data set (age) and a qualitative/categorical data set (class)
---
Do you want to level 8% slower? That’s about what no Pursuit of Justice will cost you up to 40. 
---
I am making a case for why boomkins and rets are worse dps than mages, and why that is okay. It seems like you agree then?
---
LEEEEEEEROOOOOOYYYYYYYYYYY
---
I am having second thoughts alright, maybe INT/AGIL would work for just healing/dps but tanking is pushing it tbf
---
Ye i'd buy everything but I'm having second thoughts about it now, lol. I'll just level normally :P
---
I do agree with you. I fully buy into the Hybrid tax because that versatility really does have value. A mage can’t tank a 5 man to help gear up a guildie, but a boomkin can with the right gear.
---
I intend to be helping a lot of friends who are new to wow through the game so the versatility is a huge benefit to me. For a raider going for world’s first? The extra dps and better crowd control of a mage will be much more important.
---
Importance of player decisions and cooperative/constructive group dynamics are integral to a good RPG and I can’t wait to see them return again in classic.
---
Plus the doomkin has the best post-duel victory dance, so there’s that too.
---
Your brain is going to subconsciously find ways to sabotage your relationship with your girlfriend in order to break up with her before the release of Classic WoW.  
---
Your brain will succeed.  
---
And then Blizzard will announce they pushed back the release by 1 week.  
---
JJJJJEEEEEENNKKKKINNNNNSSSSSS!
---
I remember this, and miss it. If the content is not challenging enough then it feels like a lesser achievement to complete it. 
---
I also remember getting geared to the point where my guild groups could run in to 5-mans like Scholo/Stratholme/Blackrock spire and use the "modern strategy" for dealing with trash, because our warriors had such good armor and our DPS so high that trash packs didn't pose a significant threat anymore. Having good group co-ordination and focused DPS plays in to that of course, but it was that you earned the right to cheese through instance content you were overgeared for, rather than it being a default. It also was far from the first time those characters went through the dungeons. 
---
~10 days
---
you inherently *want* things as a human being, the difference lies in the intention. it's not impulsive or short-sighted, it's idealistic. no one will tell you vanilla is technically perfect, but it doesn't officially exist. that's why you deliver the original to the diehard fans who played it on emulated private servers for the past 15 years before you consider taking any risks on changing it. it's rational decision-making. it has nothing to do with avoiding risks for the sake of fear. that's why all the people crawling out of their holes, who have never or not played vanilla since 2006, asking for changes can go fuck themselves. your want has an objectively inferior value. that's my perspective, feel free to let your ego rebel.  
---
Gotcha. Yea, imo, druids are great! You are a top tier healer and dungeon tank, and can make your melee dps and tank specs work in raid even though they are a bit weaker. Finally, you can meme around and have fun as boomkin if you want. Contrast with a mage who basically has one viable spec at any given point in the game.
---
It will be a waste of time but if you enjoy it go for it. Half ass ret and half ass prot and then somehow you wanna heal inbetween [it.](https://it.You) You are trying to fulfill two many roles. 
---
Also I'd get benediction over IMP Might and Redoubt over imp devo.
---
Omg this is right up my alley because I've been theorycrafting Paladin leveling builds on pservers for the past few months.
---
First off, I'm super skeptical about doing anything Prot. It's just not good for leveling nor for PuG tanking. I've already written [about the issues with Prot leveling without a committed guild group to support you](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ad9al9/paladin_leveling_spec_question/edf7t8z/) so I won't reiterate those points again.
---
Imp. BoM is a waste of talent points since [it doesn't scale well](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a93mk8/paladin_levelling_talents_benediction_or_imp_might/ecgiude/?context=0). Mana is always going to be an issue so Benediction is your best friend here—you'll be Sealing and Judging *a lot*.
---
Deflection is terrible for tanking since it increases your Parry chance, making it anti-synergistic with Protadins in Vanilla (you actually *want* to get hit so you can proc Redoubt, Reckoning, and Blessing of Sanctuary and Ret Aura) but since I'm going to recommend a Holy/Ret build for you taking this is perfect. It turns out that Parry increases your DPS through a mechanic called Parry-haste that I won't go into here.
---
After SoC I'd recommend getting Pursuit of Justice since distance is going to be your biggest efficiency-killer while leveling. Can't stress the amazingness of +10% run speed at all times.
---
Imp. Dev Aura is a noob-trap. Nobody uses Devotion Aura. The amount of damage mitigation is minimal compared to the DPS loss of Retribution Aura or the emergency healing of Concentration Aura. 
---
After this you rush Holy for Illumination, which is all you need to heal effectively until 60. Get Divine Intellect because mana, Spiritual Focus because with Concentration Aura this becomes your most powerful healing combination (spell pushback is huge in Classic.) I'd recommend against getting Divine Strength because you won't be getting enough Strength rating on your gear for this to scale well, it does nothing for your healing, and since you're not equipping a shield it won't help you mitigate damage either.
---
After that I recommend getting Healing Light to improve your dungeon healing (you should be building a healing set with +Healing cloth pieces and off-hands) and then two points into Imp. Lay on Hands. This is the most controversial choice but Lay on Hands is so much better on Tanks than BoP since BoP suspends threat and only causes another party member to get one-shot instead. Giving LoH a 40min timer +30% armor for 2 minutes is a huge tank buff for dungeons.
---
After this get Illumination which gives you free heals! I'm skipping Consecration since it's entirely useless while leveling as a non-tank. It's insane how inefficient Consecration is. I think a lot of people are blinded by guides that glorify AoE grinding around level 50+. The fact of the matter is, AoE grinding won't be a thing while leveling in Classic, at least not for *months,* because grinding spots will all be contested by other players (especially Mages) who can AoE much more efficiently than a Protadin can.
---
You can get Diving Favor after this but it's actually not necessary for healing effectively. Lasting Judgment is useless too since you'll likely be in melee range during dungeons. At this point what'll hold you back is a lack of utility (and no, Imp. BoW doesn't count) so I'd suggest going back to Ret for Conviction and Imp. Ret Aura—a huge boost to your party's DPS.
---
Since you'll be chasing slow two-handers, get Two-handed Weapon Specialization. At level 52 this is where I'm planning to end up: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzMwAADMM3P](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AzzMwAADMM3P) After this I figure I'll keep going down Ret since Holy Shock is the most inefficient spell we have and many Holy Paladins even skip it altogether.
---
The biggest favor you can do for your warrior buddy is to go full ret and carry +int gear for situations when you need to heal until the level 50's, when supportive/defensive specs become a thing. Peace.
---
Thats usually how these things work out, ill buy it
---
iirc john stats explained they already had too much content, same with hyjal. 
---
&gt; they love scheduling their releases in tandem with my **unavoidable** obligations
---
The high elves were decimated, there's barely any left, the majority were now blood elves.  
---
The night elves had a full, thriving society, it makes perfect sense to use them instead.
---
Mate, I know wow isn't a monopoly, that's why I never said they were. Some things (even outside of a monopoly) behave as you'd expect from a monopoly, which is why "lol not a monopoly GG" is about as useful as catching a grammar mistake. Spoiler - not very.
---
God damn it Leroy....
---
I liked the ICC model tbh, normal was nicely balanced for a normal dungeon and heroic was still hard. 
---
The game was designed to be built upon
---
Yeah 10 days is pretty average. 15 for the slower folks.
---
What is "como DM runs"?
---
People were pretty informed in my group so I just went along
---
Least i got chicken...
---
&gt;the stairs were a lot of fun back in the day.
---
stressful*
---
I sweat bullets during that phase even today.
---
Right ball park, I'm getting married July 13th!
---
You definitely cannot level a warrior in 9 days
---
I'm really looking forward to xmog and eventually flying mounts (with TBC).
---
I'm glad they'll shard too. No one wants to stand around when quests are camped. Let me play the game!
---
You can level a warrior in less than 6 days
---
You could always not go. 
---
I blew off a vacation with my girlfriend once during TBC and ended up getting two pieces of T4 (shoulders and legs iirc) the night that we were supposed to leave.
---
Somehow that wasn't enough of a red flag and she ended up marrying me years later.  I was playing on a private vanilla server recently and another vacation would have interfered with my guild's MC progression nights. I brought a laptop to raid on in the beach house kitchen at night and got our first Rag kill!
---
All joking aside, its healthy to have a good game/life balance. And if you're going to have a relationship with someone, make sure that they are understanding and accommodating of your passions.  But it's not all about you, it's a compromise, a give and take.
---
GL in the classic WoW, my man. 
---
You don't have to do quests to get from lvl 1-10, which is incredibly easy. You can very reasonably level up by grinding mobs, unlike other quest brackets where not doing quests will greatly slow you down.
---
After that, if at any bracket or zone there is congestion or it's too hot with pvp, instead of hitting your head against the wall you can simply run dungeons. You won't get ganked, no crowd, and you get loot to boot.
---
Such inflexibility is a big problem, and it is in part leading to sharding in starting zones.
---
 Let's see how far these "starting zones" will extend and what "the first weeks" of launch actually means.
---
Illuminati confirmed
---
Well then re-read the title. We're talking about a new player.
---
You have time to dump her! 
---
I have holidays mid-July. There's always a chance it coincides with Classic but I don't care either way.
---
Same with Fire and Earth elementals in the Charred Vale in Stonetalon Mountains. Huge gold potential there from level 25 onwards. 
---
Oh fuck. I also have palns around that date. Blizz is on to us.
---

here it is

I would say Benediction is much better than imp might, also I would skip imp devo aura, you'll be using ret aura and concentration.
---
Otherwise you got the right idea and it's similar to the way I spec my pally alt.
---
I take intel over strength in the first tier of holy.

Don't matter severs will be totally screwed for at least a few days

Huge* flame sac?

Thanks for taking one for the team lmao

Lol I’m Hispanic so I just wrote in Spanish by accident. Como means like. So “like DM runs”

I remember farming these for two weeks straight before the event started and I basically cornered the market 
---
Just mine some Bitcoin in the background 
---
My bday is July 16 but I hope it doesn't get released then because I will BE FORCED to party instead of playing classic
---
"Beautiful day outside" is extremely subjective. "Sunny" does not equal "beautiful" for me. 
---
I still want clipping issues resolved. Tired of dwarf weapons being halfway through the ground. One of the biggest immersion breakers for me. 
---
To be clear before I say this I am in no way saying you are wrong. I am just saying I do not feel the same.
---
Take ICC I hate the idea just any player could kill Arthas. I hate the fact he had a mode a relatively unskilled player could handle. For me if just any ass hole can kill Arthas
---
What have I been fighting for? What have I been struggling for. Arthas for me needs to be a nigh unattainable goal or what's the point. It's not a herioc quest and, this isn't my epic adventure. 
---
In many ways I am an aspirational player. I prefer pvp over pve. So in reality for me the Arthas I want in my MMORPG. Is a boss I could most likely never face myself. There are heros in this world that do that. I'm not one of them but, the fact they exist motivates me to try to become one of them. I guess that might not make any sense but it's how I feel about it. 
---
Raids should only have one difficulty and your ability to complete it or not should say something about who you are in wow. I'm not interested in balance. I'm not interested in things being fair. I have absolutely no problem being iolaus to another better players hercules. That's what makes it an adventure. 
---
If not probable then its possible, just my guess.
---
How I wish I was in such a circumstance for it to take 10+ days to level a warrior to 60. 
---
My guild leader in Vanilla had the largest guild on the server and never made it past level 50. He had tons of alts all below level 40 as well. Some people just play the game to socialise, not necessarily to pvp or pve.
---
This is just my opinion, but when they were released I saw them as the equivalent of raids for people who couldn't actually hold to a raiding schedule.  I thought they were fantastic, although as a shaman, it was hard to find groups right away because I didn't have any CC.
---
Pursuit of Justice affects mount speed too.
---
obtain a very strong set of gear with minimal effort? bs i had to do about 40 scholo runs to get the paladin libram to drop. 20 runs of strat ud for robes andtons of runs to get the dm shoulders and leggings. also if your not using pummeler then your an epic fail and that 30 str 1 crit thing sucks. but i do agree progressive itemization would be better. but yea getting pre raid bis takes a lot of time so i wont agree with you about it being a cake walk. i want to see your character armory link for just a dozen dungeons and ur almost done gearing him for pre raid bis
---
Why would you recommend for a new player to not do dungeons? Especially a warrior who is going to be kind of miserable without upgrading his big 2-hander? Also, questing is so much more of the game game—a huge amount of the content is the dungeons, and they are pretty incredible. Plus, in your 40's they start giving useful rewards that will help you @ max level.
---
&gt; As soon as you start wanting to polish this, you stop Classic from being "a museum piece"
---
Yes. You correctly understand that people who want changes do not want it to be "a museum piece" in any sense that precludes changes.
---
&gt; Personally i'd WANT that, but it wouldnt be Classic.
---
Classic will be whatever it is. Changes are already locked in, so as you are using the term Classic is already not Classic.
---
&gt; Better possibly, but where do you start and finish the tweaks 
---
Well, I don't know if you are aware of this, but the existing system is that every now and then they do a thing called "releasing a patch" and the "patch" makes relatively modest changes to lots of different mechanics in ways that shake things up and improve the game. They have released these "patches" before and the game never once stopped being the game.
---
elemental is so beast in pvp.. and way better in vanilla then tbc for pvp 
---
&gt; But you dont care that you can't race the other sports 
---
You are assuming what you ought to be proving.
---
But if you are right, I have a win/win solution. They fix the broken specs, and since in your world nobody who picked that class ever wanted to play them in a raid anyway no harm is done.
---
Human rogue
---
Gnome /human lock
---
Human /dwarf paladin
---
Bank toon
---
Ah toon
---
Maybe another class alt
---
Time unsure at this stage need more info on launch and to plan, Ideally 1-2 days off prior to ensure life is organised, then minum 3-4 days off to hard core, no set targets but aim 20 in first sitting depending on servers and mobs ext
---
Potentially stream, been a nobody it would just be no mic stream for friends ext really
---
I'm excited to prep the battlestaion like back in the day! Snacks and supplies and about 30 pre rolled smokes ;) 
---
Why would two books that are still in print skyrocket in price? One of these isn't even remotely related to Classic.
---
Ahh fun times. Good Story. Having a lowbie twink is tons of fun. I'm not sure if any of you will remember this, but for one, maybe two weeks during TBC Blizzard removed level requirements for professions. This was when skinning gave +crit. So on my level 19 hunter Ilovellamas, I would follow my friends around Terrokar Forest skinning level 65 beasts. I got my skinning to max during that time, at which point Blizzard reverted the changes and reinstated the level requirements for professions. Thing was, if you had it you were allowed to keep it. So my level 19 hunter with the max skinning crit buff had a constant 85% crit LOL. Amazing times were had.. :]
---
Don't feel bad, you'll just miss out on overcrowded servers and having to wait to login.
---
Isn't this empty semantic gainsaying?
---
I mean, when someone says "I want enhance shamans to be viable in endgame PvE" they clearly have a definition of "viable" in mind such that they are currently *not* viable. Otherwise they would not have said it.
---
Responding with "ackshually as I define viable they are viable" without even explaining what you think viability is, is an empty response.
---
Presumably because (a) the druid is not quite as good at any of those three roles, (b) because to do three things not quite as well you have to gear up three times and that is a lot of time and effort, and (c) you probably like portals or vanishing or something else unique to those classes.
---
Fyi nobody has ever used the search function on any forum ever
---
I just put shit talkers on ignore. I don’t get the point of it. Maybe I’m just too old now lol.
---
I'm so glad Blood Elves weren't in vanilla. Every time I see one of those emo pricks I just want to drive a fire truck through the nearest Hot Topic.
---
Druids are amazing healers and I would always want a few in my raid.
---
The night elves were an entire faction in WCIII, they were and are vastly more important a force than the high/blood elves, who were totally screwed in WCIII.  
---
The more surprising piece is that the blood elves joined the horde, the lore twisting that required was max silly.
---
I play ally except on this new tbc server I went horde. No one buffs anyone. It’s crazy. On alliance I’ve never not been buffed. I have to ask people and I get ignored most of the time. I can’t wait for classic to be ally again. Maybe its a pvp server thing.
---
Lol i know. I can prove I played vanilla. Got that tabard of the protector achieve. 
---
That’s on my birthday!!!!
---
I was curious if they were going make the base game free. Considering most people already own it, and current retail everything is included except BfA with just a subscription.
---
dawg, you need to calibrate your internet-sarcasm detector because it's way off lol.
---
hmm, i'd say if you were only levelling questing/grinding then yeah sure, but if u are tanking dungeons or such then the parry would be better, but in this scenario it's also about getting to the higher arms talents in the tree quicker, rather than spending 5 for cruelty and then going into the arms tree and delaying deep wounds which is actually good early on and such.
---
You didn't make this
---
26-29 unite! Going to be strange this time around. Before was in middle/highschool when I played classic-WotLK, now i'm Career, Wife, kid on the way. Im hoping the 26-29 crowd is in the same boat as me and we have awesome Dad guilds who are "real life'n" it with me
---
I was clearing heroics in WotLK less than 72 hours after release.  In T6 from level 70.  With no knowledge of boss mechanics.  We wiped once on Loken in HoL because we didn't know to run out.  That was it.
---
WotLK heroics were crap.  And so was Naxx, the Eye and Sarth.  Actually, that's not fair.  Sarth was decent as long as you were doing 2 or 3 drakes.  We thought it was going to be harder (I dunno why after the cakewalk that Naxx was), so we just went straight to 0-drake Sartharion the first week and one-shotted it.
---
I recently went on my brother's old account (he passed away during vanilla and I have his account now). He has a level 51 Warrior with 16 days played time. I'm sure he did a lot of dicking around, working on professions, and just general ignorance of the game (Warriors are bad, but they're much worse when you don't know how to optimize them), not to mention he last played probably during 1.4-1.5 so he never saw the newer talents. So yeah, if you're not focused on leveling, prepare to spend 15-25 days to get to get to 60.
---
No. The endgame content should be balanced around the game, not the other way around. If raids are outliers from the rest of the game in term of balance... YOU CHANGE THE RAIDS, NOT THE GAME. That was Blizzard's biggest mistake and it's sad to see people like you argue in favor of changing 90% of the game for 10% of it instead of changing the 10% of the game for the sake of the 90%. If classes were balanced around 1 to 5 man content and you introduce 40 man content, maybe you should consider introducing more encounters that split the raid in smaller groups so that the 1 to 5 man balance might shine more.
---
Thank you! I've been looking for more content like this. Love Classicast, but they have been posting more infrequently (probably due to holidays) and it would be interesting to get a fresh take on some of this stuff. 
---
I’m predicting August 14th... my birthday and the same day as BFA release (eww 🤮)
---
I'm sorry I didn't realize, I have sarcoidosis
---
See? There ya go. 
---
You are the same type of guy when he roll for a chest in Dungeon groupe he got 1 (100) :D
---
My first char to hit 60 was a Hunter. Play time was 17 days doing mostly solo questing. I did some BG's and dungeons. It's pretty easy to get side tracked waiting for groups to form. Travel time and professions/auction house can take up quite a bit of time too. I'd say count on it taking a good amount of time, and don't rush it.
---
Deadmines was the stuff, especially as a Horde player! I remember in Vanilla trying to find a group ballsy enough to brave the shores of STV just to get there. We would always attempt to cross from the beach to the ZG island granted we survived the Gators. Not sure why we always chose that cross seeing as there was this ?? Shark which I swear was straight from Jaws. We would be about halfway across the strait when he would suddenly appear. You wanna talk about pucker factor.... oh man. This dude swam with a vengeance, as if we were the ones who hung his side piece to hang by the tail in Booty Bay. I always made sure to be in the middle of the pack to not be targeted first. He would get through one or two of us before we’d finally reach land where we would commence the taunting. Jumping back in to catch his aggro and then quickly back to land. I stopped doing that after he swam on shore to finish what he started, the run back was worth it. At this point we were in the clear. There was nothing more memorable than reaching Westfall for the first time as a low level Horde. It felt so... taboo. I, being a rogue, would scout ahead to secure a safe route, ensuring there wasn’t an Alliance group preparing to enter the mines. I would inform the group that it was clear and they would make their way towards the entrance. Unbeknownst to them I would wait until there WAS an Alliance group heading our way to signal the all clear (I loved pvp). We would battle back and forth for a few deaths until we would finally rush into the mines all while being chased by 8 level 14’s  and their ?? buddy. Getting the red defias mask as a Horde and bringing it back to Kalimdor was a token of accomplishment. A feat of strength. A testament of tenacity! Classic can’t come any sooner =D!
---
TLDR: I camped that shark once I hit 60. 
---
paying $30 a month for more internet currency and convenience vs paying $15 a month is not more lucrative lol. And before you say "ItS nOt ThAt MuCh MoNeY" It's not about being able to afford it. 
---
If you run a bank alt you sacrifice a couple minutes here and there to switch accounts. Not everyone needs or cares about "muh max efficiency"
---
Been playing this game for a long time and it still takes me around 10 days played to level even a tier 1 class.  
---
I hate leveling :(  
---
I read the manual the game came with that explained the classes and roles, so I knew before I created my account.
---
"Fuck it!  I have a shield, I have frost shock, and I'm tired of waiting for a tank."
---
I love this subreddit. Nobody takes any shit here. It's lovely 
---
You're right that this is a circle-jerk to an extent.  But I would also contend that a lot of those "old-school" raiders quit before Cata rolled around.  I quit a month into WotLK because it was such a joke.  And I didn't know about Wildstar until fairly recently, otherwise I'd have probably played it.  Of course, I'm not every gamer, but I think there is a very profitable niche for players who like challenging games and who like MMOs.
---
Don’t follow YouTube guides they are just bullshit, just try Ellysium forum guide you can find some good guides there trust me, people usually discuss guides if they are good or not depending of there experience, when YouTube it’s just a guy who threw a video to get views..
---
I could see it if they did it like a collectors addition with cool stuff they've had over the years.  Original game manual, map poster board, maybe a newer nice big mousepad (name brand) with a decal. etc
---
sap condom?

Sorry, we don't allow the specific naming of private servers (or most private server discussion; Nostalrius is an exception) on r/classicwow. Please try r/wowservers.

Are you a Blizzard leak? :)
---
Hahah the Anubis looking giants that 1shot people with meteors if you aren't stacked. Love it.
---
No, they should not be exact replica, they should be distinguishable. But I will likely buy one even if the game is free and not going to be on CDs
---
Wonderful read, thanks for sharing!
---
I'm giving one promise/resolution going into Classic. As long as I'm not in a dungeon with a group. I will come running to my friends, if they are getting into a fight with the other faction.
---
I'm going to do my part in keeping world PvP alive. And in doing so hopefully create lots of great memories.
---
The longing is real for Classic.
---
I can't hit the updoot hard enough! Take all of the updoots!
---
That's rough. There is something about the music and ambience in vanilla that is wonderful for me. I just get a huge amount of satisfaction going slower (at least slower for me) and enjoying the leveling. I am a hyper-competitive person, and WOW lets me turn that off. Just imagining fishing underneath the pier in darkshore, when I know I could be off leveling somewhere else but I am not, sounds so awesome. With the music and ambience turned way up, slowly leveling my skills. I find leveling *vastly superior* to max level play.
---
That being said, even though I level my professions, including secondaries like fishing and cooking, I am often vastly ahead of the curve, even if only playing 4-5 days a week for a few hours. ~6-8 days is my speed. When it comes to questing and combat and spatial reasoning (where to walk for each quest), I go into extreme-efficiency mode. I like forming maps and trajectories in my head that require the absolute bare-minimum amount of time by maximizing efficiency. In fact, I play WOW to turn that part of my brain off that does that, but it turns right back on when I'm not fishing or wandering around Ironforge.
---
CWL is working on the technical work without advertising it as much now because the tools are still in development, but they're coming. It'll seem more content focused now because a great deal of the contributors are content creators, and that's something that is already in motion now. But there are quite a few cool web tools in the works. I can't speak for the dev team, but another developer should be appreciated, and I'll bring this post to attention u/JSanko

#sharding 
---
Depends. Will you partake in world PvP? BGs? Looking for groups to dungeons? Do you care about your gear at all? Professions? Will you be helping friends?
---
Solo quest grind only is probably the fastest way. As vanilla a noob? 10+ days /played.
---
The ages are very surprising to me. I expected most players to be mid 30s since during original vanilla those people would have been early 20s. But the overwhelming majority answered mid 20s? These would have been tween/ middle school kids during vanilla! Very surprising.
---
Ofc course one month before I go back to school. 
---
&gt;as a new player
---
&gt;don't do dungeons
---
I understand where you're coming from, but this is terrible advice. Not only will it mean missing out on a considerable portion of the fun, it will result in you becoming a clueness newbie who doesn't know his class and doesn't know what he's doing.
---
"Skip dungeons rush to 60" is what produces dps that pulls mobs and break sheep and hunters who can't control their pet and tanks who don't notice that their healer is dying and all sorts of other bad outcomes.
---
It's better for everyone if new players take the time to learn the game. Better advice that don't do dungeons would be to do _every_ dungeon.
---
It’s one in a million, but it just might work
---

Leeroy, you are just stupid as hell...
---
And I'll probably be on an airplane back home this date too. Figures.  
---
Maybe I'll miss the sharding :P
---
It just makes the game that much better. My friends and I all joined the same guild when leveling. Somehow that guild turned to be one of the top on the server. We raided at 60 together, made alts together, twinks, pvp’d, you name it. 
---
My roommate and I now will be playing again come summer. We’ll be alliance since that’s where the nostalgia for us is. He’ll be a dwarf priest and I’ll be a dwarf hunter. Trying my best to be a huntard, since I played warrior and rogue during real vanilla. We might have a few more joining us. Not hardcore, but we still plan to raid MC and BWL at the least. But you can bet your ass we’ll be the PvPing as much as we can.
---
You can join us if you like. Send me a PM and I’ll keep you updated on what server we plan to role on.
---
It was the first time I noticed Blizzard making a decision because it was good for business instead of for the game.
---
Horde guilds want 6 shaman, 8 in some cases. But they are trash for raiding? Lol
---
Except the primary streamer server is going to be heavily imbalanced and the bigger streams will have a constant mob of fanboys 24/7
---
But Blizzard doesn't push back release dates anymore even if the product is unfinished.
---
Don't get me wrong. I'm fairly efficient. The problem comes when I afk where I'm standing because the website I'm browsing or the TV show/movie I'm watching caught my attention and then I don't realize I stopped playing until the screen flicks over to Character Selection.  
---
I'm efficient, I just seem to have an attention disorder for leveling.  
---
My first 60 back at vanilla release was a shaman. It took me 20 days /played to hit 60. This was totally clueless, no guides, no real mmo experience, no add-ons. Thottbot was an esoteric thing. I had a great time, even though I was terrible. Big windfury procs kept me going. Especially since back then windfury could trigger off itself. 
---
My second 60 was a hunter. He made level 60 in 12 days /played. This was on a later patch after hunter was buffed/reworked. Questing add-ons still werent a thing, but plenty of guides were out by then and people knew where stuff was. 
---
Very solid point.
---
Honestly, people tend to have completely different mentality in vanilla vs current wow, atleast I do. 
---
I do not have the constant reminder of hitting max level asap, because the leveling process itself is a huge experience. You'll most likely have a great time exploring the world, meeting friends (imagine that in a mmo) and doing all the activities there is to do.
---
I literally breeze through the last 3 expansions with one sitting, because the leveling itself and everything included within it doesnt offer much and all the "real" stuff is opened up once you ding max.
---
So my tip honestly is, dont even think about leveling just to get max level sometime soon, but enjoy the ride.
---
I am actually one of them! 25. I never played vanilla, never played tbc or wrath. My first encounter with WoW was cata on my undead hunter. It wasnt until far later thanks to Nostalrius that I got to experience vanilla wow. I thought the game was amazing, especially the world, in comparison to cata. I've always hated the "rose-tinted nostalgia glasses" argument. I had no nostalgia of vanilla, and yet it was still fun!
---
My girlfriend’s cousin is getting married in a destination wedding this June. I’m absolutely fucking terrified Classic is going to come out while I’m gone.
---
Thanks for the follow up. Fun stuff.
---
Sometimes just getting to the instance was amazing! I had similar experiences as alliance. I played my druid mostly, and would stealth and scout all the way through the to Scarlet Monastery or SFK.
---
Good insight. 1.12 isnt really the vanilla experience most people remember.
---
trash as in dare iced coffee being thrown in the garbage trash
---
You don't have a clue what you're talking about
---
U forgot wing clip nightfall hunter
---
i do wish vanilla had dual specs.
---
Can conifrm, my brother's fiance Uncle's cousin works at Blizzard.
---
I mean you would have to windfury&gt;entangling roots&gt;Stormstrike&gt;stormstrike just to do half as much damage as a Demon Hunter
---
27, was on the younger side for grade cut-offs, Vanilla was definitely all high school for me though.
---
Blizzard should suck a murloc tendril cuz they don't care about us in the end....

---
Nobody had full naxx gear lol.
---
MC / BWL era pvp could still be decided in one global (ambush crit / aimed shot crit / windfury crit / seal crit / mortal strike crit )
---
Yeah, MM is better for pve dps until you are hit capped and have 425+ agi, then it’s 0/21/30. Technically, it’s a survival build.
---
I was obsessed with getting the full T2 set for my mage back in the day, the bonus being an occasional free spell (instant Pyro!).
---
I had 7/8 pieces within a month of raiding. The gloves did not drop for another four or five months.
---
I only missed one raid in all of 4-5 months, and that's when it happened.
---
The next time it happened was the evening I decided they will never drop so I FINALLY put the big boy enchantment on my T1 gloves, six months and half my gold later.
---
Mate, I know.
---
That's it I'm putting my leave in now! I'm sure the boss will let me take a month off
---
I totally understand. I know there will be a horrible storm or something and I'll have no power when it's finally released.
---
Another huge change was to the healers mana costs. In ICC gear healers could Spam spells nonstop with not much concern for going oom. Early cata changed that and the healer would quickly run out of mana if the group didn't actively understand the mechanics as to avoid more damage.
---
I can remember that it felt stressful to heal for my guild mates in 5man heroics during the beginning of cata despite being veteran raid healer. Players were so used to how strong healing spells were and how much healers could Spam them that they really expected to be healed enough to just stand in "the fire". 
---
Says the loser looking at a picture of it on reddit. Either normie or chad. Gtfo poser.
---
This story brings me such joy lol. That feeling of walking through STV thinking "I know that F-ing gnome rogue is around here somewhere". 
---
Sometimes you'd quest, and log out. Sometimes you'd quest a little and run back to Ironforge to check your auctions... and sometimes it wouldn't go so well. You suddenly hear that horrible sound. That distinct sound. He is here. He has come for me once again, and I am powerless. The ambush crits. The kidney shot stops you in your tracks. Your eyes slowly close and you raise your head to the heavens. The gnomes right hand glows blue just before his cold-blood eviscerate claims another soul. 
---
Cool! Hope you get a great score!

Lifelong pally here. Holy all the way. EXCEPT when leveling Vanilla.
---
Level 1-50ish you're 95% similar healing as holy or ret, all that matters is having some healing gear for when you head to a dungeon. During normal leveling excursions, you bring nothing else to the table.
---
Level deep ret. (IMO 8 prot for precision, then full ret the rest of the way) - Command can wait a few hours. Benediction, Imp Judge, down to Conviction.
---
Leveling holy just brings nothing to the table for yourself or your friend.
---
unpopular opinion but i always liked stockades.  prob because it tied in with the quest chains so well.  eh.   sfk is nice too though
---
It gives relatively more xp, because they're intended for higher levels. But the quest xp reward never scales and remains static. 
---
You say everything was balanced in WotLK, and then mention frost mages.  The class that already had high burst damage and some of the highest control and survivability in the game, and they turned around and gave them stuns, made barrier root when it broke, and gave them more sustained damage.
---
And you say it was balanced?
---
I switched from runescape to wow around 10th grade and BC had only just started. By the time I reached lvl 70 shattered sun offensive just became a thing. WOTLK released when I found out that girls like boys too. Cata released just before I went to basic training and osama got killed, pandaria released while I was in Afghanistan. Warlords released when I got stationed back in America (and was denied a promotion) legion came out when I started college and absolutely nothing of note happened when BFA dropped. I’m 27 and I feel like a lot of other 27 year olds probably went along the same path with when they started and similar life events
---
Fuck this game makes me nostalgic.
---
I think any thing they do will probably be digital only 
---
Yep, mana in early Cata was cancer, though towards the end of the expac, Disc priest had so much mana regen from Rapture that they were literally reforging spirit off of their gear since they didn't need it.
---
I mean, there were a few high elves and I’m pretty certain a few blood elves as well, both just using light skinned night elf models. 
---
Who else got the original vanilla collectors edition? I can’t wait to use the panda and mini diablo again (sorry zergling)
---
Genius 
---
RemindMe! July 16 
---
I totally agree. I remember videos of people going into that blank north area of Kalimdor and roaming around that entire massive area which in Vanilla was believed where part of the first expansion was going to be before TBC was announced if I remember correctly. I even remember little construction signs w yellow lights on the road before you entered. Does anyone else know what I’m talking about?
---
As a 26 year old, 13 when I first played WoW, I'm not surprised by this peak. I associate my more intensive WoW days (Vanilla to WotLK) with the last period of my life that entailed relatively few responsibilities. That association alone makes the game much more appealing and addicting. I'm sure many others are in a similar boat, and feel attached to the lifetstyle that that time period allowed as well as to the game itself. That said, taxes and health insurance aside, I'm quite happy not to be in high school anymore.

Dad guilds, lol never heard that before. That would be great. Gotta go AFK to change diapers n stuff. 
---
If he’s right this will be a meme on this sub that’s referenced for ages to come.
---
I’m 100% positive they’re release TBC, possibly WOTLK. Seeing how much of a demand their is for “old wow” and people being tired of the current state of wow. They’d be stupid to not release other expansions. 
---
Then why the fuck are you even here?
---
RemindMe! 15 July 2019

You know what he meant come on...

 RemindMe! 16 July 2019 "HAH!"

As someone who played healers almost exclusively in Vanilla-  no.
---
A mediocre skill druid will outclass a mediocre warrior in lower level dungeons, but at higher level dungeons a druid is just not going to come close to a warrior. And even at low levels, a high skill warrior who knew how to stance dance would completely outclass a druid of any skill level.
---
The point where I noticed warriors pulling far ahead of druids was level 40. Plate provided a level of mitigation that druids just couldn't catch up to. That and druids not being able to pot in bear form.
---
I used to run with a bunch of different tanks, both druids and warriors. I would struggle to heal druids in DM/Scholo/Strat as Holy, but I had no problem solo healing 15-man UBRS as Shadow with 2H-wielding zerk-stanced warriors. (Except for that one pull. If you've done UBRS enough you know the one.)
---
honestly it depends...
---
at some points questing is faster if there are a lot of quests and you can chain them together.. there are times though that without a healer to back you up as a warrior the end quest in a chain will be a pain or nearly impossible
---
the real issue for questing not being as fast was due to how areas were spaced out... and honestly I think when I lvld up my druid... one thing I did was when I hit lvl 30 and ran out of quests for the last spot I was leveling I literally found a map and ran around both kalimdor and eastern kingdoms to find all the flight points and leveled up ?? 2-3 times with like 4-5 hours of running in travel form
---
Just kick the guy from the guild already, waste of gear!
---
Amen
---
I wouldn’t necessarily want them to update much on the first run of servers. But I wouldn’t mind them making minor updates like you mention, or a Pally taunt on a fresh server years down the road, if they wanna milk classic before they move on to BC
---
I wouldn't commit myself to anything knowing that WoW Classic might come out in this summer. There is no fucking way I am going to miss another and maybe last release!
---
I would say more like a minimum of 15 days for a new player who doesn't use quest addons.
---
Less than 10 for someone who has never played vanilla before just doesn't sound right to me at all...
---
partly true. druids will spec balance for raids though, deep resto is inferior.
---
well... I cleared wailing caverns one time being only lvl 20 with my rogue acting as the main tank
---
some friends did tiny toon tuesdays and they were missing someone one day and I said I could bring my rogue but he had a whole bunch of boe blues that I threw at him from my other characters that made him a beast....
---
I ended up tanking it due to the tank not being able to generate enough threat.... after that one run though my rogue was banned from tiny toon tuesdays ;(    (they just thought I made the instance too easy and it was ruining the fun of leveling thru dungeons)
---
If you queue with a premade in BG then the population won't make a difference. I bet any AV match with streamers involved would be crazy, just not having to deal their shenanigans in the rest of the game.
---
friend who got me hooked was an mmorpg veteran. right from the get go.  
---
it still sucked as I was the tank...
---
define viable...
---
why would you need more then 1 spec for each aspect of the game?  
---
you can only play one at a time anyways so whats the point?  
---
two options  
---
- pick what you want to do in a raid and choose your class accordingly.  
---
- pick what you want to do in PvP and choose your class accordingly.
---
A new player leveling a warrior is going to take some time. An experienced player playing a warrior can do it relatively quickly.
---
In vanilla my first 60 was a priest and that took about 11 days /played. When I decided to level a warrior, I hit 60 in around 6 days /played.
---
The thing to keep in mind is that a warrior is a VERY gear dependent class. Someone who knows how to make money to buy gear off of the auction house and also knows what quests/dungeons to do for the best gear at their level is going to level MUCH faster than someone who doesn't know those things about a warrior.
---
8 days played is a very fast time for a warrior, most people will be slower.
---
lvl 1
---
Final fantasy XI was out before world of warcraft and I used to play that.... what I didn't know was that I would be able to level by myself after level 18... also if you didn't start when everyone else did the starting zones was not a good gauge at how busy the server was because everyone never went back to the starting areas
---
(in final fantasy XI.. you had one character and you leveled up your jobs for your skill and once you hit 20 you could start your subjob... so everyone was always leveling up their jobs up to at least level 30 so you could get the max benefit from your subjob at max level..  this cause the starting areas to always be populated and busy)
---
May
---
I played on an rp realm but we had people that would flag themselves outside and then someone would accidently smack and then someone would heal and get flagged and then a crazy fight would break out for 10 mins
---
They thought they didn't but they did
---
&gt; it's not impulsive or short-sighted, it's idealistic.
---
Funny how pirate server players "idealistically" and "rationally" and "empathetically" want to force everyone else to play an exact copy of their pirate servers, and anyone who would prefer something different can in your words "go fuck themselves". In the most rational and empathetic way, I assume. Yours is clearly a highly idealistic position.
---
I do wonder sometimes how pirate server players got so assured that Blizzard owes *them* because they pirated Blizzard's game and played it for free for thirteen or fourteen years. While paying overseas shady characters to do so. One could see a strong argument that in fact it is the other way around, and if anything the pirate server community owes Blizzard big time, for ripping them off for so long. But that's just something I wonder about sometimes.
---
It's all irrelevant because while it's highly likely that tens of thousands of people currently playing "blizzlike" pirate servers will sub to Classic, many hundreds of thousands or even perhaps one or two million past and former real customers will also sub to Classic. Pirate players may have been the proof of concept that the game still has legs but that is a very different thing from being the majority of the likely Classic player base.
---
Since the pirate server community are already butthurt over every tiny change and publicly threatening to boycott Classic and go back to pirate servers if they do not get their way in every little thing, Blizzard would have to be mad to make pandering to them their primary business goal. You cater to the bulk of players whose loyalty is robust, not to an entitled minority who will flee the first time something does not go their way.
---
AV won't be in the game at launch
---
I’m well aware of the timeline. By the time someone like OP is 60, it will be.
---
Fair enough!
---
elemental was on a ton of 5s team in tbc the entire comp in 5s was named after elemental cause it was so strong 2345 , the buttons they had to push to destroy a target lol. warrior mage paladin shaman priest. I definitely wouldn't say elemental was way better in vanilla although it was still good.
---
&gt; The point where I noticed warriors pulling far ahead of druids was level 40. Plate provided a level of mitigation that druids just couldn't catch up to.
---
Interesting, since that is also when druids get Dire Bear Form, which is a pretty bonkers upgrade.
---
&gt; I'm saying that this is on average the most likely outcome. Of course, one side can have only people in green gear who backpeddle and keyboard turn while the other side has only Naxx geared players who have been playing their class in PvP for 10 years. That's not a likely scenario though.
---
What's overwhelmingly more likely is that one side will have more twinks/Naxxers than the other and that this alone breaks the game if it is otherwise remotely even.
---
&gt; I was still talking about lvl 60 PvP. Regardless, BGs are about completing objectives, not farming HKs.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but is it not useful if you goal is to complete objectives to be able to kill others players and not die? I am not positioning myself as a WSG expert but I seem to recall I had more luck getting flags home when I killed the other side's flag bearer, and when I stayed alive with the flag myself, as opposed to when their flag carrier lived and ours died.
---
&gt; You really do enjoy to speak in absolutes, don't you? Unless you think that I'm the only twinker who doesn't enjoy twinking because it makes people angry, there are probably people who don't fit the profile that you outlined.
---
If you are trying to pick a fight about whether one-in-a-thousand unicorn twinkers who were sincerely oblivious to the fact they were ruining the game for others and got no joy whatsoever out of bullying people with an overpowered toon existed, you are admitting that the overwhelming majority were and are exactly as I described.
---
&gt; Coming up with silly PvE shit can be fun too. 
---
If that is what they did absolutely nobody would have a problem with them.
---
So tell me, if you can fulfil an urge of yours two ways, one of which ruins the game for others and one of which harms nobody, and you choose the way that ruins the game for others, what does that say about you?
---
!RemindMe 6 months
---
actually during burning crusade.. some people I knew and I made it to 70 in like 3-4 days and were running a heroic ?? slave pens for the first time i think...
---
funny thing is we were like.. hmm how hard is a heroic dungeon?... our ele shaman had to frost kite a melee mob around on so many pulls due to us not having enough cc in our group while I was tanking lol
---
21.8% of people in my age group (30-33) want to roll warrior. Very interesting. Thanks OP.  
---
Bear in mind July 16th is not official date so even though they might have hinted at it, it can still be pushed back at this point.
---
I ACTUALLY DID THIS! I leveled a paladin with a friend, I wore NOTHING but "Of the Gorilla" gear (Strength and Int) I was able to DPS dungeons AND heal them without ever needing to swap anything out ezpz because my gear was stacked with strength and int, druids can do this too with "Of the Falcon" gear (Agil and Int) 
---
It depends... ive leveled about 3 times to 60 on a private server and the key is to not fuck around to much. 
---
To name a few:
---
Hang in Org 
---
Level professions 
---
Do dungeons more than once 
---
Play the AH
---
Gasp at higher lvls 
---
When it comes to speed i always grab as many quests as possible and then find a logical path.  Grind towards the areas and when coming back. 
---
Only learn skills that are necessary. Saves gold and travel time. Look that up and make a note.
---
Strategically use your HS. 
---
1 to 10 you can die without armor loss so its basically a free HS 
---
The tricky part is that once the quest is green, the mobs that you kill for the quest are usually low green - grey levels. So you have to find a middle ground to get efficient xp from the mobs as well.
---
Only once you have enough crit to make nature's grace viable, which won't be the case early on.
---
I'll be traveling the whole of July so rip
---
My point is that psevers values are quite accurate. I dont see why it's so hard to accept for certain people. We all love this game and want to play the best and most accurate version of it. If I thought private servers were completely off I would have no problem admitting it.
---
Since you and the people downvoting me seem to be convinced they are, can please explain to me what makes you think that ? Im genuinely asking. I dont understand where this idea comes from. 
---
Yes, all the data was extrapolated from old sources, Blizzard never released server side stuff. But its not like those values are impossible to calculate. Mob HP, armor and resits, spell proc rates, and item drop rates. All of those things where heavily documented back then. Maybe the drop rate for STV page from some troll isnt exactly accurate, but its gonna be pretty damn close. Its not like blizzard is gonna magically come out and say it was 1% or 99% drop chance or something. Whatever its at on the big projects is very close to what it was back in 2006. And no one cares about that particular value anyway. Boss HP and important item drop rates are much more documented, and therefore probably even closer to reality on pservers. 
---
The idea that all those values are way off and Blizzard is gonna somehow "break all the private server meta" with their "original values" just makes no sense to me, and im honestly surprised to see so many people think like that.
---
Atleast I've never heard that a world of warcraft event smells like a garbage truck.. like most smash events.
---
You can actually kite an inkeeper to anywhere you want around the map and when you set your hearthstone to him, it will teleport you right at the place you set it up on. You can get a HS to Ungoro this way
---
...your wife.
---
He says they didn't need any more content, yet my lvl 58 shaman back in 2005, grinding the last two levels in Eastern Plaguelands because I was out of quests begs to differ. 
---
&gt; undead hunter
---
Puked in my mouth a bit there.
---
As a shaman I just save in bank int/healing gear for slots and if needed pick it up from the bank. Leveling enhancement gear will usually consist of leather, later some mail and will give good damage mitigation aside of DPS while healing items would provide lower - that's why it's good to have few extra pieces for another role. And Paladins rather don't level as holy, just like druids or shamans find it frustrating to level as casters.
---
And I tanked SFK as a shaman - shield + leather at those levels.
---
true
---
&gt;2hand fury has 0 downtime, no food or bandages required.
---
You are not meant to be grinding grey mobs.
---
We allready know when its being released, it was on the Classic wow dev panel with the gnomes name among other things :)
---
No it did not. You simply cannot deal that much damage in one swing with untamed blade. 
---
Even if you get both procs, diamond flask and are buffed to the teeth so you sit on 3k Attackpower, you still wont be swinging for more than 1k-1.1k damage (14 AP = 1 DPS).
---
The priest would have what? 3k hp and 1k armor badly geared without inner fire up?
---
If that was the case, Quel'Thalas wouldn't be this insanely clunky implementation where it's in the same instance as Outland.
---
It is though. Relative to the other specs in the game, elemental shamans and ret paladins (just to name another) are much better than their TBC counterparts relative to other classes.
---
up to lvl 45/50. we played in a group of 4 players. i always tanked as wl with my void walker. but at some point it was just not possible anymore. around that time our warrior discovered, that he can be pretty "tanky" with a shield.
---
/unexpectedleeroy
---
John Staats was a 3d level designer and not a quest designer. So his statement may have been from a game world size perspective rather than a quest perspective.
---
On average your going to look at a /played time of around 10 days (240hrs of played time) just to get to 60.
---
Unless you know what you are doing, have a guide set up, routes memorized, and a veteran in your vanilla class.
---
Mileage may vary
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
Just go MGTOW.
---
and this is the story of a level 49 warlock having more character than the final raid boss in recent retail wow expacs \\s
---
Having balanced factions in a faction based game is pretty good for the game.
---
You really think there isnt 6-8 shamans in every horde raid ? Theres usually closer to 10 warriors (with 3 of em tanks), 6-8 rogues, 5-6 of each healers (including paladins).
---
So your logic really doesnt make sense. Other classes that have more are cheaper, other classes that have same number are cheaper. Only difference is that mages have ton of gold.
---
I think they did this initially to lock out any player who hadn't paid for the expansion, and never looked back.
---
depends on class, experience with the game itself (complete newby vs someone that has played any wow expac before) and also on what you do besides leveling (like professions, dungeons)
---
All in all 10-15 days /played is not far from being realistic.
---
I read a bit about the game prior to the European launch, so I knew before logging in for the first time.
---
k
---
came here to say the same, those meteors
---
Really ? Forget arena then. Ret paladins got seal twisting in tbc and access to windfury which actually made them decent. Forget arena think just general damage elemental shamans and ret paladins can do burst in vanilla but their sustained is terrible elemental goes oom super quickly.  
---
In tbc elemental shamans actually have mana pools things like totem of wrath unique to them to buff others. Seal twisting especially with windfury made ret actually do something. By far I would say tbc was a better time to be any type of hybrid dps.
---
basically what you want to do once you hit 60, in any order, but first point is the most important one:
---
 \- get epic mount
---
 \- establish a source of income (find farming spot or method that suits you, so you can buy epic mount and all the stuff you will need for professions)
---
 \- do attunments, epsecially Onyxia takes a long time since you have to do so many dungeons
---
\- work towards your BiS items, spreadsheets can be found on Google
---
 \- push your professions
---
 \- (after mount has been bought) get all the class skills you skipped during leveling
---
 \- finish class quests you might have skipped during leveling that give you a skill or similar
---
lmao that is very funny.
---
Agree. The whole point of giving you abilities/spells when leveling is that you learn your class one ability at the time.
---
I'd ask, why would you try to *force* people to be locked in into *your* preferred server? Let people play whatever they want. Blizzard themselves (Brack) said that they don't have "performance goals" for Classic: "once we’re committed to doing this at a Blizzard level, which we are, whatever happens is going to happen. If millions of people show up and play for years, that’s awesome. And if just tens of people show up and play for years, we’re fine either way."
---
And it wouldn't work, in any case. If Classic changes, it'll stop being Classic. Then people who wanted Classic will leave. If it doesn't change, people can always come back.
---
Of course if it doesn't change, a lot of people who start when it's released will get bored and leave eventually. That's when Blizzard can release TBC servers to keep them playing. And so on with the other expansions. (Even derided expansions have their fan base. :)
---
After a while people can decide what expansion they want to play and they'll basically never unsubscribe. This is a no brainer for Blizzard, they'll do it, I'm quite sure.
---
What they'll *not* do is "updating" Classic and starting a separate WoW series. For what? To placate a few people? (Although they can be loud here, they are a small minority all considered.) It's a lot of effort for a very small and unsure payoff.
---
Of course I'm not Blizzard and I don't see the future. :) But I'd be very surprised if things were to happen differently.
---
10 days of /played if you dont screw around too much. Screwing around is fun though.
---
Yup, it was added in Before The Storm, so without the portal anyone would've been able to stroll into Ghostlands, Burning Crusade or not.
---
In hindsight, they most likely regret that choice a fair bit.
---
LOL i cant wait for people to strutt into MC with the mindset of "this is easier then LFR" and then whipe endlessly untill they cry theyr eyes out
---
You know what? Thank's for warning us man i believe in your story
---
They shouldn't even do this.
---
There are classic boxes and they are called "World of Warcraft". There's standard editions and collectors editions. Releasing boxed sets now would be for the sole purpose of generating money from - sorry for this - blizzard fanboys that buy everything blizzard related no matter the quality of the product.
---
There's so many reasons why boxed sets would be a bad idea and the only good reason for it would be to make a couple of customers happy. That ain't a good deal.
---
It was sort of a gradual realization for me. I came from Ultima Online, and dedicated healers were...kind of not a thing in UO. Yes, you could do it and some people did, but it wasn't super common and certainly not a required role. But "heal these people" isn't exactly a complicated idea.
---
So the after I competing my seal form quest I started questing in Westfall, and some random person whispered me and asked to heal the deadmines. I didn't know what that was, but somebody wanted a healer for something, sure that was a familiar concept, so I said sure and went along.
---
At the time I had no idea what I was getting into, but I was level 17 or 18 or so and the run went pretty smoothly. Somebody mentioned that somebody was a "tank" but having never heard the term in that context, I thought...you know, _tank_, and tanks have big guns on them, so I assumed they were telling me that was the guy that was going to do most of the damage. Which didn't really mean anything to me. I mean, I was there to heal. What did it matter who was doing the damage? All I needed to worry about was who was _receiving_ the damage, and hey...tanks have a lot of armor, right? So what about that would lead you to think the tank would need more healing than the other people?
---
So threat and aggro were completely not on my radar and I don't remember anyone even mentioning them.
---
But healing a dungeon was _fun_, and it was stress free, nothing much ever attacked me, all I had to do was hang in back and heal people and I get loot for that? Yes, please! 
---
So I ended up leveling as resto. It took 22 days /played and I ended up healing a lot of dungeons along the way. I saw almost every dungeon in the game, everything except I think Ragefire Chasm and one of the Razorfen dungeons, and at one point I spent like a week of real time doing nothing but hanging out at the Scarlet Monastery running dungeons. At some point during that process, it wasn't all at once, I picked up on how a tank wasn't the guy with the "big gun" but rather the guy that ran around with a giant target on his face shouting "hit me!" plus all of the other details. Then at some point somebody asked me to bear tank the stockades, and again I said sure, and piece by piece I put it all together. It wasn't an all at once realization. It grew over running a bunch of dungeons.
---
You might not like it, but thems the facts.
---
Its funny how you are not even denying his accusations, knowing they are true. But you keep to your opinion, so have some respect for that!
---
   Paladin leveling, at reaching level 34 respec into prot all the way down to Reckoning 5/5, Next find your shield, Delete that shit you are a mans man, cause you are about to turn the most defensive healer in the game into a chainsaw-wielding murder machine.
---
   Next make a macro /sit (hard work I know) and keybind that shit.
---
   Now spam /sit inbetween your auto attack, much easier with a swing timer addon.  You now have some of the highest leveling dps with very little down time.  
---
   Yes your health bar has now been turned into dps, but guess what this fucking gravy train ain't stopping now.  Other classes are limited to using special attacks which normalizes their attack speed down to 3.3 (patch 1.8) But Reckoning isn't a special attack.  So instead you look for the slowiest top-end-iest damaging weapon you can find and smash fucking face cause you have windfury on EVERY attack! 
---
  Oh wait did I say windfury cause what I meant to say was CHAINSAWFURY!  Windfury has a 20% chance to trigger? Try every time you get crit, and with you BM each mob you run into with your handy /sit macro you will be getting crit all the time.  Windfury only has 2 extra hits?  Get that weak sauce out of here reckoning stacks up to 5 extra hits! turning your weapon into a certified murder stick of death the Doom marine would be proud of
---
  This can all be yours for the low low price of, your health.  You know that thing you, YES you, can heal cause you are a light-wielding bad ass with more or less infinite sustain.
---
P.S. Also get to laugh at every rogue that tries to gank you as their face is turned into modern Picasso.
---
EVERYTHING!?
---
I want TBC only for my homies who'd rather play TBC than Vanilla. 
---
If 9 years of loosing subs doesn't teach them anything..... I doubt they learn suddenly from classic. 
---
&gt;However, the game was different. Raiding wasnt the be-all and end-all. Retribution was a popular spec because it was a.) good for levelling,
---
Depends what you mean by good. They are fairly safe levelers. But they are actually slower than average, which is typically what people use to determine how "good" a leveler is. 
---
&gt; b.) very strong in PvP due to its burst and survivability
---
This is a bit of a stretch. We know from private servers that ret paladins aren't a part of any serious premade PvP group. And if you want to reach max rank, at least on a private server, you MUST be in a premade PvP group - otherwise even playing 24/7 you simply cannot get enough honor. It is fine in pug PvP though - just like *every other class*. So unviable/bad in serious PvP and fine in Pug pvp =/= "very strong." 
---
&gt;
---
 and c.) actually pretty good in 5mans where you could provide all the added Paladin utility like backup heals, good buffs, auras etc and still do acceptable dps.
---
This is true, and it's always nice to have a backup rezzer as well, who also has a raid save mechanic. That said, and this is repetition of the pug PvP point, they are fine, just like everybody else. They're weaker than average dungeoners, but the floor for being a fine/viable dungeoner is so low that it doesn't really matter. 
---
&gt;Blizzard's view on Paladins was that if you wanted to raid, you probably had to heal. 
---
This is patently false. Listen to Kevin Jordan's CountdowntoClassic interview. He was the class designer for all 9 classes, and all balancing decisions went through him. He said explicitly that he viewed the balance of vanilla as a failure. He said explicitly that the goal was for hybrids to be able to raid in whichever spec, and that people didn't bring them to raids was a problem they were trying to fix. In case you don't want to listen to that whole interview (though I'd recommend it, it's very interesting) - you can get a taste for what he was thinking with this twitch clip https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractiveTangentialStingrayThunBeast
---
&gt;That's the thing with Vanilla. Players nowadays are used to the Current "all things must be balanced" view of WoW. That isnt BETTER, its just DIFFERENT. To me, the fact that there were a lot of imbalances made the game really a lot more interesting.
---
Is it really the imbalance that makes the game interesting? Most people's issues with BFA (and newer, retail WoW) is that the classes are homogenized - they play very similarly and have similar mechanics and whatnot. But look at TBC. It's pretty uncontroversial, even in this forum, to say that the PvE class balance was better. They were both less homogenized than Vanilla, and better balanced. It's having very unique specs and abilities that differ from class to class - asymmetrical abilities - that makes it interesting, not poor balance. 
---
Nice story unfortunately the last part killed it all. 
---
I wouldn't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to buy a two week head start for 29.99! 
---
And if all your friends are already 60 by the time you get back, just buy a character boost for 59.99.
---
Can mods step the fuck up and ban these troll posts?
---
There are two specific issues here.
---
a}  In psychological terms, classic WoW, more than virtually any other game in existence, was built on elitism.  Elitism causes negative feedback loops, because if you're telling yourself that you're one of the best players in existence, (and especially if in reality you aren't) you will likely also tell yourself that you don't want a single person in the group you're playing with to be less Godlike than you, because they will hold you back.  So the more successful a given guild or raid group got, the more sociopathic and exclusionary they tended to become.
---
Elitism in a game like WoW, is even more likely, if you're in an offline scenario where you are still living with your own parents in middle age, know virtually no one outside of said parents, do nothing with your time other than playing WoW itself, and are very unlikely to reproduce; because whatever sense of self-worth you might have, has literally no other basis.
---
b}  In vanilla in particular, while there were three classes which were ostensibly hybrids, (the Paladin, the Shaman, and the Druid) their performance in any of the game's three main roles, (healing, tanking, damage) genuinely ***was*** vastly below the level which any of the dedicated classes could reach, and this was deliberate on Blizzard's part, as a tradeoff for their flexibility.  Blizzard did not expect the truly psychopathic social dynamics that developed in relation to raid min/maxing.

"Viable," is a completely subjective term, and in practical terms it is defined as being something which those who have appointed themselves as class or raid gatekeepers want.  In other words, they decide on a completely arbitrary basis what "viability" is, and if you don't meet that definition, they get someone else who does.  It's an example of Marx's [Reserve Army of Labour](http://culturalstudiesnow.blogspot.com/2017/11/marx-on-reserve-army-of-labor-unemployed.html) theory.  I'm not a Communist, but as with any other group in existence, a few of Marx's ideas were useful, as in this case.
---
I will give you my opinion about the subject. And this is only my opinion, maybe some people will disagree but the beauty about vanilla is that you can play any class you want and any spec you want. It all depends on the purpose you want to give to your character. As some people said if you want to raid and pvp on an optimal way you will have to spec a certain spec. But vanilla is not only PvE so you can play whatever you want and you will still enjoy the game a lot. 
---
The end boss of TBC was a demon hunter, which in class terms is a hybrid between a Hunter and a Rogue, if that tells you anything.  From memory Illidan's daggers were the first legendary items to be introduced into the game at that point, and although they were not at first, they were later made Rogue specific.
---
Also, the ridiculous changes to the Paladin in particular were the main reason why I, as a Hunter, stopped playing battleground PvP in WoTLK.
---
Frost mage wasn't OP in wotlk not in PVP nor in PvE. Did you even play the expansion? every class was very balanced and every comp - mainly 3v3 was great. I played wotlk on retail and after that on AT for many years and no I didn't play a frost mage. Roots shared DR, stun was dispellable, their survivability was pretty low when you knew how to counter them in arenas (but it looks like you played a warrior and only did some duels against them).
---
you posted a wall of text, I read it whole twice to be sure I won't write anything out of context and you come and say you won't read mine yet you still react? pathetic
---
Who would want to play classic wow? Oh man the brd runs all over again!!!! nooooooooo!
---
Pretty much everything you said is wrong, really bad advice. 
---
Druids in PvE wotlk were pretty godly. I was topping heal meters in greens and blues compared to some of the other guys who had been raiding and healing naxx for a bit longer with epics.
---
&gt;PVP: Vanilla! Warlocks abilities to 1v2 or 1v3 in vanilla far exceed &gt;other expansions, and their chain fears in vanilla are too strong &gt;and too fun.
---
Warlocks best PvP expansion was TBC. SL/SL is one of the strongest PvP builds in the game's history. 
---
&gt;PVP: Vanilla! Warlocks abilities to 1v2 or 1v3 in vanilla far exceed other expansions, and their chain fears in vanilla are too strong and too fun.
---
Maybe like 10-12 days /played if you focus on leveling and skip things like professions. It's really hard to say, cause the journey to 60 is an especially fun one the first time around so it's not like leveling as fast as possible is necessarily the best way for you to go.
---
Its my Birthday i wouldnt mind
---
"Summer 2019" for Blizzard means August 31st. So it'll be pretty much autumn anyway
---
Because it would give players a min panic attack before starting to play.... What if the server launch experience I chose was the wrong choice. what if it's going to be a dead server in a month. Google isn't giving a answer, lemme head to the forums...
---
This is before even having the stress of picking a class/race
---
Out of content? More like you skipped the dungeon content. 
---
I leveled a warrior and I was 60 with atleast half the quests undone in EPL and nothing completed in Sithilius. 
---
Cause they ran out of developing time before release
---
&gt; From memory Illidan's daggers were the first legendary items to be introduced into the game at that point, and although they were not at first, they were later made Rogue specific.
---
1. They ARE swords
---
2. They were not the first legendaries. In vanilla we had Sulfuras and - what rogues could actually wield - Thunderfury.
---
I stand corrected.
---
I was a Hunter Main from Classic to MoP and personally I value TBC the most. Reasons are simple:
---
- we still had the deadzone
---
- we still had autoshot-clipping/timing
---
- we still had our melee weapons (and damn i loved the Halberd of Desolation)
---
- we still had mana (and thus had to manage the mana)
---
- we had two very competetive specialisations with MM and SV
---
- we had probably the coolest bows to ever be introduced to WoW with Black Bow of the Betrayer as well as our Legendary Thori'dal
---
All in all I would argue that TBC was the highlight for most of the classes. While WotLK made pretty much all speccs viable for almost all of the classes the complexity went down and with it the fun. 
---
1) There are no specs, there are talent builds.
---
2) "1 spec (build) for class is useful in pve/pvp" - that's straight wrong. Different builds are optimal different activities.
---
You should remove the fake hunter entries. There's a couple of series of hunter picks with age &lt;15. Clearly fakes. It will screw your data.
---
Kill them all !! 
---
Cut off their heads and impale em in front of Ironforge!! 
---
I (personally) see no point in taking time off since getting to 60 will take me at least a month anyway, and a few days of 8 hours additional game time won't contribute much in the grand scheme of things. 
---
Burn wotlk and cata 
---
Sorry I missed this! I totally agree. I all the cut content and more. But the all design, none of the cross server or lfg changes and a HARD level 60 cap.
---
Just looking through the data and I see:
---
1/22/2019 18:47:31	Hunter	15 or younger
---
1/22/2019 18:47:36	Hunter	15 or younger
---
1/22/2019 18:47:41	Hunter	15 or younger
---
1/22/2019 18:47:46	Hunter	15 or younger
---
1/22/2019 18:47:54	Hunter	15 or younger
---
1/22/2019 18:47:59	Hunter	15 or younger
---
1/22/2019 18:48:05	Hunter	15 or younger
---
Those might be duplicated.
---
As far as ICC is concerned, Druids, Paladins and Priests were pretty much on par. Can't speak much for the other classes but as far as those three are concerned, it's quite the even battle. So you've pretty much just outskilled the other dudes.
---
It's absurd how much cooler DM is compared to Ragefire. 
---
I dont panic anymore. I just stand still and spam /chicken at them. 
---
They also told us for years they'd never make WoW classic and people told us we were dreaming. 
---
/sit macros dont work outside of pservers
---
Sit macro will not work in Classic. 
---
&gt;The only good reason i see not completing it for a recreation is time and money.
---
Yeah dude, don't worry about those unintended consequences, Blizzard's probably just lazy for not wanting to balance the specs.
---
I loved to do dungeons just to try to get all kinds of cool loot while I was lvling and it took me about 20 day /played in actual vanilla as a hunter. But like I said lotssss of dungeons, I wanted every piece of gear possible and I just enjoyed 5 mans and doing boss fights and just loot in general. Probably how I'll level again mostly, I mean of course I'll do quests too but dungeons are where it's at, plus it makes quests easier cuz you have powerful loot for your lvl.
---
Another day, another useless comment.
---
We thank both you and the OP for your sacrifice. Will pour out a Refreshing Spring Water at the Goldshire Inn in your honor.
---
I should also mention that the people I've seen doing this tended to be level 35-40 and never went higher.  
---
The two most active buyers when I needed gold haven't logged on much recently, and now new buyers seem to be active
---
Did somebody say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
I think there aren't really any cause if you rush prebis and are active you'll quickly find a guild to raid with if that's your goal. My take is max professions you want and get as much prebis as is necessary to start raiding then enjoy endgame life!
---
You want to ask a company that, not a forum.
---
I’m specifically remembering naxx though and I think post naxx everything was relatively close like you said
---
Can confirm, just booked a trip to Italy that week. 
---
I remember spending hours exploring it when we finally did get in there. Swimming to the bottom of the pool below the tree just to see what was down there. Then once we were done, we climbed to the highest peak and slowfalled off to see if we could reach Orgrimmar.
---
Loginserver overload, server crashes, bugs, etc.
---
the only correct answer is it doesnt matter how long it takes, as long as youre having fun doing so.   even if it takes you a damn year but youre having fun thats all that matters.   
---
too many people jaded from leveling up so much that their giving advice to reduce youre fun and immersion for the sake of speed. dont do dungeons?  absolute shit tier advice.
---
Going back and forth between holy priest and holy paladin. 
---
I heard paladin is very boring to heal as, since you ll be spamming 1 or 2 spells, priests have some variety at least. And leveling as priest is a bit better. I want to play both pve and pvp, both are ok at either, but paladin probably takes the win in pvp and priest in pve. 
---
Could anybody convince me for either one please?! I want to stop doubting :(
---
RemindMe! 16 July 2019 "Check in on WoW Release date loser"
---
The second option is better than the first imo. That being said,  being that these raids are trivial and population caps will exist,  scrounging up 5 shamans will be hard enough regardless of spec for raiding 
---
still got ptsd fighting warlocks as a mage in 2v2 arenas.  fuck druid/lock combo, damn.
---
Wildvine (if that name was correct) from troll NPCs from STV for example. They have a low droprate but sell for a decent amount since theyre needed for the Tribal LW pre-quests, which everyone who wants to make Devilsaur sets early game will need
---
Couple more things to add is that a Warrior can tank 3 mobs better than a Druid. A Warrior's Sunder Armor generates more threat than Swipe. Cleave also generates more threat than Swipe. In any AoE scenario (which doesn't happen often), Warrior Demo Shout and Sunder split between mobs (with Cleaves thrown in now and then, not to mention the Charge + Thunderclap at start) are better threat generators than Druid Shout + Swipe for aggro.
---
When talking about survivability when tanking 3 mobs (or more) Warrior is obviously more tankier than the Druid.
---
Warrior Stance Dance gives Warrior better mobility (yeah, it is crap mobility, but Druids don't even have that mobility).
---
Boss tanking is 100% Warrior field. Given equally geared and skilled Warrior and Druid, Warrior's single target threat is MUCH higher than Druid's. As for survivability, Warrior is clearly far superior to druid.
---
The only department when Druids are actually generate more threat are Swiping non-elite mobs. But those non-elites packs are extremely rare.
---
And tbh, CC is mandatory regardless of how many targets a Druid can tank, because if there are too many, the Druid will probably die.
---
The Druid tank is an OK tank for 5 men dungeons. Not on par with the Warrior, but good enough to have a good run.
---
I did and still have a box in great condition but I lost access to the account linked to it so no pets for me anymore.
---
To quote the [speed leveler Joana:](https://www.joanasworld.com/tips-tricks.html) 
---
19.  Avoid grinding as much as possible, if you want to get to 60 faster, easier, and with less boredom, then learn to do the quests instead. I actually spend a lot of time flying/riding around turning in quests or moving to the next area (which is still faster than grinding).  And while doing all that flying, I take breaks to eat (in RL) or whatever. If you're grinding, you have to be there non-stop.  Not to mention, questing increases your reputations a lot, compared to grinding, which hardly doesn't at all.  Questing is the way to play this game, not grinding. 
---
Do you actually argue for which is the better tank considering MOMENTS? You do know that this implies EXCEPTION, right?
---
I am sorry, but the fact that a Druid can shine once in a blue moon doesn't make it a BETTER tank than Warrior.
---
Hey another developer here - I run https://barrens.chat which is a growing forum and guides base mainly.
---
I developed a base stats calculator and am in the process of making a simple comparison tool for people choosing which class/race to go for.
---
There are a few people already working on things like guild recruitment websites so I think that’s pretty saturated.
---
Until they release details on the API to use I don’t think there are many new ideas out there atm. 
---
I’ve always wanted to see something like this but never had the skills to do it: a sort of search engine that crawls archived vanilla fan sites and guides etc. So places like the original game guid site, alakazham, thotbot, tentonhammer etc. Would love to see this eventually happen and would be happy to help/host it if you were interested in a collab.
---
Coming from EQ it was well learned already. Was a bit strange to have so many shamans tanking on horde side though. Not because no one recognized they weren't true tanks but because there were so few tanks aroubd at all. One of my most memorable times was running all the lower part of UBRS with just a shaman tank with us mostly wearing garbage gear. 
---
I'm fairly set on Priest, but don't really know what to play. Humans look good and have some decent racials. Dwarves have great racials but look kinda goofy when casting shadow/offensive spells. Night Elves seem comfy and rare, though not as good as the others. 
---
Trolls seem great in terms of racials and lore etc, but IMO look kinda goofy in robes and priest sets.
---
Undead Priests look cool too and their racials aren't that bad, though they do seem overplayed relatively speaking. 
---
Posted it at the same time ;-)
---
Also a similar warlock entry somewhere which looks like dupes/troll attempts.
---
I'l take a Mage over a Druid tanking in Cat form.
---
The reason I listed shaman and paladin dolls is because the other faction also loots those.  so if they are expensive,  lets say 20g , people will ship them to the enemy for profit,  buy a shaman doll in Ironforge for 5g, go to booty bay and sell  them to horde for 15g..    This means the price will always drop , demand is twice as low as the other dolls, with the same supply.
---
and druids are by far the least played class, so they are also cheap. 
---
If you would have read my message you would have seen that I also listed warriors as the other max played class .
---
and of course this will always vary from server to server a bit, class balance, server age  and server population are different. 
---
Tell you what, don't look at void elves then 
---
RemindMe! 16 July 2019 
---
Improved totems aren't that much needed. If you want to go enhancement then you can have them but that also requires Nightfall Axe and raid group that wants an enhancement. In most cases there won't be any surplus of healers so going standard resto build will be the best solution. Plus on bosses like Ragnaros going melee with a mana bar is a no no. Also there may be cases where you will be in casters group with tranquil air totem or as a second tremor totem in tank group.
---
It is completely false.
---
Boomkin is the only spec that doesn't do good in any department, be it raids, dungeons, leveling, PvP or farming.
---
ALL other specs and classes are very good in AT LEAST one of the above parts of Vanilla.
---
PvE content is : leveling, dungeons, raids and farming.
---
PvP content is : WPvP and BGs.
---
Again, EXCEPT Boomkin, ALL other specs and classes are viable in AT LEAST ONE of the above contents.
---
I did play TBC (Kael'thas-EU, french server). 
---
After some patches, unfortunately, heroics were optional since the previous-season PvP sets were so easy to obtain (you could obtain previous seasons by battleground honor points instead of doing arenas). My rogue jumped right in Karazhan at 70, and cleared it multiple times with random people. Dungeons were deprecated, you would just skip to raids, which had no attunement anymore at that point.
---
A better critique of my post is that I did not take into account that many bad things (according to me) introduced by TBC only were added during it, and were not present at 2.0.1. Now that would be very true (biggest weakness in my opinion IMO). But since as far as we know Blizzard mainly take last patch as reference, that's the state of the game I reason about. Thus when I think about recreating TBC, I see 2.4 When LK, I think 3.3.
---
I have very good memories of TBC. But in my mind it's only the least worse version and can't hold a candle to Vanilla. I agree it had great balance (LK did not, however).
---
I do not feel like I mixed expansions in the post. And I don't see any link to modern retail which is another beast completely. Lastly I apologies, I lost my temper and wrote a sarcastic shitpost which does not promote discussion at all.
---
So if a classic BC was released, since deadzone was removed midway through BC, there's a good chance deadzone would be gone from the beginning, no?
---
they added a lot of quests in various patches, so depending on when in 2005 you were hitting 60  that might explain it.  Or maybe you just missed a bunch during the lvl 30-50 zones. I never ran out of quests in 2005, but I only played 1 character, a warlock and I don't remember how many dungeons I did during leveling , but I did all of them at least once I think .
---
Improved WF is a trap, it only provides your party static 90 AP bonus for their **white** windfury extra attack.  14 AP = 1 DPS for whites and when you throw in 20% proc chance then the boost is negligible, about 7 DPS per player. You'd better be off going full resto and learning how to totem twist (quick totem swapping to provide both +Agi/-threat and WF buff simultaneously, and you will need quite a lot of +int gear for that), this is what will make you the top-tier melee support shaman, not the imp. WF.
---
Agreed. I wish they had made some sort of redemption arch instead of the bloodelf, making them high elf again and on alliance side. After all, they were close allies of Lordaeron back in WC and WCII. 
---
Blizzard knew horde side "needed" a "pretty" race so they made the switch-a-roo to force bloodelf into horde.
---
Silly decision.
---
I know this is meant in a joking matter [Happy Birthday btw!], but I fully expect it to drop anywhere between 11th of 17th of June, not July. And we may possibly get open beta testing for server stability in March. If not, I will eat something out of my fridge.
---
Maybe you should check private server guild progression in 2018. Out of 200+ guilds that cleared MC, less than 30 cleared AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Does this look like TRIVIALIZING the content?
---
Oh, and that was in 2018, after years of meta practicing on p servers, AND with WRONG armor and damage values from P servers.
---
So, out of all private server guilds in 2018, LESS than 15% of the guilds managed to clear AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Nobody gives a fuck about facerolling MC or 10 dudes puging BWL along 30 hardcore players from a top guild.
---
The fact is that over 80% of the player base in PRIVATE SERVERS (the ones with wrong values and years of meta) DID NOT CLEARED AQ40 or Naxx.
---
In Classic, it will be even worse : over 90% of the player base won't clear AQ40 and Naxx, and most likely, 75% won't even set foot in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Classic will be a nightmare for most people, once they start BWL. Gear and skill won't matter at all. Commitment, discipline and organization WILL MATTER. And those are HARDCORE GUILDS attributes.
---
And HARDCORE GUILDS will be less than 15%. All the OTHER GUILDS will be stuck in MC, ZG , Ony and AQ20.
---
With some random casuals who will raid BWL along their firend's HARDCORE GUILD.
---
I mean the argument could be made that the slope has already been slipped. This will definitively NOT be the same game, and there are already changes (no spell batching, release schedule, macro system, sharding, 1.12 talents etc) So the real question is what changes are acceptable and would be easy to balance around. Some would love to see specs brought up a bit, and others are ok with the already mentioned changes, but are drawing an imaginary line trying to justify what blizzard will do. Personally I want some changes, mostly nerfs to keep the game in the SPIRIT of vanilla. People stacking world buffs was not really a thing back in vanilla, you might get your ony head buff but that was about it. 1.12 talents are much more powerful than early builds, as such I would love to see a cap on world buffs and raid boss health/damage go up to keep them interesting and to account for the 1.12 changes, I want vanilla to last a long time, but in the current state of things MC will be cleared within a month, and will mostly be a filler raid very soon.
---
The OP is right on the money.
---
I can only agree with his statements.
---
I find it interesting how few of the older players are returning to Classic based on this sample. Wonder if that's indicative of their knowledge and memory of the grind and farm and no rose tinted glasses as is often quoted.
---
Interestingly the age group most likely to play is represented by Millennials who most likely didn't play for a great length of time if at all and are keen to experience a different game to modern WoW. Perhaps quite a few Nost players in this sample in that age bracket.
---
Anyways thanks for this.
---
Its impossible to answer this question, because expansions have many patches within them. Each patch will either buff/nerf a class.
---
Are you referring to a certain version of the game? this would help.
---
I healed as Paladin and Priest in ICC. If I remember, Pally was the king of raw output of healing/ Stack Int gear and gems and you were a god. Priest was more flexible, but couldn't put out quite as much.
---
For warrior there are 3 main tank builds and 3 main fury/dps builds, all of which have their own minor variations aswell depending on taste. 
---
That is basically 6 viable raid specs for warriors atleast.
---
2 or 3 weeks probably. Got 41 days off this year, so I can manage it.
---
The min-maxing people do sometimes is unfounded, other times legitimate.
---
Think down the road, if your group ever wipes because the tank got feared or you get feared in pvp, will you regret not being a dwarf or undead? If you can live with yes, then all the other racial are honestly insignicant and are unlikely to ever make or break an encounter, so just play what you want to play. 
---
No, it has been shown no amount of gear will make Survival better. Yes, your personal dps might be higher, but the overall raid dps (your dps+the group dps gained by TSA) is always in favor of MM.
---
I can remember the details very vividly of my first deadmines run. I can remember it was a very sunny day and my window was slightly open. The smell of the spring breeze was filling my room in my New England home. I was in shock of the sense of adventure I was feeling from a video game. The immersion was enrapturing. 
---
I will never recapture that sense of wonder unfortunately but that’s okay. That memory is sufficient. Can’t wait for classic...
---
[removed]
---
Yeah it’s tricky and I don’t think there are two sides exactly. However, when a dungeon goes from ”stupidly hard” to ”absolute faceroll”, that tells me that devs are out of touch with their playersbase. They can’t please everyone, but they should find a solid middle ground between casual and hardcore, solo and group play, challenging and leds challenging content. 
---
This seems hard, but keep in mind that they were able to do this for quite a while, almost three expansions (ofc wrath is debatable). Something happened on those years at blizz, and it wasn’t good.
---
On vanilla pservers I learned that you can sell sharp arrows and heavy shots on the AH for 3-4s while buying them for 50c at the vendors. People not really familiar with the bullet upgrades think you can only buy rough arrows or light shots at the vendor (which is correct in start zones like Goldshire) and see the upgrades at the AH and buy them ;-)
---
You can also run through the bank in UC.
---
I’m getting married 7-17 at a destination wedding so the 16th is definitely happening. 
---
Fair point! :) I sure hope classic comes out great 
---
spelling of *your* checks out.
---
is stopid amerikuhn.
---
Then most people will realize 6 months after release that Bears are actually better than warriors for 95% of raids content.
---
["*What class will you be playing in classic?*"](https://imgur.com/a/xc0af06)
---
If I were you, I’d try out both! But it sounds to me like you are leaning more towards priest. 
---
If you want to play healer in PvP then yes maybe paladins are the superior. But I think you’ll have much more fun as a priest with the option to also go shadow spec. And have you ever mind controlled enemy players into the lava in Blackrock Mountains, or throwing them out of the boats? If you haven’t, trust me, it is FUN! 
---
Respeccing serves as a great gold sink for the game and helps combat inflation, so I don't know how they would implement dual spec without giving in an outrageous cost.
---
Frame Halo 2 and 3 as well😍
---
I ditched on my moms 50th birthday party to down Lich King for the first time, fucking worth
---
I agree with you that more specs were viable in pvp, the part I dont like, however is that 90% of the BIS PVP stuff is obtained via raiding so it really puts you in a predicament when you want to focus on pvp as say an enhancement shaman, so now you have to get a full resto set, go resto, and raid for a few years to get your gear, because you aren't going to have priority over anybody for enhance gear.
---
0/21/30 is a top tier hunter spec post AQ
---
Beware though: When YOU get feared, you run into a random direction, so you can't steer your own fear direction vs enemy players or mobs who can fear.
---
Wasn't dead zone removed with the wotlk prepatch?
---
I have been checking this countdown ever since that post was made. I’m convinced! 
---
https://wowclassiccountdown.com/
---
Feral was much, much better during LK than TBC and obviously vanilla. Opening bear TPS was very strong with mangle spam thanks to Berserk and cat DPS became awesome with Ulduar patch with crit on bleeds. I didn't play Balance at the time but had a Balance guild mate doing pretty much the same DPS as me all throughout ICC progress. LK was definitely the best era for DPS druids, by a long shot. 
---
True, having HS set on the different continent travel hub eventually outweighs having a HSing back in the quest hub of the zone you're questing in.
---
Looking at a Orc Warlock for PVP purposes but I think a Mage might be better in terms of Damage and survivability. Plus free food and portals! I really want to play an Orc though.
---
It just feels like more because you're lower level and are used by the xp same-level quests give.
---
The one spot I disagree with you is mobility. Most tanking druids will have feral charge which is on a 15sec cool down. Intercept requires stance dancing and is on a 30sec cool down, 20sec talented. Not to mention a druid who is mindful of his mana can quickly shift in and out of bear form to clear snares and immobile effects. Mobility is one aspect of tanking as a druid that is really fun.
---
Paladin - WotLK, because all three specs were viable, although late TBC (Sunwell/Zul'Aman patch?) ret suddenly became OP, was some of the most fun times to play a retribution paladin.
---
Patch 2.3
---
Recent dev interviews with Kevin Jordan and John Staats' new book really highlight how much of vanilla was a work in progress.
---
What surprised me is how much design work happens blindly without knowing the end product.  Dungeon layouts were designed without knowing how combat played, group sizes, or even if the content would be open world or instanced.  Classes were given their ability sets before dungeons were available.  Leveling gear itemization was a random assortment of stats because they hadn't nailed down that aspect.  It's completely understandable spec viability is all over the place in vanilla WoW.
---
And then you take that uneven starting point and add more raids as content patches. It makes sense class design needs to keep evolving to accommodate the new content.  Popular specs were prioritized to receive balance change treatment, others had to wait until TBC.  I would be thrilled if they continued to patch class design for classic.
---
On 3: It's not a bad idea to join the 'big' guild filled with the rushers initially. They will be 10-20 levels ahead of you and if you're nice to them, you will find a lot of free greens/blues for your level in your mailbox (COD vendor at most). Once they reach 60, they will leave the guild anyway to form a hardcore raiding guild. Said guild will then fall apart and you will then simply move with your friends to the guild where you really feel at home.
---
and the legendary staff from Naxx.
---
While that might be an issue as well, the bigger problem is just how insane the Nax gear is. I get that this is a game about getting gear and gear making you more powerful, but it's also a game, which means the other party at least needs to have a snowballs chance in hell of winning. 
---
Okay, realistically? Well, you'll probably look up one or two guides, probably fuck around a little bit here and there, maybe so low level PvP as well, I would say realistically from 1 to 60.... 4 months if you have experience with MMO's and RPGs. If this is your first MMO or RPG, 6-8 months if you play the game ~3-4 hours a day 4-5 days a week. 
---
Or, you have played MMOs before, shit, you've played retail WoW, and you have a substantial amount of time to dedicate to leveling...3 months.   
---
Lmao! I saved this to watch later (yes now is 43 days later lol). This guys is totally gone haha. Poor Cascar, did he sleep in his own shit too? ☠️😂
---
The real question is why didn't they push for Karazhan to be in Vanilla!
---
I know why, but it still makes me sad we won't get it in Classic - such a fun fucking raid. 
---
This is an example of the attitude of someone who wants to believe that classic is hard so they can feel good about clearing 15 year old content and that he is HARDCORE.  Guy, nobody's impressed.
---
&gt; Out of 200+ guilds that cleared MC, less than 30 cleared AQ40 and Naxx.
---
That is a meaningless stat because it implies that all 200 of those guilds have a 40 man raiding roster and is focussed on progression and has actually tried to do AQ40 and that 170 of them are going in every week to AQ40, trying, and failing to clear.
---
&gt; In Classic, it will be even worse : over 90% of the player base won't clear AQ40 and Naxx, and most likely, 75% won't even set foot in AQ40 and Naxx.
---
Again, my point: you are assuming that the 90% who never do AQ40 aren't doing it because the game is too hard.  That's not going to be the case.  The 90% who never do it are people who either don't want to PvE, don't care about doing harder raids for the sake of doing harder raids, or just don't have the time to invest.
---
&gt; Gear and skill won't matter at all. 
---
So then why even bring it up in a thread about inflated gear reducing the skill barrier to raiding?
---
&gt; Commitment, discipline and organization WILL MATTER. And those are HARDCORE GUILDS attributes.
---
I am pretty sure that no matter how committed, disciplined, or organized you are, you're not going to be clearling AQ and Naxx in quest greens.
---
Depends on when the release is. Ideally i would start my summer holiday at launch.
---
I'm an altoholic not looking forward to Vanilla as i'll have limited time to play :( I enjoy the lvl'ing part of the game however so i'll prolly have fun anyhow. But chanses are me getting to 60 on one char not wishing it was another one is low. Hehe. Here's where i stand:  
---
Paladin: My heart is with this class, its where it started, damn i remember getting the Vergians Fist so very much! The class is super boring to play, but upsides is that i enjoy healing and ret can heal just as good in int gear as a holy paladin pre 60, so all i need is more bagspace :) Since i will play slow anyhow perhaps it fits ok. Quesiton is though, will it be fun to play at 60?  
---
Priest: The class i played the most in Classic and perhaps even since. Very enjoible lvl'ing process with very little downtime, good damage/healing. Can melt faces in PVP and is a more versitile class then Paladin. Have even played it on a priv server to about 30 and always felt kinda ok! But i dont want to play as Dwarf :(   
---
Hunter: Since i'll be playin solo (all my friends is either not playing games anymore or are playing other games) perhaps i'll just be more happy being Really solo. The class is best when it comes to playing for yourself.   
---
Druid: Very good lvl'ing class, feral is cool and its the class i've enjoyed the most in retail (though its very different now then back then) I do like both feral and resto. THouogh not being able to ress someone out of combat is a real bummer :( Slow untill lvl 20 is also kinda boring as thats quite a long time.   
---
Warlock, rogue, warrior, mage - I sometimes think about these classes but not for long. So i'll prolly not play one further then 20ish.   
---
SHaman - sorry Horde, i'm an Alliance player by heart. And since i'm going solo i can chose for myself. Been playing mostly Horde with friends and has never felt "right"
---
I played hunter pretty much all of TBC xpac and BM was the go to spec for PvE somewhere around mid/late SSC/TK.  I think our raid had maybe one survival hunter to proc a buff who was usually the worst performing hunter.  Otherwise myself and the other 1-2 top hunters usually were always top 5 DPS especially through Hyjal/BT/Sunwell.  MM however was pretty much the only spec I used for PvP since scatter + silence were too good to give up.  
---
So basically my counterpoint is all 3 specs were good in TBC which was great.  BM for PvE, MM for PvP, and Surv (1 per raid).  The DPS really was completely insane.
---
I liked mage most in wotlk
---
&gt; What's overwhelmingly more likely is that  one side will have more twinks/Naxxers than the other and that this  alone breaks the game if it is otherwise remotely even.
---
So only people with equal gear levels should be permitted into a BG? How exactly do you want to make that work? Do you want to separate BGs based on GearScore? Perhaps introduce stat scaling in PvP which will make it so that everyone is equally powerful regardless of gear or level?
---
By the way, my personal experience is that short of premades, what you just described (game broken because of gear differences) maybe sometimes happens in WSG, but 9/10 the limiting factor are actually retards who can't follow objectives. And when it comes to AB and AV, 1 more geared player on one side isn't gonna break anything.
---
&gt; Correct me if I am wrong, but is it not  useful if you goal is to complete objectives to be able to kill others  players and not die? I am not positioning myself as a WSG expert but I  seem to recall I had more luck getting flags home when I killed the  other side's flag bearer, and when I stayed alive with the flag myself,  as opposed to when their flag carrier lived and ours died.
---
You are replying to my reply to your reply to my reply which states that **even non-twinks can turn the tide of the battle**. Yes, a non-twink can't 1v1 a twink. Good job, you get a cookie. Now try to think about the fact that you could join a WSG where one side had lvl 18-19 people, while your side had only lvl 10-12 people. Yes, that can happen too. Time to split up the bracket into 10-14 and 15-19? Nah, let's make a separate bracket for each level.
---
&gt;If you are trying to pick a fight about  whether one-in-a-thousand unicorn twinkers who were sincerely oblivious  to the fact they were ruining the game for others and got no joy  whatsoever out of bullying people with an overpowered toon existed, you  are admitting that the overwhelming majority were and are exactly as I  described.
---
Nice try, straw boy.
---
Sounds like you had particularly bad luck on drops.  
---
&gt;  also if your not using pummeler then your an epic fail
---
Working adults don't have time to fill their bags with pummelers every week.  Sorry, not sorry.  I'll settle for being an epic fail I guess.
---
&gt; and that 30 str 1 crit thing sucks.
---
What's better, other than the fishing pole from ZG and Atiesh?
---
&gt; but yea getting pre raid bis takes a lot of time so i wont agree with you about it being a cake walk
---
So to fill every single slot with BiS available without setting foot into a single raid group does take a lot of time.  No argument there.  What I'm saying is that with relatively small time investment, you can have a very competitive gear set that is *close* to BiS and will carry you 4 out of the 6 raids in classic, which will give you the opportunity to flesh out your gear with some upgrades to carry you into the final 2.  Remember: best is the enemy of good.  You don't need exact pre-raid BiS to survive the easier raids.
---
&gt; what server u playing on that doesnt have that?
---
K3.  Is that bad?
---
bear have better gear preraid than warriors, a lot of dungeon items are BIS until AQ40
---
I'm going to raid competitive, but when it comes out in summer I just level a little bit slower, big deal. The important thing is that you can raid during Christmas.
---
How cool is that? 
---
Paladin healing was pretty OP in TBC. You could literally spam FoL forever. Ret was pretty bad until 3.0 hit then it was godly. Prot was viable in TBC but still not many MTs.
---
I played hunter, Made friends with a couple that also both played hunters. Between the 3 of us we could complete any dungeon all the way up to the mid 50's when I slowed down on the game and they both stopped playing. 
---
Tbh, if you dont count precision, consecration or pursuit of justice talents... maybe soc if other seals arent bugged, you wont even notice the difference in levelup. You could basically smash talents blindly and have almost the same experience as planning everything to the last point.
---
On the positive side, you can do massive catch up in netflix library while questing.
---
or they just don't care/have time for reddit and surveys ...
---
Could you teach me?
---
You should probably have it set so people can only respond once, might help curb the troll responses you're getting currently regarding baby hunters.
---
Never try and serve multi purpose roles when one of your roles requires casting times. 
---
Nightfall means you need hit gear and also a reliable up time. You can't be reliably healing while trying to keep nightfall proc up. 
---
Beter you give him in game gold
---
Well yeah there is that as well lol!
---
Why the fuck would you want to level as Holy? You level as Ret. Just collect some Intellect Stuff if you want to heal Dungeons.
---
Hey. I love emo music and was a massive emo in school.
---
Don't put me in the same category as those anime pricks.
---
Well I'm not sure where that "1 per raid" is coming from but a well played survival (at least Black Temple Tier) was top notch. But as far as I'm concerned, I did play the hunter to the 100% of possibilities. Slight issues in rotation and you've been done for.
---
Yeah, I would also like the option to go with a damage spec, priest is probably the best. But I for sure will level both eventually ;)
---
Both Priests and Druids outperformed the Paladin on heavy AoE Damage fights. Paladin - at this time - was still the king of raw output as far as Tank-Healing is concerned. Beacon of Light sure helped a lot with the "multi person heals" but strong AoE fights like Festergurt, Council, Blood Queen the Paladin was outperformed. 
---
That being said: not by much. The healing speccs overall had been very nicely tuned by the end of the addon.
---
Probably more indicative of the average reddit user 
---
mate doesn't that fucking Dumbo ride suck I queued for 2 hours as an excited little 4 year old and even I knew it was shit then and I'm still mad
---
Well, the deadzone didn't get removed completely at that point though. Some skills still had a minimum range which left the hunter in an awkward state.
---
But yes, chances are that deadzone would be gone on an official classic-tbc thingy.
---
&gt;No, fighting two guilds competing over devilsaur or silithus lords is actually very structured  
---
Not based on skill. Either way its just a battleground at that point. Nothing special or unique other than "its battleground but its not".  
---
&gt;Using Sodapoppin is a massive strawman argument. Acting as if every gladiator who like to pvp in Vanilla is Sodapoppin - come on do better. Irrelevant.
---
Not really, I just don't know many gladiators that want to play it, since PVP sucks in vanilla. You may like it more from the game as a whole, but PVP in and on itself sucks for multiple reasons.  
---
&gt;Meh, druids have multiple viable pvp specs. Sorry that boomkin isn't one of them. Not worried about it.
---
Yea, like resto and nothing else. Don't even try to talk about dueling, that's a completely busted game mode.  
---
&gt;So whoever has the highest MMR at a given time is indisputably the most skilled player? Nope.
---
Yea, usually its like that. Would like to see your argument be something other than "nope" - come on do better.  
---
I can list you almost any competitive game today and the top ranked people are almost always considered the very best.  
---
&gt;If a player literally beats everyone else in a duel, then they are the best pvp player on the server. Don't need a number to see that  
---
Dueling. Lol. Game isn't balanced around dueling and never was.  
---
&gt;Swifty is irrelevant. Players are a lot better now and he would get stomped by current vanilla players  
---
Like the backpedaling rank 14s on nostalrius? Lmao  
---
Pro tip: you saying something is "stupid" and "strawman" doesn't mean they are.  
---
&gt;There are lots of PvP games that don't have MMR, especially from Vanilla's era. You going to tell me Dark Age of Camelot wasn't a PvP game because it didn't have MMR? 
---
Game having PVP mode doesn't mean that game is a PVP game primarily. Is Diablo 2 a PVP game? No.  
---
And from what I can see DAOC is just another shitty MMO with "PVP" that people like you think is competitive lol
---
&gt; Even your own example, Counter Strike, didn't have an MMR back in the day 
---
It had regular tournaments and inhouse leagues. Just like DotA.  
---
&gt;Does that mean Counter Strike was a PvE game lol?  
---
Do you even know what PVE stands for? Does CS have any monsters or bosses to kill? This proves that you don't even understand the game you're playing lol.  
---
&gt;MMR in competitive games is a standard in newer games but in old games it rarely existed. That doesn't mean the game can't be competitive or that you can't be good at it.  
---
Sure, but you're still trying to do "competitive pvp" in a PVE game.  
---
&gt;But you are going to have to do better than posting a video of one person talking and saying "True".  
---
Now this is a strawman. Good job playing yourself :)  
---
Pve balance might have been better but pvp balance wasnt.
---
Also, there are people (like me) who like to try to make meme spec work. Even if i have to do twice as much as other to get an average spot in dps recount, i dont care that's how i have fun and i dont want any class change.
---
Every time this survey pop up I chose "warrior" with the hope that people will look at it and think, Lot's of warriors I better chose something other to play. And when Classic start there will be lot's of players cursing over the fact that there is to few warriors (tanks) in the   game.
---
Hybrid classes that have at least one healing spec are only viable for raiding in that healing spec (although IIRC there's usually one shadow priest to boost other players' DPS and sometimes feral druids can tank). Hybrid DPS is unviable. 
---
Their DPS specs are just so bad that they usually don't get taken along for raids, unless one of the following is true for your guild:
---
1. Your guild leadership owes you a favor for whatever reason.
---
2. Your guild deliberately decides "Fuck progression, every spec is welcome". 
---
It's often said that players using a meme spec will have no trouble at all finding a raid slot if they're looking for casual guilds instead of hardcore guilds who are going for realm firsts. I don't think that will be true. Since meme specs perform just that badly in raids, they have to be carried by the others, and guilds full of casual players will most likely have less capacity to carry dead weight. 
---
This situation does suck of course, but balancing changes happen to be the one and only situation where the "slippery slope" argument is not a fallacy. You see it in every MP game of whatever genre, when balancing changes are made the entire meta often shifts and the game feels significantly different. 
---
In retail vanilla I believe I took about 15-20 days/played to get my warrior 1-60. Several private servers later with optimization to spec, pre-knowledge of quest paths etc I have it down to about 8-10 days without being in a perticular hurry.
---
Honestly you can heal fine as Ret pre-60, and it would be faster for you and your Warrior friend if you level as Ret and Arms/Fury together. Most of your time will be spent questing and the healing you may do in dungeons will be fine as Ret.
---
Sorry to break it to you but that is just the best way. And then at 60 you can switch to Holy.
---
I strongly recommend going this route.
---
so I assume you never played Warcraft 3 eh  
---
Personally I'd love a replica!
---
I'd love a collectors re-release even without a regular box!
---
&gt;nobody is going to care if you're playing a memespec.
---
That differs heavily though. I recently played on ND and was in a discussion regarding this. Majority of my guild said they would never accept a "sub optimal" spec because they "refuse to wipe even once in MC". And this was far from a guild that called themselves hardcore.
---
Yes its true.  
---
The usual delusional and meme answer that classic/tbc folk will give you is  
---
&gt;Everything is viable! ^^^in ^^^certain ^^^circumstances  
---
Meaning you can level as shadow or do pvp, but you will almost never PVE.  
---
You can pvp with enh shaman but you will never PVE etc.  
---
This is the worst for hybrids who are for the most part always stuck in healing.  
---
People will try to spin this but its just the truth.  
---
It was not until Wrath where they fixed most of these issues.  
---
Yeah, sorry if what I wrote came out a bit forceful. It's just a lot of people around here can get on the nerves. :)
---
In any case, I do believe what I've written is how it'll happen and yes, I also very much hope that Classic will work great for a long time. My guild and I can't wait!
---
You forgot the 4 one hander mace with attack power that are better than any 2 hander except atiesh and the gnome mace.
---
Both had more players than vanilla :')
---
&gt;there's people that hit 50 days played before they hit 60
---
I find it hard to believe that these people were abundant. When I was 12 playing my Dwarf hunter i hit 60 with \~24 days played, and I did a fuckton of stuff instead of leveling. They probably exist though.
---
Best thing about these images are the random whispers between two friends. Most likely haven’t talked in a long time. 
---
I'm pretty sure I knew a long time before I went into Deadmines for the first time, since I rerolled at least twice before reaching 20. And really, as a human you figure out pretty quickly since you have to prep up for Hogger and some of the elite quests in Redridge. Playing a human gives you a pretty good understanding of basic mechanics. And the absolute assrape you get in Redridge from the undead rogues preps you up for future zones pretty well. My first character was a night elf warrior, and I had no fucking clue how the game worked even when I reached level 16. 
---
Well if the mage has reflectors / net trinket, grenades, tidal charm and potions aswell, you are in the same position. What I said is based on equal grounds 1v1 with equal gear and skill. Sure you can counter a class with using certain items in the game, but so can the mage... So yes you can beat a mage if you are night elf hunter with shadowmeld, engineering, have farmed the tidal charm trinket and crated counter gear, and the mage has none of these items. Even if the hunter trinkets the nova, the mage can still keep 60%+ slow on the hunter at all times and stay in deadzone, so no raptor strike, and even if the hunter could get off a raptor strike and the pet is not sheeped / nova, he still wont get through 2x ice barriers, blocks and mana shield.
---
I also have a vacation scheduled that week, so that release date is in fact CONFIRMED.
---
&gt;grinding the last two levels in Eastern Plaguelands because I was out of quests begs to differ.
---
IIRC, John Staats said that this was an intentional design, they WANTED you to do some questing, then grind to level up when the game first launched, and added in quests to fill the gaps in when they found out people hated it. 
---
No professions except first aid, arms after L40 for Mortal Strike, get either WWA or Bonebiter asap, do the highest level green quests you can handle.
---
For the most part a combination of Questing and Grinding will lead to the fastest leveling experience. Warrior is generally agreed to be the slowest class to level and that is considering even the fast classes take a good while to level. General efficiency, avoiding world PvP, and thinking ahead are the most important points. [Kargoz's Leveling Guide](https://youtu.be/gtxX1WQILnM) and [Power Hour's Fast Leveling Tips](https://youtu.be/k4MqfO1JpeA) are both good videos to watch on the topic. 
---
Solo leveling as a warrior is the slowest of them all. There are tons of guides on youtube who talk about efficiency in leveling for every class. 
---
Ok, if you want to level a warrior forget the word ”asap”. Its the slowest leveling of all classes and you get punished so hard if you make a mistake as you almost have no escape. 
---
Remember that running as soon as you realize you made a mistake is your number one friend. Dont try to fight it out unless its a ”kill X mob” because you can probably loot it once you revive again. 
---
My suggestion is to follow Joanas leveling guide as Horde and always be 2 levels ahead of the guide. Thats what I did together with spoiling myself with WW axe at 30, Executioneers at 42-43 and then after Mara ring and Hinterlands trinket I started to DW with Thrash Blade from Mara. 
---
I suggest leveling arma until early 50s atleast because it gives you some leverage. Hamstring kiting allows you to do some elites if you got health potions and use CDs, if you are 2 levels ahead of the guide. 
---
I tanked alot of instances to gain that extra XP and Im very glad I did as it was painful enough even with 2 levels higher. 
---
Raid? You mean Shadowbringers? 
---
Planning my 3 weeks vacation aligning w classic, have a 1 week trip somewhere yet undecided earlier this summer
---
the guy messaging was from another Alliance guild, once the PvE race started heating up then relations quickly soured.
---
Hence us using low level alts to wipe their Kazzak attempts https://i.imgur.com/rsPpHIc.jpg
---
Actually it's not very difficult to scattershot a mage right after the blink and before the nova, at this point even if the mage blocks you can be out of range for the nova and coc assuming he didn't blink right onto you. If you get caught, Spider belt removes effects and gives 5 seconds immunity, plenty of time to see if you need to pop a free action pot or not. Then again a free casting mage will kill me in seconds but in a 1v1 it's not so easy to stay in my deadzone. If I get the jump, a mage will spend more time in his deadzone (36-41yd) than in mine. 
---
Whilst i agree its bad, that's not how u calc windfury ap dps. Because it should be used on ur 2h warrs with usually 3.5+ speed weps and they are proccing it off aas and all gcds, and the fact that it is an instant attack it the dps translates into its damage per hit which is x by attack speed, so 3.5+, so it is a bit more than 7dps more like 25 or so.
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
Just in case the memory has faded, we got a portion of our felhunter's magic resistance so it wasn't just the extra healing, health and damage transferred to the pet that made us so hard to kill.  
---
Here ya go, average age for classes (15 or younger was taken as 15 and 42 or older was taken as 42):
---
16.54	hunter
---
26.81	mage
---
27.13	rogue 
---
27.08	shaman
---
27.13	paladin
---
27.34	warrior
---
27.54	druid
---
27.43	warlock
---
27.95	priest
---
So you are saying that Classic WoW will be populate by &lt; 15 yo hunters? Interesting...
---
Is this just a viral marketing attempt for Hawthorne wipes?
---
I got a p.p.p.pocket full of Hawthornes...
---
One of my clearest memories of WoW is of when i ran through a heroic with a friend who was actually good at the game. We pulled a pack far back in a dungeon and started killing it (I was an spriest, he was healing) and he drew healing aggro. After a second he screams
---
FEAR THESE OFF OF ME
---
I remember, along with my other noob friends, being so confused. Up until that point it had been hammered into our heads that fear in dungeons was bad. Fear bad, pulls more, fear bad. But in this heroic we were pulled far back and fear wasn't a problem. We actually -needed- my priest fear to survive pulls.
---
I recall that being such a defining moment for me because it opened my eyes to the fact that I had just been autopiloting through dungeons without thinking, and that in heroics you couldn't afford to do that.
---
No definitely not abundant, it's just the highest I've seen screenshots of and the highest I've heard anyone say. 50 days is a fuckload of time.
---
It's better to just level in all areas like any normal person, skipping quests in entire zones is a horrible idea. Playing as a fury warrior has to be one of the worst choices you can make if you want to level up "asap", also.. BG's doesn't give you exp like in retail so you can just forget about that.
---
1-10 doesn't really matter how you do it, but using 1h with shield and RENDing your targets 24/7 is a very simple way of levelling alone. Then just push 11-60 as arms.
---
You can tank dungeons without problems as arms while levelling, just make sure to always have a 1h and shield in your bags.
---
Might as well get assuming skinning as a profession. Just vendor it all to pay for skills.
---
should i go orc or undead for rogue? mainly pve but will do pvp/wpvp aswell
---
I wouldn't call it a silly addition.. iirc Blood Elves have by far the highest population on horde and pretty much always have been since they were released. They're very popular.
---
Yeah.  I believe you need to be level 30 to get the requisite leatherworking skill.  Most of the time at the start of the server gold sellers will level a leatherworker to the needed leather and spam for thick leather non stop in chat until the value of gold goes down.  Plenty of people who buy the thick leather are normal people like you and me, but you know the guys (like you said, never level, literally spam chat all day, you do /target in the capital city and they will be there day and night) that are selling gold.  Try to find the normies and sell your stack for a couple silver less imo.
---
&gt;rouge
---
Famous vanilla typo :D
---
I'm pretty sure they said that your original vanilla collectors edition pets wont work on classic servers since they are technically part of retail and they want to keep them completely separate.
---
DM is more of a wailing caverns alternate isn't it?  Stockade is the alliance equivalent of rfc
---
I mean, the copyright date will most likely be changed, which would be enough to tell the difference.
---
Wotlk for paladin, best pve tank (most overpowered talent ardent defender), ret was one of the best dps with still ton of utility, and holy was the king of throughput (a skilled one could solo heal most 10man)
---
In pvp, top comp almost always had a paladin (holy or ret)
---
Wotlk pserver all have at least 25% paladin.
---
Mage is definitely a really good class to do this with. You can kill almost anyone in wpvp with just blues. 
---
I mean.. they are a company.. looking to make money. Always have been. Idk why they would pass up an opportunity to release a collectors edition just like they did back in the day. It would just make good business sense without ruining the integrity of the game. What does it matter to you if someone gets a bunch of physical items and the few pets that were in vanilla.
---
You never have to worry about finding dungeon groups as a druid if you tank them.
---
I feel for you mate, but God I hope you're right. I'm having my first kid in September so a good solid month and a half of Classic would be awesome! 
---
hmm I never thought the leather buyers could be gold sellers.  So what are they doing with the leather - generating gold via small profits to later sell?
---
Thank you :)
---
What exactly does engineering bring that helps you cap flags in AB?
---
Can't upvote this enough. 
---
I've got 4 weeks of vacation pooled and I plan on using every last hour of it on release. :\^) Priorities, man.
---
There is a build you can go which involves getting the two melee totem improvements, something like this [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMZVcxt0xa](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMZVcxt0xa)
---
As you see this is still a resto shaman build, you just lose the two healing wave talents (Imp. healing wave &amp; healing way), imp. mana spring, mana tide and 2% healing effectiveness (not a big deal). This is a very min-max build that a shaman can go when his primary job is raid healing and he's almost exclusively using Chain Heal and/or Lesser Healing Wave, usually a spec you go once you're farming the content and are confident in your mana management. 
---
In AQ40, once you get 5/5 t2.5 coupled with the appropriate 3 set bonus of t2 you are a chain heal machine, so losing healing wave talents is pretty irrelevant. The imp 2h spec and flurry serves a slight purpose in where you can swing a Nightfall and full time totem twist on some bosses which don't require all healers healing, such as Ebonroc or Flamegor in BWL.  
---
And yes, like some other posters in this thread pointed out the imp WF totem is "only" increasing its effectiveness by 30%, which is around 94AP (still a significant dps upgrade for a fury warrior) and you're "only" getting 11 str/agi on Strength of Earth/Grace of Air, respectively. The point is that those minor upgrades are still more significant than the alternatives that you would take in the given scenario; imp mana spring/mana tide are pointless when you manage your mana and use major mana pots/demo runes on cooldown so you might as well increase raid dps.  
---
I understand, however, that this was not the point of your thread. Unfortunately a "pure" support shaman isn't really a thing on the higher level of raiding, you're still primarily a healer that might have a non-healing role on non healing-intensive fights.
---
Meh, both are kind of 'faction exclusive but not really' dungeons in a similar level range. 
---
But come to think of it, you're right. 
---
So I wasn’t wrong. Honestly I have one or two people I knew from vanilla on my real ID but I don’t talk to them. The one guy is super creepy and used to ERP with people. He was one of the most feared rogues on the server. 
---
dont do it, you will regret it
---
Hunter was pretty busted in wrath pvp at least in s5 and 6. 
---
Warlock, hunter, druid, mage, priest, shaman are good choices
---
Maybe he loves WoW and hates Activision-Blizzard makes sense to me.
---
Lvl arms, take mining + skinning. Arms is just superior to fury in both PvE and leveling speed.
---
You can tank any dungeon as any spec.
---
Yeah.  They're turning the leather into the nightscape tunic and vendoring it then selling the profit for money
---
We'd been on the same server as "Goober" for all of two months by the time we killed Lucifron (Jan 05).  
---
He took an interest in our PvE progress but then him and his guild became rivals.  Can't really describe him as an "old friend"
---
Most games release for the christmas season because people can buy them as gifts.
---
Classic WoW will be purely sub based and will not have a phyiscal release nor a digital purchase option other than purchasing a sub so no one will be able to "gift" classic wow, making a christmas season release date actually a bad thing as that's when people have less money to pay for a sub due to christmas shopping.
---
Fair enough. Still always whispering in these screen shots 😝
---
Yup, his point is retarded, it requires time not skill to clear Naxx and not everyone has infinite free time.
---
Don't do any BGs or PvP, neither give exp at all and will just anger the other faction.
---
Yeah which is why I’m in no way saying a bear is a better tank than a warrior.
---
Hunter is fairly good as a fresh 60 but does start to get outclassed by AQ40 and Naxx. Hunter is a fine choice for bg's/wpvp; it's not top of the meta but it's not the worst either.
---
Hunters also offer a easier/more forgiving leveling experience if you aren't able to devote much time to the game.
---
ok thanks.  Here's me thinking they were some kind of crafting genius
---
He doesn’t mean the warlock skill fear
---
He means when the mob is low on HP and runs away
---
My buddy works for a large law firm in Austin. They have Blizzard as one of their clients. I had said many times all over Reddit before Blizz con launch was summer. 
---
I was ignored. All of the contracts he was working on had a quarterly date, which lent to the belief summer was the time. 
---
Everything he now has uses effective dates of July 15th, meaning a July 16th launch as the most likely date. Honestly, book mark this. 
---
You were asked to share a story about vanilla? By whom?
---
Dungeon finder wasn't bad. It just took spamming trade chat and put it into a window, and it's not like it stopped people from spamming trade chat anyway. It's when it started teleporting you to the dungeons, became cross-realm and the dungeons were easy as balls is when it got real bad.
---
Most paladins choose one rank of Flash of Light (usually the max rank) and just mash that button while playing whack-a-mole on the raid frames. This is not a very giving playstyle and is not going to be entertaining to play in the long run for most people. However, just because that's what some paladins do does not mean that it's the optimal way of healing or the only way to do it.  
---
Most paladins heal like this because they are simply new players at healing, don't know any better and having them raid heal like this is putting them to use most effectively. Paladins can still mix it up, using various ranks of Holy Light depending on the type of damage is being taken, you still have blessing of protection to save dps that are encroaching on your tanks threat (reacting quickly enough to a threat pull and saving the raid potentially is a good feeling), cleansing and some other nuances that I'm probably forgetting now.  
---
Even though a priest has more healing abilities it's not like most priests don't have their heal of choice which will be their standard spell that they cast for the majority of the raid. For example, a priest in 8/8 t2 is going to be almost exclusively casting Greater Heals, likely rank1, depending on damage taken. A priest in early MC &amp; BWL will mostly be spamming Flash Heal, because it's the easiest spell to use without getting sniped by other healers, etc.  
---
Regardless what class you pick to heal in vanilla, how enjoyable healing in raids becomes is what you make of it. You can play braindead whack-a-mole as any healer and it probably won't be a fun experience after many resets. The fun in healing comes from learning the content well enough to anticipate damage taken, getting better at pre-healing every week as well as figuring out more and more optimal assignments between you and your fellow healers. In the end I would definitely choose the class you want to play in the other aspects of the game, or simply choosing the class which you identify more with.
---
TSA, iirc, only buffs hunter dps as it’s a ranged ap buff. And you only need one hunter to supply it as multiple instances of it don’t stack. I’m not sure  how that would decrease raid dps significantly.
---
I played a Rogue in TBC which I greatly enjoyed for pvp. Then in Wrath I absolutely hated getting crushed by anything in plate. Seriously, Wrath was a good expansion for anyone in plate gear.
---
I also calculated the release to be somewhere in July, as that is the month after my holidays.
---
Exactly lol. When you force a pally to bubble hearth it’s the ultimate victory. They’re blowing their longest CD spell and 1 hour hearthstone. It’s the ultimate ragequit.
---
Playing like bubble hearthing is a cool getaway is laughable lol. “I didn’t get kicked out I CHOSE to leave”
---
It doesn’t matter whether you hear of the ninja or not.
---
What matters is the new system incentivized ninja looting, and fixed a problem no one cared about before.
---
I would have to say hunter, mage, warlock, druid in that order
---
Why hunter and mage you can farm, or run dungeons pretty easy feel like you have decent strength with your tight schedule....
---
warlock and druid a little more gear dependent but fun to pick up and play especially the druid you can really change your playstyle to your current mood.
---
Hunter can compete in pvp very easily, but I'd recommend mage, cause you'll get into raid groups more easily, and also have lots of options in all forms of pvp.
---
It's by design.
---
No changes. Over balancing is partially what killed retail 
---
Honestly skinning isn't a big boon and barely pays for the time you spend leveling it imho. For classes that could solo devilsaur it's awesome, but otherwise? Meh.
---
Blizzard has made clear that they don't intend to alter original 1.12 Vanilla Class balance. This could change well after the release of Classic but I doubt it. You will find that many people can be very hostile at even the suggestion of class balance changes.
---
For the most part the majority of the community agrees that the Class Balance of Vanilla is integral to the Classic experience.
---
First child is due around july 16th. My math checks out with your math. 
---
14 days
---
True, but most of the WoW players dgaf about lore though, which is sad.
---
Lore wise, wow has been butchered since tbc.
---
PVP paladin is a wrecking ball for buffing others. If your preference is to own in PvP then go paladin. Personally I love priests, and dungeon healing as a priest is unmatched. Also mind control calls to me
---
Things change with money. If they can recycle content and earn revenue they sure as hell won't even blink to remake TBC/Wrath. 
---
Sorry but everyone knows that Blizz will for some stupid fucking reason release it in August when everyone who’s a student or teacher that plays starts back to school. 
---
Great story though. Reminds me when I was teaching in the public schools and called in sick for WOTLK launch and spent half the day with the servers down. 
---
80k not 800k
---
Love all the shitty gear on the raid,and your square UI setup. :)
---
quite concerned about that , i wonder why these people are hostile, assuming the worst from people ( doing so has been helpful in life), is it maybe they feel like their "MAIN/FAVOURITE" class is reigning supreme over others and they dont want that to change?
---
Yes , the reason i asked about it is because i have read in few places people saying the same , is there anyway to **authenticate that claim?**
---
Personally going troll for their racials. Beserk, shadowguard and hex. Shadowguard can proc blackout...
---
Do more research and you will see that you can tank in raid as a feral and also compete with top dps with powershifting alliance side.
---
check out the guy who said he won't roll on loot because he wasn't 60.
---
That fits with my memories - we were definitely very impatient in going into MC, taking people under 60.  Everyone was definitely very undergeared.
---
I'm not the guy in the pic either, but was there.
---
So far nobody has commented on what else is unique/different about that pic - not sure if it's even obvious but there was definitely something unusual about that first kill
---
At this point everyone seems to have their own version of ," xxxx  is what actually(or partially) killed Retail" .  
---
Is there a constructive and unbiased information on this topic that is logical and acceptable? .  
---
**In most cases in the world i have seen some people make a wild claim about something and for some weird reason with time distance, completely unrelated people who do not know anything for sure DEFEND those claims to death.**  
---
Am just hoping to make sure.
---
Druids heal
---
Resto Shaman: TBC. All the power of the vanilla shaman, but now with better talents and some utility for your caster self, not just melee totems.
---
Prot Warrior: WotLK. No longer were you making a sacrifice in every area of content except raiding, you were viable in PvP and quite strong solo.
---
I kinda want then to shake it up even further, I don't want to know what bis is before I start the game, I want to run dungeons and have no idea what can drop there.
---
For the most part, people are happy with the class balance of 1.12. All classes ger played a lot, and druids are waking up to become the shared tier 1 tanks. A few things could arguably be fixed to ”balance” classes, nerfing fury warriors comes to mind, but this is certainly Pandora’s flask of worms that needs its lid screwed on tight at all times. 
---
Overall balance is fine. Keep in mind that classes are not balanced around raids, contrary to retail. Because there is so much more ”other” content in classic. Since world pvp is not dead, and most pve specs suck in pvp, it really matters what spec you are, and it is always a matter of tradeoffs.
---
Different classes/specs shine in various areas of the game, and you’ll be hard pressed to find classes and specs that don’t have significant advantages in one or another area of the game. 
---
And the community really seem to like it that way. 
---
Careful, people dont like balance changes in classic. For some reason they think it will completely alter everything and destroy the game.
---
I think it would only give us more variety and bring back some new things to theory craft about, find new items that work with the changes, find new builds, new raid/dungeon setups, etc. I dont know why people dont want this, but they just dont, for the most part.
---
Someone trolled you, the hunter percentage is way off the charts and seems like an attempt to skew the numbers.
---
No clue really, my whole experience as a PvP Hunter is in Season 2 were my mate and I have been World#3 HolyPaladin/Hunter combination at something like 2.4k - not high by todays standards but that was it for me. 
---
Yea. I always did it for them slightly better rate of rested xp gain, and as I’ll have more sporadic play time this time around I may do so at lower levels again. But once you’re traveling more, having it at a travel hub makes sense.
---
But it DOES destroy a certain amount of integrity. We'd essentially have a "WoW Retail Collectors" and a "WoW Classic Collectors" (which again should be kind of identical and therefore would devalue the wow retail collectors).
---
Writing on everything would have turned my post into a much more bigger and complex post that is why i did not include info on this.  
---
A lot of people talk about how some people with their unique play-styles can actually increase DPS or just play the class to its maximum efficiency .  
---
**Does a Druid have to put in so much  effort and master Keybinds/Macros and an Unique playstyle JUST to be barely relevant DPS , while some other classes can easily out-DPS you with half the effort.**
---
Although I usually ignore people who demand answers and do not ask for it, let me introduce you to this discussion:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk
---
that female human is ahead of her time with the slutmog
---
Shaman and paladin were fantastic healers lol
---
Lucifron being 63 instead of being flagged as a boss?
---
&gt; i would really like to play my Druid and EXPERIENCE Classic to the MAX.
---
Yet you seem to be asking for classic + major changes to class capabilities...
---
Don't get stuck on the name, the druid class you know isn't the same druid class as it was in vanilla so maybe you should open up to the idea of playing something else.
---
That being said there are plenty of people, myself included, who absolutely love the state of the druid class in vanilla. They get shit on by people who can't manage more than just mindlessly spamming the same 2 abilities and are unable to properly utilize their entire toolkit. 
---
Am not  For Class Balances actually , am just hoping to clarify if this issue has any real foundation behind it , **or its just something started by some selfish players who want their favourite classes to dominate Raids for example and somehow  people are just mindlessly repeating it at this point like we humans generally do .**
---
I played a Warlock in vanilla.  Specifically SM\\Ruin, I never had to respec raid vs PvP.  This build is almost like a mage caster with more utility.  You have huge crits on your shadow bolt, instant cast shadow bolts, etc.  Using succubus I could 1v2 or 3 in world PvP and some battlegrounds.  Between AOE fear, fear, healthstone, soulstone, death coil, charm from succubus I could wreck people dueling outside Orgrimmar as well.  There also wasn't a limit on Warlocks in raids I can remember, especially with 16 debuff slots its a good raid class.
---
Not really demanding answers , i have done fair bit of reading on this issue on various forums and seen videos , its just that i was not able to find pieces of Information that can legit authenticate those pieces of information on this issue.
---
Having their Main Class stay in the meta is probably the case for some people. Many people feel that conceding even the smallest change will open the floodgates for more changes which can be a slippery slope. Still more people want to play the game they loved (or, alternatively, the game they regrettably missed) in the form closest to the original game. 
---
The general lack of polish and balance issues offer a bit of an endearing charm, some would reimplement some of the massive game-breaking bugs from very early in the game's life if they had their way. 
---
In the end, the general goal of Classic is the resurrection and preservation of an old game rather than the resurrection and modification of an old game into a new game.
---
I think most people simply don't trust that Blizzard is capable of making good changes, as well as a smaller minority that want a perfect recreation for histories sake.
---
Until recently blizzard has been dismissive, if not outright hostile towards the older game design. It would take quite a while of building good will before people would trust them to be able to make changes without damaging the integrity of the game.
---
"I won't roll cause I'm not 60." 
---
Only in Vanilla.
---
Most players that will defend Classic class balance are the one who played the UBER class you mentioned. As long as you played Warrior/mage/rogue you were 100% fine balance-wise it seems, at all time in raid and PvP context. Why risking trying to balance the game then?
---
To me all spec except protection paladin are viable, even into Naxx, given what I've experienced and what I've read from some players in this subreddit. The problem is elitist consider everything that is "suboptimal" as "unviable". While both concepts are completely different.
---
Even hunters are criticized because they scale very badly with gear, and warlocks the same but the other way around (bad first and good in the endgame). Even druid restoration are criticized because they don't heal the same way as the other classes.
---
**To answer you question for my point of view, among other things, the fact that a spec as protection paladin is not viable is unacceptable and is mostly a balance thing** (for the ones who think the gear is a major problem, solutions implemented in TBC for mana regeneration, and adding a taunt would solve already A LOT of the protection paladin problem. Other ideas could be experimented to increase threat/damage according to other stats). The facts that hunters and warlocks are less wanted in raids because they do less DPS than the other 3 main DPS classes could also be fixed. And overall, why not make all the 3 pure dps specs as closely efficient as the other in general? Arcane/fire/frost mage or destruction/affliction warlocks having different purposes in PvE would be a good thing for the game.
---
**There are no such things as design compensation like some tend to say. Warriors do not miraculously gain the right to have both god tier DPS and tank specs, and a god tier PvP spec, just because they are harder to level than other classes and that they can't farm as efficiently as a mage**. There are many counter examples among other classes, and that kind of reasoning is clearly a bias by people who want to keep things who they've been for all the years they have played on pservers. 
---
**People must understand that all Vanilla design was not 100% intended by Blizzard. The developers say it themselves (see podcasts like Classicast for example)**. And it's logical, WoW was a complex game. Many things didn't work as expected by Blizzard, and some classes had disadvantages because of it, the PvP system was utterly bad, etc.
---
Which is all mostly fine, because again except protection paladin, all specs are viable even into Naxx. There were tons of raids with unoptimal DPS specs in Vanilla, and there will be tons of them in Classic.
---
As you seem to think, if TBC was not announced, class balance would have changed eventually in Vanilla, that's for sure.
---
Have you tried either? They're both very good with survivability. I think you should question each sides utility they bring to a group to help you, or what kind of leveling experience you want
---
Tough choice really, both are amazing. To with what your heart says as far as looks not just the racials
---
**This seems to be a good point , i find it logical and acceptable , thank you. By Extension**, we can say that it was not by Design because there was not a particular thought of design on this aspect. Classes seemed to built on their Skills and how those skills contribute instead of the Numbers (DPS AND HEALS) , Retail is plagued with warcraft logging endgame , for endgame content experience , if this is not the same in Classic , yeah i would not be bothered about this issue.
---
gotta go with female undead then. i need those frontflips during fights lol
---
The concept of being a realm first kill with raiders that aren't even max level....
---
It's nuts.
---
I can't wait for classiccccccccccc
---
Very stuck on what to play. I have been leveling one of every class on private servers to around level 20-30 to get a good feel for each and I am still conflicted. The only thing I have not level is Druid and Paladin. I prefer to play horde since I have since Late Vanilla/TBC. 
---
Deep down in my heart I would like to main warrior and tank, since I have mostly tanked or healed in retail. I am aware of how important that role is but also aware that most guilds only need 1-2 main tanks. 
---
The main classes I know I do not want to play are Mage and Druid, I’ve just never enjoyed playing mages and I actually love playing druids but they are my least favorite class to level. 
---
If I had to pick a top 3 I would say Hunter, Warrior, Priest. Shaman and warlock are very close. As far as professions go I’ve always enjoyed tailoring/enchanting for casters, Blacksmithing/mining for tanks and for healers alchemy/herbalism, depending on the class. 
---
A truly accurate classic experience! Now they just have to leave taunt on, forget to dismiss their pets when they jump down long distances and accidentally pull half the instance, and roll need on every weapon that drops!
---
Towards the end, it was no problem to single heal with a pally on most ICC10 fights. Beacon of light  the main tank, keep judgement of light on the boss (pretty much kept melee healed) and just throw out Holy Lights on the raid. Had a blast at that time. 
---
I don't remember exactly, but I do remember going through a lot of dungeons with like 3-4 night elf hunters and a mage or 2.  
---
Back in the early days when there was like 2 warlocks per server. 
---
If you are leveling you shouldn’t need to spend any extra time raising skinning.
---
Imagine what our gear was like back then!
---
While the logic is acceptable  , but does it not feel wrong in essence? ..  i mean letting  class balance to be a shit storm just to prevent Blizzard from messing other stuff or mess class balance instead of fixing it/making it better.
---
So as a Paladin Main, I will easily say their BEST expansion was WoTLK. Pre launch during the necropolis raids, Ret paladins in pvp were straight up broken. Even once they were settled down, all 3 specs were viable in PvE and PvP. 
---
I preferred BC’s version of prot though. Spell power plate and magic tanking felt cool and unique. The change to str/stam stacks and a closer move to traditional tanking made the class less interesting for me. BC tanking wasn’t perfect and you could die pretty easily or lose Aggro if you didn’t play smart, but it was fun and different. Ahh how I miss you RET aura
---
Powershifting is fun and the dps you can get is more than revelant, you are also bringing ton of utility (ability to tank and heal if needed, battle rez, decurse and abolish poison) so of course there have to be some drawback when you can do this much.
---
 If all you want is an easy dps class, then just roll one instead of a druid.
---
I think it's sad that they did not use the TBC alpha&amp;beta blood elves. They were thinner and made much more convincing mages. But nooo, they just had to make them bulky and perfect. 
---
Am seeing more and more of people who think that class balances if done right is not a bad idea , and yet some people down voting the post to stop this conversation from happening .
---
Same. I'm 28. Vanilla came out my freshman year of high school and was a defining part of my high school life.
---
You seem to be lost, I would take leveling out of the question.  The experience leveling is an important part of the journey but it will also probably only a small portion of your classic experience.  It will be a big bummer wishing you leveled a different class because of end game playstyle.  Start watching PVP and raiding videos of the different class specs that stick out to you most.  There's also instant level 60 servers (RetroWoW) that you can take a few for a test drive.  Healing styles vary a lot between, if you're going DPS make sure your not breaking your back trying to get a raid spot if you want to play something like feral druid.  Its all about what style appeals to you playing end game
---
Lifelong pally also. 
---
Level ret, keep any decent int/spirit/stam gear you get from quest rewards. You'll have no problem healing any dungeon near your level. 
---
I'll be rolling dwarf priest, I played one on some non-official servers and Stoneform was excellent as a utility ability.  Not crazy on the look, which is why in official vanilla I was a nelf, but back then there wasn't the same min-max ideology.
---
Class balancing didn't kill the game. TBC balanced classes and it was fucking epic. 
---
Balance != homogenization, that started with WotLK and having to support 10man raiding.
---
As far as am seeing , a lot of people seem to not want balances just to prevent Blizzard from messing it all up .  
---
Its a good reason . A reason good enough to let things be just as they are imo .  
---
I was just hoping to see a more convincing reason along the lines of , " No classes are all balanced perfect  in 1.12 "
---
Yep, I'd like to take two weeks, wife says that's a bit much and says we can meet in the middle at 1.5 weeks (not sure if that's going to be an extra 2 or 3 days yet), but i'm going to try and push for 2 full weeks. We have like, a month of vacation time so we'll have some change left over after regardless. 
---
Try RetroWoW instant 60 server, do some instances, some PVP and decide on end game play style. 
---
Even then, it's those who played those classes that were uber IN 1.12, ie the private server kiddies. 1.12 is a shit meta. Tank threat gen went through the roof which puts a serious dampener on hybrids, and the wep normalization and +hit changes in 1.9 buffed warrior dps far too high. Meanwhile as better and better gear rolls out, the classes whose mechanics scale with gear better (ie warriors) seriously start pulling away from the classes whose mechanics scale poorly (hunters). 1.8 was peak vanilla class balance even though later patches had many nice changes, for example Life Tap finally scaling with spell damage in 1.12 was a godsend.
---
Most of the people who are adamantly against class balancing are the people whose sole vanilla experience is private servers which are eternally stuck on 1.12. These people didn't live through 12 different versions of balance and can't wrap the head around the fact there were many different versions of vanilla, most of which were better than 1.12. These players don't want vanilla, they want their shitty private servers back.
---
As for the rest of the antichangers, they are, and with some good reason, distrustful of present-day Blizz's ability to make changes to the game without fucking up.
---
Am not really asking for any changes , am just hoping to play Druid and have the same or atleast a similar experience  for example , to one that a Warrior would have like in getting accepted in Raid Groups and Guilds.
---
Cool, I’ll have to check that out. I enjoyed leveling them but actually playing at max level will be the best way to tell.

I figure you will make friends along the way that will help and teach you. You will probably join a guild at some point. Surely they will help you out.

---
nothing else really.
---
yeah i clearly remember our first MC night , lots of 58/59 level mostly healer in the raid
---
Hunter doesnt scale much and is fairly powerful without gear. Especially BM and since not many things apart from auto attacks scale with hunter you dont need much gear. Id focus on getting a solid weapon and thats that.
---
And for an added bonus hunters are the fastest levelers so there ya go theres really not much else to pick.
---
Carry highest level food available for your level (expensive unless you get it from a mage, but definitely worth it)
---
Grind on mobs green difficulty / green quests.  If you engage 2 mobs of your level, your most likely going to die.
---
Make sure you have every quest available for a dungeon before you run it, and run it only 1 time.
---
Carry Throwing Knives.  They are the fastest ranged attack, and help keep pulls to 1 mob.
---
Of course if you add the qualifier that it's done right a lot of people would potentially accept it. Everyone's idea of right is different though, and Blizzard's track record is enough reason to be wary.
---
I remember distinctly in classic using dartrols rod of transformation wearing 4 pc PvP set and boots movement speed enchant in travel form chasing down mounted people and smacking them with my snake staff.  Beyond that I can’t remember which ones did and did not work.
---
I have never heard a good reason for no balancing.
---
Only: ''it could ruin the whole economy'' and ''It will ruin the game for me''...
---
Changing numbers wont fuck up the game (economy). It will change the meta, it would renew a lot of things that people loved about vanilla: being clueless AF about anything. Make boomkin the best PVE dps for all I care, let people freak out and create druids to level. 
---
It creates a reason to level a new character, it gives you more content to explore. I honestly cant see why people wouldnt want balancing at some point in the future in classic. It would only prolong the time you can be busy in classic exploring new things. Why wouldnt people want that? 
---
The game doesnt change, the only thing that changes is the optimal startegy. You can either choose to follow that or not, but for a lot of people it would be a reason to keep playing and it would bring Blizzard some money which they can show to Activision so Activision doesnt pull the plug.

Look at this before saying such things.
---
Don't believe that everything in Vanilla was 100% intended. There wouldn't have been 1.1 to 1.12 patch with huge changes otherwise. And then TBC was coming, therefore most changes were postponed to TBC.
---
This guy explains notably that classes such as the paladin did not end the way the expected it to. It was not balanced, and it was not by design.
---
Are you guys west coast? I am EST and trying to see if that could work 
---
if they change it i will be mad
---
I'd say they need to implement some type of faction limits.  If the average daily users are too out of proportion, then limit new players from joining one side.  
---
Maybe make it have an invite only system whereas a player can only join the higher pop faction if they have an invite from an active player on that faction so it doesn't prevent friends from playing together.
---
That's why the slippery slope argument is called a fallacy. And everyone is abusing it now.
---
Its to fix master looting mistakes. Personally, i say fire your master looter. No support for it and no trading. If your master looter gives loot to the wrong person then to bad. Time to pick a new master looter. Accidents happen but I promise it won’t ever happen more than twice. People take getting their loot seriously. 
---
I love the pally endless mana, ultimate survivability, especially in world pvp and ganking situations.  And regardless of what anyone tells you, you can spec ret or prot and tank or dps most of the game without much trouble. 
---
if you are a new player without any vanilla xp then i would say you gonna need arround 15 days played

Other than the comment below (Lucifron not being flagged as a boss) I can't think of anything odd.
---
DM was out before Ragnaros was killed in vanilla anyway. DM was out on eu launch. It’s not that big a deal. Imo it means I don’t have to farm some pre bis only to replace it with other slightly better pre bis a month or so later.
---
Yeah, it definitely makes me wonder how the game would be if they had a more even class balance at the beginning of the game. The thing is, most of these balance issues only affect end game competitive content and 1v1 PvP. All classes and specs are at least playable during leveling and casual play, they just aren't optimal. Blizzard and the greater part of the community see the leveling experience as the true meat of the game. Druid did probably draw the shortest stick in terms of balance but still there are people that enjoy playing an underdog class. There definitely are people out there that would like to see a balanced Classic experience but since it is a minority of the community Blizzard is not likely to act on it.
---
you'd be wrong.  The picture is taken from the webarchive January 30 snapshot from our guilds website.
---
Plus the player named Fog was a Druid, the player named Ossoi was a Druid.
---
Plus it doesn't even look like a Benediction, if anything it's closer to a Warden Staff model.  Probably wasn't a warden staff but a staff that shared the model (which was common back then)
---
ret became op with the wotlk pre patch
---
All it takes is one noob to stall geddon. One noob to mess up garr. Not everyone on classic will have played pservers. Honestly i think pserver players will be in the minority.
---
Weren't a lot pre-raid BiS pieces able to be equipped under level 60? So *technically* being level 60 wasn't a necessity to do well, it just helped a lot. Either way, I can't wait to start working towards clearing old Naxx. It's gonna be a long haul.
---
Demon Hunter is more of a Rogue/Warlock hybrid considering how they use Fel magic and their iconic ability being Metamorphosis. They are hunters in name only
---
I still have my vanilla and BC boxes with the disks and game manual inside. They’re a bit damaged unfortunately but I’m glad I still have them.
---
DM was out before the world first Ragnaros kill.
---
The extra time actually skinning I believe 
---
That isn't Benediction though.
---
Depends what your definition of BIS was - it certainly wasn't a concept we had any idea of back then.
---
It's not like in January 05 we had DM loot to supplement BRD, LBRS and UBRS
---
Shadowstep and Cloak of Shadows made Rogues in BC already stronger than vanilla.
---
how do you pirate something which does not exist? i've not touched nor even considered private servers until cataclysm, when the game turned to shit, which goes for the absolute majority of the minority you described. it's blizzard's biggest mistake to have waited so long to implement legacy servers. but neutrally, fine, let's assume people ripped blizzard off for consuming a product which does not exist and which blizz publicly shamed of being outdated and inferior, further diminishing any hope they would restore it.
---
your 10000 people count is not anywhere near reality. 10k is still the CONCURRENT daily number of the currently strongest server, Northdale on Light's Hope. it might be higher, i don't pay much attention anymore. the petitions Mike Kern brought to Blizzard had a count of 220k. they could include retail/oldschool players though. nonetheless, nostalrius used to have 130k active accounts and 730k accounts created. 730k people on just one single server who are so strongly interested in classic they resort to highly illegal, pirated servers, for which they will go to hell for. that's how disloyal players are to an authentic emulation of vanilla. and that's the absolute hardcore core, there would obviously be many more to join, if private servers weren't as shady and sinful. these players are in fact the perfect fundament of players to cater to because blizz are trying to create a product they wholeheartedly love. blizzard confirmed they want as close of a replica of vanilla as possible. and even if the only reason you didn't partake in private servers because you believe it's unethical, why would you want to change it? because the original isn't worth your time, that's the only explanation. then get the fuck out, blizzard confirmed it's not for you. i don't even need the idealism argument. 
---
the threats to blizzard is a legitimate strategy to save what's left of that company. are you trying to tell me retail blizz numbers are great? that the game is in a great quality state? yet the people who are still subscribed are the perfect loyal sheep, never criticizing and believing blizzard will get better. but they are the actual problem. if blizzard had no subscribers left, they would HAVE TO make changes that actually benefits the game. the players who stay subscribed are desperate, not loyal. if you were loyal to blizzard, you'd have left after cataclysm, since that's when blizzard's betrayal to themselves became obvious. but i do agree, if blizzard change their minds and want to overwork vanilla, this portion of players is definitely not one to build upon. they will instantly unsubscribe. but they're, by far, the most valuable subscribers they could attain. 
---
"A naked rogue"... glorious 
---
Nope. I don't really care about lore and I don't like RTS
---
Much of the problem of class balance is to define what that means!
---
How do you ”balance” a healer, a ranged and a melee? It’s going to be a rock-paper-scissors to some extent in pvp, and there is no way the healer could do as much damage in pve, or the melee have as much flexibility as the range. The situation is asymmetrical.
---
How do you balance cats and dogs, men and women, the sun and the moon?
---

"I won't roll cause I'm not 60" this right here is the real mvp 
---
&gt; I don't see the two adds. But they could be in some corner out of sight.
---
Yeah, you're on the right path.  Our first kill bugged out and the pathing was weird.  I don't remember all the details but I got a PM from Tigole on the Fires of Heaven boards after I posted about it
---
That's not a Benediction. Ackchually ... ;)
---
In the top dright I see a Staff of Hale Magefire, and 2 staffs with the similar looks as Warden Staff.
---
You know how you can tell it's a vanilla printscreen (besides the gear)? That cast bar, love the wierd shit we put on it and the key binds we used to use :) 
---
disgusting heretic  
---
you should know lore of he game you play so much   
---
vanillababy  
---
I see there will be a lot of Dad guilds but can we get the 26-29 wife-wannabe single girl guilds starting please? 
---
Probably time of day...
---
/r/thatHappened
---
I am mainly going to be playing PVE, but want to try PVP eventually. I am having the same problem as you and can’t decide whether to go orc warlock or undead mage. I have been set on playing warlock since I heard of Classic servers, but know I am starting to doubt everything lol, I hope you find what you want
---
Oh cool. Thanks. That first one is exactly what I needed.
---
i think healing will reset your swing timer
---
Ah, nice. :) I remember with my first guild we whiped aaaaaall night on this boss and got him to 5%. I was too tryhard to deal with it and played waaaaay too much, so got myself in one of the top guilds that was in BWL quickly after. Kind of makes me sad I didn't experience the progression like the peeps in this pic.
---
Ah accidently put 10% in Calc. 80k -&gt; 2k guilds
---
The sad truth is nobody is gonna run MC and let in lowbies. The Raid leads will always check your gear to make sure you are in at least dungeon gear. We can get classic back but people will still play it like they play ever other game in 2019..... only the "right" way. Its already like this on pservers
---
My list is not based on private where specs like fury weren't even viable until AQ.
---
\- Paladin. WOTLK. Every spec was OP (tank/ret) or good (Holy). Most of the complaining from delusional ret paladins has to do with the fact they started in this expansion. They were the best tanks and complete faceroll, the healer spec was faceroll and Ret was like being an arms warrior with a personal healer who also could self cleanse a lot of things, including stuns. This is when WoW class design got ruined. WoW listened to all the whiners and we got classes like this that no longer filled a role. They could simply do too much. It also has ruined WoW going forward past this, because idiots expected all classes to be like this.
---
\- Warrior. They were the best dps in PVP in Vanilla and TBC but they didn't start out so great in Vanilla and dps warrior was pretty mediocre in TBC (almost all melee was), so it's hard to say. 1.12 changes that with PVE. In vanilla they were tanks and off tanks mainly until AQ and when fury was redesigned. They rule beginning to end under the Classic ruleset, which is why they are so popular on private. WOTLK arms stayed the same and other melee classes like DK/Paladin were just broken. Armor pen was discovered and abused late though. Would that change things? Maybe. 
---
\- Druid. TBC might as well be named Trees Bears and Cats. TBC added more CC the game didn't need and cyclone was the most irritating CC ever. TBC is when PVP started to be bad in larger scale due to a minigame. The only thing that saved TBC from being a complete sh@%show in PvP is that druids were so rare and a lot of the players sucked on them because the good players had all rerolled to other healers or DPS due to crap like meters. When people figured out how broken resto was with resilience in TBC and rerolled druids,  PvP was just awful. Very few people knew how to play feral well. It was probably the worst played class from Vanilla-WOTLK and the class that has the biggest swing in dps.
---
\- Rogue. Vanilla but every class had a spec that can beat them after the AQ patch, which will be in Classic. **They were very OP before that.** TBC they are mainly just CC in PvP, but do good raid dps. They are awful in BG's in all 3 expansions. WOTLK was more of the same but armor pen broke a lot of stuff in WOTLK and people figured it out late. 
---
\- Mage. PVE Vanilla and WOTLK. They were best ranged from start to end, which won't happen in Classic due to 1.12. Locks will be around the same. They had early patches with lunacy like rogues did where they were just OP with double spell trinkets. PvP I would say Vanilla and WOTLK are tied. Broken patches with double trinket, Broken shatter one shots and arcane in early WOTLK. Frost was always strong. Arcane wrecked BG's in WOTLK. They started TBC VERY strong and were always fine for pvp there to. Mage is probably the one class that was just always good at PvP in every facet of the game in Vanilla-WOTLK.
---
\- Shamans. They suck as dps in in pve in all 3 expansions in PVE, but elemental got out of the gate pretty good in TBC. Elemental and enhance was great for pvp in Vanilla. Resto Shaman was good in PVE in TBC and in PVP they got good in WOTLK. They are of course needed in Vanilla, but resto is a garbage spec in pvp in Vanilla. You simply play elemental and heal. It's the worst pure heal spec in vanilla in PvP. 
---
\-  Hunter. PVE TBC they are top dps. PvP They are good in every expansion. They kind of suck in 1.12 after the first couple tiers in PVE. 
---
\- Locks. Same as hunter, but they sucked in early vanilla. Under 1.12 they don't have that problem. SL is broken in both expansions but SL/SL is remembered the most due to all the mages rerolling locks, because mages were pointless in later pve content. Add to that in a BG that dumb spec was never complained about in Vanilla, but in an arena where you are forced to sit there and fight the, it was about the least fun thing in the world. Arena in TBC was complete trash. 
---
\- Priest. Vanilla healing priests made the world go around in PVE. Shadow was among the most OP specs in PVP.  In TBC shadow was decent in pve and needed a lot. Still good in PvP but not OP. They had a dumb bubble heal spec in WOTLK in PVE that was OP. Priests were always good in early arena. Hard to choose between expansions. So basically PVE heals, Vanilla and WOTLK (due to a gimmick). PVE dmg. Prob TBC. Shadow PvP. Vanilla.  
---
yep the progression was the journey/experience.
---
Looking back at webarchive of our site, we didn't kill Rag until July 05.
---
We even had a Rag attempt where the Sons didn't spawn and we still wiped.
---
Now guilds are killing him before he submerges.
---
They were best at it but we just had a enh shaman do it. He knew the GM.
---
Wildstar was a buggy mess with a completely broken crafting system, dozens of abilities that didn't work, and extremely poor dungeon and raid itemization which made doing any endgame content actually ineffective for gearing. 
---
Wildstar failed because it was a shit game, not because the raids were too hard. 
---
Well... thanks for conducting the survey, I don’t think I care about this coming out anymore. 
---
&gt; am just hoping to play Druid and have the same or atleast a similar experience for example , to one that a Warrior would have like in getting accepted in Raid Groups and Guilds
---
Okay well you won't, because what you are asking for isn't what vanilla wow was like. Each class is unique and has their own advantages and disadvantages. 
---
Since they are the least played class you shouldn't have too much trouble getting a spot. This is in contrast to warriors and rogues, who even though they do mad dps and raids usually stack a good amount of them, everyone and their mom plays one so you have a lot of competition. 
---
Warrior has been slipping since forever. Vanilla/TBC was the golden age of warrior. Tops for tanking (the only tank!) and tops for dps. WoLK was ok, but seems pretty downhill since then. I miss Defense, I miss my sidearm. I don't recognize much of the way prot warrior plays now compared to back then.
---
Of course, but those should be reserved for who was actually there for the original release. I wasn't around for one (joined a few weeks later) but it would be taking something pretty special away from them in my opinion, and that's not fair.
---
data looks fucked how is there age spikes at 15 and younger when the curve is clearly there to see
---
&gt;Classes seemed to built on their Skills and how those skills contribute instead of the Numbers
---
Pretty much this. Almost every class brings something unique to a group whether it's powerful buffs or utility.
---
&gt;Retail is plagued with warcraft logging endgame , for endgame content experience , if this is not the same in Classic
---
DPS classes in top end guilds still like to log on Vanilla servers, but it's nowhere near as prevalent as live.
---
That should be an accomplishment by almost anyone's standards man! I was in a similar situation. Got to 2200 as ele sham/holy pally in s8. Idk what rank we were in terms of that combo but must of been high because that combo has to be one the worst around lol
---
ill have to agree with collax. you can do respectable dps as a feral druid using pummuler mace from gnomer and power shifting. yes you have to put in way more effort but thats part of the game. 
---
also for example a ret paladin and ele shaman do crap dps in raids. but if you put ret dps on par with warriors then they would be beast as fuck in pvp and if you buffed ele damage even just a little bit they would be bonkers. they already have insane burst i cant imagine them becoming even more powerful
---
&gt;easiest way to add content would be to add TBC.
---
Totally, but the question is, would it be the most profitable? That's the real question to ask, IMO. I think short term, yea it will be. It'd be (I imagine) relatively lost cost compared to developing new content and there'd most definitely be a surge of people coming back to experience it again...but for what, ~ 2 years if not less? 
---
If they go the route of new content though, while it would be more of an investment, I think that if Classic is a hit (and I think it will be) then developing new content to keep them around on top of attracting new/old players would be the best, long term, profitable solution, and is one I'm hoping for personally. 
---
Feral DPS/Tank Druid has a lot of it's best in slot gear pre raid :)
---
I leveled a prot warrior from 1-80 in early wotlk and remember taking mobs down to like %50 with a single shield slam. It was great
---
&gt; They start adding shit to classic that wasn’t in vanilla and a good amount of the classic player base will leave.
---
wht a bunch of unsubstantiated bulshit! they have already  added 
---
 shit to classic with all those talent changes, altered content releases(the 4 stages), non-existent spell batching, sharding, loot trading etc. classic will not be vanilla and that's fine.
---
i am willing to bet that all those ppl that have been playing pservers for 12 years would be more than happy to see new content in classic.
---
there is nothing preventing actiblizz to remove, insert or alter the content. it is their property and, as shown with sharding and loot trading, finance rules over creativity, melancholia, authenticity.
---
People are hostile to any balancing changes for a couple reasons. One is that balancing and homogenization turned WoW into what it is today on live where the RPG elements of the game have been stripped away. The other is that no one trusts current Blizzard to make changes, so we'd rather stick with what's already established from patch 1.12.
---
It's a re-release, it's not vanilla.
---
And there's a huge difference between someone being a collector and buying something before it blew up, than 15 years later, after it became one of the biggest video games of all time. That's in a way like printing a ton of First Edition Charizards or Black Lotus into the market 15 years after the fact and fucking over everyone who had the originals.
---
I figure as much. The idea that it's possible is still so far from what we have on retail.
---
Spellcaster. Shadow Priest. Get the blue pvp set when it's out and pug MC until you get Anathema which is almost as good as the Rank 14 staff. You can beat just about anyone with that 1 v 1. Be Dwarf or Undead. Troll is an option to but UD is better for wpvp cus you can 2 v 1 people easily with devouring plague. You can get the staff quicker healing, but one shadow per raid is needed in Classic due to the 16 debuff change to buff lock dmg. Can eventually get it that way to.
---
Melee. Orc Enhance Shaman, Dwarf Ret Paladin. Buy Arcanite Reaper. Get PVP blues. Eventually get AV Hammer. Should be competitive until later AQ. I would say enhance is more fun. Prob just get some DM gear before then.
---
Why dwarf? Gets you out of rogue blind. There are always lots of horde rogues.
---
wait is fucking killing me seriously
---
I was trialling for a guild a few weeks ago on my first private server.  They were short on 60s so we did actually take a 59 priest into MC - so it's not that unlikely
---
Each guild may need 1-2 MTs but some fights need as many as 8 tanks. And even in MC some fights have 4 or 5 tanks. Most guilds who run MC will end up runnings 2 AQ20 and ZG groups most likely, and each of those requires 2 MTs.   
---
While there was always an abundance of warriors in vanilla there was always a shortage of good tanks. Tanks burn out faster than most other roles. A guild running 40 mans should have 2-4 MTs and 5-8 OTs or "Plated Ladies In Waiting" since its not uncommon for a burnt MT to want to switch to DPS for a while.   
---
There is always room for a good tank. Don't let the concept of low% of MTs stop you. 
---
Oh god I never realized that it was actually confirmed they are doing the
---
Loot trading.  That's kinda horseshit. 
---
What rank is the blue pvp set available?
---
Wrong, it’s not based off weapon speed. It’s a 20% proc chance on every single swing. 
---
&gt; Each hit has a 20% chance of granting the attacker 1 extra attack with 315 extra attack power.
---
BC’s BM spec was fantastic for dps but it was really just mashing a steady shot macro with kill command and switching between hawk and viper. I LOVED the hunter play style towards the end of Wrath. High armor pen and just blasting stuff away (that may have been more of a function of just how insane any physical dps class was with armor pen towards the end of Wrath, though).
---
Gonna spend my whole life farming Manual Crowd Pummeler’s lmao 
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome, hopefully you’ll be able to do it again.
---
To add to what others have said (imp WF being a complete waste), you should know there’s no point in swinging Nightfall because every non-instant spell resets your swing timer. You can’t just weave attacks between spells. 
---
One week early access? Go fuck yourself
---
Don't even bother trying the WW Axe quest until after level 40 if you don't have lots of help. 
---
Murloc’s aren’t plants, they don’t have tendrils.
---
I played a human rogue for most of Vanilla.  If I saw an orc in a BG, I would pass him over for a different race almost every time.  
---
It was extremely annoying to have every one of your stuns resisted. Yea it's 30%, but it seems to resist every damn time. 
---
Who hurt you?

I'm compelled to note that Kevin Jordan was fired by Blizzard in part because his design sensibilities were no longer welcome. He said (paraphrasing) that he felt like the old man in the room that the younger people humor and don't take seriously. Take that into account when/if advocating for changing Classic. The game designers working at Blizzard now are uninterested and probably incapable of responsible alterations, even *if* the leadership encouraged it. 
---
I really want to know if you guys are willing to spend hours inside Molten Core, already knowing all the boss tactics from over 10 years ago, and after all being happy to do it again and again and again.
---
With the same single mechanic bosses, with the same half raid afk because even 15 players could clear that raid, with the same prefixed classes allowed to raid and with the same trash mobs that are being either skipped or become boring after the third pack is pulled.
---
I get that it was incredible and super fun when in 2004 it has been released for the first time. But now? I think that a lot of people will be very disappointed if content like Molten Core and some classes will be not reworked to be more challenging and fun.
---
Legion dungeons (not even Mythic ones) were more challenging and interactive than Molten Core.
---
Except its pretty bloody empirical.
---
Remember when over 300,000 people signed a petition for classic and blizzards response was to announce the atrocity that would be pristine servers? They' are/were so far out of touch with this communitys wishes.
---
As for slippery slope, a very Base function of the human mind is refering to previous experience and building on it. Going from running to instance portals and bgs and what have you to instantly have all instanced content available in the UI would never happen, the outrage would be surreal. Do it in increments and people will refer to the previous step and say it isnt a bit leap "well you still have to visit the battlemaster" &gt; "you already had the battlemaster, now youre just not forced to afk in Org, you still need to set up your premade" &gt;"well you could already queue from anywhere, now you just dont need to chase people down to join you, they click the Button and you're put together"
---
The only way I Can see anyone mystified by the concept is If cause and effect is equally mysterious. 
---
Yes, we are on the west coast. Goal starting time of 6pm (I think that's 9pm EST)
---
&gt; the consensus was proven wrong when Blizzard tested it on their internal 1.12 client.
---
Are we talking about the same internal client that “proved” charge didn’t make you enter combat despite dozens of warrior pvp videos from Vanilla proving them wrong?
---
Orc is the way to go, especially if you like pvp. 
---
I played an alliance rogue for most of vanilla and I would avoid Orcs because of that damn stun resist.  It's extremely OP.
---
Undead do look way more bad ass though.
---
I’d say it’s very important to play a class with high mobility if you’re short on time. Mage would be great due to always having teleports. Shaman and Druid would also be great due to travel forms and their “second hearthstones”.
---
Tip for you: Go fuck yourself
---
Yeah that would be too late for me with a 1st shift job. Thank you! 
---
Just sell the copies for 25 dollars for a 2-month sub.
---
You are probably right, I'm not arguing against that but, not a thing you said had a link to my answer to the guy above.
---
We are talking about Vanilla. He said the balance in place was by design. I said that's not the case, with proofs from one of the main developers himself.
---
And it's as funny as ever to be downvoted when giving proofs of something.
---
I don't know anyone who still has a CD drive. 
---
&gt; My question is,
---
What is the community's stance on Class balances , i would really like to play my Druid and EXPERIENCE Classic to the MAX
---
Druids are great in Vanilla. They are needed in all raids. They are great dungeon tanks. Probably the best wPvP class. The best pvp flag carrier.
---
Vanilla is an RPG game and not some e-sports game. All classes are balanced and perfect.
---
Yeah that’s true, I may go with my gut on that. I’ve always loved tanking and think it would be fun to compete 
---
Hunter, warlock
---
&gt; I really want to know if you guys are willing to spend hours inside Molten Core, 
---
Hours?  Guilds can speedrun MC in 30 minutes.  A non hard core guild can do it in 60.
---
I want to say this is a bad idea but I miss standing in the stank of 50 nerds cheering for the people working the shop late for us. I remember the first time a "midnight release" was at 7 pm and you could show up any time throughout the day to get your number to queue up at 6:45. It felt wrong.
---
I would throw down $20 for the nostalgia factor of a midnight release and early access. There are enough hardcore vanilla players that newbie zones will still be clogged.
---
Youre asking for an objective answer to a subjective question.
---
And since youre rock hard for the logical, is it more logical to write compelling text that highlights certain parts naturally, or to brute force it with bold text and caps lock? Pet peeve but still. 
---
My bad. Everything feels so political these days that I assume that even reasonable discussion is tinged with agenda. Apologies. 
---
&gt; Except its pretty bloody empirical.
---
Nope. If every situation in the world could be comparable, then yes. But that's not the case. Every situation is different, and the slippery slope argument is far from valid everytime.
---
Changing balance in Classic wouldn't suddenly allow things like LFR or phasing to be added. Because all of those things have nothing in common in design philosophy. It would be the same to say that changing balance would eventually lead to the addition of pandas in Classic. Yeah ikr? Ridiculous. As the slippery slope some are fearing for Classic.
---
😳 
---
GM of Capital (Laughing Skull Horde Side) checking in.
---
But this isn't vanilla once again, this is classic. Any real collector I'm sure would be eager to add a new art classic box to their collection and even if you gave the same rewards they'd have the benefit you assume of picking 2 pets instead of one.
---
The story of WoW and spirit of the game ended with WotLK. A true classic server would go Vanilla-WotLK. That is the true wow experience.
---
Some kind of collectors edition? It would have to have some cool benefit for anyone to care enough to attend. Early access definitely would. I’d be there at midnight with 20 bucks that’s for sure!
---
I was on that server! Was even in the guild for a brief minute. Hawthorne was a foul mouthed raid lead. ‘Heal me you [racial slurs]! I’m not popping shield wall, deal with it!
---
i guess expect a version of the game thats different then what you have played before 
---
what was your character called?
---
This is a terrible idea lol
---
I don’t know you either.
---
What stores? Lol...
---
Thats never going to work. People don't want to wait in Line anymore. Last time I did that was in WotLK.
---
I just hope they sell a Classic Collectors-Edition again. Back in 2004 I was 16 and had no money to spend on a Collectors Edition. 
---
isnt the enchant only like 5%? so 40+15+5 is like 60%
---
Rocket helm, mostly. Had a druid sleep my pet, rocket helm me, and cap before.
---
That sounds horrible.  I would not want this at all.
---
You know blizz hasn’t announced any charges beyond maintaining a sub. 20 bucks to bring back the nostalgia of a midnight release that gives early access is perfectly reasonable. I’d be there with some Mountain Dew game fuel.
---
You can go be around stinky nerds without causing others to do the same.
---
8% for boots so it ends up being 63% and you slightly outrun normal mounts without mount speed increase.  I remember chasing people in STV who were 40 without carrots.  I rarely killed them but I just liked to see their reactions like “how the fuck is this furbolg character keeping up with me while attacking me?”
---
Whats that item bound to '5'?
---
Can you ensure you have gold for your mount at 40 without yhe extra income?  The extra time you'll spend walking without a mount might not be worth it.
---
Meh, I tanked on my shaman until Mara, rockbitter and a shield worked very well,  Princess was the last boss I could tank before I knew we needed to get a warrior.
---
Paying for early access is completely against the spirit of vanilla and should not be a thing in games at all its such an anti consumer practice.
---
That being said if they did a midnight release where you could buy some physical things old style discs or figures maybe I can see that being great, people get the hype and feel of queueing up at midnight for something without it being bad for the game. 
---
oh damn 8% thats sick... its funny how the paladins have to put 2 points to get a 8% speed boost that doesnt stack with other speed boosts. cant wait to move at 63% speed in travel form 
---
Im not claiming a 100% success rate, since its based on assumption and prediction it cannot be, but to say the notion of "having done A makes B easier to swallow, rather than jamming A and B down at the same time" is falsett is banal. You'd have to be the most black and White person to walk this earth completely incapable of contemplating "what If?" 
---
You think you don't but you do.
---
Beta? Maybe... Early access? No fucking way. 
---
Definitely agree, Paladin never felt better mechanically/lore-wise than Wrath. It was basically the Paladin's magnum opus.
---
Requesting paid early access? This mentality is the reason microtransactions will always be in video games. 
---
It gives AP, melee and ranged, and only your group gets it. So there's 1 hunter in each melee group to give TSA
---
I agree 100% with TBC for best hunter. Mainly for a reason you left out - Silence Shot. I'll miss that alot in Classic.
---
It's pretty much an RPG staple, so I never had this problem going into the game.
---
Thats good to hear actually
---
The server started before I joined and I had read up a bit on the gameplay so; RFC, I think.
---
How do you get your mount at 40 without skinning on a fresh server?  
---
I guess you follow joannas and you end up at 38 and you grind raptors for 1 and a half levels? Lmao
---
Well, remember a big chunk of the game is the road to 60. So, you got to take leveling into account.
---
PvP servers will definitely have the enemy faction on your heels. In that case, a class with some variant of Stealth or a Night Elf can be useful (Shadowmeld in case of wife/child aggro). Obviously this is not needed PvE.
---
PvE servers obviously don't have this issue. Paladin/Warlock can be indefinitely useful if you have nearly no time to grind for gold or seriously work on professions due to the free mount at 40. Both are also *lower* maintenance due to being a heal-bot or with Soul Link providing a hefty and important amount of mitigation without needing crazy gear.
---
But at the end of the day, the game is meant to be enjoyed while you are playing it. IMHO play whichever you mind most enjoyable and simply work around whatever pitfalls show up.
---
Its gonna be a huge shock to a lot of people thats for sure. I can already see people raging that leveling is so slow that they jsut want to hit max so they can play the "real" game 
---
Non-midnight release without nerd stank isn't classic. #nochanges
---
You can go Fury or Arms, whichever playstyle suits you best, they're pretty close. Either way use a 2-handed weapon, and always focus on getting the best 2-handed weapon possible.
---
Focus on mobs no more than one level above and two levels below you.
---
Spirit is not a terrible stat early on. If you're below level 30, don't shy away from it, it'll reduce your down time quite a bit.
---
Get first aid, keep a good supply of potions if possible.
---
If you happen to have a very slow 2-hand weapon, consider doing the hamstring/joust method of leveling. You'll need a swing timer app, but it'll reduce the damage you take from mobs by 20-50% if you do it correctly. It can be tedious and take a bit of practice, but it works very well.
---
All classes in vanilla are desirable. Every class will be able to experience all aspects of the game, including top end raiding. Not every SPEC will be able to, but specs were a much more wishy washy thing back then.
---
The devs have admitted that the lack of RAID balance wasnt their design, but they had to make sacrifices on what to focus on, and all specs had at least some good aspect to them. Whilst not all specs were raid-viable, there were LOTS of "specs" rather than just one per tree, and all CLASSES were raid viable in a number of specs.
---
So you want to rolll druid. Spec Resto and you'll be super desired in every raid. Spec Moonglow (a 50/50 balance/resto build with loads of mana regen) and you'll also be desired as a healer but can pewpew a bit more as balance on the side. Spec pure Bear tank and you'll be the best 5man tank in the game, arguably (with caveats) better than warriors. But you'll be very limited in what raiding you can do as a Bear, and will likely be forced to heal instead in lots of parts of the raids.
---
BUT! Spec 30 feral 21 resto and you have a hybrid build with hte largest mana pool of any druid spec that's perfect for Raid fights needing decursing, can raid as a healer, can still offtank as bear, and you have a super versatile pvp build, especially if you move 1 point into balance for the 1/29/21 build.
---
So... whilst Cats dont do the damage of rogues, and Bears are only super good in 5 mans but fall off in use in raids... the class has loads of options and will let you experience all content in the game provided you juggle your role and spec a bit for what you want to do.
---
Sure, you may not be raiding BWL as a pure feral kitty in the melee team, but you'll be raiding as a DRUID and be well needed for your role.
---
That's... not cool. You could always do that next week. Your mom only gets one 50th birthday party.
---
Oh my god. I was horde side LS, and I remember almost every one of these alliance toons.
---
My classic memories are more pronounced than anything I did in the next expansions all the way into Wotlk (when I left the game).
---
I'd be PISSED if they gave people the zergling / panda cub and mini diablo again. I personally have those pets and if I started seeing everyone else with those in game it would take out all of the uniqueness out of having them. I dont think theyll make a new CE. I think like other people have said, its just gonna be buy the sub and you now have access. 
---
Oh shit! TR! 
---
SWG Bloodfin what up! Hawthorne! Ossoi! dang those names bring back some memories. I was young at the time but Hawthorne = Onslaughtxxxxxxx?
---
Oh I thought you said “for casual plebs”
---
i dont agree about wotlk ruining class design. ret still had no mortal strike, interrupt, gap closer, or slow. infact death knight has the damage of a war/ret but can also self heal and gap close, interupt, silence, and slow. but i wouldnt say dks were all that crazy op (if we are talking 3.5.5 here)
---
TBC is the closest that WoW ever was to Vanilla since that time. Here's a sample of what you should expect:
---
1.) If you can heal you are in general only viable as a healer.
---
2.) Gold is more important than in later stages of the game due to the prevalence of consumables and key crafted gear.
---
3.) Leveling takes FAR longer than it has ever since. If you're not familiar with the routes/quests, expect this to take around 8-10 days /played.
---
4.) Your reputation matters since everything is locked to one realm. You will run into the same people and your actions will reflect on you, whether bad or good.
---
5.) The game is much moreso about the journey then WoW was since Vanilla.
---
As a tank-healing priest Twin Emps was a really zen fight. Me and the other healers were literally in a vent channel with a metronome tick to keep the rhythm of when to start our heals so we maintained a perfect continuous flow of hp to the tank. It was all about keeping that rhythm and popping consumables on cooldown to last for the duration of the fight. When we finally beat it, I felt like I'd been meditating.
---
My guild in vanilla had very strict "you only wear your class's gear type" rule. Even as a resto druid, I was not allowed to wear cloth with healing.
---
If a resto druid comes to the raid wearing a cloth piece, then it is reasonable that cloth pieces that drop will be an upgrade for them, opening the gate to them taking cloth pieces away from classes that can only wear cloth (namely holy priests), but that the resto druid can still upgrade in the same instance by finding a comparable leather piece. In any case, a cloth piece is better for a clothie than for a leather (or mail or plate) wearer, because there are fewer available pieces for a clothie to upgrade to.
---
If a holy pally rolls need on a cloth piece, then a leather piece with similar stats drops, then the leather piece is an upgrade for the holy pally. If a mail piece then drops, that is an upgrade, then a plate piece drops, then that is an upgrade. Meanwhile if the holy pally had just passed on all that gear, then the cloth piece could have gone to a priest, the leather to a druid, the mail to a.... well... mail can go to the pally (or disenchant) because there aren't any competitors for mail healing gear on alliance. Allowing people to wear gear of "lower" material than they are capable just opens the door to wasting a ton of gear and creating needless competition for gear that isn't even good for those classes.
---
Even during leveling, a pally fully decked out in cloth will die quite fast, as they are a melee class. It just doesn't make sense to allow.
---
Like I said, I almost exclusively played healing classes in Vanilla. There was a period of time during Vanilla where I wasn't able to work for a few months so all I did was raid on my 60 and level 3 other priests.
---
Every time post 40-ish that there was a bear tank, I'd find myself wondering if I'd forgotten to put on my healing gear, then checking recount to find that the bear tanks were just taking that much more damage than warrior tanks. The only exception being fresh 40s who didn't know the game and/or were too poor to afford plate.
---
People are free to argue about what skills etc  they claim make druids on par (or better) than warriors, but the numbers that I was running clearly showed that druids took way more damage, which required more mana to heal and resulted in much more down time and slower dungeon clears.
---
That's why I capitalized 'you'. Maybe someone thinks, well if mobs run away in opposite direction, maybe I run away in opposite direction as well.
---
Or... you know... plan your route around it and get it as soon as possible. Why go back to stv at 40 when you can do that earlier?
---
My first char on pserver was 13days and it was a warrior. I played fairly normally didn't spend super much time doing random shit but i wasn't playing super efficiently either.
---
So prolly in that area.
---
Here is the priest set.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=540
---
Will prob be like 3 months into Classic. There were two different pvp sets in real Vanilla that progress in stats, but I doubt they do that.
---
Until then just grab some Eagle gear, the warlock blues (Dreadmist), DM has some BOE's maybe some tailoring blues.
---
Can get this recipe pretty easy from an elite mob and the mats aren't bad at all. In the 50's just level on satyr's for a level or 2 for the Felcloth.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14493
---
On Enhance you would just go to DM and basically get blue hunter gear that is really good there. Pair it with an Arcanite Reaper. Getting in their as enhance should be doable if you are social and in a guild. 
---
Ret Pally just grab anything with attack power and do same even if it's lower than plate. Might be harder to get an invite as ret though. Could always heal to get gear though. Enhance is probably easier to gear than ret.
---
&gt; Hawthorne = Onslaughtxxxxxxx?
---
What?  No
---
Hawthorne was GM of TR.  Onslaught was a member of Dread in SWG.
---
The original plan was for Archimonde to be the "pvp guild" server, but the server problems meant TR and some of Dread re-rolling on Laughing Skull.
---
Onslaught was GM of Vanquish, who were raiding partners with TR in the early days before each guild had enough members to raid independently.
---
VQ are still active in WoW today.
---
Who were you in SWG/WoW?
---
thank you for this information.
---
Yup, once you get to higher levels and your quest log is all over the world. In earlier levels I dropped my HS in the zone I was questing in since other zones are close by too.
---
If you care about leveling even as a fresh player you can do it in 9 days easily. If you just do some preparations in terms of quest guides and efficient leveling you will do just fine in prolly 7-8. You don't need to have played the game before to understand these guides and follow them efficiently.
---
Did you forget the fact that I originally had said it should be distinguishable and I will buy one if it is available? I absolutely want a collector's edition but I'm against the OP suggestion to make it an exact replica of the original.
---
Part of evolving out of the EQ mentality. EQ leveling was 100% grind , I can see where the designers originally thought a mixture would be nice.
---
2 hunters, 2 warlocks, and a priest spamming prayer of healing. Good times.
---
Hopefully it launches in September or gets pushed back another year. It's coming way too soon.
---
if you think TBC was balanced i dont know what to say. 
---
What's saying it should be identical? I'm completely against making it identical and see no problem with them making new artwork for a Classic release, and would buy one if it was available
---
It's not so much about quest routes and planning. Warriors are a difficult solo class. They need groups to do certain quests. Let's say he does group up for most of them. That's still going to slow his exp intake.
---
were you a Shaman in Unfadable?
---
Oh fair point. I mostly meant the elite elemental part. I remember doing all the stuff before that and getting to it and just getting my ass handed to me squarely since I was unaware how tough it'd be.
---
BC: Warriors, Rogues and Druids lol
---
You can't bring your retail pets to Classic. If there is no Classic CE, you won't have them either.
---
It is a bit of extra time but it also allows some spirit ticks of HP regen, and warriors can really benefit from this a lot if they get a few nice pieces of str/spirit or stam/spirit gear.  
---
To add to his gold point, there are no "dailies" that produce gold. Gold must be farmed, or things must be farmed and sold or crafted and sold for gold. TBC saw dailies that produced 50-100g a day(if i recall) which saw dramatic inflation to the economy. In vanilla most people were dirt poor, like less than 100g on average. I'm sure it'll be a little different this trip around but just another thing that is very different from the rest of wow.
---
So what would your recommendation be for a ret leveling build?  I found this guide, but a lot of stuff contradicts other things that I have read.  I also don't know if I want to go engineering as a profession.  The biggest uses are more applicable to PvP which I won't be doing heavily until I get some raiding gear.  It seems like it would be more beneficial to go with something else (skinning for vender / mining / herb+alch).  
---
The specs also seem to very here and there.  I'm just kind of curious what your thoughts are.
---
guide: [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-wow-paladin-leveling-guide/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-wow-paladin-leveling-guide/)
---
EU launched Feb. 11th 2005, DM (patch 1.3) launched March 7th NA / 8th EU, so it wasn't, but as I mentioned it came out so quickly following the release that barely anyone was 60.  
---
I wonder if they'll do the "old" Ragnaros route, because he initially was only available for 1 hour after being spawned before he'd despawn and be gone for the week. That's why it took so long to kill him in the first place, he didn't go down until 2½ months after WF Majordomo (Rag April 25th 2005, Domo feb 10th, the day before EU release)  
---
    
---
But yeah, DM is basically vanilla release baseline for EU players, which validates their proposed release order. There might be a miniscule population of people today that remember doing MC before DM was released, but the vast majority of us experienced something else. And if anything, we were promised the vanilla experience, not an absolute 1:1 replica, hence the 1.12 talents and stuff as well.
---
You may feel that way but, I'm perfectly comfortable with Trade Chat being used to organize groups. I consider that part of "Trade and, Commerce" My problem with dungeon finder is that it affects how they make dungeons.
---
It's not a coincidence that the dungeon design changed from CC and, focus oriented affairs where you need to be wary of Pats. To the new design of grab a pack then AOE tank, and DPS it down. It also created a much stronger idea of the "disposable player". Before the days of dungeon finder. If someone in your group was bad. You didn't kick them unless you absolutely had to. You gave them advice  and, help because replacing them would be such a hassle. 
---
Live to win! Till we die!
---
It's an empty slot
---
F
---
I have never played an alliance character. I also quit in the first 3rd of WOTLK. So I have never actually done or seen the alliance early dungeons. I only feel they are bad because of hand me down opinions lol.
---
How would it fuck over everyone who had the originals?
---
I've got some cool replica Mickey Mantle cards. They look just like the originals, except *they aren't* and therefore are not worth thousands of dollars.
---
Any replica case would be distinguishable by serial numbers, copy write information, etc. if in no other way. I fail to see how making a Classic CE that is a replica of the original CE will have any effect on original CE owners, let alone how it would be "fucking them over."
---
Druid- WoTLK is where they literally started to peak. Proper tanking and melee DPSing was possible, heals were alright. You could any spec you wanted for raids.
---
Warrior- Vanilla and WoTLK. You were always welcome in raids. Arms was the shit in PvP both in Vanilla and WoTLK. Prot was a blast in both PvP and PvE in WoTLK, it required some skills to get good at it, and it was worth it. Fury was GOAT melee DPS in raids in WoTLK.
---
Paladin- WoTLK. Tanking with them was fun as hell, and you could get spot in any raid. Holy spec healing was fun.
---
Rogue- Vanilla. It was most fun in PvP and PvE.
---
It’s ok, there’s more to the story than that. We were estranged a few months later due to alcoholism and I haven’t talked to her since. But I didn’t want to put that in the initial comment.
---
The thing about ArPen and Hunters has been that it wasn't a linear power increase. You had certain caps you wanted to reach and that made reforging so much fun! Pure theory crafting, I even recall myself creating simple tools to figure out best arpen values for my hunter with every new piece of gear.
---
Perfectly fine with that. 
---
Ahh yeah that all clears it up more then. I rolled on Archimonde yeah and then remembered. I was Taddel on Bloodfin and mostly just posted on the forums but before wow beta I joined fight and was doc / rifles. 
---
In PvE relative to Vanilla, absolutely. If you don't think that, I don't know what to stay either.
---
Yea private server experience shows that this generally doesn't happen. Sure, there are some rare casual guilds that legitimately take a couple of hours to clear MC and no doubt have an atmosphere that you describe - half afks constantly and people not tryharding, but the vast majority of guilds that are decent and semi-hardcore make their members get world buffs, consumes and overall close to optimal gear levels. Eventually, the good players in the casual guild will realize that them carrying a bunch of shitters isn't worth it, and they join the latter guild which suits their motivations better. Seen it happen quite a lot over the private servers.
---
As un-fun as MC is, it becomes an alright experience when you're in a guild of tryhards, gather full world buffs &amp; consumes and clear MC in 30-40 minutes, it makes it bearable for how long you have to do it.
---
ML mistakes - in my experience - mostly happen when your going fast and you have one person master looting and another changing groups for the next encounter. Its dumb but its not really a fixable mistake other than slowing down.
---
lol.  what patch?  and take private servers with a grain of salt.
---
That's why I'm rolling a warrior tank and making my own guild. 
---
I hate tanking and I am not a big fan of leading groups of people. But i'll be damned if my classic experience is going to be ruined by the dipshittery of others.
---
Nice screenshot :) 
---
&gt;I played a ton of 49 bracket.
---
Same. I had a bunch of 49 twinks on both horde an alliance. It was a really active bracket, with a bunch of people always playing.
---
As others have said:  
---
ONY/MC Attunement
---
BIS Pre-Raid
---
anything else is just for fun. but those two things will get you the farthest towards getting to do other things.  
---
Every time I see posts like this I think "holy shit, is classic WoW available again!?"
---
I think both are strong choices, however with orc you are only giving yourself the edge against stuns from other rogues and marginally warriors. With undead and WotF you are giving yourself the edge against priests, warlocks, and warriors. Pick which one you like best.
---
wtf
---
I never played vanilla (I started a month after BC released), but my understanding was that pre-raid gear was more than sufficient to raid in, right? Like there were BiS pieces that weren't even max level?
---
&gt;too much content
---
There's literally no such thing as "too much content" in an mmo.
---
What he actually means is "we didn't have time to add more stuff"
---
Broke my heart when I learned this.
---
Most fun thing to do on a pally.
---
That’s sick
---
I'm sure people knew what the best items were back then. There were plenty of min-maxers from other MMOs at the time.
---
yeh stocks was an iffy one.  people said its boring and repetetive but i digged it.  could say SM is repetetive too but everyone loves that place hah
---
I still miss Thorann-Terokkar. He was my bud back in BC days. I don't know what happened to him.
---
&gt; If you can heal you are in general only viable as a healer.
---
Hybrid classes can be sick in pvp, so it depends on what you want to do in the game.
---
&gt; Gold is more important than in later stages of the game due to the prevalence of consumables and key crafted gear.
---
Yep.
---
&gt; Leveling takes FAR longer than it has ever since. If you're not familiar with the routes/quests, expect this to take around 8-10 days /played.
---
Leveling was tweaked in patch 2.3. Prior to that the experience from 1 to 60 was pretty much the same.
---
&gt; Your reputation matters since everything is locked to one realm. You will run into the same people and your actions will reflect on you, whether bad or good.
---
Also applies for TBC.
---
&gt; The game is much moreso about the journey then WoW was since Vanilla.
---
What? 
---
Not if they tune MC for 16 debuffs
---
That 8% only counts while you're travelling, which isn't 100% of the time.
---
and there goes the nit picking.
---
If you played TBC the game isn't completely alien to you. 
---
I'd say the biggest difference is gear pathing. In Vanilla you pretty much had to join a big guild to do 40 man raids, otherwise you are stuck with zg or lower tiered loot. TBC had many more paths because 40 man raids weren't a thing anymore. Much smaller guilds could raid and if you didn't want to raid you could get heroic quality loot from dungeons. 
---
The other thing is PVP loot. TBC expanded the whole pvp loot system with epic quality off set items pieces and multiple pvp sets for your class specs. 
---
Hunter, easily. They scale the worst, so your blue gear won't matter so much.
---
&gt;Thank you for your reply!  I'm also looking at ret builds that may seem appealing.  Just out of curiosity what do you think of this guide I found?  (also posted in another reply so I just copy/pasted).  
---
&gt;So what would your recommendation be for a ret leveling build?  I found this guide, but a lot of stuff contradicts other things that I have read.  I also don't know if I want to go engineering as a profession.  The biggest uses are more applicable to PvP which I won't be doing heavily until I get some raiding gear.

---
Thanks man, this was really helpful. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; What?
---
After Vanilla the endgame was the focus of WoW and a lot of people rushed right to it but there's plenty to enjoy well before that. If you've never played vanilla before and treat it like you would other eras of WoW you'd likely miss some of the best parts.
---
it also depends on rested state a lot. in vanilla, if you play 3 hours per day, you would level 1.5 of them on rested state, every day, because the xp gain was just that low. 
---
The classes in vanilla all had different strengths and weaknesses. Some classes were especially strong in some circumstances, and some were exceptionally weak in some circumstances. All of these strengths and weaknesses could be overcome by switching to a different spec, upgrading your gear, or just through skillful play, and choosing your battles carefully.
---
Basically, it's fine. L2p
---
&gt; paid early access
---
keep yourself safe mate
---
&gt; I'm sure people knew what the best items were back then
---
1-2 months into the game how would people know what all possible drops were from each boss?
---
As I've already said there was limited end game content, and one dungeon set that could be completed across Strat, Scholo, and BRS
---
People were still figuring out the game with limited knowledge and understanding of the mechanics.
---
Does this mean that people couldn't optmise their characters based on what was available? No of course not, but if you think people were doing 100 Lava Runs for Ironfoe back then you'd be mistaken.
---
That clicking is killing me
---
You know I'm okay with that.  I started with FFXI before switching to WoW, and one of the few things I enjoyed about it was that you didn't need to be max level in order to effectively contribute to a raid.
---
Shoot melee shoot
---
Am I allowed to *woosh* replies to my own joke?
---
Having some spare gold to help you out is a wonderful thing, as warriors are very gear dependent. I bought my warrior alt a 21dps sword at level 20 and it was an incredible upgrade, and much faster than farming an instance for a certain weapon.
---
Yep. I miss healing as pally in wrath. And you’re correct solo healing 10 mans was awesome. I loved the holy light glyph that made it an aoe heal.   Also I believe it was in wrath but there was a super op pvp healing build and it was going prot.  You were unkillable. Could kill people with avenging shield and keep everyone alive.   Good times 
---
You need to clear trash first. We always said if you need loot stay behind otherwise keep clearing trash. You don’t set up groups till you get to the boss. At least wait till loot is done to move groups. 
---
Ret could cleanse slows, cleanse stuns (was broken AF), self heal, had great utility on top of that, cross heal, BE had an interrupt, ranged CC, decent ranged dmg while closing the gap they couldn't be kited on, burst as hard as anyone in the game.  I got my Arena wep with a elemental shaman who had never played Arena before in like 2 weeks after creating the character.
---
Ret was only not considered broken because shadowfrost was broken at launch and everyone wanted to be Arthas including some really good players who rerolled from warrior. Ret was broken the entire expansion. Most ret paladins were just awful (just like Feral druids). The best melee players were all on rogues/warriors, because frankly Ret Paladin was the most boring class ever before WOTLK and Feral didn't really get great until TBC. I actually made one because a ret paladin was always talking sh@% about my mage, which I told everyone was faceroll in WOTLK (arcane) PVE. I never claimed I was playing a hard class in PVE or anything, but this dude was a headcase. He told me I couldn't play as a Ret and gave the same victim complex BS all rets do.  I sent him screenshots of every BG tier with "wrecking ball" as I steamrolled my wat to cap.
---
I used to duel other glads and Arena players with no weapon in my hands in the sewers in Dalaran and win. The class was just broken man. It was as broken at PVP as arcane mage was at PVP. It was the beginning of the end for WoW.  You had a BG hero spec not dependent on anyone else that attracted the worst kinds of people to play WoW. It was just dogsh@% game design.
---
It might be different with armor pen on private and with patches not how they were but Ret was just dumb the entire expansion. At the end it was whoever had that dumb legendary Axe so balance there really doesn't matter.  I'm sure Blood DK's could put a wrench in things with armor pen on private depending on how patches work.  I never played WOTLK private.  That isn't what we experienced though. 
---
Yep - it’s called precedent and it’s fundamental to most legal systems throughout the world. Create a precedent for changes - people like you will be using it to argue for further changes. Once you know it’s an option pandora is out of the box.
---
Goober looks like a very memorable name.. do you perhaps remember banana boys (horde) on Laughing skull. Laughing skull was an amazing realm back in the day. Sadly it died out with the dues vox drama etc.
---
Double hamstring, an intimidating shout, and run your ass off!
---
I'm in the process of developing [https://www.vanilla-questing.me/](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/) but have been figuring out the stipulations for a few other vanilla related projects on the side. Databases are terrible when it comes to presenting data that's related to professions and you pretty much always have to use yet another tool in tandem to figure out what path to take.

It wouldn't be very hard to build a javascript parser that goes through all the patterns within a specified range and figures out what the cheapest alternative would be for the user. The user could even select materials they have an abundance of and have the app show you what patterns are related to them. You could build a tiny addon that adds a button to the auction house UI that snapshots the current value of materials on a server which the user then pastes into the app and it figures out exactly how much it would cost to level for example tailoring from 280 to 300.
---
There is absolutely zero chance that the LUA API will ever be able to do something like that so your work won't get outdated. It takes time, but if you're testing on a local server you can craft certain items a substantial amount of times and really figure out what the chance of reaching a certain skill level is instead of just ballparking it. Even if your app just showed the patterns in a visually smarter way than databases and the user could for example filter out anything that doesn't have shadow damage would already be a giant improvement to what's available.
---
I hope they don’t do that. I hated it when vael in bwl did it too. 
---
There are more than a couple back to back bosses
---
If you know what you're doing, Warrior isn't terrible. If you keep your deaths down to a minimum you'll out-level a Paladin.
---
Blizzard has never in the history of WoW achieved balance, why would they achieve it now? I even think balancing is fundamentally not suited for an RPG. If you want true balance every class has to gave the same abilities, the same heals, the same movement abilities everything the same, maybe different animations. Sounds very boring doesn't it?
---
Classic is not meant to be balanced because it's an RPG in the first place, not an esport game.
---
&gt;1-2 months into the game how would people know what all possible drops were from each boss?
---
Sure? Why not? There was a beta before launch anyway. It's not difficult to see what the drops are and determine which gives you the most power.
---
Min-maxers had been playing MMOs for almost a decade before WoW came out. 
---
Take a look at these Google Search results from 2003-2005. There are plenty of forum posts or websites talking about builds and optimizing their characters.
---
https://www.google.com/search?q=min-maxing+world+of+warcraft&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2003%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2005&amp;tbm=
---
Goober was in In Excelsis.
---
And yes I remember BBZ.  Not sure how LS ended as I quit during the AQ patch.
---
Christ, nobody is saying people didn't optimise their characters ffs.
---
You're taking a concept like BIS lists which are based on 12 content patches of Vanilla and 15 years and applying it to two months after launch.
---
That was Hyjal. Wasn't to hard to get to, but was totally empty and yes there was a little "under construction" sign on the road. 
---
I don’t always agree with you but I have to say - you are definitely one of the most consistent high quality contributors on here. 
---
I mean, it looks great on paper for a variety of reasons. It allows you to earn more gold, meet people along the way around the same level and it allows you to really learn your class....
---
But, in practice, it was too time consuming and, afik, wasn't something that was communicated to the player base. The impression I got from Staats was that they EXPECTED people to quest, then grind. What players actually did was quest until they finished quests in that zone, then moved to the next one completely under leveled (seeing how they didn't have enough quests) and were confused/frustrated at being under leveled. 
---
On top of that, the play style while leveling vs end game is night and day for nearly every.single.class out there, so my point about "learning your class" in the first paragraph only makes so much sense. 
---
Since when do undeads do frontflips?
---
"Releasing boxed sets now would be for the sole purpose of generating money from - sorry for this - blizzard fanboys that buy everything blizzard related no matter the quality of the product."  
---
Why would the boxes not be quality products ? I believe they could be printed with equal quality as those released back in the day. 
---
I do not see the problem how Blizzard satisfying customers is a problem by itself. I guess you have some side-effects in mind, but which ones ? Please elaborate. 
---
Reprinted books are common, and original editions still hold a lot of value for collectors. What if they reprinted the Bradygames guides ? Same issue ? 
---
Why are you getting upset? 
---
BiS lists didn't take 15 years to produce. As soon as people knew what dropped from each boss (which honestly took a matter of days), they could tell you which item would benefit your character most.
---
Maybe you didn't know what BiS was back then, but it's been an extremely prevalent concept in MMOs since long before WoW ever showed up on the scene.
---
I went through the links you posted and didn't find a single one that even mentions pre BiS gear and where to get it. I think you are disproving yourself here.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I bought PC's just for Classic WoW and they don't have disc drive(s); I haven't had a PC since Wrath (but got it a little before WoW came out) so it threw me for a loop when I first got them in December .
---
/u/Nicholas144 So OP your joke turned out to not be a joke
---
if im sure, the female ones did in vanilla
---
I think you may be mistaken, if anyone in this thread could clarify for us, that’d be great!
---
Ah dartol's rod, truly the sixth druid form in Classic. I hope they won't fix the quest and that we will be able to get it.
---
Class balance is only a shitshow for retail players expecting everything has to be balanced around PVE endgame.
---
It's not nitpicking at all, WoW is an expansive game with a wide variety of areas of content. One can't expect to have a productive conversation about the game without narrowing down the scope of discussion to a single area of content. For example, if a person's primary way to play TBC was in the 2v2 arena, I can see where they'd be doing a full on spit-take at the notion that TBC was balanced.
---
I happened to read this on your reddit cake day, congratz
---
Yeah but the whole leveling process is amazing. Finally getting to the point where you can do X quest, or finally getting better leather from the mobs your level, or doing a dungeon and clearing half your quests out, or getting AN upgrade (on any slot). The list of stuff that feels great to accomplish goes on and on...
---
Yeah Ill be going Druid but I wont be farming those. Maybe Ill keep a few for important bosses. but Since I don't plan on raiding I see no need to farm pummerlers
---
I mean... I do have one but I havent opened it in at least 2 years. I wonder what's in there... probably spiders.
---
Which bosses in mc are back to back? Pretty sure each one has trash in between. Either way raid leads should just wait till looting is done. I feel like its a rare enough issue as it is as I rarely saw it happen in vanilla. I just want no trading but no tickets either. People can slow down or get no loot.
---
&gt;a single one that even mentions pre BiS gear
---
Were you looking for exact term match? Or the concept. The concept is all over all of the results pages. The term itself is not. The term "BiS" didn't become popular until around late 2008.
---
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=bis%20wow
---
I looked up an old guide for feral dps Druid, and they wore 0 pieces of "Requires level 60" gear going into MC. I think this was mostly the case for all classes.
---
I’m not sure if you have played the unmitigated pile of horseshit that BFA is. If you haven’t tried it I encourage you to - so that you can truly understand where Blizzard as a company is at this point in time. 
---
Then come back and tell me you trust them to rebalance classes in Classic WoW. I would wager whatever they came up with would be exponentially worse than 1.12 of any of the previous patches you refer to. 
---
It runs much deeper than their ability to run numbers - Blizzard as a whole ideologically opposes the kind of design that made vanilla and other old school games. 
---
i love seeing Community stuff pop up. 
---
&gt; Hybrid classes can be sick in pvp, so it depends on what you want to do in the game. 
---
In most PvP situations you're still more valued as healer in there unless you're on ur own (solo wPVP). 
---
Pally is preferred to stay holy to cleanse+heal. Ret needs gear to be worth, gear u will suffer to get aside few late drops. 
---
Priest gets to a similar point. At least for solo/wPvP there's shadow, but it gets tricky in a group, where you're still better cleansing/dispelling/offhealing.
---
Druid? Gear yourself mostly as a healer (sta/int/+healing/+dmg+healing) and run for flags or buy time for anything to happen. Feral works poorly.
---
Shaman is the one getting it better with ele being the preferred one, but still you're an offhealer/dispeller with on-demand burst. Enh is unreliable. 
---
That's not to say the typical issues to gear yourself as such, both due to scarcity of appropiate gear and lowest priority of loot.
---
So more than sick it feels sickening.
---
I don't know what this is in reference to specifically. Just to be clear based on that German interview their client is a different thing from the demo they use to test internally what is vanilla-kosher and what isn't.
---
But that example aside, I can already see how "pfft Blizzard can't get it right, but pservers can" is going to be the next line of defense once more discrepancies inevitably come to the surface.
---
BfA is over a decade removed from Vanilla WoW. The profile of its player base is completely different. The design direction of BfA is made with an entirely different user in mind. I don't fault designers for giving their current customer base what they want. I've shipped plenty of products I personally thought were shit but ended up making my users very happy, and considered that a success.
---
Point being, BfA's design direction is not proof of Blizzard's inability to implement Vanilla-style design, it's proof of Blizzard's ability to meet the needs of the current active WoW subscriber base.
---

Power levelers reach 60 between 4-6 days played. Hardcore (in knowledge and experience but still levels profs and diversifies game play a bit) players will hit 60 around 7-10 days played. New players may take 10-20 days or more per character. 
---
It's hard to stretch it out too much unless people truly put zero effort into making their character capable of leveling efficiently. If you play 2 characters, one is gaining rest xp and accelerates it's leveling curve anyway. Of course if you play 1 hour a day, 10 days played will take quite a long time indeed.
---
pally is better for single target, priest is adapted for all situations, but has more mana problems
---
priest levels better by a mile
---
in pvp both are good
---
I think so
---
Yea... thank you for agreeing buddy. I didn't need you to explain my point. 
---
My guild went with a bit more video effects.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8hGZpqxyI8
---
All classes are viable in all content. Every class is unique and have it's own flavour.
---
Blizzard have said that they will not change classes.
---
Gonna find or make myself a guild with just such people. Who cares if we only end up being 30 man strong, I'd be playing with the right kind of people!
---
Raid resto
---
Live feral 
---
Heart of the wild
---
If support classes would have the same dps as pure dps they would be hillariously op in pvp because all the utility AND dmg.
---
warlock has more survivability tbh (health stone, spell stone, generally higher health pool), mage just has more CC options (sheep, all frost spells)
---
Both are extremely good in PvP, you cant say that one is better than the others. Vanilla PvP is more rock paper scissors, some classes struggle against others but will wipe the floor with another one.
---
E.g. mages will basically never lose to warriors, but an elemental shaman will almost always beat you
---
Warlocks on the other hands need some gear (= HP) to withstand  a warrior onslaught but will in most cases win against mages (with the correct pet out)
---
Wasn't open very long.  Was your intent to only poll people who are on reddit 24/7?
---
it wouldnt be a 2005 era wow raiding video without that horrible music. 
---
Regulators, REGULATE!
---
(P.s. I thought Afterlife beat us to the server first.)
---

---
You never played vanilla, you don't know anything about the gear, but you come in here posting google search results making nonsense arguments. Did you even read the search results you got ? You searched for best in slot and got addon  websites, CPU requirements for the game, a lvl 70 rogue twink guide (What), and one article listing the dungeon and tier sets for hunters, which has nothing to do with the best gear for pre raid.
---
Good to see some LS players hopefully coming back for classic 
---
My favorite dungeon tank is a well played and geared bear druid. I've also played one a hell of a lot (feral is my most played spec in Wow). Technically warrior is my least favorite dungeon tank. I'd even prefer a well played tank paladin but players need to understand how work with those.
---
Sadly one main reason why I do not like warrior tanks in dungeons as much is because of the player behind the character. I'm biased as I played feral so much and I cringe at most bear tank players (I wish the ones who NEVER leave bear form would delete and reroll) but, holy shit, most warrior players (because there an ass ton of them) are complete crap.
---
They'll be keeping everything as truthful to Vanilla as possible. The only changes they'll probably make is any possible bugs or exploits, other than that, they won't be doing any balancing.
---
dont worry about professions for now, focus on the class. If you want to tank as a warrior, go for it. You will need a guild to raid with it but if you want to only do dungeons you are the most sought after class in the game
---
Talent changes that were in 1.12, so no not really adding there. They weren’t going to launch with Naxx at release and weren’t going to add in both Mara and DM after launch so something was gonna get altered for content release. Spell batching is yet to be seen (also doesn’t really matter anyways). So sharding and loot trading are what they have added and sharding isn’t for sure yet.
---
I’ll take your bet you can buy me a pizza too. Cause I know for a fact I will win that bet. I play/have played pservers and I won’t play classic if they add new content, and I know not all of the pserver crowd will stay too. 
---
Of course there is nothing preventing them from changing anything, never said there was. Just that the best bet to keep people on classic is offering TBC and not new content.
---
Classic itself is a good enough game to be played as is for years and years no need to add anything new. Not to mention that adding new things instantly makes it not classic. It’s a rerelease not a new game or franchise.
---
Don't believe everything you read on forums. Nobody ever goes to a forum to say "wow, this class is great! Don't change a thing".
---
heroic Arcatraz....
---
and to a lesser extent heroic shattered halls / shadow labs
---
fucking brutally tuned/balanced 
---
"oh we dont have a pally tank and 3 CC? guess we will go run something else..."
---
Tanking Paladins were as far as I remember the only tanking class who would hit 102.4 avoidance in WotLK
---
They could get close in BC as well. 
---
So, I played a troll warrior in vanilla to level 60 as 2h arms. I was young and not great at the game, but it was fun at the time. In retail I've mained a ret pally since like late wrath on. I'm mainly interested in PvP. I will be rolling alliance in classic and wondering what class I should play. I love melee, it's my preferred play style with the only ranged class I thoroughly enjoy being hunter. It's my understanding that ret pallies aren't great in vanilla, though I don't really remember. Should I play ret pally, hunter, or warrior in classic?? 
---
Show me an accurate BiS list (using that term or another) from 2004. 
---
I mean - sure if you have the odd belief that Blizzard played no role in shaping the current player base with their previous design decisions and philosophy for the game. I would just retort that their current audience is the audience their design philosophy appeals to and they have pared the game down to the minority that approve of their current direction for the game.
---
We know it will be on an updated client. But they hopefully understand that we expect the closest resemblance to the original as possible. From a few fleeting statements they seem to understand that desire.
---
Well said
---
They already announced it won't be an exact replica of the same game, but an 'as-close-as-possible' copy of vanilla put onto the current engine. It'll have the original graphics, classes, abilities, mobs, will be recreated as close as possible. There are a few updated things they may implement such as loot sharing and sharding for starting zones, but those are not 100% yet.
---
Ah, i thought you meant jumping animation! My
---
Bad.
---
Well in 19 and 29, especially in the last few months before BC. There were a LOT of twinks in that area. Having a twink in that was almost not even that great because it made you average. Having a 49 twink... you could really feel a difference. I assume 39 feels the same way. I just don't think i would like not having a mount at all
---
Took ~20 days /played as a noob in Vanilla. Around 10 for my Warrior alt where I had a little more purpose and knowledge. 
---
If you're not following a guide, and doing some PvP/crafting/dungeons along the way, expect 10-15 days played. 
---
The argument whether you should level in arms or fury was going on for ages, but finally the dust began to settle down. 
---
Fury was considered to be slightly better due to ability to sit down and enforce Enrage and Blood Craze. But the research had shown that it's purely pserver feature and it won't be a thing in classic. Considering all the factors and PvP realm it appeaes that Arms spec will be the top dog on classic from the very beginning. 
---
To experience classic to the max there's other solution beside: /nochanges  :)
---
oh yeah didnt mention i was talking about melee animation sry
---
Ion talking about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1812](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1812)
---
There will be some obvious changes like Battle Net integration that didn't exist back then, but their aim is to have the core of classic as it was back then and I hope they deliver that experience.
---
haha nice, and you were also using nurfed too :P nice!
---
I think a few months after you quit, then, P4L picked up anyone worth picking up from TR. DV imploded in early Cata because of girl drama. By early MoP the server was pretty dead, and we (P4L) transferred to Kel'thuzad. 
---
Undead Mage for basically all of classic &amp; tauren shaman named Malorrasil for TBC.
---
&gt; Not based on skill. Either way its just a battleground at that point. Nothing special or unique other than "its battleground but its not".
---
Number of players involved is variable. Fighting over the most lucrative gold in vanilla, basically pvping for gold. Controlling the spawns means control of the best gear for raids. "Nothing unique"
---
I am done replying.
---
The issue is utility is hard to value as a whole. Dps/tps/hps are a set value. An extra pally buff and some offheal capability of a ret, how u factor it in? The same can be said about any other one of the *meme* specs. 
---
Utility IMO is only valued as a whole when it is clutch, like reviving the MT while fighting a boss. Individuals who get it are on the same page, specially when it is a single-target boost (PI, innervate).
---
Specs aren't like that in vanilla really...
---
Here's some from each class:
---
Warrior: Prot is great tanking(meta right now is actually tanking as mostly fury but whatever), fury is amazing dps, arms is great pvp. 
---
Rogue: Has sword and dagger combat, can spec assassination in naxx. Ass and sublety has great pvp specs, there's like 4 viable pvp specs.
---
Hunter: Dps spec only marksman, but there's both survival and BM pvp.
---
Mage: Frost for mc/bwl 2 different specs here, and then fire in AQ/naxx. 2 very good pvp specs and a few memey ones that can do sick stuff(pom pyro fx.)
---
Warlock: Two different raiding specs, has 3 different cool pvp specs
---
Druid: Either deep resto or balance/resto healing. Feral druid as both tank and dps is being more and more viable each year with more abuse of gnomergan mace, for pvp there's balance/resto in 1v1, deep resto for flag carry, feral or boomkin for more fun pvp
---
Priest: Either deep holy or disc for healing(disc having PI to boost casters), for pvp there's 3 different pvp specs, tribrid (all 3 specs at once), balance (mostly healing but can do serious smite damage with PI), and deep shadow(which is more of a solo for fun pvp spec). 
---
Paladin: Holy is the only viable raid spec, there's a bit variance but it's mostly just for buffing, the same spec is also the only premade pvp spec. Ret is a great fun pvp spec, reckoning is amazing at oneshotting fools, and protection can honestly tank most dungeons fine.
---
Shamans: There's either deep resto or totemtwisting resto for raiding, enhancement for meme pvp, and elemental which is actually a super strong and cool pvp spec by being both very offensive and utility/healing. 
---
So yeah.. Lots of viable stuff TBH, though for raiding most classes are more or less stuck in 1 spec with some variance, but it's just so much more than being resto prot or whatever, you have talents tree, you can mix between to make some really cool shit.
---
Even in the private servers I played, there'd occasionally be lowbies.
---
You wouldn't see it in a random pug where the leader is basically trying to ensure everyone can pull their weight so the pug raid doesn't die, which is kind of understandable. 
---
But my guild brought in at least a couple people who weren't 60, and this was on WoW-one/feenix where boss HP and damage was buffed.
---
Afterlife weren't on our server, that would be a world first not server
---
At this point no, they've said they're running with 1.12 balance.  So yes there's a number of bad specs out there, you expample if you don't like healing don't bother roling a hybrid.
---
My favorite pvp spec for WSG and AB is Hotw hybrid:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTMscbdLVE0oso](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zZxTMscbdLVE0oso) (points may vary and some spread resto points into balance for faster wrath spam giving up NS)
---
It's mostly feral but focuses on dots instead of shred talents (bleeds, moonfire and insect swarm). It's full hybrid gear. You can support heal and dps with all the feral goodies.
---
My favorite spec for AV is:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsLxG0oZVV0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0xhMxsLxG0oZVV0o)
---
Balance hybrid allows for more range which helps greatly in AV.
---
Both specs and variants are not just considered the best druid hybrid specs but also some of the best overall pvp specs in the entire game. It is considered a higher skill cap class to master.
---
Yea my plan is to be HotW. I just keep flip flopping on my exact spec. 
---
I think depending how often I am asked to heal will determine if I go a more traditional Feral build or not. 
---
I think to start(once 60) I will be a 0/30/21 build and if I find I am going into groups as a tank or dps far more than heals, but still heals often. I'll swap to 11/30/10 (for healing touch cast time)
---
If I find myself always tanking or dpsing and basically never healing at all. Ill go for a true Feral tank and cat build 11/31/7 +2
---
Here is an example of the information I found using your links:  
---
"
---
 For warriors  
---
The best alliance warriors For tanking are  
---
Dwarf   
---
This is because of stoneform and the extra health that dwarfs get. Yes I am talking about 40 health, but that can make the difference is many areas.  
---
For Horde it should be  
---
Tauren because of the extra 5% health yes I know this is very little because when you have 5k health it only adds another 250 health, but again that can make the difference.   
---
Thats pretty much everything.   
---
"  
---
Dwarf and Tauren are the best tanking races apparently lmao. Dwarf is actually probably the worst alliance side (maybe besides gnome). Most people would agree that Orc or Troll are superior horde side, with Undead fear immune being a nice option as well.
---
Ret pally's would requite you to be at the top of your game all the time for you to be considered good. Its a tough road and you may simply be dismissed by a min/max raiding guild. I'm sure with effort you could find a raid spot but your life would be tougher than needed.  
---
Warriors have a soft spot in my heart but they are great DPS, but you should expect to OT in raids. Don't have to spec Prot or anything but expect to be asked.  
---
Hunters are great early on but tend to see diminishing returns on their dps as others gear up.  
---
Have you considered rogues if you only want to Melee dps? 
---
I'm not gonna defend SL/SL, but fuck RMP in 3v3 equally lol. 
---
They already mentioned that had to "fit" Vanillla data into the Retail puzzle.    In some areas, the data didn't fit.  So they have to massage it.  Talk about round hole.  square peg.
---
That being said, I think they will get the overall gist of what Vanilla was about.  They won't get everything right though.  In fact, I think there will be significant deviations.  There were will be pathing and leashing differences, raiding value and spell value differences, armor, etc.  That being said, if all you want to do is have fun leveling.  I think it'll fit the bill.  
---
Not that I care about I'm not sure about the down votes.  You asked 2 legit questions.
---
All classes are viable, but not all specs.
---
(I'm not advocating any changes, just pointing out the distinction)
---
Yea, nothing unique like I said. Sounds like any regular AV skirmish.  
---
Fighting over resource. Changing what resource is while everything else is the same doesn't mean a thing in reality, its just psychological. Its still battle over certain resource.  
---
Yes you are done replaying after you got your ass swept :) 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0
---
Classes are perfectly balanced in PvP outside of viper sting.
---
PvE doesn't matter, you can literally 25 man every raid.
---
depends on  what your goals are really.  
---
That was Gladiator level in TBC wasn't it? I feel like even R1 was in the 2600s. 
---
You buff rets in pve, you now ruin pvp.
---
Zero class changes please, especially since the current Activision(-Blizzard) is devoid of talent or creativity.
---
I think you missunderstand op's question. He said he is a new player, i assumed he didn't play classic wow before and because of that questing is often one of the biggest noob traps, because they waste so much time not knowing what to do.
---
The fastest way to level is oboiusly quests and then grind only if quests are not aviable, but the thing is people go such poor routes (wasting so much time traveling) and waste so much time on not knowing the quests, that it's simply not worth doing quests for these new players. 
---
can you not perform a basic google search?
---
2.0.1 is the TBC prepatch and 2.0.3 is TBC official launch (portal opens)
---
&gt; Not until TBC pre-patch, at least. 
---
Well, I was a patch off, it felt like pre-patch. Either way, this is when the PvP community completely died so I REALLY hope they do not allow cross-server bgs in Vanilla.
---
I have first hand experience of what cross-server bgs caused to my ability to socialize and the pvp community as a whole.
---
Nope just none of your points are worth replying to. You don't understand arguments or how to actually make one. Just not worth continuing this discussion nothing good coming from it. Seriously go read your post and tell me why I would bother replying to that. There isn't a single point worth addressing. Bye 
---
I completely agree with you, but i just answered what op asked for. Just because i think it's the wrong way to do it just mean it's the wrong answer to his question. If you want to level the fastest and that's your only/main goal my advice is correct (atleast i believe that) my answer is also only if you never lvl'ed in vanilla before. Since i advice farming because new players waste so much time on traveling &amp; doing quests wrong.
---
Heroic Shattered Halls at least becomes fairly simple with a pally tank because it’s mostly large groups of mobs dealing physical damage. When the WoW community figured out you could blast through there with a pally tank it was kind of just one collective “...ohhhhh”.
---
The others though, I never touched if I didn’t have to. Ramparts and Blood Furnace were okay, but I didn’t have any real need to do them. Slave Pens and Steamvault were fine. Mana Tombs and Crypts were a pass. Durnholde and BM were passes. Mechanar was fine and quick (especially if you skipped the fire boss), but Botanica and Arcatraz were atrocious. Really I think the only heroics I ran with any degree of frequency were Mechanar, Shattered Halls with a pally tank, and MrT when it came out.
---
I wouldn't recommend it, but to his question i think it's the best way to level fast. It might not be the "best" way to level in vanilla in terms of fun/learning the game, but if your goal is to level fast as a player that never played the game before, i believe this answer is fairly correct
---
He‘s like the guy in Ready Player One. 
---
&gt; hamstring/joust method of leveling

I'm surprised I don't see this pointed out more often in these sorts of threads. This method has a far bigger impact on efficiency than whichever spec one chooses to roll with.
---
Nice meme.  
---
Vanilla is the same. End game was always the focus.  
---
"There's plenty to enjoy before that" can be said for every single expansion. 
---
I mean, no one LIKES not having a mount but I think it makes bgs better- it opens up different strategies and forces you to have better Intel and foresight to win.  It also differentiates classes more- druids and shamans have a better niche for example, and pally/warrior dominates less because they can be outmaneuvered.  I say this even though I played a pally in the 39 bracket for a long time.
---
Of course it also means hunters and mages still wreck everything though.  
---
This is how a loser talks.  
---
&gt;I won't bother because you aren't worth. Your arguments make no sense  
---
Pathetic and sad. Get rekt son :\^\)  
---
I'm similar to you and play hunter, druid, and mage. Both are not hyper gear dependent and excel at farming/saving money, which if you are AH savvy can get you some decent gear you wouldn't have time to raid for. 
---
1.12 talents  are tuned for Naxx and you will be going in MC. unless retuned, they are literally making MC a LFR run :(.
---
sharding and loot trading are a logical follow-up of cost cutting. they are doing everything to cut the costs: [firing ppl](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-blizzard-customer-service-staff-express-concern-as-over-100-accept-cash-to-exit-irish-hub), [handing over all of the decisions to finance department](https://wccftech.com/decisions-blizzard-being-driven-finance/), most of the team that made wow great has left blizzard, also the fact that kevin jordan, one of the initial developers of vanilla wow, was denied by blizzard when he applied to them doesn't sound good at all.
---
who else is buying you pizza? we shall see who's right, maybe neither, anyway i'll wait to see what's gonna happen and not gonna buy the "Cause I know for a fact I will win that bet."
---
regarding "classic itself is a good enough game to be played for years" know that vanilla is broken after Naxx. once you gear in there all content is obsolete it doesn't matter if pvp or pve. you get ridiculous 1 shots in bgs. you dont even play, things just explode around you.
---
it doesnt matter how you call it (rerelease, new game, franchise) it will be whatever actiblizz wants it to be, not what someone calls it on reddit.
---
I didn't find it too difficult, but sometimes I just get lazy. It does require having space to run around. It doesn't work too well in tightly packed areas, unless you pull the mob pretty far back if you can.
---
Hopefully in the future if they decide to go OSRS route, which is doubtful  
---
Except leveling is a complete joke and there's no sense of difficulty in the slightest until you reach endgame so the entire process up until then feels pointless.
---
Thanks man. Think I’m going to roll hunter then. 
---
No.  Most of us wouldn't play if they try to "balance."
---
Well, the downvote probably come from the fact that we already have the answer, 1nd there's no "what do you guys think." you just link the guy to what Ion said, the rest is wait and see.
---
Not saying I downvote, just explaining. 
---
Old argument. Game is 1.12  patch and it had cross realm BGs. 
---
The ONLY reason why 1.12 vanilla emulators do not have it is because the open source engine it is built on does not support ANY cross server tech and people merely got used to it and countered the problem by slapping 10k+ players on a server obliterating the rpg/pve aspect of the game.
---
Yes. They specifically said that they won't be "balancing classes" and that they are shipping them as they were in patch 1.12. They said this, three separate times at Blizzcon by my recollection. One of them was a funny response to an audience member who straight up asked the question, then tried to re-word it, and was still told "No, we aren't changing the classes or numbers at all".
---
yeah I just thought that druid and shaman flag carriers were a little to OP without the mounts
---
Oh yeah it certainly doesn't work everywhere. I was also surprised at how many elites I could solo with some cheeky 3/3 imp hamstring procs and bandage.
---
Lol
---
OK so no that's wrong. Blizzard said there would be no change at first. In the future we will see. What we can expect is a no change roll out till naxx is out for quite some times, and then we'll see about class changes if there are any. 
---
It's 1.12 and likely closer to real 1.12 than vanilla emulators are. Still, I expect differences to some degree and largely it will be the progression patches which, for some reason, Blizzard wants 4 large progression patches. Only the 1st one seems a little messed for me. I'd prefer 5 content patches.
---
Utility value mainly depends on your group composition and mentality.
---
Example if you are full on healer but still need a paladin for another buff you don't have, bringing a ret would be better than a random dps for exemple ( some people could argue you could bench a healer to bring another holy paladin instead but outside of hardcore guild, you don't have that much control on your roster etc... and you might still want to bring every healer).
---
Hardcore guild care a lot less about utility because they don't need it :
---
They don't need innervate because they kill boss 5 times faster than random guild, they don't need battle rez because everyone know the mechanics and have better gear and consume so they are far less likely to screw up and need a brez on a dead tank etc...
---
Whereas in other guilds, those utilities will be often more valuable than to kill the boss 2 sec earlier.
---
If you are good enough and with little effort, you can do enough dps even with the worst hybrid dps spec to beat any enrage timer (a raid only need 9500dps to beat patchwerk for example, that mean that even if you only bring 20 dps, you only need 475dps per person. Every dps memespec can achieve that with a little effort). 
---
Garr -&gt; geddeon -&gt; shazz have only 2 or 3 trash pulls between them
---
Same with golemagg -&gt; majordomo
---
And I agree they should wait but speedruns are fun, especially after months of MC runs and loot trading does nothing but make them less stressful for the ML'er. I don't think its the best feature I'm just saying it has its uses and the downsides should mostly be policed by the community anyway.
---
They added cross server battlegrounds in vanilla because severs tended to lean heavily toward one faction or the other causing wait times to literally take hours, sometimes even during peak times.
---
But this is the TBC patch so it wasn’t released during vanilla
---
Yeah preraid bis wasent a thing lol
---
yes, meaning it was possible to mask forms during vanilla.
---
Count me in. I don’t care for tryharding. Just some good fun that only vanilla raiding can bring.
---
Hopefully you have a lot of freetime on your hands!
---
They won't touch the balance, the "off-meta" specs will have to look for certain items to be competitive.
---
That's just how classic is and if you can find a chill guild that'll have, say, a mascot Boomkin in a spellcaster heavy group, just be ready to put in 100% of your effort.
---
The "lesser" builds are not terrible per se, but they do require a large effort to be par with the other dps classes.
---
The reason why people pick a Resto Druid instead of a Balance one is mostly because you can replace the Boom as a dps and lose nothing, as a Resto druid will provide the same, or bigger benefit for the raid.
---
(roughly, not the 3% spell crit for the group)
---
Still trash even if its a few pulls. If they limit it to master loot situations only ill b ok with it. I think we just need more info.
---
&gt;Yep - it’s called precedent and it’s fundamental to most legal systems throughout the world. Create a precedent for changes - people like you will be using it to argue for further changes. Once you know it’s an option pandora is out of the box.
---
Yeah yeah developing a game is the same process as living in the real world and politics blablabla. I know I am right at this point.
---
&gt; Sorry you won’t be getting any balance changes. Feel free to stay in BFA. 
---
I stopped playing towards the end of Wrath. Never played retail nor pservers since. Nice try though. It's not because BFA is shit that Classic needs to be as well in its own way.
---
I expect next to zero changes overall in these areas until the game has been out for some time and Blizzard orients it to match the stand alone concept better. I do expect future changes because the meta of a stand alone 1.12 Wow is different than historical progression. 
---
If anyone has played vanilla emulators, they should have noticed how different the 1.12 vanilla wow meta is over real Classic historical progression. Patch days back in Classic were more about "What class balance changes will we see?!" because some classes had to wait a YEAR or more to catch up on balance tweaks over other classes. 1.12 is static, and the entire game plays a different beast. You only care about the content coming, which is rather comforting as you know you aren't getting seemingly random class changes that are hit or miss. At least most consider 1.12 as the "least worst" class balance patch in Classic.
---
&gt; Changing balance in Classic wouldn't suddenly allow things like LFR or phasing to be added. Because all of those things have nothing in common in design philosophy. It would be the same to say that changing balance would eventually lead to the addition of pandas in Classic. Yeah ikr? Ridiculous. As the slippery slope some are fearing for Classic. 
---
You got too much going on. Join a instant 60 server and test out abilities and play BGs. Let your feel decide
---
I would say the least gear dependent classes are the ones that either do not need crit. Or they are given crit as a core component of their core stat. Rogues and Hunters are great out of the can because the AGI you need on your gear gives you 6% crit for every 100 you have. Priest is another example, your pvp spec shadow never needs to crit. Getting gear with just spell power stam and, int isn't anywhere near as hard as other classes have it.
---
I played in Annex, Human warlock named Nvie. Joined before AQ40 came out. Recruited by Mandrake the warlock officer, dont know if you were around back then, but hello!
---
Surprised nobody has said rogue. Meets most of your criteria.
---
Hi, /u/roaringsnakexd
---
I was in Annex as well, Human warlock named Nvie. I joined a bit before AQ40 came out, it was over 13 years ago obviously but I think your name sounds familiar. I remember Mandrake the warlock who recruited me, and I remember there was a human mage who was cousins with a night elf druid who were officers or leaders in the guild for sure. I remember our main tank was a night elf warrior with a really deep voice, and I remember a bunch of the officers rerolled warriors and started PvPing when they saw Laintime pvp videos... 
---
Don't know if any of that rings a bell but it was all a blur. Good to see Annex people, though!
---
No worries. It's just that everyone should keep in mind that Vanilla was not a complete / achieved game, and neither is Classic. Changes happen from 1.1 to 1.12, and fortunately so.
---
Yes from Wrath/cata on many bad things were added (at least I can guess), but it's exactly because of what happened that we can learn and pin point the few areas that could get improvement in Classic. If it stays the same, we should be ok with it. But if slight changes, depending which ones, with consultation of the community from Blizzard is proposed, we should be open about a discussion.

Everything he said is correct if you're trying to level as fast as possible. 
---
I remember when Cat form's hit range was fucked up and using Noggenfogger elixir fixed that. To be able to land hits on anything you literally had to be standing inside your target, and in PvP, this was especially annoying. 
---
You can technically have your mount by level 40 just by not buying spells and being smart on what to vendor or ah. Skinning is not needed but makes it far easier. 
---
I dunno about you guys, but i'm expecting the 2nd content wave to be more in the 6-8 month range than the 3 month range.
---
Just not buying spells is usually enough, especially for a warrior who only really relies on weapons. 
---
Ditto to this, want to raid but limited time.  Not a fan of getting ganked while leveling, part of the limited time is not spending it all in STV.
---
it was just for school and was open to reddit and 4chan. its not like an official poll.
---
ty its been fixed now
---
We you usually have a bow and some arrows for tanking anyways. 
---
Human warlock named Nvie, I raided with Annex. I remember Requiem, I remember seeing Rushdown female night elf warrior in ironforge and thinking that is a bad ass name, and his gear was sick.
---
July 20 is [this ballbuster](https://ultrasignup.com/register.aspx?did=59189) which I masochistically do every year, so naturally classic will come out the week before.
---
To add to this, keep in mind that both are still very close as long as you go 2h, on a pve server. A very common build is to go 5 points in fury for the crits, then arms and respec at 40 for mortal strike. It's the recommanded build for pvp servers. 
---
I think the reason balance went so sideways was because TBC introduced arena, and that was just a whole other can of worms to try to balance around. The esports scene became prevelant, and the were forced to try to balance both over and pvp, which is impossible.
---
I wouldn't be upset if some balance changes were tested for classic to allow some unquestionably inferior builds to be brought up to a level closer to the God tier classes. (Mage/rogue/warr).
---
Not having to balance around arena would have made a world of difference for class balancing, and would have likely resulted in less homogenization, and significantly less tinkering with all classes.
---
timestamp where he talks aabout being fired for his design sensibilities no longer being welcomed? i watched the entire video but i must of missed it 
---
Why is viper sting imbalanced?
---
It depends on the player. If this is someone with a large amount of MMO experience they likely can level fairly quickly. MMO skills tend to be fairly transferable 
---
The problem is not all servers will have a high enough population 24/7 to support server only BGS. 
---
I grinded my way to GM pre cross realms and made another pvp character after they added realms. It was a necessarily evil IMO. I pvp'd on one of the top 5 populated server in USA but eventually people stopped queuing as much and those GM/HWL pre mades made it even more discouraging to queue. Basically those pre mades were queue dodging each other and steamrolling pugs.  It got to a point where no pugs/sucky premades would sit in the grave yard on my server while they let us capped. 
---
I'm pretty sure I see a ret paladin wearing tank gear (Golem Skull Helm, Stockade Pauldrons?).
---
tbc prot paladin is one of my favorite specs ever.  they did an excellent job making it a legitimate tanking spec without homogenizing it with warriors (both being sword + board plate tanks)
---
The gap between hunter and everyone else is pretty funny, but not unexpected
---
&gt;It's cheap money.
---
Well fuck me kind stranger, where can I find some of that stuff?
---
It was during one of his twitch streams that I watched back in September or October. He was talking about the state of retail WoW and the modern systems in place. 
---
Here's his channel: https://www.twitch.tv/failureanalysis/videos
---
I couldn't find the video but I'm sure he'd be glad to talk about it if you ask him. 
---
The leveling will be somewhat the same, save a few quest hubs, extra quest giver npcs, lowered exp requirement 40-60 and itemisation changes.
---
The leveling will take you a while, and that is something you'll have to accept.
---
The good thing is, you'll likely meet a lot of people and form contacts with said folk. Obviously you'll likely remember the arseholes that poked you in the bum with a stick while you were at 10% hp.
---
You should always take enough time to play if you're doing PvE content. (Unless your group outgears in tremendously.)
---
Dungeon runs or raids may take an hour, or up to 6 hours still lacking completion.
---
Take in the world, make yourself a part of it and find a group of like-minded fellows to shoot the shit and be an arse to the other faction. (Depending on the server type.)
---
oh damn ok. can you remember what exactly he said he did differently that got him fired? like what exactly did he want to do that they didnt like?
---
You kind of almost need them though, my experience ranking to 11 was sitting in queue for about 45 minutes to an hour to play a single game of wsg or ab with a premade. It kind of sucks that over a 12 hour period I would get to play only 15 games, most of which we smoked the other team in 5-10 minutes. 
---
If they do do it they need to have battle groups like they did in TBC and they should keep them as small as possible, like 5-10 servers each max. 
---
They don't need to go overboard to completely minimize queues they just need to make it so like no one has to wait 30+ minutes per game consistently. 
---
There is no sense of difficulty in vanilla either. Mob hitting you harder than you can hit mob harder is not "difficulty", its stats(gear, level) war  
---
CT Raid and raid bars in general didn't exist during the first attempts in MC. Blizzard added their raid bars after CT did, too. But there were definitely beginning stages where the only health bars you could see were your own party's. 
---
I played in WotLk and just playing on North sail the server seems very similar to my experience of playing WoW during that time
---
Remember though this only happens on private servers because the bosses are easier and everyone knows the content inside and out!!
---
This is how easy this stuff is folks, it's way too easy and with 1.12 talents and itemization, MC is going to be trivialized content, and BWL won't be too far behind.  That is potentially a years worth of raid content that offers almost everyone that wants to raid very little challenge.
---
LOL Feral DPS is probably the most hardcore Class you can play. Way too much hassle. Farming the Gnomeregan Mace and all that weird Swapping in and out of Forms to restore Energy is kinda annoying as fuck.
---
Definitely not open to any discussion about changes until we get the closest possible recreation of the best game ever made available again to us. After that point I'd definitely be curious to see how an enhanced edition could be improved and would enjoy dreaming of ways the game could be improved. This is 2019 Blizzard, remember. Your choices are: no changes or bad changes. 
---
*casual plebs*
---
I'm assuming he's not intending to min/max.
---
Please show me the numbers and time saved.
---
You're incapable of continuing a train of thought aren't you? Fine I'll spell it out:
---
"Hey guys, let's fix prot paladins!" - Sure, here are all their issues that needs resolving. "Great let's start by giving them a way to regenerate mana, let's give the spiritual attunement" sure, but now holy paladins can reach that and illumination and have even wonkier mana return than before "Oh shit, well switch it with a later tier ability like reckoning so it doesn't stack" Great, now Rets can go deep retribution and still get reckoning bombs, making them even burstier in PvP. "Oh fuck *1000 fixes like this later*" 
---
Okay so you managed to fix talents, but there's still the issue of gear, all raiding gear is tailored towards protection warriors, not protection paladins. "Well so let's add new gear for them with defense and mp5 and spell power and stuff!" alright, is this alliance only drops or shall we flood hordes loot pool with items they'll never equip as well? *tons of debating* "Alright well how about we remake Judgement into a protection set?" Fine, but that fucks shockadins and that sort of build, and they'll still be outclassed come Naxxramas since there's no equivilent "Well then make redemption tank gear as well!" - The fuck is a holy paladin supposed to wear then? "Erhm, well fuck let's just add a spec specific tier for each class, one for holy, one for prot, one for retri and have them purchasable with tokens dropped from bosses!" ....wat?
---
This, right above, is the slippery slope, and these are the exact kind of issues that would arise from attempting to balance a "complete" product, everything's like a big web, you can't tweak a few strands in one corner and expect the entirety to stay the same, you can't fix vanilla WoW's balance without making it into something entirely different.
---
Correct if I'm wrong, but I believe Blizz originally intended for the Night Elves and the Forsaken to be a part of their own factions.
---
Only later they changed their minds to make it a bit easier to manage.
---
back in emerald dream i was level 57 and a guild asked me to join them for MC. im not sure if a level 57 can even get it but they still wanted me to come lol 
---
you do realize no one would have it in classic at the start, because they've stated ingame items from modern WoW aren't transitioning over?
---
They'd have to re-introduce the zergling and panda cub somehow.
---
Blood elves were alliance, which is why it is odd that they ended up in the horde for some reason.  
---
The high elves show up plenty- there's tons still around.  There's certainly enough to be players if, for instance, space goats and void elves get to be.  As far as I can tell, there's more high elves around than death knights, lost isle (aka all player) pandaren, player demon hunters, void elves, dranei, and likely some more.  
---
It's just an excuse, because they know that the players want high elves and they are opposed to it.
---
The memory is a bit hazy but the jist is that he was adamantly against flying and LFG systems and the like. He said that there was a general feeling amongst the designers that adding in convenience systems was the way to go and that he, with his Ultima Online sensibilities of wanting players to feel very connected and challenged by the world, started feeling like the cranky old guy. He's one of the people who understands that rewards with no work feel meaningless and that beating something after overcoming challenges is joyous. 
---
Not to mention it's nice when you can actually play BGs in pre-60 brackets a year into server launch, which is virtually impossible without x-realm BGs.
---
What about a quest planner? A way to map out a leveling/quest path? Im currently writing up a rough path to hit all the quests for darkspear trolls rep that way I can get exalted and have a raptor mount on my orc and not have to spend any time/money on cloth turn ins. 
---
Another idea is some kind of gear planner. So you can mark down all the peices you want, and it'll give you a list of dungeons/bosses that you can run. That way when you see people advertising for different dungeons you know all the ones you should respond to. Or to have a quick reference on which bosses drop the loot you want to save your dkp/rolls for them. 
---
Not sure if they exists or how difficult these would be. Just brainstorming. 
---
lol damn and people say blizzard sucks because of activision. it sounds like blizzard are responsible themselves
---
You really don't. Take a queue from TBC, what if you had a deep ret talent that let the ret's attacks refresh all judgements on target. Basically irrelevant in pvp, potentially a strong argument for a single ret to keep JoW/JoL/JotC up.
---
If youre better than others you ll obviously do better. But the average player will lose the most time if they level a warrior.
---
Prot warrior - Shield block
---
I remember the first time we downed Lucifron. 
---
Our guild must've been trying for 2 weeks, give or take, every single night and we were all getting frustrated w/ the wipes and repair bills and everything. We had finally gotten both the guards down and we all start hammering Luci, and right at ~3% health she fears us and one of our DPS almost goes into the imps which had respawned by that point and you just hear our MT on vent scream at the top of his lungs, "GET AWAY FROM THE DOOR!!!!" 
---
Fortunately, they didn't aggro and we got our first Luci kill with an inside joke (we'd randomly scream "get away from the door" on vent when someone did something stupid) that lasted for months after that. 
---
It's an instant cast ranged ability with 0 cool down and minimal mana cost that completely devastates a casters ability to function. If you have mana and you can't dispel poison you're pretty much fucked, and even if you can you'll just be spamming dispel to keep that shit off of you.

---
Hard copies are cool but that you are asking for early access is just crazy, its that type of harmful business thats ruined WoW 
---
My opinion is that Activision makes them worse and encourages their bad tendencies. Ideally you'd have wise people leading and saying that reputation and goodwill are more important than quarterly returns but Activision is kind of the drug dealer calling up the junkie and saying "I've got a fresh stash". Hard to say no. 
---
But yes Blizzard got too obsessed with trying to be clever and accommodating to the lowest common denominator and forgot the fundamentals that made the game appealing for average people. 
---

---
That's fair, I really should have said there's a period where it sucks. Even in my post defending spec variety, I believe I undersold the potential variety of specs for different purposes. 
---
My guild never got past twin emps sadly which upset me because I had all the mats for my Qiraji bulwark. Ended up having to pay another guild to summon me after they cleared upto C'thun.
---

---
Mana Tide Totem single handedly forces all shaman to be healers, except for the one Enhance Shaman who gets to feel special by swinging Nightfall (even though everyone agrees that a Hunter is the better Nightfallbot.)
---
Oh, and Spirit Tap for Priests. I can't understand how any Priest levels without it.
---
Bow and Arrow is much slower shot then throw.  This is why throwing knives are key to fast leveling.
---
I think that's a good point. If they added it along with the naxx content I'd be fine with it. Prior to that they'd probably be better off merging servers after tourists leave.  Farming hk in world PvP between queues added a little spice too.
---
Hunter class is very chill and has little or no downtime at all. It's one of the easiest classes if not the easiest class to level. 
---
&gt; I knew that this part of my life was over. 
---
I played religiously from ~May 05 - right before Sunwell or ZA was released (I forget, exactly, but sometime) in late TBC because the game had lost its luster to me at the time, fortunately I had made some friends in college and started seeing them so it wasn't too bad that I quit the game. 
---
But, I did come back in Wrath, right before the release of ICC and, I felt that exact feeling right before I quit playing for 3 months. The game was not the same, I didn't recognize any of the names, the lore, the top guilds on my server (with the exception of 1, TG) were all gone and the community had changed DRASTICALLY....I realized then that even though the time I spent playing WoW, the time that I truly cherished (as "funny" as that is to say about a video game) was gone, and that I'd be moving on with my life which to me was sad in a way.
---
But then, they announced Classic, and I could not be more excited .
---
This! I love making twinks, my 39 warrior twink was my favorite character ever and without x-realm bgs he wouldn't have had anyone to fight.
---
I swear there was a competing guild in MC/BWL that started with an A.  This was before Deus Vox assembled.
---
Talent?  Mana Tide Totem
---
Class Skill? Rebirth (Battle Rez)
---
There were tons of nelfs and humans in full T2++, min-maxers are in their own bubble. If you are in a guild with people you get along with, friends, etc, it literally does not matter.
---
&gt; Blizzard said there would be no change at first.
---
Bullshit. Here is what they actually said:
---
&gt; The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .

---
And when they added them people were so happy to have queues. People welcomed them and begged for them.
---
I wish you luck on this quest. This is no small task adventurer! Few are those brave enough to raid every week and work with 40 other people
---
Frost mage was decent in PvE and horribly OP in PVP.  They were one of the strongest PvP classes in TBC and got nothing but buffs in WotLK.
---
Yes, I played.  I remember they were nearly impossible for melee to kill because of Shattered Barrier alone.  By the time you could catch them, Ice Barrier was up again and then you were just gonna get frozen again.
---
Then they added a stun, which also count as frozen, so while you're stunned they did massive damage to you.
---
They were insanely OP in PvP in WotLK.
---
It is highly likely that they have planned for July 16th release but cannot yet commit to it because there could be some problems that would postpone the date so they gave us these hints. 
---
That same patch that added cross-server BGs also revamped Rogues so much that they actually reset your talent points for free.
---
So which version of Rogues are you saying should be available in Classic?
---
Oh yeah I love it. More than i enjoy endgame tbh. Just people nowadays dont care about the journey to max. they just wanna be max cuz thats supposedly the only relevant content. leveling to 60 is literally over half the game. Leveling WAS the point of the game until they shifted focus to raids and dungeons because they were a shit load of fun in vanilla too
---
There aren't many times that a company gets to relaunch a product and consumers are excited for it. Who knows, they could re-release TBC with updated balancing and no world flying to keep things rooted in that classic feel. 
---
Is it possible to only upvote the link flair text? 
---
&gt; It's by design.
---
It's bizarre that players have come to believe this. The devs have never stopped talking about the ways in which Vanilla was left incomplete and balancing was interrupted for taking too much time away from [developing the first expansion.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; “Right now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. **Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.**”
---
An additional culprit was a lack of ideas on *how* to fine-tune each spec for maximum viability and class fantasy, as Kevin Jordan pointed out on the Classicast:
---
&gt; “[A Protection Paladin] was fine generating threat as long as the mob was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, whereas the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. **We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt** so we were still experimenting and learning as we went.”
---
Why should I know more? Doesn't affect my raiding or pvp at all.
---
nope we got the first Lucifron kill, hence Goober from IE messaging us during the raid
---
Who were you in TR?
---
&gt; People back in the day were slower paced in about everything but right now as it stands there is so much information out there that if people really want to get to 60 they will be getting to 60 asap
---
It's not really here nor here but to be fair there were other reasons anyone who didn't level 1-60 during 1.12 would have taken longer than today.
---
Fewer quests and items, different talents, fewer quest hubs, mobs and spots that haven't been nerfed yet, slower tech and so on
---
1. We know it's going to be running on the modern client. So it won't be exactly the same game. It's a re-creation of the game not a re-release.
---
2. They've said their goal is to deliver the closest possible experience to what the game was like in 2004-6. So while it won't be the original game they will be trying to replicate it as closely as possible.
---
anyone remember redeemerr from warsong feenix? i feel like he started the entire na vs eu thing on private servers

I didn't get to see most of AQ in vanilla, just in Wrath when I would solo farm CThun as a DK.  Looking forward to getting another chance to see these fights as they were went to be.

You underestimate how quickly it fell to debauchery on RP servers, lol. Pretty much as soon as the first wave of levelers moved on from Elwynn, ERPers stayed behind. 
---

---
Also take a look at 30:11 in that video.
---
Yikes. That sounds painful. Spirit Tap + Wand Spec is infinitely more fun and efficient than the alternatives. But I guess to each their own!
---
As for your last build, 7 in resto, I assume you mean imp enrage. Personally, I'd go 14/32/0. Imp enrage doesn't do much. 10 range every one minute. Personally I go for https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZE0zsfddtV
---
   
---
  
---
People might bash me for going one primal fury and one feline swiftness. To be fair this is the best of both worlds for DPS and tank. You have the bonus rage from primal fury which is better than two pts imp enrage. Natural shapeshifted helps for powershifting for cat regardless of having pummeler, it adds a ton of DPS.  
---
Feline swiftness, while great, doesn't offer much when you're indoors.
---
No one said that everyone had everything figured out. Min maxers existed and tried to push their characters to their limits. I'm sure that person assumed that tankiness for a tank would be more important than threat generation. Also, let's keep in mind that DPS do much more damage in early raids on pservers because of the 1.12 itemization. Healers do more healing as well. Which might shift the onus on threat a lot more. 
---
One thing I will not miss. Interacting with people across the globe. I am sure on their own Europeans are lovely people. That being said I would like my world chat to be something other then angry Euro's shit talking America. Don't get me wrong. I am sure we do it too. I am just saying its toxic and, annoying. I won't miss it. 
---
Ice block lol
---
Fair enough
---
What do you mean, accurate? Private server accurate? With 1.12 itemization? How would people in 1.1 know which items were the best before the changes they received in later patches? 
---
Ally :) Named Cykelskur
---
Overall, yes, Warriors are the slowest. If a very good Warrior and a very good Paladin were to race to 60, I think the Warrior will be quicker.
---
I wont bash you. You bring up a good point 10 rage/minute plus cutting my armor a ton doesn't seem all that great.
---
I likely wouldn't do 1/2 and 1/2 Id rather get 100% bear rage on cirt. 
---
Also serious question. is Feral aggression that much better than improved armor or threat?
---
Actually, the above poster does seem to think that they had everything figured out shortly after the game released. He said exactly that.
---
Pservers dont have 1.12 itemization, at least most dont. But on classic we will likely have 1.12. The talents are usually 1.12 which is actually important to remember. 
---
Yea lol. Just to be clear I am not shitting on Europe. I am just saying they are a sibling we squabble with a lot and, it's annoying for the "adults" in the car lol.

While leveling, you can heal fine without any healing talents.

MRW I notice the person on the road with a flying mount: [https://i.imgur.com/4R8wnZP.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/4R8wnZP.jpg)
---
This is a video from guys playing BFA.  Note their commentary: they're annoyed at a mythic titanforge with leech they randomly got from a mythic 0 (aka for those not playing retail: an easy max level dungeon) because "I will literally use this for the next 6 months, and I got it in an m0."
---
One of the biggest complaints about itemization in BFA is the fact that it's so random that it feels like a slot machine.  Run same dungeon over and over again, get same item over and over again, but hope it randomly gets upgraded like it did for this guy.
---
But the other complaint, that this item is *too powerful* for how easy it was to obtain, is highly relevant to classic.  Items that can be obtained in easy 5 mans are in many cases better than raid items.
---
I definitely leaned toward the #nochanges camp until I started playing on a pserver which doesn't have progressive itemization and the overpowered dungeon blues can't be looked over.  They're just too good.
---
If progressive itemization is enabled, it solves the item progression problem in the short term but creates another meta.  Some items will be horrible in 1.0 itemization but then get buffed later.  Other items will suddenly become available around Naxx time which will be obtained from dungeons like BRD and be *better* than your epics from BWL.  That doesn't feel very good either.
---
I'm not sure what the best solution is, but it's a problem that needs to be solved IMO.
---
So I'm out of the loop. Is Jaina a Daemon prince now?
---
&gt; let's give the spiritual attunement" sure,   but now holy paladins can reach that and illumination and have even wonkier mana return than before "Oh shit, well switch it with a later tier ability like reckoning so it doesn't stack" Great, now Rets can go deep retribution and still get reckoning bombs, making them even burstier in PvP. "Oh fuck *1000 fixes like this later*" 
---
I could also only mention the worse examples ever, but I don't have the same energy as you. You just are being ridiculous there. You can put spiritual attunement high enough (and even without moving anything?) so that you can't reach it in other specs. There are many scenarios where that would work. But again obviously you took a bad example to show a wrong point. But whatever.
---
&gt; Okay so you managed to fix talents, but there's still the issue of gear, all raiding gear is tailored towards protection warriors, not protection paladins. "Well so let's add new gear for them 
---
No. Admitting you give prot paladins the mana recovering mechanics, the taunt from TBC, you don't necessarily need gear to fix let's say spell power/ threat. You could for example just improve righteous fury by adding a bonus threat based on hp, or str or int for example. That's one example. I've not though about it, but there clearly are solutions that do not require gear  and you don't need to be a genius to think about it.
---
There. Nothing else touched that talent tree. Now you can use most warrior gear available to tank, and do it well enough. You will still have weaknesses compared to a warrior, less panic button, slightly less overall threat on single target, exactly how ret and moonkin do a bit less dps than pure classes. But now at least it's viable, like feral tanking. And as feral tanks, paladin will excel in their own situations.
---
And all of this at its own scale could be done on other offspecs as well. But the prot paladin is the only necessary one in my opinion.
---
Quit being so hostile and so hasty to prove a point with such bad arguments.
---
you were a rogue or warrior? lol its been like 8 years 
---
&gt; yet some people down voting the post to stop this conversation from happening .
---
People are down-voting this because you aren't the first person to bring this up. You aren't bring anything new to the table to be discussed. You are also wanted to bring the newer era of WoW back into what was a completely different game. People have had about 1.25 years to talk and discuss this. The anti-change group are done discussing it because the pro-change group can't provide anything new or valid as a reason for it. Brian Birmingham already said " ...if you want the modern balance changes, we have those in Battle for Azeroth."
---
gib monis ploz
---
With how cluttered and ridiculous UIs are in WoW nowadays, it was refreshing to see such a simple setup. I can’t wait. 
---
Show me the best you can find. 1.1, 1.12, whatever. Some things arent really going to change between patches or servers.
---
nah, typical uninformed side commenter
---
the difficulties of vanilla wow (organizing and gathering 40 competent people with all their shit together) isn't affected by farm. Naxx is an incredible challenge to overcome. 
---
And no, you won't be in one of those 'really good guilds' because they don't fucking exist. Unless you dedicated 18 hours a day to the game you won't be in one of the world firsts, either. Any person who has spent any amount of time on a private server at 60 can tell you all of this.
---
I guess am referrring to the last patch of each expansion (before pre-patch). We know 1.12 is being used for vanilla, there’s a good chance they would follow a similar strategy for BC and wotlk, or even if they didn’t, would at least probably end up there.
---
Not at all, between the significant buffs to the classes from 1.12, and from the improved itemization, along with the fact that we know exactly how all of these fights work, as well as the fact that they are much easier than raids people have become used to, and that they simply were not that hard to begin with, this content is going to be trivially difficult.  I for one do not think that is a good thing for the health of the game, and that they need to be buffed substantially, just to get them to a place where they are challenging to regular players, let alone good ones.
---
Pally actually \^\^ How about you my man 
---
regional servers are one of the best things about classic
---
weekends are such as shitshow on pservers with a large population.  you also have the smelly euroneets who play 24/7 regardless.  looking forward to off peak-hours being a thing again   
---
This is a hybrid DPS / tank build. I've gone over it a bunch to try and get the talents you're mentioning. The problem is, you can't get 100% bear crit without sacrificing hotw, savage fury or fearie fire, all of which increase threat. You could spend the one point in feline in armor or threat talent, but you HAVE to spend it in lower talents to progress. Feral aggression increases fbite by 15% which Is super important for feral DPS. Please keep in mind, this is MY feral dps/ tank build. This is what I've found to have Max DPS as a cat so people don't pick on you and have decent threat talents as a bear.   
---
I would definitely prefer to have Max best crit talent tho
---
Any reasons why? Mage is one I’m really curious about.
---
Levelling: Spirit Tap. The effective HP/mana regen you get over the course of levelling is absolutely insane, and levelling a Priest without this talent is nothing short of torturous.
---
PvE: Illumination. The amount of mana gained by this talent is absurd, to the point where the only real difference between a Paladin healer and non-healer is the question of whether they picked up this talent or not.
---
PvP: Very tough question, as for one the question is what is "most valuable". In terms of sheer fight-winning-potential the victor is unquestionably Preperation/Cold Snap, with Preperation edging out just a little bit IMO. However, they are in the end 10 minute cooldowns and so many fights you'll have to do without them.
---
Honorable mention to Presence of Mind/Nature's Swiftness. Both Balance Druids and Elemental Shamans are better off going 30/0/21 instead of 31/0/20 because of it, and needless to say that PoM builds dominated vanilla WoW for a long time and are still powerful.
---
As for non-ability talents... I can't call a victor there. I think every class has some invaluable PvP talents and it's impossible to give a fair comparison. For Mages I'd have to say Improved Counterspell. For just 2 points the benefit is absurd. Shatter is a build-defining passive as well.
---
I don't care about this enough to look for it. I'm still convinced that as soon as people got loot tables, they looked through them and knew what gear they wanted. Hell, I did this as a noob with atlas loot when running low level dungeons. 
---
That's essentially what "BiS" is. I'm not saying everyone was 100% right, but that's not my point, getting 95% out of your class because you didn't consider one talent or undervalued/overvalued a stat is still theorycrafting. 
---
Resto shaman talents in vanilla are actually pretty lackluster. You could easily get away playing/raiding in any spec and heal without anyone knowing otherwise!
---
Gonna second both of these things. Quick dagger plus flametongue with shield is nearly as much damage as 2h WF while also being more consistent, significantly tankier, and better in world pvp. Sure you don't get the random one-shot windfury crit moments against some mobs and cloth classes but you also never get the miss once and take off a quarter of your health in the time between the last swing and the next moments. It helps to have the 2h option available though as sometimes the weapons available to you are better than the daggers available (don't miss out on some nice staves either, there's functionally no difference between them and axes/maces). 
---
Also, I'd suggest just making sure you have an alternative set of gear that focuses on having lots of int for healing dungeons just to make them go smoother. You don't have to invest lots of effort into getting it, but if a quest reward, green, or dungeon drop is available that makes you better at healing shows up then grab it like you would something that makes you good in the world for melee.
---
The only time you may need to put points into the resto tree to heal is essentially at the end game dungeons like blackrock spire, where you may just end up running them loads of times for pre-bis and level up by doing them instead of being in the world anyway.
---
Until they realized that was the first step in the loss of community.
---
No. It was more like getting 60 % put of your vlass because ypu arent considering leather pn a dps warrior or cloth on a pally.
---
You will have no difficulty healing without being resto spec until level 50+ dungeons. Even then you could get away with it. Much more important is stacking as much int as possible and to a lesser extent spirit so you have the mana to heal.
---
Also your warrior friend doesn't need to go prot, it's a small boost to tanking ability but a big decrease in leveling speed.
---
How about Ormen with the slutmog?
---
Hawthorne - the op - in defensive stance with a polearm in full t0.5
---
Consumables on the bar? lol no
---
no buffs - ~~possible he was revived, would explain the healing too~~ confirmed he was dead and revived, according to the combat log
---
Scaley with a macro that does a shoutout to their healing target (??????)
---
that's all I can seem to gather
---
Yeah but if you make a hunter use nightfall then why did they even bother being hunter in the first place. A warrior can do just the same as them by spamming hamstring.
---
&gt; why did they even bother being hunter in the first place.
---
We're talking about end-game raiding. Your question answers itself.
---
What is pathetic and sad is that /u/betamods2 tried to tell me he was done just before writing this, and couldn't even copy pasta my reply right.  
---
Seconded on Illumination.  Especially at higher gear levels with high spell crit, this talent shines.
---
judgejudie paladin
---
The Clip is definitely worthwhile and it does showcase how trash BFA is atm.  
---
However, your point doesn't stand, or make sense, even.
---
&gt; If progressive itemization is enabled, it solves the item progression problem in the short term but creates another meta. Some items will be horrible in 1.0 itemization but then get buffed later. Other items will suddenly become available around Naxx time which will be obtained from dungeons like BRD and be better than your epics from BWL. That doesn't feel very good either.
---
What? The purpose of those items is to help people, who started playing later on, catch up. If those items are gated, and are introduced later on, the issue is resolved.  
---
The only concern is that Blizzard will release the game with these items in from the start, trivializing the first few raid tiers even further.
---
i feel like ranking is going to be a lot easier with just NA
---
lore wise? The battle for Theramore drove her insane, or smth like that.
---
If anything, you can trust Blizzard to make good class balance and gameplay. I've made this point before if you want to dig through my comment history, but just looking at http://www.simulationcraft.org/reports/T22_Raid.html to check PvE DPS balance and https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/ class guides, you can quickly tell that the current wow has much better class balance as well as much more interesting gameplay. 
---
You can get away without respecing Restro, at least early on. You however still need an INT geared set. 
---
Yep. 1 talent point investment near the bottom of the tree that makes a warrior uncrushable and uncrittable by almost all bosses. Pretty insanely good.
---
Back in the a lot of people were also rushing to 60 as fast as they could. Obviously they weren't as fast as people are today since they, as you said, were lacking the information, but saying most players weren't even aware of endgame is just ridiculous and wrong.
---
He agreed with you.
---
There will be a lot that will for sure. Private server players are inherently more hardcore.
---
There will still be millions of people that will take their time to get max level.
---
You underestimate how stupid the general population is.  Most people won't simply faceroll content from BWL onwards.  
---
I think the items should be released in a 1.12 state, but that endgame content should be balanced around having them.
---
I'll be playing a shadow priest. In Vanilla my first 2 characters were a prot warrior (18 days game time) and holy pally (14 days game time).
---
I leveled a shadow priest from 1-60 on Nost and I think it was 8 days. In addition they are very fun in PVP which I know I'll be doing a lot of since I'll be casual. 
---
I’m dumb.

Scatter totally changes the class.  It's obnoxious.  Although as far as " talented abilities that feel like base abilities" go, tactical mastery is a big one as well.

Is t2.5 with t2 really better than 3pc t2 mixed with all the other bis off pieces? Wild growth, salamander legs, pure thought boots, don Rigoberto’s hat and that robe off fankris I can’t remember
---
I prefer one difficulty with different dungeons with different difficulties, rather than fewer dungeons with 2 difficulties (or in the case of retail, like 20 difficulties for dungeosn, and like 4 or 5 for raids).
---
I much rather prefer the "RPG" progression where you progress into new places as you get stronger, not into the same place you have already been with + HP/damage and 1 new ability per boss. It seems a bit lazy to me even tho "it keep the content relevant", altough not in a good way for the longest time on retail where the "normal" lower dificulty was harder than the joke that was "heroic".
---
Slow gear progression and actually having BIS lists where some dungeons can be very good for a long time will always keep them relevant, people are farming all 50+ dungeons forever in Vanilla, either for good gear procs, money, profession resources etc.

---
I invite you to look through a couple of class guides, especially DPS, from [here](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/). 
---
Classes can do balanced damage/healing without losing their identity. Balance does not necessitate homogenisation. Of course the easiest way to balance is to make everything the same. But that's not what Blizzard did. 
---
😂😂😂😂
---
there was this one swedish guy who was going to pay me 100g an hour to rank his character when he sleeps. all he did was rank and play 16 hours a day and somehow he had all this gold
---
on private servers ft weapon always did a lot more damage on fast daggers then it should have. at least according to the tooltip 
---
It seems to me that the intent with Classic is to provide a "Classic Vanilla WoW" experience.  Everyone arguing about balancing and 1.12 etc. seem to be missing the larger point.  
---
Think about it this way: people who are into classic cars - if you compare a 67' Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500 to a 2019' Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500, the 2019 absolutely destroys the 67' in every possible performance metric imaginable.  But that isn't the point, is it?  People still lust after the 67' because for all it's faults, for all the modern tech it's missing, it is all about the ***experience*** of owning and driving one.
---
Vanilla WoW might be a better game with some minor (or major) tweaks, and Vanilla WoW might not even be what the devs intended at the time when they made it, but that isn't the point is it?
---
A positive thing is being able to play on off hours and grinding etc alone without people being everywhere 24/7.
---
Yes, but it's kind of expected that people will be hitting 60 faster and more smoothly the second time around.  That was already the case when people started leveling alts in vanilla.
---
You're actually not forced to interact with the outside world. Off the top of my head, classes that can farm gold in instanced content: warriors healers mages priests warlocks rogues hunters. I just realised that I listed every class. DM T with stealth classes, DM E jump runs with warrior/healer DME lasher farm for mages and priests, princess runs and ST runs for hunters and warlocks. 
---
When I reached 60 on a pserver with my priest I almost never saw any wpvp anymore. Simply because I wasn't running around in the world for hours. 
---
Absolutely this. 
---
Gnome for alliance because int boost
---
UD in PvP because WotF
---
Troll in pve for berserking and regen I guess?
---
My hope is that they'll leave things alone until Naxx, and in a few years, when all the content is out, they either release classic tbc which solves the issue, or release horizontal content for classic wow including class balance fixes. 
---
Yea the instance farming definitely sucks. But you do have ro travel through the world. Oh well better than nothing. Sure hope they nerf the farming, personally

I haven't really thought about rogues. Are they good at surviving in situations where they may be out number i.e. 1v2 or 1v3? I'll be able to spend a lot of time learning the class, gearing it, learning bis etc
---
&gt;I disagree. There weren't significative QoL added in Classic. Outland and flying is not QoL, the sad part was that the leveling and many raids were located in outland, and therefore Azeroth was not the center of interest anymore, but it's still content in itself, not QoL related.
---
I think flying (altough some content was specificially designed for it) was a massive QoL change, Shattrath city was a massive QoL change (portal to everywhere basically, no need to travel a lot).
---
Other constitutes things such a summoning stones for warlocks( can't remember if this was wrath or TBC), or the summoning stones  outside of dungeons. Food tables, 1-60 rework so its much easier as a solo experience.
---
But the biggest problem as you said was Outland in itself. A tiny continent compared to Azeroth that more or less made Azeroth mostly obsolete, and people were mostly stuck in a tiny place instead of spread out across the world.
---
&gt;There wasn't an auto teleporting mechanic for the whole group in dungeons and raids. PuG wasn't on command. There weren't microtransactions.
---
Classes were pretty good, but definitely more homegenized than in Vanilla, specifically for hunter/warlocks who just turned into standard DPS classes as opposed to more of a utility/support role. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a change non the less into more traditional roles.
---
and for the balance, I think TBC is a fucking wreck in terms of faction balance, where Horde with pallys is just far superior in terms of racials, and thats the worst it has ever been. And you can also see that from every TBC private server that it will be 60/40 h/a  if its enforced, because Outland is a tiny continent and people want to min-max, and be able to play without being dumpstered by people with flying mounts.
---
&gt;And of course PvE and even quests/rep were super good imo.
---
I agree, I think PvE in TBC is amazing (pre welfare epics that is). The overall progression structure of TBC is amazing, but I still think there are a lot of downsides to the expansion that makes me like it less than vanilla.
---
Laughs in rogue
---
all sorts of cc resets it stacks same with switching weapons. 
---
I wouldn't take that as a promise for no change occurring ever. In the event that Classic becomes hugely popular, Blizzard will pretty much inevitably take actions to retain the playerbase. There's tons of options for that, I don't know what they'll do, but I'm sure they'll do something.
---
The only way that I see Blizzard sticking to their guns with regards to that quote is if Classic doesn't see much success.
---
I was under the impression that catch up items were bad. The purpose of the Classic servers are to allow people to progress in the Vanilla state, not to skip most of the content for the end game. That's what Blizzard started to do that ruined the game, catch-up content &amp; end game based content.
---
Second point is arguable, because for some reason everyone ignores earthbind kiting. It's arguably better than hamstring kiting, which is a staple for warrior speed leveling. If you are earthbind kiting, you are far better off with a slow 2h weapon so it's easier to kite and you take less damage.
---
She's not. There's a popular joke about Jaina being a dreadlord as a result of how she did a complete 180 after Theramore got destroyed. Now she's just trying everything in her power to get the Alliance to full-on destroy the Horde. It became such a meme that Blizzard even made [a skin in Heroes of the Storm](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/349/729/large/dan-pingston-dan-pingston-jaina-hots.jpg?1512166221) for it, which is what that image is fan art of.
---
Can't wait for Deep Wounds, Impale, Axe Mastery! Classic can't come soon enough!
---
So change all items to their last iteration. Then try to balance content around those items? Why not just use what has been proven to work in the past?  
---
That aside, I don't think anyone believes that Blizzard is going to add progressive itemization, no matter how much we scream at them. In part because we can all see the state the company is in atm, but also because the bigger issue is their bullshit 4 stage progression plan with DM and world bosses at launch. Not having those on launch is a much bigger deal, than trying to figure out which version of BRE we should get.
---
I'd hate to see catch-up items in the game. They serve no purpose in Classic. 
---
Wotlk up to BFA flourish in Catch-up mechanics &amp; gear just to get you to the latest raid. The original intent &amp; experience in the game was to progress your character from easier to harder content. To skip ZG, MC, BLW, etc is blatantly stupidface.
---
I think its a toss up between Improved Eyes of the Beast and Improved Firestone. How many other talents double the duration of a spell or increase your melee damage by 30%?
---
People also thought warriors could only tank and were raiding in Arms specs. There may have been a few people who knew what was best but that information wasnt readily available.
---
"faster" is a relative term. 
---
90% of the people talking about how they are going to rush to 60 in 2 weeks time are going to hit a wall at the half way mark somewhere between 35-45. 
---
It takes an absurd amount of time to hit level 60 even if you know everything there is to know about the game and it simply isn't fun for most people to play that way. 
---
Not during progression....
---
Horde. Troll in a landslide for PVE on Horde. Undead in a landslide for PVP.
---
Alliance has it easy. Gnome is best at everything.
---
Personal preference on animations is male troll. All my casters would be troll if I could choose my racial. 
---
It says: Ultima Online Napa Valley Kings of chaos
---
Catch up items were put in the game for the people who came in late to the show. You're not going to back to doing BRD arena for Gladiator Chain if you've been raiding for more than a year. Releasing them later on is not an issue, in fact, its actually beneficial, as it provides options to new players to get in the game, instead of feeling like they're too far behind. Getting those items at launch is what the issue is going to be.
---
I disagree with most of your points to be honest. It's incredibly boring when every best in slot item is from "current tier" and finding and thinking about which items are best from all the varied locations is part of the game itself.  
---
"Other items will suddenly become available around Naxx time which will be obtained from dungeons like BRD and be better than your epics from BWL. That doesn't feel very good either."  
---
To that in particular I think it feels good, it means you have an excuse to do some 5 man dungeons again and you can actually farm a quick upgrade and look forward to your other upgrades in the new tier.
---
it does, knowing more about things you participate in, like why night elves fight orcs in ashenvale, or who ragnaros is, makes things more interesting  
---
Yikes you have smol brain.
---
Sure, you can choose to be a crappy warrior or a good one.
---
Is that how rose-tinted the goggles are in this sub, we're idolizing early WoW talent trees full of useless choices and single digit %, boring, increases in effectiveness?
---
Replace the meme text with Druid or Paladin and see how well that holds up. . . there really wasn't a choice, it was a false choice at best.
---
You could be effective in your role, or not. That's how binary the original talent system was.
---
The declining state of game play. And people's will to cling to things they love even though they're trash. People rather RP in goldshire than play the game ever since cata... can you really blame them?
---
I think most people would argue that’s why TBC was so popular
---
imo illumination is a great talent but you could get away without speccing it with just spaming major manas/demonic runes. not that it would be advisable but theres other talents that are more vital to a build 
---
Like most classic wow videos. 
---
having played both in pvp (TBC though, but close enough), well... the paladin is a nice and easy to use, sorta peaceful, durable healer. the priest... I'd say they're the spanner in the works, but they're more like wrecking balls, even if specced for healing.
---
"aww, you wanted some rage from hitting me? too bad, honey." "hey, let me get that stamina buff off of you. and that freedom. and while we're at it, how about that ice barrier. oh, you died? how sad." "vanish? no." "hey, I can see you're getting healed, let's do something about that, shall we?" (only applies to troll priests) "we're kinda high up, aren't we? why don't you just *jump off to your death right about fucking now.*"
---
no other class can sow nearly as much chaos on the battlefield as priests and it's absolutely glorious. downside? if your enemies are any good, you are the priority target.
---
One of the issues everyone forgets about progressive itemization is that some items were catch up items and some items were shifted to match the shifting talent trees for classes.  If we don't keep the items that were shifted to match talents trees but however keep the talents at 1.12 than some classes will just be gimped.  People seems to be okay with that but it to me is obviously not beneficial at all.  If they aren't going to look into this than I'd rather have no progressive itemization to allow for all classes to have their correct itemizations.
---
good point, I didn't even think about how much people would harass someone for being on a blacklist these days
---
Hearing someone rage on discord is so much more fun when they have a heavy accent you can barely understand.
---
How about https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVboZxhhsfrdtV
---
 
---
&gt; But i dont want to play as Dwarf :(
---
the troll master race welcomes you.
---
It is worth listening!
---
Laughing Skull represent!
---
As harsh as this might come across, I'd say it's mostly true. The exception here is probably some mixed meme builds that excel in very niche areas and are lackluster in most scenarios.
---
You're absolutely wrong. The purpose of the Classic Servers are to keep the game in a permanent state. Why the hell would you need catch-up items in a game that doesn't progress? Your point rides on the incorrect fact that this version of the game will be finite.
---
Sithe, night elf hunter.  I was briefly in the guild during BWL progression until I rerolled on a fresh server, Staghelm, to be a warrior MT.
---
The uncrittable comes from Def Cap, not from block. The block only pushes crushes off the table. Atleast that is my general understanding.
---
&gt; Let the humans begin their hearth in ZF before attacking them, that way you only fight the one who actually matters and save time.
---
What humans in ZF?  The event ones?
---
Agreed, I'd prefer 5 or even 6 patches. I'd like to see bwl released separately from zg. I like the idea of having a 20-man introduced later so that guilds can catch up, and complete pre-existing contentthey strggled with. Zg was a great way for my guild in vanilla to gear up a couple undergeared players and progressed further in Blackwing Lair. Introducing them together will clog raid day and make BWL seem less demanding. 
---
Not everyone is super focused on end game content. Private servers probably have a larger ratio of hardcore speed levelers. They want to get capped and experience raids while they're fresh, and want to get as much done as they can before the server is either shut down or becomes embroiled in some scandal that kills the population. Classic should bring back a lot of casual players, so I wouldn't worry about everyone rushing to cap.
---
1 shots happen for sure mate.
---
There's more than one way to play and enjoy the game. Not everyone cares about raiding and raw performance. 
---
I'm not saying Vanilla talent system is perfect, but IMO it beats the hell out of modern WoW's system. I never met anyone who had my exact Hunter spec. It wasn't optimized for PvE, but it was perfect for my PvP playstyle. I find less room for creativity in PvE speccing, in PvP there is a lot of choice in how you want to play.
---
That fist picture really drives home how immersive vanilla was. Walking through Elwynn and seeing someone on something as rare as a Swift Zulian would make you stop dead in your tracks. Seeing a higher level character on a mount felt cool as well, because that's exactly who you wanted to be one day.
---
It's sad how this is just gone from the game.
---
Modern WoW can't be saved. Let it die. Post this on the WoW reddit so that they can ignore you.  All these streamers are also a joke. They designed the game around them, they put in stupid crap like queues and made everything minigames so they could stream "content" and then they complain. They are the ones who helped ruin the game, especially people from guilds like Method. I don't want to hear anything from them if they are still playing it, making money off it and if they are used to help in design as Blizzard has stated it does with streamers. 
---
Why even release Vanilla WoW? An old and boring game.
---
The spirit of WoW is alive, BfA is awesome! Why stop at Vanilla? They should just re-release all the expansions in order, TBC to MoP all the way to BfA. 
---
Always Vanilla server would be boring and absolutely no one would play it.
---
classic ret pally has little to do with wrath ret pally. ret pallies (and most other hybrid DPS specs) got most of their fun stuff in TBC, expanded even more so in WotLK, especially for ret. it literally won't be the same class, except in name - WotLK ret pallies had a fuckload of attacks of varying types, while in classic, you put up a seal and auto attack. spare yourself the pain.
---
warrior is a good choice, but as much as I love trolls, for them that class is just a bad choice, along with UD. orc or tauren works perfectly.
---
Lock and load and the stun chance just made explosive shot so overpowered. I played. Vanilla through wrath, and that was the most powerful I've ever felt as a hunter
---
It's not *just* rock paper scissors when warlocks are involved. Mushrooms.
---
Here is a shaman critting 300k in vanilla :D   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAm7jImrsUU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAm7jImrsUU)
---
Youtube footage from pservers today still have horrible, loud music.
---
I seem to remember druids getting huge buffs at the start of tbc and wrath, then getting nerfed both times. My druid arena partner was always pissed
---
The question mark is because i dont remember if anyone beat that :D 
---
I played a mage through vanilla to S5.  Trust me when i say i understand how overpowered explosive shot felt haha
---
I want to level a little slower than the "pack." I want to get my epic mount shortly after hitting 60, and one of the best ways to do that is selling stuff on the AH to rich level 60's. If I'm one of the "first" to hit 60, there won't be as much money going around to buy my stuff.
---
Laughing Skull boys raid Lucifron like no one else.
---
https://youtu.be/9vcdLlBbndg
---
Spot any names/guilds you recognize?
---
This ain't happening on a PVP server. If you think you just do quest guides and level in a straight line? Good luck with that once you hit STV. If you are slow initially, Ashenvale will be a warzone as well, Desolace will be a warzone, Winterspring will be a warzone, Felwood will be a warzone, Ungoro will be a warzone.
---
Now if you are playing on a PVE server? You are wasting your time. The first two tiers are nerfed to hell and back. You have no raids close to real Vanilla until AQ and no real raid until Naxx. Since most people never clear Naxx you are looking at all that time spent for one raid.
---
TLDR. Play on a pvp server. It was called world of WARCRAFT for a reason. You are playing half the game on a PVE server and after nerfs, not even that.
---
Wait... they put selfie cams in retail WoW?
---
Just release a non-ruined version of Classic WoW so I can forget about everything Activision Blizzard shits out from now onto their eventual dissolution.
---
I play on a pserver with a very competitive community, and there are *still* people on there taking their time leveling, seeing all the dungeons and zones, and even complete noobs that don't have any information.
---
Sure, there will be more knowledgeable players than retail Vanilla, but people are underestimating how much casual play (or noobs) there will be. 
---
Or people that simply want to stop and smell the roses, the actual best way to play Vanilla (or Classic) WoW.
---
Me neither, plus there would be absolutely no point to it when they launch with 1.12 talents anyway. Release everything as is and just gate the content imo. (but so far this seems to be their plan in the first place)
---
Also, people were raiding in Arms and other terrible specs. It was very far from the understanding we have today. There's the classic story of how everyone thought warriors were terrible and then one player showed them how wrong they were and warriors actually ended up getting nerfed because they are so OP.
---
imp heroic strike. omegalul
---
Beastwarrior, I was only around a few weeks when y’all first downed the nature resist boss in AQ40. huhu whatever 
---
Countdown to Classic podcast ep #73 with ex-Blizzard dev Kevin Jordan takes a great look at this.
---
Kevin was in charge of spells and talent trees in Vanilla wow.
---
He makes this point exactly, actually pointing to the Warrior as the best use of the talent tree.  It allowed you to really make the character you wanted to be.
---
(E)RPing in Goldshire has been a thing since Vanilla though. 
---
Are you ignoring my point on purpose?
---
The values don't matter, i'm not a game designer they're entirely made up, the arguments don't matter in any more sense that they tell a story.
---
That story is that each change made has a ripple effect that affects something else, and on it goes. For every one hole you plug another unforseen spring open. Ask anyone working with game design or general code and see if they'll dispute it.
---
A slippery slope, if you will.
---
Well I will be rolling alliance so no orcs undeads or trolls for me haha 
---
I'm going to level my main slow. I'll go through every zone, even if they're just green and grey stuff. Part of the joy of classic for me will be seeing it all again, so I want to see it all. That said I'm not going to burn time on alts or doing every low level dungeon ten times. Which I probably did first time around.
---
You know those gifs you see pop up every so often that show you the scale of the universe? Those which start comparing The Moon to the Earth and then the Earth to Jupiter and then Jupiter to The Sun and so on? You know that emptiness you feel in your head while you're trying to comprehend the scale of things in this infinite world we live in? That's the same feeling I got while reading your comment. On the plus side... there's a lot of room for improvement.
---
I feel like it will be pointless to try and explain to you how having progressive itemization and progressive content so that players don't just skip half of the game is not only good for the player base but also for the company.  
---
I feel like it will be pointless to try and explain to you how making sure new players don't feel put off for starting later on or being slower to level up by providing catch up mechanics is good for the player base but also for the company.  
---
I feel like it will be pointless to try and explain to you how people have been playing Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK for more than 10 years on private servers, over and over and over again and if that Classic succeeds this will not be the end.
---
If I were you, I'd get off the internet and go read a book, or you know... a bunch of them. 
---
So much this.
---
well thats assuming you want to do raiding... I was a 4 years old playing on my dad's account back then so you can imagine how flawed my talents were and I was still able to do quest and some dungeons, sure I was not the best but im pretty sure most would agree that vanilla was not about the destination but the journey. I had fun and that is all that matter really. on a final note even in raiding since there was 40 people most would be useless and/or newbies/carried anyway so being crappy or useless pulls way less weight then it does now.
---
Unfortunately it won't be like that anymore. People took under 60's to MC because nobody had any idea what they were doing this early in vanilla. The game had just came out and there were no guides, walkthroughs or video tutorials to watch. 
---
So you had under geared under 60's with crappy specs doing terrible damage, not knowing how to defeat the boss.
---
It was also a really wild time, felt like the wild west where anything was possible and new secrets were being discovered every day. Eventually people wised up and realised that you needed certain things to create a successful raid so fewer and fewer guilds started accepting under 60's into their raid and would actually inspect you for gear as knowledge of good gear was starting to become common by the end of vanilla.
---
The difference comes during leveling where that one boring talents is actually something many of us very much looked forward to. Every. Single. Level. At least we were always improving our character from the moment we hit lvl 10. Yes you're right that at max level you had one or two cookie cutter specs, but I still thought it was fun. If you liked one talent over another you could change one around and not be total shit but in current wow you change one talent and it's a big fucking deal. But now the issue of cc specs still exists alongside a smaller selection AND fewer points AND you get them way less often. 
---
Warrior:
---
PvE: Vanilla. Fury rocks.
---
PvP: TBC for sure!!! 
---
Hello there!
---
Haha true dat
---
Hey I didnt even think of that, good point :)
---
Yeah I totally expect that to happen. We've had over a decade to figure out raiding and min/max and whatnot. I do think I'll have a blast getting 40 people to all down a massive lava puppy, and in the first few months it's gonna be a smorgasbord of newbies and veterans all bathing in excitement! Can't wait!
---
Heeeey fellow pally :) Good times on feenix man, it was buggy as hell but also pretty damn fun.
---
Just keep a half-assed healing set for dungeons.  You'll be fine healing instances until mid/upper 50's as Enhance.
---
The difference between shield/dagger and 2H WF while leveling is very minor.  However the fun factor of 2H WF is HUGE.
---
Those were the most fun raid leaders. I was in a guild where they got pissed if you cussed at all on vent. Noped the fuck out of there quick fast 
---
&gt; So change all items to their last iteration.
---
They're not being changed to the last iteration. The last iteration is the base that we're getting, since it's 1.12
---
Then balance the game around those existing.
---
&gt;Why not just use what has been proven to work in the past?
---
In vanilla, we had no idea what items would be changing or when. Knowing those changes in advance drastically alters how people approach the game. I'm interested in as close to a fair representation of vanilla as is possible, and progressive itemization is most certainly not it.
---
Warsong Feenix? Damn that was my first experience ever playing WoW
---
If you're planning on making a raiding guild then good luck! Competition will be *very* fierce, especially against the private server veterans who know vanilla inside and out. They will be clearing MC before most players have reached level 30!
---
Back when vanilla was retail there was no guides online. Youtube wasn't even created yet. Talents changed patch to patch and essentially nobody did any number crunching. People would talk to each other to get their opinion on what was best and when. 
---
Part of the reason why modern wow is looked down upon by this community is its removal of agency. Day 1 of BfA or Legion you could look on wowhead and see exactly what spec/gear/stat priority was optimal for the most dps. 
---
I'm not arguing that what you said isn't mostly true. Just that you're kind of a dick. Also a few talents points that don't line up with 100% cookie cutter raid spec didn't make the situation into a binary "effective or not" situation.
---
I'm sorry I didn't understand your shitty joke, high, at 4 am
---
Hence why I made the distinction between PvP and PvE. In PvE it's all about sustained damage/healing, and there's not really any talent that provides as much sustain as Illumination does.
---
YOU get to decide what kind of Paladin you want to be.  
---
You could be a healadin, or... or uh....  
---
... uhhhhh hmmmmm....
---
... nevermind.
---
I think players have always done this, as it’s how most of Blizzard’s games were built. 
---
Personally I’ll speed to 60 as much as I can but WoW came out while I was in HS, living in a tiny town with nothing to do, so I’ve already spent a lot of time enjoying the 1-60. Even so much I used to do “level jobs”. So basically I’ll get to 60 as fast as I can knowing full well that life is gonna throw plenty of curveballs. 
---
You don't have to care, no, but that doesn't mean that some talents weren't bad.
---
And while I am more of a tanking fiend, I would rather push more towards armor than the threat. If you get pummelers the threat thing isn't gonna be a problem. You only need one pummeler use to get insane threat on a boss. Bear tanks already have insane threat/aggro. If I were asked to be 2nd OT then I'd go:  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxhxsfrdtV
---
This still gives you some decent DPS as a cat while focusing on all priorities of a bear tank
---
I mean, an attack of that magnitude one could make a case for "Understandable, if not entirely Justifiable Anger" instead of just pure "Batshit Crazy".
---
Still, it **was** quite a departure.
---
I know about that one , but that is a team effort
---
It did late on but I hope they see the error of their ways and dont have them for classic. Queues are better than xrealm.
---
It will take me 6-15 months to hit 60, so you'll at least have company with my casual-ass.
---
It doesn't bother me either way but I can see why some people would rather prefer instances like DM to be released a few months later as DM items are really really good. 
---
Allow 1.12 items as is. Rebalance endgame content to compensate.
---
Progressive itemization is a horrible idea: It adds nothing beneficial that isn't accomplished by rebalancing content, while at the same time being an extra amount of work for blizzard to do, while also drastically increasing the complexity of gearing up characters to casual players. (And not in a good way, in a "hey I thought x item had y stats yesterday, wtf?" kind of way.)
---
I played UD rogue in vanilla, and you’ll be jumping on a lot of healers during bgs to disrupt their back line, so WotF comes in handy quite a bit. If you’re not doing that chances are you’ll be defending flag room and chasing down a Druid, which orc would be better for. So I guess it depends on your play style. 
---
I think it’s widely agreed upon that orc has the most powerful pvp racial in the game, and will probably help you more with wpvp. Orcs are also better in pve. 
---
But undead look cooler :)
---
Wow... that's the biggest crit I've seen. Lot's of prep so isn't practical, but damn!
---
Yeah I too will miss that aspect but it's the price we pay for a legit server. 
---
Another issue for the current game environment is the sim tools now available. We used to rely on the math of a few guys, but now we can rely on a bevy of simming tools that will calculate the optimal throughput for us. It's going to be interesting to see how that affects the meta of Vanilla. Maybe private server folks already experience this. 
---
So, we're only bringing 1 ret paladin for aura damage buff, because they hit like a wet noodle otherwise? Great.
---
"but but muh cookie cutter builds"  
---
\- people who did less dps than me
---
would have to calculate it to be completely certain. Depends if bis or close to bis +healing off pieces for helm/shoulder/chest/legs/boots are enough to overcome cutting -0.4seconds off chain heal.
---
Got a few more months to keep me busy till grind time.
---
\&gt;swap out % increase for more mobility  
---
\&gt;people like you dumbfounded how you are leagues below me in dps meters and bitch at blizzard  
---
go away
---
Umm what?
---
But if WoW Vanilla was being released this year, the situation would be the same as it was for Legion or BfA.  
---
The main reason expansion content lasts less than a month, is that everyone's on the PTR, and by release day everyone knows what to do.  
---
I didn't play BfA PTR, so by the time I was 120 people had already cleared all that was available, and had capped the reputations (my highest was Revered, the others Honored, the Tortollans Friendly).
---
maybe its a flight path?
---
yea the prep is next level insane :D 
---
Yeap, hillarious :D 
---
Pre-nerf reckoning let you 1-shot raid bosses, so...
---
I think you just described hunter. 
---
Which wasn’t til way later. Willing to bet if they don’t have em eventually they will cause people will ask when the same thing happens with hour long queues.
---
It's actually not cheap money. Boxed copies cost alot and collectors cost more to produce. Add to that is hard to gauge interest. (my best buy still has half a dozen halo 4 collectors editions). Blizzard is trying to spend the least possible so they get a return on investment. That's what we want :we want them to make a shit ton of money so they keep going with new or old content, support, etc. 
---
I think you're being delusional. Casual retail players won't stick with classic and it won't appeal to newcomers either. It will bring a lot of private server players back home though. 
---
I'd rather wait in queues than lose the sense of community in PVP
---
Ya Europeans have this weird obsession with comparing Europe with America. We get it you guys are living in heaven and we are all literal slaves and Donald Trump. leave us alone
---
Ya I fell you, I wish I had recorded our Naxx progression as well, those fights with 40 people where the most fun I had raiding in a long time.
---
As a Horde player. The benifits are you get better racials. Also early leveling is better and, easier on horde. The pretty hefty negative is that the horde in classic traditionally suck at raiding. The alliance Paladin and, other racials like fear ward. Make the alliance a way better faction to clear pve content. 
---
This means the average gear score of an alliance player is normally higher then that of a horde. Despite many faulty memories having the horde as being better at pvp because of racials this is not true.
---
While the horde does have better pvp racial. On average the alliance players having better gear and paladins should more then negate that. The reason why the horde won in pvp so much was they were out numbered 3-1 on most servers and, often 5-1. This means that just being a level 60 horde meant you had to choke through a higher skill cap of play. When you are always outnumbered. You figure out what all your abilities do.
---
To be fair it's not that hard to have more players than BfA and I'm saying that as someone who's still subbed to retail. I mean really, it feels like any expansion during content drought these days. 
---
As a city kid, hearing a random in a PUG say "Hold up, I gotta AFK for a sec - I need to chase the chickens out of the house AGAIN" was mind-blowing.
---
Less fun was having to group up with someone with a low ping so that we could actually start the Ring of Blood quest in Nagrand during TBC; that was a special kind of madness. Memorable, but madness.
---
Fix the hair in the top left frame damnit. 
---
You could be any kind of paladin you want! As long as you either want to heal or sit in Stormwind trying to find a group that will take you.
---
Ahhh The Regulators! Which then became VANQUISH under Onslaught. Good to see nostalgia like this. I played a Human Paladin on LS and raided with Novus Ordo/Deus Vox and ended Vanilla with We Down Bosses.
---
Our server was slammed with 29 and 39 twinks. Most BGs were over 75% twinks which made it so much more fun. I had a mage at 39 with a wand that I can not remember the name off hand that hit like a bazooka.  That was fun.   But 29 remains my favorite bracket Bc there were newbs to farm once in a while.  
---
How is not changing items that changed back then an unfair representation of vanilla, but changing the end game content isn't?  
---
I mean, you are suggesting they tune the raid encounters right? Am I wrong? Because what you're actually saying happens to be the exact opposite of what you claim to be interested in.  
---
Or is the issue here your belief that people who know which items are going to change are somehow going to get an unfair advantage over the others? I don't mean to burst your bubble but you're going to need access to the internet in order to play Classic, and with that comes the ability to look shit up. Which I believe, will be much easier then, than it is now when it comes to progressive itemization.  
---
The last option is that you actually want to capture the experience of vanilla. Which, lets be real, is not possible.
---
Most Hybrids - TBC.
---
Maybe take a joke for once mate, it's all fun and games.
---
But that's exactly what makes a good talent tree. If you want another example of this just look at Path of Exile's amazing talent tree (sphere grid style from FFX) and how popular that is now.  
---
Not every point should be a new skill or something huge, you get lots of little mini upgrades/choices, some skill modifications and some big notables (actual skills) all in one tree, just because vanilla WoW is theorycrafted inside and out doesn't mean the design wasn't good and there are a still some optional points in a bunch of builds for both PVE and PVP.
---
Totally understand. I have been doing ample research into this topic but still find myself torn. Racials are arguably the best overall for horde, with humans being the main outlier. Easy early leveling is also something I have tested on private servers and found to be true as well. 
---
We both want to run the same race as well, so what would be the most effective race for hunter/shaman combo?
---
I mostly meant to convey that he intends to tank. I have no idea what spec that will be while leveling haha.
---
You already laid it out.
---
If you wanna play Paladin go allies.
---
IF you wanna play Shaman you go horde. 
---
Everything else is pointless to argue for or against. It's an endless discussion that won't lead to anywhere.
---
Would a warrior leveling be faster if grouped with a rogue?  Or would cumulative eating downtime actually make it worse?
---
Ayyy! I remember PvPing against you guys and Bannana Boys and Sharks with Lazers Pew Pew!
---
Good times my friend.
---
I agree that implemented it poorly. I have my own thoughts on how they should have done it but it's all a moot point now. But even still, it was the most consistent fun I ever had in WoW. I say consistant because world PvP was still king of fun for me ..it was just extremely rare to get quality world PvP. Where as arena I could que up for every night which, in my opinion, made it better overall. 
---
Heresy. It's clearly standing on the ground.
---
Also, I did not download this image for use as a desktop baground, so stop asking me about that!
---
That's far from bis gear, and very far from all damage increasing buffs you can get. It shouldn't be too hard to beat.
---
Good point! Thanks for your input. I guess the issue is I want to play pally and brother wants to horde. So I was hoping this thread could reveal some points to either convince me to horde or provide me ammo (excuse the pun) to convince my brother to roll alliance.
---
MAGE WATR PLZ
---
I think I'm pretty set on a warrior horde side. Not sure on the race, leaning towards orc or troll since I loved durotar and barrens back then. Gonna be a busy area though my God. Having the option to tank and dps is a main reason. Though that's alot of gold/time for re spec and building both sets but that's also fun
---
but i mean maybe in real life the gyrphon doesnt despawn the second you hit the ground from the flight path
---
\&gt;  "Hold up, I gotta AFK for a sec - I need to chase the chickens out of the house AGAIN" 
---
LMAO, As a fellow city kid, I can relate to you there :p 
---
I played on this server in Vanilla (Human Paladin - Branix) Really digging these screenshots, have any more? I almost for got about In Excelsis, was that prior to VANQUISH?
---
That and authentic server caps are going to do wonders. 
---
Alliance?
---
My first thought to this is; How did you stick around?
---
But on second thought, Playing that buggy mess was a hell of a good time \^\^ I guess it comes down to what we had to compare it to at the time. I didnt even feel like it was THAT bad back then 
---
Man this video always gets me.... By the time I saw it for the first time I was a huge noob and have only played alliance this far.... Then I saw this video with all the shamans and the crit and I was like holy shit I gotta play Horde! 
---
Fix the hair damnit!
---
I’ve seen frost mages solo two rogues at the same time so not sure what you’re laughing at. All these Vanilla noobs think they are just going to own everything as a rogue haha. 
---
I bet warriors hated it more. For the first time playing wow, I could burst them down like anyone else.
---
And I still knew people who complained when it was nerfed. I knew it was going to be nerfed after my first week doing arenas
---
Alliance has better quest lines, and better early starting zones (Unless you really like the Barrens). PvE is better on alliance with Paladins at least in raids, I would say shamans are more fun in 5 mans with windfury and chain heal. In PvP Paladins are imba.
---
Well, it was -kinda- like that. It really added some depth to making your character your own, but it did not influence it the way it did on DND for example. If you take a look at Kingdoms of Amalur, that one had it done a tad bit better in a similar way. 
---
I generally agree with the point. 
---
Really impressive!
---
I'm not sure if this counts though, but there was this one time when a pally managed to kill Doom Lord Kazzak with a reckoning bomb... 
---
I disagree. She is freaking epic now. Jaina is the best she could be and we love her. 
---
wow, impressive
---
Ruin. Holy shit, so much power in a single talent point.
---
It it resembles the 2 year game we had? It will destroy retail. If it's Vanilla Timewalking which it appears to be? The hardcores will still have fun for 6 months smoking people with a much bigger gear edge than we had in real vanilla. They they will quit and it will be the last time Blizzard gets money from a lot of people and we get to see Ion and Brack fired for horrible decisions like Dire Maul at launch, wrong itemization, 4 content patches broken servers on modern infrastructure (if that happens).
---
Everything I have seen so far makes it look like it's designed to fail. I am still going to have 6 months of fun smoking casual players and accelerating the time frame Ion and Brack get fired. Nothing will bring me greater joy.
---
Some talents are bad, many are boring, but there are legit choices even now, and back in the day it took creative individuals to come up with some of the builds in the first place that eventually became "cookie cutter." 
---
Even now, the new talents aren't super balanced, there are still plenty of shit choices. Blizzard also keeps introducing new similar systems like legendaries and azerite, because people just like some complexity and choice to their RPG systems. You could literally boil everything down to +damage and +hp because that's all that matters in the end, but it'd be a far less enjoyable RPG.
---
I will miss some people, but I’ve never been keen on having half of the population unable to speak with you. Because, then you have the negatives of a high pop without the positives. If 6k are on, thats 6k people who can gank you or steal your herb, but it sucks when there’s only 3k you can wpvp or dungeon with, or just talk to.
---
I appreciate that everyone has access to some private servers, but I am looking forward to a tight knit community where every person can communicate with you. It’s just a little bit of a downer when half the people you say something to just can’t reply back.
---
agreed on the trolls, they're the sexiest motherfuckers ever to walk the face of Azeroth.
---
how much is the gap, btw, between troll and UD pvp? is WotF *that* powerful for a caster class, someone who generally tries to stay the hell away from enemies?
---
No, large venom sac.
---
They are used to clear poison in aq 40.

Theyre a must for viscidius

I spent so much time fishing the pools outside and in the cave entrance to WC farming Deviate scales to make deviate scale belts for lvl 19 twinks.  It was by far BiS for a 19 to get some agility.  Blood Furnace server was crazy twinked our. The AH was always a great place to make money Bc the market was full of twink goods.  Enchanting pants to get the strength/agility and the +15 agi weapon chants were really hopping too.  At one point I chanted crusader on the AV honor sword like 6 times in an hour.  One dude got it and then everyone wanted it.  Damn Im nostalgic as fuck all the sudden.   When the nerfed twinks is when I quit the game.  I know a lot of other players did too.  It’s been over 10 years and I am ready to camp the gy again in AV.   I ain’t holding no nodes.  Let the newbs get killed over the mine.  I’m after those tasty KBs bitches!!!   
---
Time is yet to tell, it really depends on what build they release. It may be more populated for a time (I certainly would spend awhile until I get to 60), but I guess plenty of players will pop back to modern Azeroth in a little while. I mean, if nothing else, BFA looks stunning in terms of art. WoW Vanilla was great for its time, but if you have an itch for beautiful landscapes, animations and gameplay variety, there are better scratchers for the itch. 
---
TBC with no flying mounts.  That’s pretty much it. 
---
This post is false advertising. 20 k ain't killing a world boss.

---
Yeah, th Kazzak one shot that resulted in a very rapid nerf of the Reck Bomb has to beat this. My understanding is the game couldn't even recognize that much damage due to a software or server limitation, so the single hit was processed over several seconds (notice the health bar "ticks" down on that Kazzak kill).
---
Ugh, I hated that team comp. The #1 team in our battle group had it, and we fought them several times. We would either win a hard fought battle or lose a person instantly and get smoked. The latter happened most of the time.

&gt; You know those gifs you see pop up every so often that show you the scale of the universe? Those which start comparing The Moon to the Earth and then the Earth to Jupiter and then Jupiter to The Sun and so on? You know that emptiness you feel in your head while you're trying to comprehend the scale of things in this infinite world we live in? That's the same feeling I got while reading your comment.
---
I'm not usually a fan of people needlessly flaming others but this did make me laugh.
---
To piggyback on to the reply I just made. I don't see armor and threat talents super necessary for the tier 1 and maybe even tier 2 raids. Pummeler will make up for that. 3 pummlers can be farmed in 15min and that's 9 charges. The original spec I linked will provide plenty of threat and cat DPS for prelim raids w/pummelers without respecting. If I were asked to build more armor then I could go into the armor talent which is the only thing I would debate getting in terms of feral/tank build.  
---
 For the most part you will get some feral talents after you've gotten all the important bear talents, which will just happen anyways, it depends on your guild and position and how much you want to farm for which build you will pick
---
I am pretty sure it was not a thing in vanilla. The first time I saw masking of form was on a private server. I played to rank 11 in retail vanilla, I think I would have remembered this if it was a thing.
---
It's not even a question, progressive itemization has to be in the game to some degree. 
---
Patches 1.10 and 1.11 were an absolute free for all in terms of items added and changes. This shit cannot be in the game from the start.
---
An example would be these cloth healing shoulders off the first boss of BRD that any 2 60's can solo. They are simply too good and trivialize every single piece of pre raid gear for all 4 healing classes.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=22234#dropped-by
---
There are many more items like this that I don't feel like looking up but basically blizzard knew vanilla was coming to an end and just started handing out gear like it was candy. 
---
The itemization changes made between 1.0 and 1.8 were actually reasonable and was blizzard just learning how to properly itemize statistics on gear to be useful. the 1.10-1.12 changes was blizzard giving out catch up gear so new comers could catch up.
---
Dude, I had over 100 days on a lvl 29.  Twink alt of course but still.  
---
I stuck around because I fucking loved it so much. I had so much fun leveling up my Paladin. I did it blind and then when I hit 60 I was like oh shit Ret Pally sucks and I cant heal.
---
So I made a mage got him to 60 really quick, got a decent bit of pre raid BIS, guild was advertising for members to help with Molten Core, I joined it they took me into the guild (Skull n Bones) and we progressed all the way into BWL and once or twice into AQ40 
---
All the while learning how to play Ret for PVP and herb farming. I had a steady flow of money from that to pay for consumables. 
---
Eventually got into Full Blown Raids build (Thanks Obrag) raided a little more into Naxx 40 downed a couple in abom and then eventually stopped playing because I got a part time job at a grocery store and couldnt keep with the raiding schedule.
---
I didnt care that it was buggy and server pop was skewed I had great friends and a guild that got me hooked.
---
The experience is impossible to really recreate, since the majority of what made it so awesome was that it was a new world to explore. Even players that started recently have seen the vanilla world.  
---
Things like item progression, skills updating, and bug fixing is what made vanilla, vanilla.  This time around we will just have new raids / bgs drop when they decide its time for them, but talents and gear will be staying the same throughout. 
---
Classic will be an easy mode version of what Vanilla really was.  
---
That's OK tho, I'll probably still play for a little bit.
---
\&gt;tfw no classic draenei horsecock futa gf
---
Yeah. The GM of the guild who did it actually explained it in a post on youtube a few years ago, so I went and found the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqPQ4SNmx2c
---
"...As stated in the description, the pally's screen locked up when the reck hit, and after about 10 seconds of a locked up screen, the screen unlocked, and and both he and Kazzak were dead. Why the client showed the paladin swinging multiple times, I'd guess it was a client-based toggle of "unit X is now attacking unit Y", which lasted until unit Y was officially dead on the server.
---
And to save bandwidth, I'd guess the WoW servers only broadcast the HP changes of bosses every second or two, rather than sending 500 health updates each second, hence the appearance of it coming down in separate chunks."
---
That is just... crazy. And awesome. 
---
Off-hours  24/7
---
I like that.
---
Horde is my faction of choice.
---
- pvp racials will always make horde the ‘go to’ faction for pvp orientated players. While the paladin OPness in pvp makes up for a lot, you will be more likely to run into problems with ganking in contested areas as alliance. Redridge is camped 24/7 and STV is the hordes play ground. 
---
- Horde cities are aweful, but their small towns are much better placed than ally. They seem to be more conveniently placed near dungeons (sfk, bfd, wc, rfk, rfd, SM), more centrally located in some zones... or like in STV, they actually get a flight path! 
---
- this is an unpopular opinion. I believe the benefits given to the alliance by paladins and dwarf priests, somewhat detracts from the game. It trivialises many raid encounters. Fears, what fears? Threat, what threat? 
---
-horde ony attune doesn’t include the aweful escort quest! 
---
As a fellow mage with the extra good water from the questline, i was the plug and would come to raids with 10+ stacks, I even had the pig and turtle polys
---
Bad at what?
---
LEFT SIDE, MANY WHELPS!
---
Maybe not though.
---
It's also nonsensical.  Everyone aside from the most hardcore raiders goes into even brand new content "knowing how all of the fights work" if they want.  Guides, videos, etc. appear in no time.  And yet the majority of people don't just stroll through current content (well at least they did when I last played).
---
You can try to seduce him with your pally buffs.
---
After all, shamans are all about buffing the melees, while paladins have good stuff for every kind of players, including hunters.
---
Very insightful! I have played both shaman and paladin and have overall no issues playing either. So this kind of information is what I'm looking for!
---
Alliance are stronger in PvE and horde are stronger in PVP when you take into account racial’s + Paladin versus Shaman.  I’d only roll horde if I was a hardcore PvP player or going to be making a shaman. The alliance have way better pre level 30 zones compared to the horde. Horde can be a really boring grind until you get to the later zones. 
---
No, two separate guilds
---
Oh I'm just planning on joining in, not forming or organizing. I have some mythic raiding experience from retail and am currently leveling a Druid on a vanilla server, so I think I'll be mechanically adequate and knowledgeable. But who knows!
---
&gt; Ahhh The Regulators!Which then became VANQUISH under Onslaught
---
Not even remotely true.
---
Two separate guilds, both played on Star Wars Galaxies Bloodfin server (although TR dates back to UO).  VQ players were part of Dread guild on SWG.
---
Both guilds planned to play on the PvP guild server Archimonde, but due to server problems rerolled on Laughing Skull.  Onslaught and others from Dread became Vanquish.
---
In the early days of LS, TR and VQ raided together but were always two separate guilds
---
Vanilla specs were so completely different, both in form and function, than what they are now.  This led to vastly different playstyles and what you could or could not do than what exists now.
---
For starters, there were only a couple of unique abilities per tree.  The rest were just passives.  And the thing about passives is that they can be overcome with gear.  And some of those unique abilities weren't even all that good.  The result? A 21/0/30 "ret" paladin could stack int and be a perfectly fine raid healer.  He has his free crit heal and lots of good passives from the top of the holy tree.  Doesn't have holy shock, but it's necessity is very debatable.  I mained paladin, so my knowledge base is somewhat skewed, but it was also pretty true for druids.  Going 31/20/0 (heavy resto light feral) got you the necessary innervate ability but with the right gear, you could tank/cat dps with friends.  Pardon if I'm mis-remembering where some of these skills were; point remains.  Hybrid specs were very much a thing.  Some talents were just objectively bad and if you dumped all points into a single tree as ANY class, then you're doing it wrong.
---
Now, all that said, the class design and the whole talent tree idea was very poorly communicated to players from the beginning.  Going back to the paladin, prot is "viable" if that means you want to tank dungeons, but IMO, a spec isn't really viable unless it's capable of performing its intended role throughout all of the game content.  So it makes no sense to have a tanking tree if you're going to be cock-blocked by lack of necessary skills and (big one here) GEAR.  So if you rolled a paladin with the intention of tanking, eventually your friends will leave you behind as you get stuck on Teir 0 dungeon level.  Then there were the lol-specs that put things like reckoning builds on the map.  Yeah, a deep prot talent that helps with 2h DPS (?!?!?!) and makes you scary in PVP makes a lot of sense.
---
That said, I do think it's fine for classes to not have all specs be viable in all contexts.  What's not fine is for classes to have specs that at certain (or most) teirs of play are just bad and you would never choose them.  What's also not fine is for classes with more than 1 role to be able to excel in their damage role.  So, nerf warriors.  You can't be the best tanks AND the best DPS.  That's just stupid.
---
They wont do it most likely , its a lot of work for them for a very short time frame
---
Instant gratification microtransaction generation won't have the patience to experience the value of Vanilla.
---
I agree with you.  But I would prefer 1.12 itemization to 1.1 itemization.
---
&gt; P4L picked up anyone worth picking up from TR.
---
Nope.  TR continued into AQ and also into Naxx
---
Don't forget that backround artwork as well 
---
Just 2 man it all from level 30. Pay 2 lvl 20-30 healer in hillsbrad to come assist you and youre good.
---
The elemental part can be long but the drop rate isnt too bad.
---
I agree they shouldn’t arbitrarily change the stars of gear, but they should release gear based on what raid patch they were added.
---
Spriest and Lock are some of the harder matchups. WOTF helps where you are weak. The gnome racial helps in mage mirrors and gets you out of a shatter combo and level 1 blizzard is pretty much as good as perception. Bind it to the S key.
---
If you really love it though I would say play it. This isn't TBC where you are FORCED to play a class due to a stupid minigame that was never and never will be balanced. Just make sure to have engineering for the shadow reflector. A good mage is going to beat most classes with no racial at all.
---
Thanks for the guess pass.
---
Yeah I hated the amount of burst+CC in the opener, but even if you survive it they could drag the game out doing it over and over again. 
---
In one on one pvp the horde have better racials. In group pvp the paladin out classes the shaman so hard I don't think you can argue horde have it better. (serious caveat most paladins don't cleanse. so this is not normally noticed.)
---
To be very clear. I am not saying shamans are bad. They can 1 round people and, do a lot of amazing things but, guess what. So can every other freaking class. The Shamans not bringing a huge game breaking mechanic to the fight a paladin is. That game breaking mechanic? Mutha Fuxen cleanse. The horde have only one class to dispel harmful magical effects in the priest. 
---
This means if you get sheeped, feared, trapped.... ect. You only have one class on your entire faction to heal your boo boo's and, most won't. I can not even remotely impress upon you how big of a deal you will be. If you convince your brother to roll Ally and, cast cleanse a lot on your paladin. You will be a god. People will fall to their knees and, praise you. No one likes to be a sheep after all.
---
Isnt reckoning multiple hits like windfury? I think this shaman had the biggest crit number in vanilla :D The paladin is still impressive and hillarious :D 
---
The illusion of choice makes the old talent tree better than the newer one a bit. But I must say, they are both meant to be quite different in the end. The older one is meant to be used all the time (respeccing costing more and more gold and no dual/multi speccing back then) and the new one is meant to be changed depending on the situation. I remember changing my talents as disc priest in arena just depending on the comp I was facing and in different dungeons etc. Both have their ups and downs, but this old one just seems more interesting and rewarding. Huge part of it being that you get to spend a point each level (up from level 10) unlike nowadays.
---
Sorry for a wall of text and the unorganized sentences. I'm a bit tired and have a headache.
---
Out of curiousity, what buff is he missing? :O
---
What point are you trying to make? 
---
I mean I recently commented something along these lines, but I think us fellas here will account for a big portion of the Classic playerbase (that will remain after initial hype month), so there's still a chance some of us will meet each other again, depending on what nicknames we pick, of course.
---
If we all agree to roll on the first 5 realms from top to bottom, for example, it could increase the chances :O
---
&gt;Actually, the above poster does seem to think that they had everything figured out shortly after the game released. He said exactly that.
---
Quote me on where I said that. Lying doesn't help your argument.
---
Wouldn't be a WoW video if it weren't for terrible music.
---
That would be perfect for me on east coast as it gives me more time to make sure work and dog are taken care of before raiding.  Saved your post for the future! 
---
I've never flown in an airplane and I still know how it works. I was still a gamer and an MMO player during that time.
---
It's a simple fact that there were BiS pieces back then that weren't max level. It's another simple fact that it wasn't difficult to determine what was BiS.
---
While I would usually agree with you, that hybrids need some love, talents are nice the way they are and allow for many hybrid builds that are VIABLE however not optimal. I'm starting to think they just need to add a end talent to each hybrid DPS tree that came from tbc. Mostly Mana Regen stuff
---
"When you want to be it" Well no not really.. respecing was expensive and could only be done at trainers.. You couldn't just switch from Fury to Prot in the middle of a raid.
---
Yep. Classic WoW was not at all like modern WoW. It was more like other older MMOs. There wasn't a huge margin between pre-raid gear and end game, top ilvl gear. It's similar to how Guild Wars 2 works.
---
Lakeshire is going to become this, on my server.
---
100 % of the time? No way in a million years. But I believe there *will* be a point where more people are playing classic than retail. At a time when Classic is booming, maybe WotLK just launched, and when retail is struggling, maybe the new xpac Corgis Unleashed is having a content drought. But concurrently? Nah...
---
Tell me how elemental mage or 30/0/21 elemental shamans are memes in PvP.
---
Do consider 5 points resto for the Healing Wave casting speed. That's quite a big deal, even for soloing.
---
Show me then. Show me where someone could find this information in 2005. 
---
This is why I'd rather have official BC, prot paladin was viable and ret was still kind of a meme but somewhat usable and slightly less for Horde.
---
This has been a criticism of every younger generation since the dawn of civilization. Probably before. And it's always been wrong. A fair number of those same "instant gratification microtansaction" kids still play and fall in love with chess every year, despite how old it is and how much investment it takes to really master.
---
I don't agree with the OP's prediction of a flawless victory for Classic, but I think her/his pie-in-the-sky idealism is at least slightly closer to the truth than the nihilistic doomsaying about "kids today" that afflicts every generation once they hit 30ish.
---
All else being equal (i.e. marketing to make sure people actually know about the game and positive word of mouth from happy players), good game design will draw people in and keep them playing. Vanilla WoW, for all its warts, was full-to-bursting with good game design. I'm confident there will be plenty of teens and young adults who will see that in Classic and appreciate it for what it is, no matter how much Fortnite they've played prior.
---
Proof that the Horde is better than the Alliance.
---
I feel that progressive itemisation should be in, however it should be implemented very well so that you don't run into situations that a piece of gear might be crap at the start so ppl D/E it, or just sell it and then some weeks / months later gets very good and everyone wants it again. No player should need "insider" knowledge to know what pieces of loot to keep because they get good somewhere later down the path. As that will turn ppl off the game in the long run. 
---
&gt;I'm sure people knew what the best items were back then. There were plenty of min-maxers from other MMOs at the time.
---
&gt;There was a beta before launch anyway. It's not difficult to see what the drops are and determine which gives you the most power.
---
I played alliance and huntard vanilla-&gt;mid BC, then mained rogue from then to pandaland, and when I’ve played sporadically since then. 
---
I was absurdly bad during vanilla. So, do I play my long time main, huntard, relive the experience and do it right? Roll rogue, and play my long time main in the original unbastardized game? 
---
Or do I go for a totally new experience and do something like Tauren warrior or shaman? 
---
i played warsong from 2012-2014 heavily. its most popular days were BEFORE tbc came out. got rank 11 i think. did mc/bwl/aq 20/zg tons of times. so much fun. 
---
Ironforge is the place to afk in classic, boy.
---
Abort
---
That correct information about what was "best" was not easily obtainable back then. The guides that were posted were riddled with errors and inaccuracies. That lazily posting google search results without even reading them is a stupid way to form an argument.
---
i reckon it might be (much) larger than retail at launch, or if not larger than retail, it will atleast be a pretty big succes. The question for me will be the retention though, will Classic be able to remain large after 6 months, a year or maybe even 2 years when all the content is out. 
---
You couldn't be more wrong. We didn't have anywhere to share the info, we didn't centralize our knowledge in that capacity. Commonly accessibly lists came after years, not days. We simply didn't really have databases besides Thottbot. No one in most guilds had any idea what dropped where. People heard about a cool drop like Rivendare's mount, with 50 added details of what you had to do (no paladin in group, kill him in under 30 min, not own a mount at all etc)
---
Her character might be better, but her model in retail is fucking garbage, I just feel like vomiting whenever I see how incredibly cheesy the Alliance characters are.
---
Enjoy tier 1 and 2 easier than LFR and a destroyed community where everyone just pugs/sells carries for half their raid and screws them out of loot with the new loot sharing system
---
Change the title of the game to WoW Classic: Timewalking Edition
---
Im personally looking forward to regional servers, rather play with everyone knowing english so when youre out looking for group content and whisper some random guy next to you and he doesnt respond or responds in another language then rip that entire interaction. What will suck tho is loot trading because blizz would rather not have to pay gm's instead we get a terrible alternative. Theres also no rule against multiboxing live pvt servers have. Pvt servers also do progressive itemization, I have doubts blizz will do this because its too confusing for the casuals to keep up with the item stat changes and loot table additions. They want to streamline it so the game rolls out smoothly and more easily to understand is my bet. This will affect the game in getting loot progressively 
---
This is why Arthas went evil. He did nothing wrong.
---
Maybe this is a bad question but what's stopping people from staying on private serves after Classic launches?
---
I’ll be there to enjoy the ride with my friends. I’m expecting it to take like 3 months at least to get to 60, I feel like most people are in the same boat 
---
Sorry but the "illusion of choice" canard is pure BS.  They changed the trees because they had too many hookers and too much blow around the office to spend time balancing anything.
---
There wasn't illusion, there was actual choice.  Not everyone in the world just buys the top rated car by Consumer Reports, because not everyone cares about the same things.  Just because some idiot on EJ claims something is universally "mathematically" superior by .16% on Patchwerk so "choice is an illusion" doesn't mean there aren't other considerations like lag, gear accessibility, encounter variation, playstyle preference, visual preferences, RP, etc. that actually ARE real choices for players who don't exist in an echo chamber.
---
It is actually difficult to determine. Warrior theorycrafting is very complicated because of the way rage works. You think it's easy to determine what is BiS? 
---
What is the better neck for a DPS warrior?

---
I have this experience as well. People that never played wow before playing everywhere. Its great
---
If shield block is up then the warrior can't be crushed or crit. If it isn't up all the time then that's when they need def cap to be uncrittable, but in that case they can still be crushed.
---
What about patch 2.4 ret paladins tho
---
After 40 when you can start throwing remaining talents into Resto 
---
Aahahahah yw yw
---
I'm expecting the birth of my first child July 15th. Can confirm this is probably when classic will release...
---
YOU get to decide where you want to afk!
---
My first child is also expected July 15th. Math double checked. 
---
&gt; I think flying (altough some content was specificially designed for it) was a massive QoL change 
---
That would be true if it was possible in Azeroth in TBC.
---
&gt; Shattrath city was a massive QoL change (portal to everywhere basically, no need to travel a lot). 
---
I agree.
---
&gt;Other constitutes things such a summoning stones for warlocks( can't remember if this was wrath or TBC), or the summoning stones outside of dungeons. 
---
Honestly I don't think it was really significant. Having 2 (or 3?) people going to the stone before being able to summon anyone often lead to everyone going + - at the same time when forming your groups. I don't remember being summoned a whole lot personally.
---
&gt;Food tables, 1-60 rework so its much easier as a solo experience. 
---
I agree. They could have not changed that.
---
&gt;Classes were pretty good, but definitely more homegenized than in Vanilla, specifically for hunter/warlocks who just turned into standard DPS classes as opposed to more of a utility/support role. Not necessarily a bad thing, but a change non the less into more traditional roles. 
---
I disagree. I think this opinion is disrupted by the way people view balance in modern retail. In TBC no one thought like that. I personally found every class fantastic with each one its use. CCs used were different and on different kinds of mobs. Tanking was done differently. Some healer were better in some circumstances but druids weren't inherently suboptimal in most PvE content. This is not what I call homogenization.
---
&gt; I think TBC is a fucking wreck in terms of faction balance, where Horde with pallys is just far superior in terms of racials, and thats the worst it has ever been. And you can also see that from every TBC private server that it will be 60/40 h/a if its enforced, because Outland is a tiny continent and people want to min-max, and be able to play without being dumpstered by people with flying mounts. 
---
I mean I don't see how racials are such a big deal. Racial are not significant enough compared to gear or talents, or have so high cooldown that, yes it does make a difference sometimes, but to the point of complaining? I mean Vanilla being awful in term of class balance is IMMENSELY more important than "racials being imbalanced" in TBC. I am wrong there?
---
But I wouldn't complain if Blizzard proposed to change racial a bit, not to homogenize them, but to make them more balanced after discussion with the community.
---
&gt;I agree, I think PvE in TBC is amazing (pre welfare epics that is). The overall progression structure of TBC is amazing, but I still think there are a lot of downsides to the expansion that makes me like it less than vanilla. 
---
I also think PvE was amazing. Arena had good sides as well. BGs were awesome. But changing balance because of arena and handling PvP gear the way they did wasn't the best obviously. Still, I played PvP mostly to have fun, as many people did probably.
---
The only account I play anymore is my starter account on Moon Guard, chiefly because it lets me be part of Goldshire shenanigans.  That was the place I first rode a travel-form druid.  I once watched a dwarf roleplaying a quest to find his moustache or something.  Reading the godawful RP profiles is fun.  I hired a fortune teller.  I like when paladins come to "cleanse Goldshire".  There's a ton of fun in Goldshire still, more than the actual game offers.
---
There is something to this for sure. I am planning to hit that wall at lvl ~40, but I amso have a plan for dealkng with it ...muahaHahahaHAHA
---
HANDLE IT!
---
They're starting at patch 1.12.1 so this means everything will be in its 1.12.1 form. It seems like their plan is going to be an artificial content gating.
---
Doing it any other way would be an insane amount of work as they would have to build a database for every single patch with every change.
---
Level prot and never die. It'll be painfully slow, but it'll be steady.
---
I agree. Every ArcheAge fresh start server (I think 4 total) concidided with my boss visiting town. When I'll know her schedule I'll report back in. 
---
You mean in contrast to Sylvanas, the unique and distinguished lingerie model? 
---
Those were multiple hits.
---
See, it's subjective. I absolutely hate retail art.
---
What was the worst was being reported for AFK in PvP because you forgot to make water for the group before the match started. Probably still goes on.
---
The modern system is really just 3 specs with one or two options apiece. Barely counts as specializing.
---
Do you like playing by yourself?
---
Horde 
---
&gt; I love interacting with the Asia
---
Sounds like a weeb.
---
It'll likely have a huge initial rush followed by a very rapid decline.  A lot of people are going to drop of real quick once the nostalgia wears off.
---
14 years ago, where that nelf is sitting, 13 year old me payed for a sexy dance.
---
Well, your lack of understanding might be tied to how your logic is flawed. Sure it will have a huge launch number, but that is because WoW vanilla is a history piece in the world of video games. After that it will go down. Probably do well, but not like retail.
---
&gt; original WoW attracted casuals en masse, after all
---
You take this wildly out of context. Back when WoW originally launched there were practically no competition for what they did. Because back then WoW *was* the game for casuals. Not many MMORPG's were on the market, and those out were games like EverQuest, known to be much more hardcore. The WoW devs actually directly *tried* to make a more casual MMORPG, and that is a big reason for it's success. Now, however, there are a lot of competition and a lot of options for players. So you can't really use this as any kind of argument.
---
&gt;  retail is dying and has been for years. Nobody likes it anymore and all the players do is criticize the arbitrary, un-fun new directions the game takes.
---
Because people are toxic ragequitters (that doesn't really quit). Look back at the forums of WoTLK, something most people praise as the best time for WoW (at least in Ulduar). People raged too. Retail is *not* dying and people on forums yelling is in no way any valid way to judge the game. It's like judging Classic by people coming here saying "it will fail, it's just rose-tinted glasses". TBC had doomsayers on the forums too, yet WoWs absolute biggest player number were still ahead of it. Legion were a massive success. BfA have done some things wrong, but for such a large game it's not too late to fix it. It's still an impressive number of players WoW have.
---
&gt; When I compare all this I cannot see how retail will have a player base larger than Classic.
---
So to conclude, all those things you compare are delusional. Taken out of context of time, using minorities to judge the majorities and thinking a toxic forum didn't exist since vanilla.
---
&gt; Classic has everything working to its advantage. Enthusiasm, novelty (lol), a more passionate community, better gameplay, etc.
---
No, it doesn't. Enthusiasm, sure. All new highly anticipated games have that. Novelty? No idea how, I assume it is a joke. A more passionate community? Sure, but Vanilla is built around community, retail isn't. Two different ways to make a game, but neither is wrong.
---
&gt; better gameplay. better gameplay. **better gameplay*...
---
This is laughable. I enjoy vanilla more than retail, but the gameplay is *objectively* worse. Spamming one spell for raids because they literally fucked up mana cost of everything else is not a good gameplay. You might *subjectively* enjoy it more, but it is a worse design. Even the devs says it sucks and they tried to fix it. Currently WoW gameplay is better in pretty much every way. You might personally enjoy the old school WoW gameplay, but it was bad. Like how a car from the 1890s are worse than a brand new "insert fancy new car". You might like driving such an old car, but it is still a shit car.
---
&gt;  for a time people may even forget about retail entirely
---
No. There are probably going to be 3 types of people. Those who likes retail and will only play that, those who hate it and will only play Classic and those who will play both. It's not like retail players are all just waiting to be saved by Classic.
---
The permanence of talent choices also makes an insane difference. 
---
When talents can be changed on a whim super-specialized builds will dominate for any given kind of content (raid, PvP etc.)
---
Generalist builds can only be viable in an environment where changing talents is onerous or expensive.
---
It doesn't stop you from specializing, but your superiority in that type of content will force you to sacrifice in other areas.
---
I can not see your spec as it is banned at my work but, the two biggest things you need for leveling are as you said wand mastery and, the other is the one that makes it so you regen mana when you drop a body. 
---
Having leveled a priest before my normal rotation was always. Vamp Embrace, MindBlast, S Word Pain, and then wand to death. This rotation generally had me killing fast with almost no down time.
---
Something else to consider though. What build do you plan on going at 60. By this I mean I do have some good builds I can show you. To keep you viable in pvp but, still able to farm Diremaul for herbs. It's a type of Shadow Support priest sans shadow form. If you are interested I can link that.
---
Maybe you should, you're assuming those EU players are "angry". Nah man they're just joking, maybe make fun of Brexit next time you talk to anyone from the UK. Like actually join in on the fun, they aren't angry behind the monitor, they're laughing their ass off when they make fun of America and expecting you to laugh back. 
---
I can't tell you how many times I've heard people from EU countries mention how "serious" Americans are. I'm an American who's grown up in the EU and the US and I'd rather live around anyone from a euro country than an American more often than not. Americans just get offended so easily, like take a joke. If you're getting up in arms over what someone says on a private server then you have issues lmao.
---
Unfortunately it is ez to gank
---
&gt;this is an unpopular opinion. I believe the benefits given to the alliance by paladins and dwarf priests, somewhat detracts from the game. It trivialises many raid encounters. Fears, what fears? Threat, what threat?
---
I feel the same way. Blessing of Salvation is such a big game changer. It allows for a much larger margin of error. 
---
I dunno about the erp - isn’t it a bit weird knowing its 90% mostly guys in there?
---
&gt; Because what you're actually saying happens to be the exact opposite of what you claim to be interested in.
---
Saying that I want 1.12 items and the endgame adjusted accordingly is not at all the opposite of wanting the most vanilla like experience.
---
We cannot recreate the exact experience of vanilla, but that doesn't mean that all options are equal, some will come closer to that experience than others.
---
Given that we already have 1.12 talents, and that we would know in advance how items would be changing with progressive itemization, I am stating that I feel the choice that would be most vanilla like is going to be to re-tune the endgame content for the gear and talents that we will have when we face it.
---
Is the alliance guy based off Ragnar lothbrok or am I imaging it?
---
Ya the selfie cam was the first major patch for WoD, instead of a raid tier.
---
Yea, starting wand spec into spirit tap and wanding to abuse 5 second rule (and because none of our spells are particularly DPM effecient anyway) is the plan I've got. It blew my mind when I found out that Mind Flay was, uh, not very good? It's a bit more complicated than that, but it's so iconic that it's super weird for it to be a bad leveling skill.
---
I haven't looked into any 60 planning yet. I intend to do raid healing as holy, but I'm not at the point where I've really thought about it very much yet, and I'm also totally unsure as to how much spec matters for healing in endgame dungeons (where as I know I'll need to be holy to raid heal and it won't matter at all what I'm doing if I want to heal in my 20s and 30s). I'll likely just be one of countless other raid priests full respeccing twice a week, but I am interested in the build your talking about because that sounds like the most fantastic kind of strange.
---
The guild carried on, there was just a good handful of people who bailed/were poached around the same time. I don't know the how and why, I was just a new scrub then. 
---
Really? I thought it was one hit, the GM's theory felt solid. But if you look at the video, even if it was multiple hits (even though it shouldn't be) Kazzaks hp goes down in 4 chunks. Seeing that his HP was 366,410 in vanilla according to https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?npc=12397 , if you divide that by 4 the attacks would do around 91,602,5dmg each (some more and some less maybe). The shaman crit for 25,515.
---
&gt; A slippery slope, if you will. 
---
That's exactly why I'm explaining you in my answer that you could only change balance and not touch anything. Touching balance does not equal suddenly having the right to touch other things that are not in common and are way harder to change / have more indirect consequences.
---
You know we should go back to hell in 1.1, and no change because slippery slope, right? Give me a break. I can do fallacies as well.
---
&gt;I wouldn't mind balance changes at all if Classic weren't (by all accounts so far) going to be a static enviornment. If it were to recieve updates and content I'll happily take class balance along with it, since you then have all values at your disposal rather than a set framework. This needs the development team to show they'd retain the spirit of Classic before it'd happen. 
---
I don't see why it couldn't receive a few changes such as the reasonable ones I discussed with you above. New content or not, it could benefit the game, the same way 1.12 improved the game from 1.11, and the same way 1.11 improved the game from 1.10.
---
they learn what people are in premade on the other faction by playing against them a couple times, then they can either send 1 person in when queue pops to check for premade group or use tools like a 2nd account to watch them on their side type things
---
A negative thing is being completely unable to do anything except at peak hours..
---
Good job using a dictionary/google. Do you understand how monopolies work in a corporation/market share context?
---
This. I love being horde with long queues to :
---
-relax
---
Or
---
-heartstone to kargath and go hunt from there.
---
The old talent trees weren't perfect but they really gave you a sense of accomplishment. Getting a point every level and new talents every two levels gave you the feeling of powering up and being rewarded for your work. 
---
You can't decline that the quality of the animation allows for more detail. I mean, trees are still pixelated in classic. Even if you don't like WoW, you can't decline how good current generation games (Witcher 3, RDR2, HZD, etc etc) look. 
---
Boy don't go using any weapons that are fast, y'hear? If it ain't an axe with an attack speed lower than 3.50, you keep your doggone need rolls to yourself.
---
I played druid in retail vanilla and spent 20g a week on noggenfoggers and deviate delights. 
---
That pathfinding was pretty hilarious in retrospect.
---
Most fun I had on private servers was with my old roommate raiding in PUG Molten Core groups on Feenix. 
---
This was the ONE change that I hated the most. Blizzard totally killed the one rpg element of the game that allowed you to be who you wanted to be. People always argued "but people would always pick the same talents anyways so what does it matter if they streamlined it?" That may be true but it still gave you the option to make your character however you wanted it to be. It also gave you something to look forward to each level up. I remember finally hitting level 30 or 31 as an arms warrior and getting mortal strike I believe? It was awesome. Now the game revolves around getting one talent every 15 levels?! How exciting. 
---
Sleight of Hand for Rogues. 2 points gives 2% reduction to be critically hit by melee or ranged. Not hit, just critically hit. There's increased threat reduction but that's for what, if you have a bad tank? You can't Vanish, or have BoS?
---
Explain how you would put 2 points into that versus anything else in that tree.
---
imma give you the shocker
---
I have never really played a priest, what's wrong with mind flay?
---
Whether or not something is interesting is a subjective matter. Obviously if I found lore interesting, then I would know more about it or wish to. The reverse is true however, so I don't know very much about it.  
---
Hating a certain feature of the game, in this case the Blood Elf race, is another subjective matter, often called an opinion. Yet here you are trying to measure intelligence against a subjective opinion.  
---
Looks like you're the dumbass here.  
---
&gt;The older one is meant to be used all the time (respeccing costing more and more gold and no dual/multi speccing back then)
---
That's something I liked about the old system, you weren't just a Druid you were specifically a Feral Druid or a Resto Druid. You picked a spec and lived as it, not swapping willy-nilly.
---
Sounds inefficient
---
I mean, what exactly is people's motivations to play Classic and start from scratch if they already have a private server they are part of the community on, is my question.
---
Yea there will be a point...launch.
---
Why is this even an image? You could've put the image text as the title instead of the clickbait crap you ended up with
---
#nochanges
---
but
---
Cookie Cutter Builds
---
&gt; builds that excel in very niche areas and are lackluster in most scenarios.
---
It was illusion of choice, mate. There were maybe 2-3 genuine choices you got to make in your tree, but most choices were so stupidly obvious that they're hard to count as choices.
---
Frost mage: do you want 6% hit, or a 10% for frost ward to reflect frost spells? Arcane gets to choose between +10 to resistances or 10% chance on cast for clearcasting.
---
Feral druid: 40% extra AP reduction on demo roar, or reduce the cost of BOTH of your primary abilities by roughly a third.
---
Survival hunter: 3% damage AND 3% crit against beasts, giants, dragonkin OR for the same points, 3% parry on a ranged class
---
Or how about warriors and rogues both having an entire tier occupied by various weapon specialties, where the choice 100% of the time is decided by what current BIS is and what you have access to, not necessarily which one you "want"
---
Or the number of times where you have the obvious PvP option against the obvious PvE option? How many priests take 10% chance to stun over spirit tap when leveling? Or the stun/fear resist instead of wand damage?
---
I understand fully why they moved to the system they have now. By the time we hit WotLK, we had *hugely* bloated trees that had been number-crunched to hell and back, and it was easy to see that each spec really only had 2-3 small options to choose between. The rest was just numbers.
---
And just numbers is *boring*. A talent that gives 5% crit is incredibly powerful, and a total snore to unlock. What players were excited about were the big choices, the big powers, the 21-31-41-51-61 point talents. Blizzard looks at that and says, "every choice should be that fun", but that means getting rid of the boring choices.
---
Of course, they swung wildly too far in the other direction, where you had so few choices that your character hardly felt different from another. Even if you wanted something silly like a tank shaman, there was nothing in-game to support it however trivial. It's a shame because the logic behind the changes was sound, just very poor execution.
---
If only the Darkspear trolls had the broad shoulders of the Amani trolls.
---
Oh well. Still the sexiest race in the game.
---
:/ not as steady as Ret/Holy tho. 
---
And forget about AoE grinding at launch since most mobs are going to be contested. 
---
Right click, go make dinner, ???, watch glorious swing

Low increase in DPS compared to wanding. [Longer math explanation I wrote here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7ifmp4/question_on_spirit_tap_for_priests/dqyq3f8/)

---
You can see here reckoning is multiple hits :) 
---
Not bad but I can't help but feel the 2 points would be better placed in the shadow tree under the reach and resist talents. 
---
It is a bugged griphon
---
Atleast for alliance, 38-42 or so can be brutal. Theres simply a gap in quests unless you've really done your due diligence, and haven't skipped any hubs/chains along the way.
---
Tizzle I want to be clear on this. I have no dislike for Europeans. Almost every European who I have met in a one on one situation has been cool as hell. I also want to be clear that I am not saying that Europeans are doing this to poor ole innocent Americans. I am not.
---
Very often in trade an American will trigger the pissing contest. That being said it still happens regardless of who starts it. Every time I have been on these global servers. It's a small number of American and Euro's starting crap. That being said it still happens and, for me it happens enough to make trade nearly unusable half the time.
---
Europeans and Americans are like two 8 year old brothers in the back seat. No ones the ass hole but, puttem together on a car ride for an hour and, the ass hole comes out in both of them.
---
As far as Americans being sensitive. That is most likely true but, it's kinda hard not to be. When all of your allies start rewriting the last 50 years of your history to make you out to be the bad guy. If I get ranted at by one more European trying to say the US. is evil because we meddle in other peoples elections I am going to vomit. 
---
No one in Europe complained when we "meddled" in east Germany for 50 years. In fact pretty much every time we have "meddled" in another democracy. It has been to stop a pernicious and, evil ideology from taking over more territory. No single country has ever sacrificed more for world stability then the US. It's hard not to be bitter when the only thing you get for that is condescension. All of that also blows past this "world policeman" roll is one we never wanted and, Europe forced on us.
---
Prot Warrior kicked ass in PVP during Wrath. Loved it. Even if I didn't do much damage, I could hold a group of the opposing faction long enough for the DPS to fuck shit up.
---
its not an illusion if it actully impacts anything
---
Except that this created a situation where you literally couldn’t afford to experiment or deviate from the cookie-cutter builds. 
---
Yeah, the ones you fight with on the pyramid.
---
It's a single sub, so playerbase is a moot point as far as blizzard is concerned. They don't care if you're playing classic, retail, or both as long as people are paying. BfA isn't great by any means, but people seem to forget it's still miles ahead of other MMO's population-wise. Classic is going to have a good initial spike, however it's going to be hard to tell how many people are new and how many are already subbed without blizzard's input. It wasn't until wrath that it presented at 12m subs, and we can't assume that 0% of the 7m subs that played vanilla don't play retail. 
---
Yes, there's gonna be a shit ton of people playing classic,  but at some point it's going to stagnate whether it's after 1 month or 5 years. The thing retail has going for it is that each expac is practically a blank slate and as long as there's promising content people resub. Unfortunately, the hasn't been anything exciting to retain subs, but they could learn from classic and (re?)implement what mechanics people enjoy from it. 
---
Was that when Divine Storm was introduced? Cause we don’t talk about those times.
---
From my experience, especially during WotLK, if you were playing a spec, basically 80% of the tree was already decided for you. You almost always HAD to take the 51 point talent, there was some room for playstyle and flavor. But if you had 100 Ret Paladins, there's a good chance that 95% of them had 80% of their points put into the same talents because they were such obvious choices.
---
When leveling a druid is it a good idea to put your first point in nature's grasp before starting down there feral tree?
---
It's even diminished on most servers over the years, in my experience. Moon Guard maintains the status as the de-facto place to hang out in Goldshire for ERPers and trolls. 
---
I know of the tanking guide, I don't know about that cat guide.
---
I doubt I will raid much if at all. And if I do I will do so super casually. MC/Ony/ZG/AQ20 only most likely.
---
I want to get a name for myself on the server as the dungeon king on my server. I want people to know me and when they need an extra tank/dps/heals they talk to me as I am always down to go. Or at least that's the fantasy I have in my head
---
Now that blizzard is directly losing money from private servers, I don't think they're going to be so passive about their existence. 
---
Because when Classic comes out, the person(s) paying for the server space will likely shut it down and start playing Classic instead.
---
WoW is entering an era like music did in the 2000s. Rather than people torrenting entire albums and playing it all from their hard drives, they'll pay for Pandora or Spotify.
---
shit just ran in the air straight to you lol. you can pull enemies from the mines above you and they come through the ground
---
Lol @ Vanilla not being raid-or-die.

When the PvP meta is everyone in Naxx gear auto-winning every single BG come remind me why raiding tunnel-visions wasn’t a huge design flaw of Vanilla.

Small world. Yours is one of the guide's I was using an hour ago!

Do you remember playing with anyone that you thought, damnit I wish I would've rolled that class.  I played Warlock all vanilla, but I had a good friend who was our raid healer, PVP healer.  And fuck did it seem cool to play priest and win duels 1v1 in front of orgrimmar.  Watch some videos, I've posted a few times, but RetroWoW has instant 60 servers to test out pvp and raids (scaled down to 5 man I think).  Watch some videos too on each for pvp and raiding, they're all quite different styles
---
well yeah...the point of those servers is to recapture the true authentic vanilla experience :P
---
Ah joined in 05'/early 06'. I was pretty young then and moved across a few guilds due to scheduling, RL friends, etc.
---
So PvP is a "very niche area" of the game for you?  
---
Elemental shaman is the equivalent of arms for warrior or sublety for rogues. It's the go to spec for PvP shamans taking huge dumps on both resto and enhancement shaman. 
---
Elemental mage is very strong with some gear and is one of the strongest burst specs in the game.
---
If I weren't rolling on a pvp server, absolutely. But I can't imagine not taking those talents right after shadowform (which is admittedly going to be pretty late, like 47 I think?) when I have to worry about getting 1v2'd and needing to heal while unable to CC both enemies.
---
What I liked most about them was that they were kinda permanent. You had to make choices (even if you simply copied a build from some web site). 
---
Today you switch talents constantly on a boss by boss basis. That's like having access to all of them all the time, no compromise needed. On top of that it's exhausting having to alter your rotation back and forth all the time.
---
As long as you have a mage in your group or are willing to shell out for water you can tank 5 Mans (pending you are on the higher end of the level requirements). 
---
As much as I want them to change as little as possible... I don't think many people would complain if they gave the Paladins a hard taunt. But even without it lower level dungeons are do-able.
---
Yes
---
Found the rogue. 
---
Didn't male trolls have some kind of racial animation spin move.  There needs to be more trolls this time around imo.
---
Not taking anger management... ouch, 1 rage / 3 sec in combat can't miss that! 
---
Its pretty much the same thing in earlier editions of D&amp;D vs later ones.
---
Why would you not take certain feats or abilities in 3.5 or PF? What melee fighter doesn't grab Power Attack?
---
Then later all the feats got pared down so none of them were 'necessary' but you lost the ability to go really wild and memey.
---
I prefer nilla talents vs modern ones but the nilla ones are definitely pretty boring and inflexible.
---
Yes, I too would love to prove to people cat/bears are awesome however I don't have the time to invest to be that awesome and I also love playing priest. Personally I'm gonna rock the first build I sent you. For you I would suggest this build which I posted earlier with the 5 in armor and 3 in threat. If you really wanted to you could cut shred and cat crit talents for a primary tank build if you want super smooth dungeon groups: 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxxxscMdtV0b
---
Why 1v2 though? Because your a priest therefore a target? Or wpvp? 
---
I will miss the knowledge that I am playing in a passion-created project. I somehow dread being controlled by Blizzard again.
---
It's possible, not probably IMO, though. That would assume that the highest point of Classic popularity is launch, and it's population can never grow. Sure, there will be a good % of tourists that try the game for an hour and quit, but I think overall concurrent numbers for Classic will be at some point *after* launch. 
---
Say that Classic does enormously well for itself by month 1, there is 1.5 Million people playing. That could very well be over BFA at it's lowest point, but *probably not* when it launches. I think it's more likely that Classic subs will dip, plateau, and slowly expand after a few months to reach 1.5-2M, and during one of those months there will be a massive BFA Dry-spell, perhaps the one due around December 2019.
---
Just think, everyone: if this dude had just gone on his vacation in February, the wait for Classic would have been cut down by like 6 MONTHS!
---
&gt; how do you pirate something which does not exist?
---
For better or for worse the law does not let you pirate something just because the owner chooses not to distribute it. If I make an album and I decide that for business reasons I am going to stop selling it, that does not give you or anyone else the legal right to start copying or selling it.
---
I could see a case that you aren't being a bad person if you play on a pirate server while maintaining a WoW account. It's against the TOS of the client to do so, of course, but you would still be paying Blizzard while you use their IP so maybe it's morally okay even if not legally.
---
&gt; your 10000 people count is not anywhere near reality. 10k is still the CONCURRENT daily number of the currently strongest server. it might be higher, i don't pay much attention anymore. 
---
There aren't that many blizzlike vanilla pirate servers though, and the few biggest account for most of the population.
---
&gt; the petitions Mike Kern brought to Blizzard had a count of 220k.
---
I think a lot of people who weren't current pirate server players signed that. I don't recall if I did sign it or not, I am lazy, but I certainly supported the idea and I thought about signing it.
---
&gt; Nost used to have 130k active accounts and 730k accounts created. 730k people on just one single server who are so strongly interested in classic they resort to highly illegal, pirated servers, 
---
Nost, it seemed to me, was a breakthrough event that got publicity outside the pirate server community in the mainstream media and would have gotten a huge boost of tourists from that. We're both guessing here but I am guessing that 220k (the petition) is a high-end estimate of the number of pirate players who will be Classic players.
---
&gt; these players are in fact the perfect fundament
---
You said it, not me.
---
&gt; the threats to blizzard is a legitimate strategy to save what's left of that company
---
Have you considered stand-up comedy, or perhaps being a Presidential spokesperson?
---
I didn't say I was a min-maxer back then, but to suggest the practice didn't exist is flat out incorrect.
---
Yeah because forums didn't exist at all. Websites about WoW didn't sprout up like weeds. Okay bud.
---
The ironic part about your post is that if it's true that you came up with this build yourself then you pretty much lucked into describing (give and take a few talent points) the only efficient leveling build for priests.
---
So... congrats? This is pretty much the same build *every single priest with half a brain* is going to be running come launch.
---
I mean, I like the old talent trees, but this would be a completely different post if you had described any other leveling build. People would be (rightfully) tearing it to shreds.
---
Yes it was. No one is saying that the min-maxing of today was available back then, but there are people here who are arguing that *no* min-maxing existed back then. They're the kind of people who tend to think WoW was the first MMO and other retarded things like that.
---
I never suggested that people didnt try to min-max, just that they did a crap job of it and I cant find any evidence that pre bis gear was well understood at the time.
---
What about the tons of players that dont like retail wow but loved Vanilla that are also not currently playing a private server? Dont discount what officially sanctioned blizz Vanilla servers might do to that group, people who dont know/dont want to go out of there way for an unofficial private server
---
Oh nice. Good to hear it's still showing up when people search.
---
&gt;they had everything figured out
---
I didn't see this quote in my comments. Now again, quote me on it or stop lying.
---
World pvp. I don't expect to be able to avoid it at launch, so I feel like I have to build around it.
---
http://google.com
---
Im looking I dont find anything.
---
It's classic. Don't let anyone bully you into respeccing twice a week. That is for the peasants who DPS. If you are going to raid as a healer I would recommend making sure what ever spec you go with, include Holy Nova. Its a pretty bad spell. Mega garbage in raids but, for solo play. Having Holy Nova will allow you to AOE non-elite packs of shrubbery in DM. It is the best way for you to farm gold. Seriously though if you are gonna play a  priest. Unless you are headed to Naxx. Tell anyone telling you need to be a certain spec to take a long walk off a short pier.
---
Thats a really safe assumption. But the question is will more people stick and hang with Classic vs Retail
---
Brother, this mindset is the only illusion.
---
My friend and I played Vanilla together when we were younger and he specifically would only wield swords on his warrior. He LOVED sword spec, period. %s meant nothing to him. Gold did :P Most of the time he played 2h fury because it was "different" as well. 
---
This min-max mindset destroys any sense of character individuality and it's not necessary.
---
Nah dude we all used cookie cutter builds. Don’t lie. It felt better but you googled the best build, picked one, then didn’t touch it until another patch. 
---
&gt;they did a crap job of it
---
Based on what? What are you comparing it against? Min-maxing 15 years later? Are you retarded?
---
&gt;I cant find any evidence that pre bis gear was well understood at the time
---
I don't really care what *you* can or can't do. You clearly weren't a min-maxer back then. 
---
I'm tired of arguing with someone who doesn't understand how to even form a coherent argument. Get blocked.
---
Got it, thanks. 
---
You must have never played on RP servers back then
---
I detested that Mana Bomb development. It was too much like a science fiction/Hiroshima maship. It also trashed a fantastic part of the world, part of the Cataclysm issue.
---
I know that on war, loss happens, but it's just my personal reaction.
---
Nitpicking. You know exactly what I mean. Fine, I will change "had everything figured out" to "knew what items were best" or essentially "had itemization completely figured out".
---
I guess they felt Righteous Whatever was good enough at the time because of Consecration. Or maybe they thought Judgment would generate enough single target threat on its own. I don't recall: did they ever give paladins a seal for aggro?
---
I'm not sure about the exact numbers but I know we were off just by a couple of 10s when the ladder closed :) that's life though, not that important
---
For real. OP is a person who has never heard of Moon Guard.
---
That's like saying you can't create a specific potion because Blizzard didn't add it to the vendor for you...
---
Go get it
---
You are overestimating how many of you "hardcore players" there will be relative to the general Classic player. Also I get that your taking the stance of "it will suck" so that either your expectation is met and you can be smug about it, or you get to enjoy a good game. Its a safe attitude to have so I understand why you and many others are taking this angle, but its also a pessimistic one when we dont have concrete evidence to know if this game will be good or not until we get to play it. Just try not to dissuade others from being hopeful.
---
YOUR ARGUMENT WAS "LOOK AT ALL THIS EVIDENCE"
---
I LOOKED AT IT.
---
THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE.
---
AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO SAY THAT I CAN'T FORM A COHERENT ARGUMENT?!
---
Ok, so. I've never played paladin for some reason and I don't mind being corrected but this is my current idea of the attack.
---
You stack up reckoning by being critically hit. When you attack all that stacking goes away and you hit like normal on your second attack and onwards. 
---
Which means that Kazzak went down with 1 attack, because after that the paladin would have to kill the boss with his normal attacks.
---
Now, if reckoning is still considered multiple hits, lets say that it's 1 major hit that procs into 4 smaller ones, we can still divide Kazzaks HP with 5 and it would be 73,282 dmg per hit. Which is still a lot of damage. I don't know, am I missing something? 
---
Kazzak was a world boss. He had so much HP that you'd have to divide it by 14,3 times to get down to the damage the shaman managed to pump out. Was reckoning really able to proc that many times before it was finished?
---
I mean, that seems true of every build, right? It's either going to be bad or popular? There's usually not a lot of middle ground. Yea, most priests that know how jank the leveling process is will be using 5 second rule builds with wand spec and spirit tap. Most fire mages will be picking improved fire ball. The spec in question isn't really an important part of the post. 
---
I literally describe caring about my spec as "inexplicable" because I view it as unimportant and uninteresting. It's the process of actually making a talent tree and having choices to make. If you make a wand spec shadow priest then... That's the build, minus a few points, right? There's about 35 points automatically on lock once you do that. 
---
Patch 2.4 was some of the best times.
---
Flying around as a naked cow knocking people off their flying mounts with thunderstorm. Camping the side bridge to kara and knocking an entire raid off the ledge with thunderstorm. Camping the summon stone for hellfire ramparts and flying down and knocking everyone off the ledge with thunderstorm.
---
Those were good times.
---
&gt; If those items are gated, and are introduced later on, the issue is resolved.
---
The problem is that the catch up items that are available in the blue dungeons are in many cases *better than what you've earned by raiding.*  This means your itemization would go:
---
blue dungeons -&gt; MC -&gt; ZG &amp; BWL -&gt; blue dungeons/AQ20/AQ40 -&gt; Naxx
---
I find the idea of returning to BRD to get new BiS items over my BWL epics a problem, personally.
---
They arent specializations anymore, they are complete classes. Mages dont have 3 specs anymore, there are 3 mage classes because they are all completely different.
---
The farming Dire Maul wit holy nova thing is something I'd totally forgot about and really useful, so thanks for that, and the kind words. 
---
The real question is does the critical hit chance get replaced with a miss or a hit in the table.
---
They will also include sharding in starting zones, increase debuff slots making the game easier and include loot trading.
---
Not saying any of this is baf but fact of the matter they have allready deviated from the original. 
---
No. It's like saying that the design decisions for curbing constant talent changes are insanely anti-fun in terms of experimenting. Switch a few talents around too much and eventually it'll cost you 50g (or one month of waiting) to reset your talents again.
---
Listen, I like the old talent trees, but lets not delude ourselves into thinking that it wasn't cost-prohibitive to adapt your talents for new situations or experiment with unusual builds on more than the rarest occasion.
---
&gt; Post this on the WoW reddit
---
That's actually where I saw it.
---
The reason I brought it up is that classic stands to suffer some of the same problems that are killing BFA.  A drop you get from your first dungeon shouldn't be BiS until the very final raid which you may never see.  Having nothing to aspire to kills motivation.
---
haha, yea that too:D
---
I just miss being able to choose ranked spells for mana conservation or pwning lowbies efficiently haha
---
NA here. The best friends I’ve made in wow have been EU friends on private servers. 
---
Thats fair, some servers have it worse than others in this regard but I can for sure see where youre coming from. 
---
I'm not sure I get what you're saying, but it seems like if you level a class you've never played before and refuse to read any guide or advice and start picking noob-trap talents (of which there are *many* in Vanilla unfortunately) then you start caring. But in a bad way.
---
There's nothing more frustrating than not being able to respec because you chose talents that are actively working against you, or holding you back, because respecing becomes more and more cost prohibitive the more you do it. It's a punishing system that punishes experimentation and adapting to different play styles on the fly.
---
Haha loving the idea. I hope to run into some of the old Pserver boys when we finally launch \^\^ 
---
Preparation -  one talent point that reset the cd of all your shit
---
Mortal Strike is a good one also
---
Al’Akir4Lyfe
---
Man, warsong was where it was AT back then. Good times. 
---
I feel you on that regard. Heres to hoping they can keep their fingers out of it. 
---
This is how reckoning works:
---
Every time you get critted, you store 1 attack, and then the next time you attack, you unleash them all.
---
WotLK made heroics _easier_, but TBC has the dubious honor of being the expansion that pioneered the idea of designing dungeons almost ubiquitously as these short loot hops with predictably-placed bosses.
---
I'm so torn between going undead rogue or human warrior. I played a rogue back in vanilla. Had seen it all with him up to some of Naxx, had a crazy amount of played time on that character and loved it. Even played a rogue on a pserver doing bwl content. I had started a Warrior on a different private server and got to 60 and really enjoyed the leveling, I liked the challenge but never really experienced any 60 content with that character as I just stopped since I knew classic was coming. Decisions, decisions... 
---
I cant speak for all of us, but for me personally its about two major factors:
---
1; The server wont randomly shut down one day, this could be caused by a plethora of reasons on Pservers.
---
2; The server is run and curated by an actual company with actual employees, which means less to no chance GMs are spawning in items / max lvl chars for their friends ( something I cant help but suspect when playing on private realms)
---
As a side bonus I get to support the game I love, and have loved since 05' even if the company owning it has gone down the drain for the most part
---
Heroics were fun (mechanically speaking) for a while, but unfortunately I will always remember my disappointment at how short and predictable the dungeon layouts were.  I'd never used the term "loot hallway" until TBC came around, and that is, unfortunately, for a reason.
---
no problem. Diremaul is life lol.
---
Except the text is completely wrong and applies more to modern WoW.
---
Dumbass post.
---
Warbringer was so good
---
The paladin in the kazzak video stored like 2000 attacks, so him auto-attacking once was like auto-attacking 2001 times with 1 strike, thats why it lagged
---
nah my guild will be posted up, so will most alliance on my server to prevent that.
---
Hey man this is exactly what I mean! Traveled to the US a couple of times and been running tons of content with you guys over the years on the private server scene. 
---
Met so many awesome people both IRL and IG. Cant wait to visit yall again some time, its just too goddamn expensive for me right now :(
---
The system is the same to me. Talents are just the keystones in the old tree like Icy Veins. The small bonuses you had to take to get there (+3% to crit) are in the azerite system or the artifact system in legion.  
---
I don't care how it is presented to me in a UI as long as it is intuitive but both the "old school" crowd and the game devs need to stop acting like they replaced it when it is functionally the same. 
---
I care
---
No, your guild leader gets to decide what your talent tree looks like, otherwise you don't get to go to the raid.
---
That said, I agree with you. I remember the "default" mage build during Wrath called for me having a point in improved blink, but I refused to use it, in favor of an arcane missiles proc. People would flip shit about that one talent point.
---
It's the reason why live is stuck with the shit it's stuck with now, yet *still* has required abilities **anyway.**
---
Yeah that's the hilarious part of this post. I wish everyone could be 100% transparent during Classic about their actual talent choice because I'm willing to bet **hard fucking money** that most of the people saying they love the old talent trees are going to be running the most effective and efficient builds regardless of what they actually want to pick.
---
It's Anduin Lothar from the WoW movie. Ragnar's actor played him.
---
Everyone doesn't buy the top rated car because they dont have the disposable income for it. If they could, most would. 
---
None of your choices make sense. Like, who considered their lag for a talent? What talent was picked over the meta because "it looked pretty"? Roleplaying fits. You could easily say EVERY talent is a "real choice", but you're wrong that it's not an illusion. People get kicked from raids for having the wrong build, especially if you're already low on meters. Gear can outweigh bad talent choices, but by that point you could run with only half your talents picked and do well. 
---
Blow or not, Wrath was absolutely terrible with elitism among talent builds, even in casual groups. Larger numbers meant larger gaps, making builds less flexible. 
---
haha
---
It's adderall isn't it
---
They changed the art, not just upgraded the original ones.  
---
As I always say, my orc is, in retail, Shrek's cousin, not an orc. And everything else is Disney-Pixar work. I despise all of it.
---
He's based on Anduin Lothar from the Warcraft Movie which was Ragnar Lothbrok's actor.
---
Gnome is best for every class, hands down. Even Shamans.
---
&gt; No, your guild leader gets to decide what your talent tree looks like, otherwise you don't get to go to the raid
---
In maybe the top 5% of guilds (and even that's a stretch). Most guilds won't require specific specs and bench players who don't have them, hell most guilds will be happy to have 40 raiders show up...
---
Nightfall melee hunter.
---
You must not have played the same game as I did.
---
Builds were fairly cookie cutter. In the early days as a mage it was frost all day for raiding and while a few build were definitely viable it was probably the best for pvp as well (3 minute mages might disagree)
---
Yeah in the pvp specs you can pull off some amazing plays, especially if you use engineering and all the other special little items/gadgets. Sap, blind and playing like a scumbag work reaaaaaally well
---
&gt; So only people with equal gear levels should be permitted into a BG? 
---
You lot really are predictable. Let me just quote myself from my original post:
---
And before you start in with the usual apologia, nobody wants perfect balance in PvP any more than we want every single boxing match to be a 50/50 proposition. But if someone finds a loophole that lets them smuggle a 130kg fighter into a 50kg division that ought to be shut down because that degree of imbalance breaks the game.
---
&gt; By the way, my personal experience is that short of premades, what you just described (game broken because of gear differences) maybe sometimes happens in WSG, but 9/10 the limiting factor are actually retards who can't follow objectives.
---
My personal experience in 10-19 is that a single well-played, unopposed  twink usually swings the game if it was remotely close to begin with. I suspect they have less personal impact at higher brackets, because 10-19 is where the gulf between a twink and random leveller is greatest.
---
&gt; You are replying to my reply to your reply to my reply which states that even non-twinks can turn the tide of the battle.
---
You love these massively vague claims guarded with "can" and "should". Sure, there *can* be a Disney ending where the little level 12 mage that believed in himself steals the win from the 19 hunter twink because the twink was an idiot. But we all know that the reason people twink is because that Disney ending is justa feel-good fantasy in the overwhelming majority of cases.
---
&gt; Now try to think about the fact that you could join a WSG where one side had lvl 18-19 people, while your side had only lvl 10-12 people. Yes, that can happen too. Time to split up the bracket into 10-14 and 15-19? Nah, let's make a separate bracket for each level.
---
You seem to think you have come across some new and ingenious argument here.
---
Brackets are a trade-off, and this is not news. You want the brackets to be big enough that queues pop fast even in the slow times, and small enough that the game is reasonably balanced. There's no inherent virtue in putting 10s up against 19s, it's just a compromise between queue time and balance.
---
Twinks break that balance because a twinked 19 is about equal to a normal level 26 give or take, or at least it was in the WotLK era when I played my lowbie hunter. (That toon at 20 could hold its own in most 1v1s in 20-29 and chew up level 27 PvE mobs.)
---
Unless you think a 10-29 bracket is a good idea, twinks break the game. It really is that simple. The only people disagreeing are twinkers who have to justify their own selfish behaviour.
---
I love this "min-max is the devil" mentality (/s). I don't know about you, but I plan to see Naxxramas in its original iteration, and I'm not getting there by fucking around with garbage talents that hamstring my character for the trade-off of being a unique snowflake. There's nothing wrong with making subpar choices for fun or roleplay, but it's not going to get you to the content you want to see, bar some really low standards.
---
Ultimately, it's the game and system as designed - ESPECIALLY in Classic. Raid mechanics are not complex, they aren't requiring tons of creative critical thought. They require *numbers*, and lots of them. Like many old RPGs, the gameplay of WoW is dice rolls, and your only creative input is in designing which dice you want to use. If you want to use the goofy gag dice weighted to roll 1s, be my guest - but don't criticize me for wanting to refine my character and perform better. It's the system working as intended.
---
The perfect system, of course, is one that offers meaningful choices were each option is both a) valid and b) creative enough that it cannot be number-crunched into irrelevance or otherwise. You can see this exact methodology in the talent system introduced in Mists of Pandaria. You got to choose between three abilities that all fulfilled the same role in your kit, but in radically different ways, and in ways that were not so straightforward that it was immediately obvious which would be superior in every situation.
---
For example, mages get a defensive utility: Greater Invis, Cauterize, or Cold Snap. You choose if you want to avoid the danger, eat the danger in the face, or add a layer of redundancy to your existing emergency tools. This is a cool, meaningful choice because all three could be used creatively in any given scenario. Compare that to "do you want 5% crit, or do you want a bigger shout radius" - which fantasy am I roleplaying: deadly warrior, or *very loud man*?
---
PS: This isn't to say that you always have to choose the "correct" option. If that were the case, every raid would be nothing but fury warriors and rogues for DPS. It does mean that you should do your best to fulfill your chosen role, whatever that may be. I'm rolling a feral druid with intent on tanking and off-tanking in raids. I know this is not optimal. I'm learning the limits of the class and what I can do to maximize utility and minimize liability to the raid. This is "min-maxing", but it's not me being pigeonholed into something I don't want to play. It's just playing what I want to play to the best of my ability.
---
We had a shaman tank Karazhan once - you think he would have been able to do that without min-maxing for it? It's extremely suboptimal, and that's why min-maxing is all the more important. It's not about restricting choices to only what's viable, it's about making your choices into something viable. I'll be happy to have boomkins, retadins, spriests, whatever in my raid - as long as they're trying their hardest and fulfilling their role well. 
---
Rogues  cant use axes in vanilla...
---
The problem with what you are saying is that it simply isn't true. I have made lots of specs designed to do specialized tasks with the old talent system. This cookie cutter complaint you are trotting out is only true because of the culture. Yes it is the case his build is similar. This is also his first attempt.
---
He did discover it himself and, that feeling is one that will cause him to toy with the tree even more. Getting into more complex builds for more specialized tasks. 
---
The best example I can think of is I played a Holy Pally in TBC. I did well for myself in Arena. Got all the way up to 2350. With my well known cookie cutter build. Meanwhile my friend who isn't half as good as me but, at the time liked to "play" with unique stuff. Finished his Arena season over 2400. How? The ass hole stumbled on to some homebrew double shockadin build and, team up. Shit couldn't lose to anything. Apparently Double Shockadin had no bad match ups because of the meta and, I missed it because I was just like you. Assuming cookie cutter is always best.
---
Soul link.  30% damage reduction.  3% increased damage.
---
The heart wants what it wants :)
---
To be fair, the old vanilla system completely changed and morphed by Cata right before they changed it in MoP. It was literally just,
---
* Look up the optimized talents
---
* Use that talent distribution for every single fight.
---
Say what you will about the new system, but it was definitely a more fluid system that changes as per the fight.
---
The new system definitely destroys the leveling content, but modern wow's leveling is so fast it barely matters tbh.
---
If you go to Darn you can be one of the 5 people there! 
---
Forums definitely did exist, but they didn't really contain any readily accessible and structured information. Forums were more people's experiences and opinions (such as how to get Rivendare's mount).
---
It was a different time, man. It might be hard for a young guy like you to understand, but the internet was *new*. People weren't used to sharing in that capacity.
---
Because in the past we didn't have information about how things would turn out. If you got item x and knew that even though it's subpar today it eventually gets buffed to near BIS status, you will hold onto it. By the time items are buffed, you already have all of them and you just go to the bank and swap sets. It's really kinda dumb, but that's what everyone would be forced to do for optimal play if items are initially in nerfed form before eventually shifting to 1.12 stats.

The expense of respeccing is part of what made old wow amazing. If you played you will remember how diverse peoples specs often were because rather then being a purely specialized for one thing at a time build. They had to go Hybrid builds to be able to PVP and, raid with out respeccing. Or pvp and, farm it made things way more fun IMO.

Fair enough, I should've stated "specific" rather than "very niche". My point still stands though, the specs you listed excel in PvP and are suboptimal in other areas of the game.

The thing for me is that you take away the min/maxing.  For a casual player, it didn't matter, but a lot of people like the idea that they're coming up with their build.

Just like how they homogenized gear, took away gems, took away enchants...there's not much you can do besides just play the class the way they built it for you.

Exactly - thus why he told them to only roll need on quick axes; not sword or clubs.

Ooooh yeah dude, the way the UI manages to convey the dread of an unknown threat is just inspiring.

Travel form doesnt stack with boots movement speed and the math is wrong to begin with as the pvp set bonus is multiplicative. Base cheetah = 140%, cheetah + 4 set pvp = 161% (140\*1.15 = 161)

Does it still have any uses in PvP (or PvE) for the slow? If the damage really is that mediocre, why is it such an iconic spell?
---
It's almost like we were in different guilds or something.

I'm talking about specific talents. Like if you raid resto you need to be speced into resto. The vast majority of GM's won't inspect your resto spec and tell you that you picked the wrong talents while telling you that you need to respec into the right talents or you aren't raiding.

Young guy? Haha I was married before WoW was a thing. I was a teenager before the Internet was publicly available. You don’t know shit about me, kid.

The forums and plenty of other websites worked perfectly well to share information. If you’re trying to suggest everyone was clueless and naive back then it’s probably because you were. 
---
No, you had to follow the exact build on the official Wikis.

Nah, Divine Storm was the Wrath pre-patch. I remember buying that funky looking blue level 68 2h mace and destroying people in duels with full prot gear. Silly times.
