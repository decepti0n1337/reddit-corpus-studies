Felmyst was really just "have 1 caller watch where Felmyst is lining up and then play the world's easiest safety dance".  Mechanically easier than Kalecgos and easier tuning-wise than Brutallus.  Kalec and Brut actually weren't that bad, really, if you had a full raid of people that knew how to press their buttons reasonably well and brought consumables (especially for Brut, the first guild I was in got cockblocked there, but then I found that people weren't bringing consumables).  It was really Twins and Mu'ru that made that raid hard.  If you could do Mu'ru you shouldn't have had much problem learning the KJ fight.  I did enjoy that as an enhancement shaman on KJ (with all the threat issues Enh had), I spent all of phase 1 /dancing because even if I was just white swinging, I'd pull in phase 2.

I played on a private server launch where I had 2 hour queues and 20 people standing around each skeleton spawn location in the newbie zone waiting for a tag.
---

---
I'm ok with what I experienced on the p-server.  It was temporary and very exciting.  It was also a pain and might drive some people away.  As someone mentioned above I don't trust Blizzard to use it now, but not later.  It is not a rational fear because they could have no sharding at launch and then add it 2 months later everywhere.  Fear is rarely rational though.
---
Some kind of server message board would be really cool imo, but I could see it being abused 
---
&gt;  like Ion and respect that he is willing to talk about things other devs avoid
---
Same here, but he (or his team) is responsible for the downfall of Retail and so I will always resent him for that.
---
So, here I go again *sigh*... DOWN WITH ION! BRING BACK JEFF!
---
&gt; If Blizzard wants to increase loot related tickets, implementing loot sharing for needed items is the best way.
---
That is not how it works. By doing open trading Blizzard can just say you have to tools to fix the problem yourself and ignore you. Where any other trading requires them to put in a system that forces Blizzard to actual do work to correct stuff. Personally I want no trading period with GMs auto-closing tickets with an auto message saying too bad too sad for any and all loot tickets. 
---
&gt; But anyways, why group with ninjas? This is Classic, a game we all agree is all about community and reputation! Maybe you are one of the dicks and have no friends to play with? 
---
Pre-BC was a game about the community and reputation. Classic is an unknown. Classic doesn't exist yet to make the statement it will have a community-based reputation. Classic could become the trash-fire community that plagues a lot of online games or it could be a recreation of the pre-BC era. It is not known yet. 
---
Lol roomers 
---
You could always ask a gm to trade loot but it has to be the person with the loot asking the gm.

---
No, from thousands (as in multiple thousands to under one thousand.
---
You didn't play at launch, did you?
---
Wildstar wasnt what i would call "hardcore" i played it at launch and made cap. it failed because it dint put out enough content fast enough to keep up with player demand.
---
Because that doesn't get rid of the loot tickets that Blizzard wants to remove. Making it greed only just removes a small portion of the loot tickets. 
---
If Blizzard wants to not deal with loot just make it one of the topics GMs will not touch and get an auto-message reply. And don't have loot trading at all. Make so the players are accountable for their actions. If the mess up that is on them.

It looks more like concept art to me, as I do not recognize the land formations.  The closest I would say is Thandol Span, but the two masses are connected by land and not a bridge. It also appears to have either a port or a jetty with boats nearby.
---
Either a Hunter with Bestial Wrath or a Mage with Arcane Power will kill things with minimal effort. Go with Hunter if you want to make use of it while leveling, since Arcane is a terrible Mage spec to level with.
---
Yeah but you just got convinced by somebody that something that didn't really ever happen was a prevalent problem, right? Because this either wasn't a thing that anybody knew about or I had the 1/10,000 odds of never knowing anybody - or reading on any forums - about using GMs to ninja loot. 
---
If you're still going I'd like one please
---
The hunters have to need roll on everything possible 
---
it flopped because they launched with no endgame content and they took too long to add any.
---
i have tried project 1999 ive never been a big fan of everquest honestly i dont like games that remove experience on death.
---
All the way. 
---
Ah, so my memory isn't that bad after all
---
imagine being this naive, did you enjoy your red dot?
---
[1. General][Stormwind City] Are we talking about [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Oh boy where's the "double talk" in that? 
---
Want to != will, it's as straightforward as it gets. 
---
They have said exactly that classic economy will be completely independent. There will be no gold buying with the exception of derpy ass get your account banned websites.
---
I farmed it on multiple characters throughout MoP, WoD, Legion on retail and managed to get one thunderfury halfway through legion. Those binding drops can be quite impossible
---
Lol, all jokes aside the thunderfury drama is going to be real and break many guilds like it always has.. whoever gets ALL those rare mats from ALL those mc runs will carry the legendary swords..
---
 IN other words, only the GM and their girlfriends stand a chance of getting one, while deceiving their entire guild and never mentioning what those mats are for, claiming they are your "guild bank"  reagents  8)
---
Ya.. I said min/max, but really it's just they are both fun to me...
---
That's whats making it hard. I've been a hardcore raider since BC as a hunter, so I know how to play and can pick up the minor vanilla only stuff.
---
But man being able to tank is nice early on.
---
I got super lucky and got both bindings on my monk in the same run but monk doesn't even hold the sword in their hands when fightingn😭😭
---
Useable indoors is one of those things I'd love to see in classic, same goes for things like druid's roots. The skills are already part of the class kit, you can't say that giving them access to all their skills would screw up balance. Ghost wolf in instances would give shaman a leg up on mobility, and roots would give druids a much needed CC option to flesh out their group utility.
---
Took me 8 years of farming MC pretty much on reset on my paladin on live servers.. good luck to your "3-4" month journey. 
---
Every MC raider looks like Punky Brewster for at least three months. 
---
I used it myself back then for guild masterloot mishaps. I'm not saying people abused it (probably did on a much smaller scale, though).
---
Like I said above I don't really want it in either as any legit problem will be sorted by a GM anyway but it'll just be a waiting game for that. 
---
So maybe DONT go with a party full of guildies of ur own class?
---
Really great video! Thanks for posting. Tauren for me; I love me some Mulgore. 
---
If you haven't its worth watching the full World of Roguecraft videos that that was a clip from.
---
Chain heal is the most satisfying spell in the game. That alone tempts me towards shaman. 
---
I don't have any questions off the top of my head I just want to thank you for making Classic Wow happen because without Nostalrius it would just have been a dream
---
I don’t believe for a second that anyone here can give a good guess of the likelihood that it might happen. 
---
Secondly it doesn’t even matter. OP just said he hopes and wishes.
---
As long as you get connected, why does it matter what the login screen says?
---
All the rep values for quests are listed on [http://classicdb.ch](http://classicdb.ch) . Anyone could in theory go through a levelling guide and tally up the reputation from all the quests you typically complete before level 40 (plus dungeon quests like Blackfathom Depths).
---
Release a build for VR, and then yes.
---
Also, does anyone have a link to that video telling people making cool projects to _shut up about them_ until release so they don't get shut down like they almost always do? OP needs to see it.
---
Wrong. It's a 50% chance for each binding. Either you get it or you don't. ^(/s)
---
Find the class you really want to play, and go for it. They all have they're strengths and weaknesses. I've only played a rogue out of the classes you mentioned. I will tell you that even a crappy played rogue can be good, and the skill ceiling can go through the roof as you improve. 
---
I'd love for you to do it for me if you get a chance! 
---
I can't select my lvl 100 or 110 (can't remember) character to post on the forums. I was able to despite having an inactive account, but can no longer do so.
---
I opened a support ticket and the customer service employee said posting on the forums is a "privilege for subscribers." 
---
I'm leveling a char to level 20 with a free trial mode right now. It's not a fun experience.
---
I really hope I can post after having done this.
---
Debating between nelf priest or dwarf pally. I love to heal! 
---
Just get the Bindings 4Head
---
TIL my old paladin is in the 0.16%. I won the first binding in a run and when the second one dropped and nobody else said they had the first binding as well I looted it to myself causing drama in the run. Apparently someone getting. 1/2 is better than letting someone finish 2/2. 
---
Hmmm I just logged into my inactive account selected my 120 and posted. I know the characters don’t always show up on your forum list, and logging into the account generally solves that.
---
Also weird that their customer support says this a bunch when plenty of people post on inactive accounts.
---
Will they add expansions to the classic?
---
Quests award far less rep (might go all the way down to 0 but I don't remember) as you outlevel them.
---
To be technical. Its content from patch 1.1-1.12.1 between 2004-2006.
---
You forget one thing. Retail gold can be turned into cash by paying your subscription.
---
Does your math take in account that you have to obtain 2 **different** bindings in order to count as a success? 
---
And that these two drops are completely independent from each other and obtaining the 1st binding does not increase the chance to get the 2nd one in any way?
---
Everyone in barrens chat talking about chuck Norris and Iraq 
---
Yes of course, you wouldn't have such a big gap between average first Binding (13 runs) and second (37 runs) if it was just getting 2 random Bindings :) I simplified the labels calling them first and second bindings but they can either be Right then Left or Left then Right.
---
implying any guild would take a gnome main tank in the first place
---
I see this comment and variations all the time for all subjects.
---
An analogy: Just beasue there is crime, have always been crime and will always be crime, does that mean we should not try and prevent crime?
---
&gt;Then It got to Google chrome I stopped like a deer in the headlights.
---
The sound of screeching tires was the first thing I heard 
---
It will most likely be a different game in the battle.net client, but I'm not 100% sure. 
---
Smash faces in pvp
---
Nice, just got a bit misguided by the labeling, my bad
---
Southern US thing. Means grandfather.
---
&gt; ~~Enjoy!~~
---
Was it really needed to cross out that to ;)
---
I got both bindings the same week. 
---
The first week I started farming. 
---
On two different Rogues. 
---
Sigh. 
---
We don't know yet. The demo was its own client but then again so is the PTR. Could go either way. 
---
Common sense says it will be its own client.  
---
Claasic is a remaake of the originaal "vaanillaa" version of WoW.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's being built on the legion client, so it will haave some improved graaphic settings. But it will still use the originaal models.
---
You won't need to buy it, you'll just need aan aactive subscription
---
Back then a Warrior getting it was priority regardless of someone else already having the opposing half. You weren't going to be using a Pally tank then, so it was pointless giving it them. 
---
Doesn't look like these lists include items added in later patches, for example the preraid bis lists all include items that were bis during very early patch but since we'll be on 1.12 it's all wrong. A lot of good items were added to Blackrock Spire in 1.10 (post-AQ/pre-Naxx patch) for example.
---

---
Loot tradin is no different than vanilla.
---
If someone ninjad  in vanilla, they got shitlisted.
---
If people ninja using loot trading, they get shitlisted. 
---
Literally no difference.
---
&gt; Blame the system, it's rational behavior that can be eliminated by not having loot trading. 
---
No, it cannot be eliminated. It happened in classic because we used tickets to do the exact same damned behavior. The difference was **you didn't know it was happening**. Ignorance may be bliss, but it doesn't change the facts.
---
Are there really that many ninjas that it will be a problem though? Like it's pretty obvious if someone rolls for an item they don't need. 
---
I didn't think most people were callous enough to do that in front of everyone. I understand people would if it was not really visible what you are doing (like with the current loot system in retail), but everyone can see if you are ninjaing an item in vanilla. 
---
No worries I now have mentioned it in the post, thanks!

Have your upvote

jesus christ this will be one of the human paladins begging for buffs to the class

NO ENJOYMENT. PARTY IS OVER.
---
Uhh also the glaring issue of necessary spell augments that were incredibly rare, gearing issues, and the awkwardness of attunement being overly lengthy and odd in its requirements.
---
Have you heard of "TheSinglePlayerProject"?
---
I got my first binding on something like my 3rd solo run around mid Wrath. I didnt get the other till Legion... Though i did skip pandaria and most of WoD.
---
Nobody knows. Some people have opinions. It might be technically easier for there to be a separate client, but it's in Blizzard's best interest from a marketing and customer retention standpoint to make it as easy as possible for anybody who plays one game to be able to play the other game without a separate download.
---
Why does it matter?
---
&gt; well I looted it to myself 
---
You mean you ninja it to yourself...
---
Don't forget the 100 arcanite bars!
---
I ran MC probably 50 or so times in vanilla, saw bindings drop 4 or 5 times or so. My guild made a single Thunderfury, and one Sulfuras. Your assumed drop rates sound optimistic to me.
---
Thanks all, I can't wait to play in Teldrassil, Darkshore and Ashenvale as a Human, something special about it!
---
Was a post on official forums where a guy said he wanted to play classic ONLY to get Scarab Lord and have that title in retail. Like... dude... not a fucking chance in hell you'd get it even if it carried over to retail.
---
This is easy for me.  I want to play paladin.
---
Haven't played in forever, I heard loot trading doesn't work on items where you rolled need on.
---
Optimistic? 
---
5 times out of 50 is 10% or 5% each... so higher than what he used.
---
Well, I am 16 years old and I am deeply interested in WoW Classic. I played on Nostalrius and many other private servers and I can see the appeal of vanilla WoW. It is actually my most anticipated game of 2019.
---
When I asked my mates that like video games (yes, they like even the ones that require commitment, there is actually a lot of younger gamers that dislike games like Fortnite or Call of Duty. One of my classmates loves old RTS games, other kids two grades below me likes RPGs and is a completionist, sunk like 400 hours into KCD: Deliverence */well, i did too/.)* I found out that out of the 15 people I asked, 9 said that they were willing to try WoW Classic out, and out of them 5 saidthat they are really happy to see where WoW Classic is headed to (more RPG elements, class fantasy ETC.)
---
Yes, WoW Classic type games may not be mainstream, but from my own experience, there are still younger people that are sickened (or maybe bored is a better word) by most modern mainstream games and want something fun. I do not think that there will be 
---
Hell, I  even got one of my friend to start playing EvE Online with me but we will probably ditch that when WoW Classic comes out  
---
You win in pvp by marginally outcompeting the other person. Talents are a huge source of  that ability and this comment is blatantly unaware of the realities of pvp.
---
I agree with most posters so far. It wont be exactly like vanilla when weapon speeds weren't normalized (making warriors and shamans 2irh arcanite reaper contenders)
---
That was my perspective, considering the thinning of the land-mass there. 
---
Already have an idea of what I want, but I'm routinely indecisive. Go for it!
---
not so much rogue-buster as rogue repellent
---
They drop from 2 bosses, so 4 or 5 out of technically 100 kills, and you need both. So, less than what he used.
---
He factored that in. Look at his math. 
---
Like who? Ele and enh shamans still need mana to cast their heal, same for ret and prot paladins. Shadow priests still need mana for theirs as well. Feral, guardian and balance druids all use mana for their heals etc. as well. And at least in legion I know that warlocks used enough mana during fights that they did have to life tap a reasonable amount too, although maybe that was only affliction. Most specs still have it and use it, even though it's basically deprecated. 
---
The current generation won't like it as classic is like working towards some and people hate it they want instant gratification. Classic WOW will be painful and will find few more audiences.
---
Whoa. Another morrowind player!
---
As someone who didn't had the chance to play on Vanilla (I've started by the very end of Wrath)... FOR THE HORDE!
---
But I want to make a Dwarf (no idea about the class) to visit some places that I really like but that were destroyed by Deathwing, just to see how things were before Cata
---
The story would have been better if could have found a way to believably say he were planning to level as a hunter and still take the guild's first TF 'since he was GM'.
---
To get both bindings. And to farm for all the mats to make the bars ? Long, long time friend......And any decent guild knows the first TF goes to the MT. I was like fifth to get one, as a 2h fury. Took me 6 mo of MC for garr to drop my binding
---
I mean if people are gonna hold loot for ransom with loot trading they would be the same people in the old system flipping on master loot and saying if you want me to master loot it to you then pay me lol.  
---
I don't care if they have loot trading or not, but any system we choose there will be assholes abusing it.
---
How to get the armor set the orc is wearing?
---
Just play retail
---
Awesome! I hope you enjoy Classic Azeroth
---
An 8 year old post from my Facebook memories came up today and  both bindings dropped in one run for me.  Makes me want to play classic. 
---
I wasn't able to log onto retail while being on the demo...
---
So there's that information.
---
GRH is the BiS pvp gear to be honest. Once you use it, you switch it out for something else. The cooldown is fairly long. In a 2v1 it's your best friend. In dueling it allows all kinds of good things too (catch up to a hunter, start a fight with them unable to respond while you purge all their buffs, give you a moment to bandage, etc).
---
You should be proud of the work you're doing in this thread, OP. Your post is amazing but some of these responses to comments are next level
---
It's entirely luck based.  You could theoretically get the parts in a single clear.  Or it could, which is much more likely, take many many months 
---
This is a quali🅱️y 🅱️ost
---
how you could even win the first binding is beyond me, but then again, classic were some different times
---
Yes because nobody else in rad had ANY part of the bindings. Sure it was super greedy but in the long run everyone eventually saw it as the right thing. 
---
I chose crow which makes me think Shadow Priest, and I chose Dragonfly which makes me think Troll because of their colorful skin.
---
So Troll Shadow Priest.
---
It took me 9 years. 9.
---
I got my first binding while tanking as a prot warrior in 2006 but never saw one drop again until WoD . I believe that I was able to start trying to solo it at level 70 but I think I could only do some of the trash as prot, it wouldn’t be until level 80 where it became possible to solo bosses.
---
&gt; Because that doesn't get rid of the loot tickets that Blizzard wants to remove. Making it greed only just removes a small portion of the loot tickets.
---
They tried letting people trade loot taken with need rolls, it didn't work.
---
&gt; If Blizzard wants to not deal with loot just make it one of the topics GMs will not touch and get an auto-message reply. 
---
Or let people trade BoP items obtained with greed rolls because that has no downsides at all that anyone seems able to articulate.
---
&gt; And don't have loot trading at all. Make so the players are accountable for their actions. If the mess up that is on them.
---
Or let them trade loot they won with greed rolls to other people eligible to have rolled on it, because that has no downside.
---
Because I have a slow internet connection and knowing if I can pre download the client would be handy.
---
I wouldn't start shaming until 45.  At that point they should have travelled enough to get it without really going out of the way.
---
Our guild had some wacky luck - first Garr kill we got a binding. Actually caused a minor crisis since it hadn't been anticipated so the officers had to call an emergency meeting. 
---
Sadly it took a while to get Geddon's; though we got the server first drop of Attumen's mount in Karazhan on our first run through in TBC.
---
I just made a dorf hunter.
---
Death ran to Mulgore at level 10 and was able to tame The Rake.
---
That ain't gonna be possible on retail that's for sure. Horde will have that shit on lock. 
---
Will have to settle for some other pet :p
---
FoH, huh?
---
Every time I see a tauren warrior on my dwarf rogue I say free honor.  Now orcs are another story.
---
It was possible in retail vanilla without cloth turn ins.
---
@op you forget that blizzard nerfed the percent later on... when classic wow comes out the percent for bindings will go back to 0.01% it used to be...these bindings would take people years or longer...most never saw this weapon...and if they had both bindings mats would cost over 6k gold... so skewed data imo... and moot in the point of classic...
---
No one knows at the moment. Maybe, one day.

Success!

Retrieving realm list
---
Why doesn't my mage have any healing abilities? 
---
Going of the demo, it would be a separate client download accessed via the battle net launcher 
---
If the undead were not part of the horde I would choose them. But now it's the most common race in the horde which sort of ruins it for me. I like WC3 horde, but when almost half your faction is made up of undead it doesn't feel at all the same any more. 
---
Same thing with the alliance and the night elves, but they feel at least a little bit more similar to the rest of the alliance races than the undead does to the rest of the horde. 
---
The Youtube advertisements here are putting in less and less effort.  
---
What was the specific design concern you voiced to Ion?
---
This is a video from November after the demo went offline and I'm sure this video has been posted here before. So what's the point of posting it again?
---
These things are already well known to us the community and we're waiting for a confirmation from Blizzard how it will play out
---
To be honest I can't wait haha.
---
I was watching some videos on your channel and I think I'll make a Shaman. Now just gotta decide a class for a Dwarf haha
---
I left home after a massive arguement with my mum because i was playing wow one day.
---
I am pretty sure same thing will happen but this time with my wife..
---
I dont care because ill have full epixSSS!!!
---
Couple things I feel like I need to point out...
---
Dire Maul.  When Dire Maul was released on MC, there were exactly 0 guilds who had fulled cleared MC, so if they were to release Dire Maul with MC it would be the exact same experience as 100% of the players who played retail vanilla.  They had DM gear when they full cleared MC and they will in classic.
---
But, unless I missed something, they just said these were the stages and didn't really say much else.  For all we know their 'stages' could also be spread out.  Such as adding MC, then wait a month, then add DM and so on.  But even still, the problem with BGs and ZG being released with BWL?  That is a stretch calling it trivializing.  There is still a LOT of reasons to go into BWL and on retail BGs were released with BWL and then just a mere 2 months later ZG came out... it's two bloody months of difference does it really matter THAT much?  
---
Also one more thing, I certainly hope you were joking on the journey thing and you don't actually think you created some sort of term for vanilla as if people weren't calling it a journey for the last 14 years lol.
---
Other than that, yeah spell batching will create issues for sure and will determine a handful of fights.  Completely changing the META?  Eh... yeah I would say you exaggerated a tad bit there but to each their own!
---
How about making a text post and not a shameless plug for your YouTube channel.
---
People might actually take it seriously 
---
...

"OKAY IF YOU SUCEEDED THEN SHOW ME MY TOON"
---
If he went at L4-6 he'd still be exalted shortly after L40 from doing all NE quests. No need to skip out on all the basic spells.
---
For the Horde, always.  I've never seen any Alliance content, and I never will.  Fuck those nerds.
---
No question that it's doable, but I can imagine that it'd be really tedious compared to going a few levels later when you at least have a few more spells to work with.
---
Please don't materialise nightmares like that
---
I've always played both factions, but the Horde will always be near and dear to my heart.
---
Yes
---
But if you don't get the maximum number of totems ASAP how are you supposed to board the boat/zeppelin, set them down, and leave them floating together in midair? They might get lonely.
---
&gt; "*&lt;&lt;Some BS headline&gt;&gt; -And that's a good thing!*"

Literally a form of modern day propaganda, telling people how to think rather than just giving facts and letting the audience decide for themselves.

Random tangent/rant here...

I'm not a music snob.  I'm not one of those people who's ever going to make some dumb blanket statement like *"all rap is dumb hurr hurr"* or *"ew I'd never listen to country music."*  Statements like that are close-minded and awful opinions to hold, IMO.  The beauty of music is in variety, and there's something to appreciate in almost any genre or style.  Even if it's not immediately apparent to you, it's always worth at least giving things a fair shake and trying to understand what the appeal is, even if they might not personally appeal to you.  To that end, I never thought I would find myself saying *"wow, I HATE that song."*  That is, until I heard "Work" for the first time.  It was popular on the radio, and there for a while you couldn't escape it.  And I tried to give it a fair few lessons, I really did.  I don't even dislike Rihanna's voice, I think she's great!  But that particular song, goddamn.  She sounds like a drunk stroke victim who's in the middle of having a seizure.  You see me I beeeweerrrkhkwerrwekkehkhwwwkehrkekhwher-ERK!
---
I hate it, and this peon version is a legitimate improvement.
---
Rift was the only successful WoW clone that was actually any good. I’ve not played it in years but the levelling experience was fantastic.
---
I'd say continue working on them even if you'll never publish it. It'll be good practice and it's something you can look back on and say "Yeah I did that." I say this as a writer. I've taken on numerous projects that I knew had no hope of being published, but I still kept doing them because I knew it would be an accomplishment I would be proud of and it would give me good practice for the future.
---
Just my two cents though. Idk.
---
Do me do me
---
I think there will be a ton of orcs in classic due to the racials
---
Ice cold.
---
But true.
---
So, is tFury going to be in the game at launch?  I recall it not being in the game until BWL released.
---
But how? Did you actually Tank raids with tf as paladin? Screens or didn’t happen &lt;3
---
horde is for little kids who want to be a scary monster or big kid tauren 
---
Oh, I never experienced those.
---
In the Classic demo it worked like the PTR, so you’d have a separate sub-directory with everything in it including the executables and cache directories.
---
if it does work it will most likely get fixed as weapon damage enchant for +damage shouldnt work in cat form 
---
I want to play through alliance one day because the wc3 campaigns were actually really cool, but, I find all the races lame and boring. Everything about horse is inherently more interesting.
---
Why did you post them here then? 
---
Ofcourse you can't monetize them, there should never be even a thought about it, when you start projects like this. People do things like this when they really love the property. Look at the half life 2 modders industry - people work on the mods for years without any thoughts of monetization, and sometimes things like counter strike, team fortress, dear esther or the stanley parable appear from this. But they do only if you are passionate enough and not making it for the money, but because you have an idea.
---
If you make some incredible wow fan game, get attention, people will love it, and then you will make something original based on this - you might get money. Otherwise just do something original in the first place.
---
nope just a random vanilla/bc/wotlk player who was gladiator 6 out of 8 seasons
---
Bro. I have two monitors as well. It’s not going to make that big of a difference. The actual play style of warrior takes a long time. Best of luck still! 
---
Also Classic DB is a great vanilla database for questing! 
---
Wow, Nihilum. There's a name I haven't read in years, I remember watching Kungen tank videos as a teenager.
---
Literally no difference, aside from the fact that the problem is no longer a single ninja looter but ninjaing multiplied by 4, 9, or however many people are secretly cooperating to cheat you out of loot.
---
yea if thats true i doubt they will keep it at 0.01% 
---
Have fun autoatacking until lvl 60 and then becoming a fulltime blessings bitch.
---
Come on, you don't like spirit on your rogue gear? 
---
How can anybody im their sane mind can choose ally over horde. Especially after wc3.
---
Not to mention combat felt really disconnected and gimmicky. 
---
There are many misconceptions around the factions and PvE/PvP viabilities.
---
While Alliance racials and especially Paladins make them have an edge in progression, Horde Shamans make Horde more efficient at speed clearing or raiding on farm.
---
Assuming skill and everything else is equal, Alliance will generally progress first, but Horde will farm raids faster after they've initially progressed.
---
I think there is a good opportunity for an MMO in the realm of Diablo or Starcraft. It seems unlikely, but so was the idea of WoW before the new millennium. 
---
A nice balance of RPG elements and smooth gameplay you expect from Blizzard would hook me in.
---
Video doesn't say doomed, it says "won't be authentic." Given that the PvP hasn't even been experienced yet past the demo which was capped at 19, any sort of doomsaying is cringy to say the least.
---
I will, thanks!
---
No one is impressed by that.
---
Wildstar also kind of marketed themselves as the hardcore “grownups” MMO, but A) wasn’t, and B) failed because of so many other reasons. It felt like Rift advertising “You aren’t in Azeroth anymore”. It just felt a little on the nose.
---
I'm going to attempt to "redeem" 15ish yeard old me myself, undead rogue w/ non of the mistakes (save money, no using/rolling on trash gear, clear path of talents and thus no spending a fortune on respecs, etc.), but I'm bringing my SO along for the ride and I hope to vicariously live through her the experience of the game for the first time. 
---
Honestly, I couldn't be more excited. 
---
Discounting ignite mage, troll warrior. BIS for fury is swords so axe spec doesn't do much for orcs, and the haste buff scales very well. Horde because WF.
---
Imagine being so stupid you join the same ninja looter three times in a row tho.
---
"Your account is already logged in"
---
Depends if you mean BIS for the raid tier before or after BWL. If you mean before than do not give up the 3 set bonus. With gearing in AQ and beyond the answer becomes nuanced and I don't know enough offhand to help.
---
TBC - Netherwing
---
Top level non-shit post.  10/10
---
Vanilla 1.12
---
&gt;Play the same faction, race or class?
---
Same all of the above....at first. I'm going to "right" my "wrongs" from a few years ago, but I really only ever played my main save a few alts that only got up to 30, so I want to venture out of my comfort zone and level at least 2 other alts, one will be a support for my SO (since she'll be playing the support roll for our mains) and then probably a hunter or warlock so I can play solo.
---
&gt;Toggle the graphics?
---
I bought computers specifically for Classic WoW (as an American I'm so thankful Blizz announced Classic at Blizz Con in early November, so I was able to get 2 decent computers on a black friday sale), so I'll be playing at Ultra settings to get the experience I couldn't back in 05-06.
---
&gt;Play at 4:3 resolution?
---
Negative
---
&gt;Get together past friends?
---
I've only kept in touch w/ one person I used to play WoW w/ from back in Vanilla, but I may hop on my old character and hit up a few people to see if they're down to play for old times sake. I plan to get the game at least a month before Classic is released so I can play around in retail (among other versions of the game) and get a feel for playing again. 
---
&gt;Snack on old time favourite foods?
---
It's funny to me you bring this up, my mom used to buy [these](https://i.warosu.org/data/ck/img/0068/01/1440222776345.png} in bulk, so during the summer when I was off of school (or really anytime) I'd pop 3 of these in the microwave and eat while playing...unfortunately I've developed diet restrictions and can't eat this particular brand anymore, but I plan on making my own version of them in advance, freezing them so I have them on hand as I'm taking off from work for at least a week and a half when Classic launches. 
---
&gt;Move back into your parents' house?
---
Pfft, beats paying rent :P
---
I was pretty hyped for Ashes of Creation but now it seems it will be DoA. Pantheon however seems very, very promising
---
Priest and Druids used 3PC T2 into TBC. It had to be nerfed, because there was theorycrafting to suggest it would literally never not be BiS if gear continued to scale by the standard ilvl formula. It was changed to 20 mp/5 in patch 2.0.3. Ten Storms, the Shaman 3pc, had a similar issue.
---
Jesus, just realized I'm playing solitaire  ..  this is getting serious.
---
Honor 
---
Vanilla WoW - E*****m server. Blizzlike server, ~1.5k - ~2.5k concurrent population (blizzlike pop).
---
I have alt-idis all the way, leveling so many freating characters 1-60! The journey is my favorite part.
---
This is the correct answer. 
---
I would say legion and classic were equally good but with 2 different target audiences in mind. BfA however is fucking trash. Thats not just my opinion, its fact
---
Except that it's a design philosophy rather than a technological capacity. Says so in their book and everything.  
---
They want a community that exists, ideally, as it did in vanilla. Which requires the same populations. So you have the same number of guilds and same number of familiarity with players.  
---
As someone playing ona  10,000 cap PServer, i can confirm that it entirely hcanges the dynamic of the game.   
---
You are right though, it is interesting they've said nothing about it. Although perhaps it just fits under the 'we want the classic experience to be entirely replicated, minus some insignificant changes, which they DID discuss.   
---
Given the above, it seems sound logic to presume if they've said nothing on it, it will remain the same.  
---
I'm still up for the hat eating :)
---
obviously any system can be exploited. way to truism.
---
stream delay wouldn't stop anyone, it's so easy to find people without Sharding even if you have a 24 hour delay
---
It launched with the hardcore raids everyone clamored for. Arguably the best raids of all time. 
---
I hope you don't mind me asking but why would play on E instead of LH?
---
a LOT. you'll keybind every single totem. you'll keybind rank 1 and max rank of all your shocks for either utility or damage. every spec basically does minimum and max rank for spells, with resto doing up to 4 (reasonably) ranks of healing wave depending on need, ele doing multiple ranks of lightning bolt depending on your spellpower and how long you need to last. it gets complicated :D
---
I'm avoiding private servers--I dabbled with them a little back in the day, but that was a long time ago and I don't want to "spoil" myself for it. (Though the temptation is definitely there).
---
I'm mostly playing Overwatch and Hearts of Iron 4, which is an excellent way to kill an entire afternoon, evening, and sometimes next day.
---
I feel like this video is slightly trolling. But then I noticed it also isnt at the same time 
---
Those are minor issues in the grand scheme of things. The fundamental problem at the core of wildstar was the game was too hardcore and too inaccessible for the average person. 
---
Will also be a ton of forsaken due to the racials. And because of classes. Mages, priests, rogues, are all popular classes that are overwhelmingly undead on the horde side. 
---
Could you please explain the "improved graphics but original models" part? I'm not sure I understand the difference. Would the graphics be old if they use the original models?
---
Racials really do make it easy for me, if this was wrath you best believe I'd be playing a human rogue LOL.
---
The first paragraph was gold then you kinda ran outta steam
---
Maybe, but I'm waiting on it to start happening. 
---

We say the same about you guys... Funny
---
If it's actually bis then it's bis...
---
&gt;Wildstar and modern wow have harsh system reqs
---
You call a first gen i5 and a GeForce GT 560 2GB harsh system requirements? Lol. WoW cam be taxing if you play on everything maxed out and crank the render resolution, but it has such a broad range of graphic settings that you can still run it on toasters. 
---
Chain heal is extremely satisfying when healing five mans.  Once you get a lot of +healing, seeing a rank 1 chain heal keep the whole group up is awesome. I’ll even scoot closer to the tank to get it chained back to me if I need it.  Each jump can crit and increase that persons armor.  
---
The T1 8 set bonus turns your healing waves into monster chain heals that start buffing themselves and at the same time have a high chance to get you mana back from the 5 set bonus.
---
Hunters aren't exactly tanky. In wpvp they can track humanoids which helps a ton but in wpvp they still get utterly wrecked by rogues and if a mage/warrior/warlock jumps you then you're in for a bad time.
---
In BGs however they're great. A rogue can still kill you easily enough, but you can really be a star in group combat with good positioning and aimed/multi or even good use of viper sting!
---
Fwiw I remember them being a total nightmare in vanilla too.
---
Well his group gave the first binding to a paladin, so they clearly didn't know what they were doing.
---
Do mages die a lot in pvp if your not some amazing mage?
---
Downvote for truth...makes sense 
---
Our guild has been recruiting for a while now. EU RP-PvP with around ~130 members so far. We're just chilling until Classic launches.
---
https://youtu.be/9QhChdyOLrs
---
Low lvl PvP as an elemental shaman. Check out his other vids too
---
Do me!
---
Just started playing Path of Exile, loving it so far.
---
Hopefully it will be enough for me to make it until vanilla release.
---
If I could play as a draenei I totally would....but for the most part, fuck allies. Horde is where it's at.
---
The dam at Loch Modan I believe. Would fly over it all the time going from ironforge to western plaguelands. You wouldn’t see it unless you panned your view behind you. 
---
This is classic
---
if it used to be 0.01%, it will absolutely be 0.01% again. 
---
Mods don't care about the rules
---
Retail wow and Total Wat Warhammer II mostly
---
The improved graphics are mostly due to how the new client will handle rendering and shading. Since the game is using newer engines now.
---
Checkout this [album](https://imgur.com/a/xwIFtSP) by /u/turdas
---
It's got a pretty decent comparison of the original 1.12 client, the demo running with the "Classic" preset settings and Max settings.
---
When we had access to the demo some people were flipping out about the graphical changes. Like the amount of [grass](https://i.redd.it/kgsmsdt3twu11.jpg) at max settings.
---
But what most people seem not to know is that [this was somewhat possible](https://imgur.com/a/vqe2kX6) with the original 1.12 client but you needed to manually edit your config.wtf file or use console commands to increase your video settings beyond "max".
---
They're not touching the models at all from my understanding.    
---
So we'll see the original vanilla models and not the updated WoD models (or whenever they were added).
---
Why play on LH instead of E? Both are exceptionally blizzlike. Of course the Classic demo doesn't even begin to compare in terms of authenticity.
---
I went for E instead of LH for the more blizzlike population.
---
Even if you don't spend much time in Shadowform in BGs, Divine Spirit is not worth more than Shadowform. You'll cast Shadowform more than Divine Spirit, which is a huge mana sink for not much return (in PvP). I rarely even cast Fortitude when I res in PvP if I need to get back in the action. Not to mention how much Shadowform will help you in 1v1, farming, 5 mans.
---
Clearly it's the other side of Azeroth. 
---
I logged so many hours of solitaire and minesweeper logged on xfire back in the day when I'd hit my monthly internet cap and basically couldn't do anything else.
---
You just said it can be eliminated by not having loot trading which obviously isn't true. It honestly makes 0 difference to me what system ends up being implemented I just think its hilarious the mental gymnastics some of you guys go through not to face reality.
---
They edited their post to correct the mistake.
---
Thanks for the album!
---
&gt; They're not touching the models at all from my understanding.
---
Bummer, I'm all for graphical and QoL improvements as long as the core gameplay experience remains the same. Might be in the minority there it seems.
---
Just started Witcher 3 for the first time 
---
warframe and archeage.
---
not seriously playing archeage is pretty fun, great graphics , really nice combat.
---
now the developer and publisher did a lot to fuck it up but they have finally put in some systems to help new players gear up. not a lot of people left playing but its probally the best version of the game its ever been.
---
i may give netherwing a go , i planned to but the word of shitty performance turned me off a bit. 
---
is netherwing populated enough to do a lot of the leveling process in dungeons? dont think i can be bothered questing to max atm
---
i actually sort of agree with this id consider tbc but yeah ill leave vanilla for classic
---
yeah really good game , ive played it e ough im a bit sick of it but that took about 7k hours
---
I can see where your coming from in that sense, as I personally also like the synergy of the orcs, trolls, and tauren, thanks to the shaman and savage feeling they embody, but too me that's why I liked the Forsaken being a part of the horde. In my mind they added something different and it was cool to see the interactions between races like the tauren and the forsaken, as they ally out of necessity and they cause a bit of tension within the ranks. If it wasn't for the forsaken, the horde would have been far less unpredictable I feel.
---
Until Blizz see that Classic was a huge success and decide to bring out *Classic - TBC*, the bulk of the population leaves for the **F R E S H** and Blizz shuts down the Classic servers because there's no longer enough interest.
---
This is an excellent point. 
---
The same thing happens if after a few months after release, you aren’t happy with your original class/faction or maybe even server that you chose. You can easily start over again without being so far behind the pack or a fear of fully missing out on content because of future patches. 
---
The same content e.g. MC, Ony... dungeons like BRD and later DM remain relevant for essentially the entire lifespan of the game. 
---
Another underrated advantage of Classic. 
---
I've seen a few posts here and there where people have been trying to start up guilds already.
---
We've also got the weekly [Looking for Group Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/adg4ln/looking_for_group_monday_january_07_2019/) posts for that sort of thing.
---
You might also like the [What Should I Play Wednesdays](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ae58t9/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_january_09_2019/) posts.
---
But your boy Drek'Thar though. 
---
There's certainly some people that would like to see the WoD models as a non-default option. But I think some of them might have different clipping sizes which would cause some unforeseen issues.    
---
Or a lot of extra work from Blizzard.
---
I personally would like to see the old models receive a bit of a polish so they look cleaner/HD.    
---
But I'd take the original old models over the newer WoD ones.
---
How will they know to blacklist me? If I already have Dal'Rend's set, I can just equip Mirah's Song/Thrash Blade for the UBRS run and roll for my friend or guildmate on the MH/OH.  
---
I can Need roll on the item OR /roll even if it's Master Loot, doubling our chances. I'll just hand it to him after the run in Ironforge. 
---
When I was farming Mc rep back in mop I got both binding in the same run, on my druid. rip
---
There's a lot of truth in this. Anytime a fresh realm will get released you'll divide the population, and if another 'classic expansion' releases you'll divide the population, maybe even cripple it in these instances. 
---
Then what? Do they consolidate servers? Redo battle groups?  Will old realms absorb new realms once they get to the final 'patch'? Or just let them peeter out?  
---
wow your a retard. yeah bud im a total snowflake for saying blizzard is more likely to go with a drop late they had later on in vanilla. i guess im also a snowflake for thinking that blizzard isnt going to use every early talent and every early spell changes for every patch. and for that matter i dont beleive it ever had a 0.01% drop rate and its simply something you made up
---
Overwatch when friends are on, Civ6, occasional Vermintide 2 for some fun mindless rat-smashing.
---
Otherwise kinda just waiting on Kingdom Hearts 3 and the Resident Evil 2 remake.
---
He'll have to resub for classic so what's the difference?
---
If keeping 3-piece T2 is better than the "BiS" pieces from later raid tiers, then those pieces aren't actually BiS.
---
I always wondered this... You know what happens when the day comes that the game really does die.. what are the few left to do that have different interests, it would be cool to have a offline WoW mode with AI players, you could play solo and run around seeing other "players" but they are really just AI and they are only in the areas you are in and always around your level and if you needed to do dungeons or raids you could group up with them to do runs
---
if for some reason at one point in early vanilla it was 0.01% well it wasnt later on and ill tell you blizzard wont make it 0.01%. and i want to see some proof it was ever 0.01% drop rate? 
---
Yes, you're a snowflake. Lets take a walk down to the way back machine...
---
Here is Thottbot in 2006...
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20071012041632/http://thottbot.com:80/i18564
---
Sorry, it as 0.2% drop rate… my bad
---
id love singleplayer wow but i feel like it would be an rpg type game similar to minecraft actually. not random generated like minecraft it would obviously be in toe wow universe.
---
maybe more like skyrim i guess thats a better comparison where you get loot and do dungeons and maybe have a party of npc's you can pick and have follow you around.
---
There's something very disturbing about that idea.
---
October 2007? way past vanilla and it says 0.2% drop rate? fact of the matter is its 3% drop rate in vanilla. maybe for some reason it was 0.2% in early vanilla? i dont believe that but if so blizzard would go for the drop rate they had later in vanilla. just like they will use later talents
---
Wouldn't be remotely surprised to find out that a couple of hardcore guilds on each faction already have a full raiding roster ready to go.
---
I haven't played since WotLK, so I haven't seen them to be honest. But yes that's what I mean - if I'm playing an MMO in 2019 I'd like to see HD textures.
---
Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
---
Drop chance - Eye of Sulfuras:
---
3.73% for 1 run
---
31.62% for 10 runs
---
53.25% for 20 runs
---
68.03% for 30 runs
---
90.00% for 61 runs
---
99.00% for 121 runs
---
As someone who mained a resto druid in vanilla, I wouldn't dream of raiding without 3 pieces of Stormrage. If you have a look at the 8 piece naxx (Dreamwalker) which gives you 30% of your mana after a crit healing touch, thats pretty great, but Druid's tend not to have a lot of spell crit, nor would you get a lot of mana back from a 200 mana rank 4 healing touch even if it did crit.
---
On top of that, Dreamwalker, basically is best in slot for most pieces of gear, but the gap between some pieces of T2 and T2 is larger than others,  so a few wiggles here and there are more than capable of accomodating 3 pieces of Stormrage.
---
It's hard to put into words how good the mana regen actually is, especially when stacked with the 15% mana talent, dark moon blue dragon, mp5 on gear, etc. I could definitely burn myself down on mana if I wanted to, but if I didn't want to, I could stay pretty juiced on most boss fights.
---
again your "proof" sucks because when you go back to even augest 2007 it will bring the drop rate to %1.5 drop. so that is not proof of 0.2% drop rate
---
AHA! So you DO have a job!
---
If it was a 2% drop rate... It will still be incredibly hard and take about a year of doing Molten Core every week to get both bindings. I knew people who ran it religiously and never got the weapon. I am sorry the site isn't up any longer... The data you're using is for current WoW not classic. So the whole point is moot. Run the numbers using old values. Then the data will be more realistic. 
---
if it was 2% drop rate your damn right it will be hard but the arguement is that you said it will be as low as 0.01% or 0.2% which i dont agree with. in your own very source as ive said above when you go back a month it increases in drop rate? and your own source is during tbc time. 
---
Torchlight 2, pretty fun Diablo clone.
---
I will probably play alliance this time. During WoW I mostly played Horde in the past. 
---
One of my motivations is that I want to main Druid, like I did before and Night Elf Druid forms just look better. Especially Tauren cat form looks like some weird kind of wyvern hybrid.
---
As for alts I would love to play Warrior, Warlock and Shaman, but seems Shaman will not be an option for me, since I will main alliance. Or I'd have to roll him on another server, not sure about that.
---
amen to that, being able to afk underwater is so fantastic to avoid ganks
---
I think of games like WoW as a balance between convenience and immersion. More specifically, role playing immersion and digital game world convenience. I think the two are generally at odds with one another, and games like WoW are all about how you balance the two. Said differently, role playing aspects are typically inconvenient, and making the game convenient typically lowers role playing immersion.
---
Vanilla WoW was the version of WoW that most heavily tilted the balance in favor of immersion at the cost of convenience. Leveling to 60 was such a time consuming adventure, most people had only one 60 during vanilla. You didn't know how to use all weapons on a new character (inconvenient), so if you got a cool new green 2h mace that'll really increase your DPS, you now are motivated to find the 2H mace trainer. So you go to the capital city, experience the beautiful walk-up and blow most of your money and equip the mace. Things like weapon training, learning spells every other level, no flying, mounts at 40, minimal movement speed increases, no group finder, etc etc are less convenient, but they greatly increase immersion and attachment to the game.
---
Modern WoW has slowly, but steadily tilted the balance completely in the direction of convenience at the cost of immersion. When the tilt started in BC, people liked some changes. They continued the tilt in WotLK where many people would say they enjoyed the game the most. I think this was the expansion Blizzard balanced RP immersion and convenience the best. As the tilt has continued and now you insta-queue into a dungeon, click one button and teleport to it. You are given all quests when you zone in, don't bother CCing anything because you can 3-shot "elite" mobs, don't have any keys, and follow the single lane theme park ride to the end. You spank the final boss in 15 mins and teleport back to your capital city.
---
As immersion has decreased, player power has increased too much. We used to be and nobody doing heroic things, now we are heroes doing nothing... 
---
This is going back further...[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313194504/http://www.thottbot.com:80/i18564](https://web.archive.org/web/20070313194504/http://www.thottbot.com:80/i18564)
---
Alliance because they are the underdogs.
---
Horde are mostly elitist nubs who need OP racials to do well. Ally has the people that are more genuine and honest. Horde attracts your scammers and exploiters, as well as the edgy teens who want to be “evil” characters because it’s “cool”. Alliance is your college graduates and intellectuals, whereas horde is the beginner faction the nubs are attracted to.
---
Also, I can’t imagine *not* playing a Night Elf. They are the coolest looking race, coolest mounts, best zones, best music, need I say any more?
---
Haha no.
---
...but you can have Thottbot.
---
Foxhole. Lots of team-working and actually talking to others to get certain tasks done. Chances to randomly work together with strangers to tackle a task are plentiful. 
---
I'm always in hopes that in 2-5 years time the meta will be how many meme specs can we push through content.
---
When everyone is maxed out in gear, it will be fun to mix it up. "You think you're guild is good? We cleared naxx without a single warrior!" Think of the size of that dick.
---
And this is why we have the luxury of taking our time with the levelling experience. There's nothing to 'catch up' to. 
---
yes going further back into tbc and showing with drop rate as low of 0.7 to 6.8. so i guess this is the drop rate of being 0.2% proof in vanilla?
---
See your last statement would be an incredible thing for Blizzard, and both a way to keep Vanilla/TBC style content brand new and make them a lot of money. Why they left their most successful method of cash whoring I'll never know. It was good for us and good for them. 
---
This guy must be a shill or something.
---
E now sell gold, characters, vanity items and exp boosts directly from their site.
---
Totally Blizzlike.
---
Escape from tarkov, but I always play it
---
Bullshit. As soon as nax is released anyone is anything less thatn T2 gets completly skullfucked by anyone in Naxx gear.
---
There were no seasons in vanilla 
---
Yeah, because everyone is just going to be walking around with Naxx gear...
---
Not only is Naxx gear incredibly hard to get, but people with it tend not to bump into people without it very frequently. Casuals and Hardcore players run in different circles.
---
is it finally working?
---
Check out money bags over here.
---
:P
---
Oh don't worry it's going to suck regardless lol.
---
Cept BGs
---
+Weapon skill has diminishing returns and with lategame itemization yeah troll pulls slightly ahead because berserking scales where blood fury is a static amount of AP. It's a very marginal ( dismissable ) difference in dps throughout a single raid and orc crushes in comparison for PvP which is why you never see troll warriors even in the min/max pserver meta.
---
You've misunderstood what he's saying. He's talking about content being relevant from a progression stand point. 
---
BfD is about to be released in retail, which means there's no reason for a guild to progress through Uldir since M Uldir gear is equivalent to N BfD gear. Because Vanilla doesn't have different difficulties for the same dungeon, a player would need to progress through Ony -&gt; MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; AQ40 -&gt; Naxx unless they're being carried. In Vanilla there were plenty of guilds progressing through MC while others were downing bosses in Naxx.
---
And a technique called "power shifting" with macros 
---
/pat all kitties
---
Unless they are just destroying people for fun, hardcore pve players tend to roll in premades. Sure you might run into them and get trashed, but if youre not in a premade you're probably getting trashed anyways so what is the difference.
---
Ah, a fellow person of culture.
---
Regardless of all this back and forth. The first year at max you could kill the two bosses around 52 times (realistically 48). So... the more time that goes on the drop rate will increase. 
---
That was my mindset when I was young and played the first few... fuck you brought me back
---
dude just admit you were wrong. when have i ever said you could get bindings in like 2 runs? of course it can take years to get it but not 10 thousand runs (0.01%) or 0.2%. and if it was 0.01% during a month in vanilla my arguement is that blizzard would use the drop rate they had later on in vanilla which is around 3% and for that you acted like i was some casual scum bag that wanted legendaries handed out to me. so just admit you were wrong 
---
This happened on non RP servers as well.
---
If you have good ping and reflexes then you'll usually last a while as a mage, unless an overgeared rogue jumps you or something like that.
---
TBH I'm hoping tbc does come out. I'll be experiencing vanilla for the first time and when I've got my ceiling there I'll get to relive my first wow experience in tbc. I'm excited to see og WoW as it was but I can't wait to do original Kara, ssc and tk again, and get the chance to see bt as current content. Tbc is when wow peaked for me and the thought of seeing it again makes me happy
---
You cant make it before BWL because you need Elementium Ore which only drops from techs in there. 
---
We are both wrong. Both of our values are not accurate to vanilla...The percent would increase as time increased. The more kills will increase the percent. The first year would have the lowest percent, increasing as time went on. The drop rate was never increased (according to patch notes) and if it was it was never stated. 
---
LOL yeah thats why every single private server dies almost instantly when naxx drops. And it has abosutley nothing to do with the INSANE fucking power"creep" of gear that naxx provides.
---
no we arnt both wrong just you 
---
I honestly do hope for a TBC release. It’s my main drive for a successful classic experience, but if it doesnt end up happening I would be satisfied with just classic. 
---
If TBC servers do come out I personally only want it done in a specific way; a new TBC server that people can copy their existing classic characters to so that the original server is preserved, and an additional fresh launch vanilla server for those not interested in TBC. 
---
Looking at existing private server populations now I have no worries about the activity on each of the servers. As they say, life finds a way. 
---
Destoying people for fun???. Thats exactly whats wrong with the vanilla powercreep. You shouldnt be able to destroy people for fun you fucking idiot because of the gear u have equiped.
---
If you could do the same for me I would appreciate it.
---
Everyone has their own unique experiences and you can't take that away.
---
And many people have their arguments and counter arguments of what classic should be and what or how to play.
---
But, we will all be there when classic launches and it will be awesome.
---
Progression of gear has been in every fucking instance/Expansion of wow ever created. Please let me see you kill a competent pvper in prebis when hes wearing naxx. It wont happen. Naxx gear and general powercreep is FUCKED, because it is based off a time when dev's were trying to incentivise some HARD content for it's time and wanted to reward the hardcore 2004/2005 raiders for their insane dedication and effort.
---
This dosen't hold up in 2018 sorry.
---
Many people share your opinion.
---
I'm a bit torn. I really did enjoy raiding Kara. And I'll even admit that I really liked the early LFG tool, with the exception of the summoning stone part of it. There's nothing I hate more than doing laps of a city spamming trade/lfg for hours.
---
^^^\(Yes, ^^^I ^^^know ^^^there ^^^are ^^^alternatives ^^^like ^^^using ^^^/who ^^^and ^^^spamming ^^^every ^^^individual ^^^on ^^^the ^^^server. ^^^Or ^^^adding ^^^people ^^^to ^^^friends ^^^list ^^^etc. ^^^etc. ^^^I've ^^^made ^^^this ^^^comment ^^^many ^^^times ^^^before.)
---
But TBC ripped my guild in half with the raid size decrease. And the introduction of arenas and resilience gear destroyed PvP for me.    
---
I didn't have the time back then to dedicate myself to both PvE and PvP. And I sure as shit don't have the time now.
---
We've been begging Blizzard for Classic for so long now.    
---
I really don't want to find myself back on the private servers again because I've lost Classic to TBC, again.
---
Maybe Vindictive will kick Brimstone in the nuts so hard they’ll all server transfer again.
---
I would say he definitely exaggerated at some points about staging PvE problems. The only thing i could foresee is vanilla players from 2004 not having nearly as much time they did when they played back then. This means that every time schedule would be inflated. 
---
&gt;Other than that, yeah spell batching will create issues for sure and will determine a handful of fights. Completely changing the META? Eh... yeah I would say you exaggerated a tad bit there but to each their own!
---
This is where you're *dead wrong*. I played a mage and rogue throughout vanilla was a die-hard PvP'er. I also played pretty much every class to 2000+ rating during BC and WotLK and a multi-gladiator Mage and Rogue. There are so many instinctual timings built into how you play against every class. Changing them even slightly would definitely change the meta for every class that depends heavily on CC. There are so many interactions and options that will be stripped from the meta making it a lot more generic and predictable and lop-side previously skill-based matchups. This change in meta might still be enjoyable but would definitely be a huge thorn in anyone's side looking for an authentic Classic PvP experience. 
---
*\*The Rogue Gouge re-stealth thing will most likely get hot-fixed because otherwise that would make rogues absolute demigods on top of their vanilla prevalance in pvp. so let's ignore that.*
---
**Rogue** vs. **Rogue** (duel)
---
\*Before resilience, and lower rogue burst, this duel was decided inside a single CS/KS combo. First person to get trinket then combo wins the duel.
---
\-Rogue\[1\] gets Sap/CS into Rogue\[2\]'s instant trinket before GCD to prevent rupture. This timing is pretty much second-nature to any Rogue and will almost always occur in either a landed Blind where Rogue\[1\] wins or Rogue\[2\] lands his Vanish CS into a variety of flashy duels. Without ability to Vanish a Blind this duel in Vanilla is essentially pointless or boring. The Rogue\[2\] will almost always die in the DR'd CS/KS aftermath.
---
\-Can no longer Gouge a Rogue's KS. This is hard to land but occurs often by chance and prolongs rogue duels significantly. With CD timer addons this was almost guaranteed to land in a long duel. 
---
(world pvp/BG's)
---
\-Can no longer Vanish a Rogue's CS.  A lot of times if you see a rogue in stealth just before they open on you this was very possible. Also if you knew a Rogue was around and would open on you quickly after you unstealthing this was also very possible with good timing.
---
\-Vanish Sap a Rogue' Vanish. I'm not sure how this is affected but it was an very flash move that was amazing to pull off, especially after vanishing a Rogue's Cheapshot bringing him out of stealth without bringing him into combat. I remember watching this in WotLK from Khuna but it wasn't really relevant in Vanilla BC. Although not being able to take this skill back would be really disappointing. 
---
**Rogue vs. Warlock**
---
\- Can no longer Vanish Deathcoils properly. For non-UD Rogues this is pretty important. You can still win the duel but vanishing the deathcoil was so satisfying and pretty much insta-wins a duel. 
---
**Mage vs. Priest**
---
\-Can priests still death polymorphs? If not, This really shifts meta since now a healing Priest has no recourse over the massive amount CC a Mage has without trinket. This also significantly reduces the ability of Spriests to chase down mages since they can always freely disengage where as before you could trinket the first poly, SWD the second and they pretty much had to face you.
---
**Priest vs. Rogue**
---
\-Screaming the Cheapshot or KS in a duel or BG/Wpvp pretty much won the situation. With a CD Timer in a prolonged duel, this was easy to time. Without this priests are significantly weaker against an already strong class. 
---
\-Death'ing a Blind is pretty situational but not as hard to time as you think when a rogue is changes directions and B-lines for you. If this is affected, its not gonna shift the meta but it definitely makes the matchup less fun.
---
**Rogue** vs. **Mage** 
---
\-Interrupting vanishes with fire blast and CS were hard to time on purpose but paid off huge when it worked. Although, this happens very often just by chance. Without this, rogues are significantly stronger against mages (and every other class as well).
---
\-(WPvP) The interaction between a crippling poison proc and jumping is pretty core to how a mage kites a rogue. Is this affected? If so it makes rogues much stronger against mages 1v1. 
---
\-(Duel) Cheap-shot into timed gouge on the blink opener no longer viable. This opener is hard to pull of but when landed pretty much wins the duel. The garrote opener isn't viable against mages who start mount (Shiv wasn't in Vanilla). 
---
There are many more interactions but I just listed those I'm very intimate with. I'm sure every class has interactions they expect to come back and if not will be sorely disappointed in PvP.
---
Explain...You understand when someone does something more...and it is available to more people the chance will also increase...making the numbers skewed from the original first 54 kills. When classic comes out we are starting at zero. Your numbers will not make sense until 1.5 to 2 years after release. I am sorry to tell you but you're wrong as well. The reality is when vanilla comes out you will play for a month and quit. If you make it past a month, you will quit shortly after because raiding is going to be hard as fuck with all the snow flakes that want to play "vanilla" for the first time. The game is hard. So you can run numbers all you like. But at the end of the day you will never see the bindings, nor obtain a Thunderfury (nor will I)… 
---
&gt;back then a Warrior getting it was priority
---
No, back then people mostly did whatever. People were generally smart enough to realise that a Hunter or a Paladin couldn't really do any good with them, but many of the more casual guilds also didn't care and just let anyone who could potentially equip it roll for it. 
---
Even many of the more knowledgeable guilds didn't differentiate between Rogues and Warriors at all, because they weren't aware of the threat multiplier and just figured they needed it for the debuff. And when purely looking at the debuff uptime, Rogues actually seem quite attractive for it at a glance, due to their attack speed bonus on Slice &amp; Dice.
---
There really weren't that many guilds that truly knew what they were doing with Thunderfury back then, from my experience.
---
My man! Buffs for all
---
This. I feel like most of these posts are made by people who didn't play classic.
---
You feel like a tramp in your 6/8 T2 when you see people running around in aq40/max gear. 
---
I can kinda imagine them eventually having optional TBC and WoTLK realms in addition to the vanilla ones in the future, but I think they are primarily vanilla-focused.
---
Skyrim, Dragon Age, Don't Starve, Nancy Drew, and working my way through the Witcher series for the first time. I was thinking just the other day that I miss doing some proper grinding, though. Sometimes it's nice just to turn your brain off and do something repetitive and boring for a while.  I haven't been able to find a good substitute for that yet.
---
The common trend amoung pservers over the past 4 years has been MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; ~~AQ40~~ nvm, I'm bored -&gt; F R E S H
---
Currently that fresh is the new TBC server.    
---
I expect to see a large drop in population on the current large vanilla server.    
---
(It's already been happening actually, we're down to like 6k, from the 14k peak.)
---
In the same way that I expect to see a large drop to any remaining Classic servers when/if Classic - TBC becomes a reality.
---
Many people want to see Classic - TBC. And that's fine    
---
But I'd be very surprised if Classic survives long after Classic - TBC is released.
---
A few months prior to tbc you would have dozens of guilds on servers who had at least downed a couple of bosses in nax and cleared Aq40.
---
Now people know how to do bosses you will see mc being cleared in the first week, BWL possibly the first or maximum by the 3rd, ZG in first week, AQ20 probably first week and Nax and Aq40 at most a month.
---
The cockblock put in by blizzard in Aq40 probably won't be in this iteration of classic either since it was a mistake. 
---
Currently playing a little on naughty servers trying to decide a main, otherwise Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is kinda single-player mmo-ish so that's keeping me happy otherwise.
---
ROFL after being defeated in an arguement all you can do next is insult me by calling me a casual snowflake again. the reality is that ive played many many 1.12 servers and leveled 1x on them many times and even got a legendary. ive spent 12 hours a day for months farming black lotuses all day. im not proud of how much ive played but dont make stuff up and call me a casual once you realized you were wrong and cant admit it.
---
you said 0.01% drop rate. i said if for some reason blizzard had 0.01% drop rate at one point in vanilla they will use the 3% drop rate they had in vanilla not 0.01% (10 thousand for one binding) and then after you insulted me for not agreeing with your retard assessment. and then with your dubious "source" you claimed its 0.2% drop rate. im using logic in this arguement when i said its not going to be 0.01 or 0.2% while you can only claim i want it to be something super high so i can get free legendarys out of selfishness. obviously the drop rate is around 3% and NOT 0.01 or 0.2. 
---
&gt; You understand when someone does something more...and it is available to more people the chance will also increase...
---
That's not how probability works.
---
&gt;TheSinglePlayerProject
---
No, but I googled it immediatly. Looks interesting :) Thanks!
---
Thottbot was the only source...back then... calling it dubious just shows how naïve you are to vanilla. enjoy!
---
If that's the case I would like to see them out of the ability to copy over your character rather than choosing to progress it on that same server. I'd love to have level 60, 70, and 80 version of my character if I so choose that way I can choose what expansion I feel like playing.
---
and your "source" was from 2007 for one month where it said 0.2% drop rate and everything before much higher including up to 6%!! thats why i said its dubious. 
---
Probability increase with sample size...and will get close to x.
---
Yup! Fixed crashes , come play
---
Are you implying that will of the forsaken isn't an amazing racial? 
---
Yea. Doomed is exaggeration. 100% of people who actually played vanilla/BC will notice but 90% will probably get over it. Although for the 10% of players who were hardcore PvP'ers and who depended on these mechanics for their competitive edge, it's a death sentence. The difference between two top players is insignificant so any small advantage is huge. 
---
For me personally, who planned on coming back after not playing since WotLK, I was excited to come back and focus on the PvE side instead of PvP. But the lack of authenticity would make the whole experience underwhelming and the occasional PvP side unbearable. 
---
Same here. I was a poor student when WoW came out, so I played private with shitty bugs and low populations - but had a blast because it was with friends.
---
I'm hoping to recreate at least some of that experience going forward. I think ideally it'd be good if they kept a classic server for those that wish to stay, and opened up a TBC server for those that wish to continue. 
---
&gt; maybe something like a tauren druid or whatever isn't the norm.
---
Taurens are the only ones who can be druids on the horde side, so that's not particularly unique. 
---
ban anyone who downvoted this.
---
Please no horde thanks
---
This is the kind of post this sub needs.
---
Because the things he auctions now might not be worth anything later
---
I will roll PVE only because of Naxx. 
---
Seeing what they are doing to the battle.net app and the WoW client i'd say theres deffo a possibility it will be the same client a they are changing the client to not require seperatie installs for beta's / ptr and the live game. 
---
They changes this, PTR can now use the same install a the live client. 
---
i'm avoiding private servers, don't wanna get burned out, so path of exile, league.
---
I think they are looking for a database that has the actual values of those &lt;random enchants&gt; on the item pieces. 
---
I noticed in my years of trying to make gear tables for my classes items at the same level will have different armor values and different &lt;of the bear&gt; &lt;of the monkey&gt; values. One piece might have more armor but would have lower stats. Or pieces might be almost identical but one of them will have like 1 or 2 more of a stat for no discerning reason. In later itemization you'll find +healing on greens better than rare and epics. 
---
So they are probably trying to min max with the greens. I've never seen an online database have these values. I would look up the level range, get the names of the pieces, find them in game (usually ah) and record their values. 
---
The closest I came was a long time ago I found a site with the ranges the gear at certain levels would have, but you still had to estimate, and have long since lost it.
---
Sorry I can't actually point you to concrete help.
---
Vendorstrike 100% for 1 run, 100% for 10 runs.
---
&gt; When Dire Maul was released on MC, there were exactly 0 guilds who had fulled cleared MC, so if they were to release Dire Maul with MC it would be the exact same experience as 100% of the players who played retail vanilla. They had DM gear when they full cleared MC and they will in classic. 
---
that's actually bulshit because you will go into MC with 1.12 patch talents which makes the raid virtually a LFR walk since 1.12 talents are tuned for Naxx and not MC. 
---
this is exactly vanilla retuned for retail players or the same bulshit that's happening now on private servers :)
---
also 90% of the MC bosses were downed BEFORE DM patch
---

method vanilla raid history 
---
[Majordomo Executus  Afterlife (US)10.02.2005](https://www.method.gg/raid-history)
---
so yeah, you're missing a whole lot
---
Baldurs Gate, Dragon Age, Arcanum, Civ
---
Cool. Thanks for the info
---
Stable as! 
---
Old content in retail wow. I never played past wrath so I figured I'd see what other expansions had and some stuff is pretty cool. Also brown orcs.
---
Cool dude enjoy clearing naxx untill u cleared naxx then its just dead content.
---
Yea so Xjum has posted his [billing info showing he wasn't subscribed in 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHUUU_P0bjo). This is a straight lie.
---
No I’m not... first off I didn’t say anything about talents I was talking specifically about timeframes of Mc being out and dm being out.  
---
And the fact still stands... DM gear was available before Mc was cleared period end of story.  Not to mention 99.9999999% of people didn’t even step foot in Mc yet let alone working on rag.
---
Nothing I said was bullshit.  If you disagree then I’m sorry. 
---
Nice joke, "crashes fixed" meaning it doesn't go down every 15min but every 30min instead
---
This gets mentioned wayyy to rarely and is one of the biggest reasons I’ll come back to classic after 8 years. Especially now that most people are older and just don’t have the time to constantly chase a gear spiral because of new content.
---
With the time I got on my hands I need my progress to sustain its usefulness.
---
Well the idea of twinks and twinking wasn’t as known as it is now 10+ years down the road. With all of the min/maxing, you really don’t think there’s going to be any issue relating to new players trying out bgs for the first time and getting 1 hit by a twink premade and just unable to play? 
---
You’ve still misunderstood what he’s said. 
---
Same
---
Which is why Vanilla was, and Classic is, best to not be balanced around PVP. :thumbs_up:
---
Cool dude enjoy retail.
---
We’ll love Classic for what it is :)
---
yep agreed imagine if vanlla dungeons gave you tokens for t2.5 gear and onslaught girdle and other bis peices from mc or bwl were on a vendor for dungeon tokens. even though naxx gear is super op at least it doesnt make the other content feel useless 
---
I want TBC to be the golden standard honestly. It was just better. Arenas alone were almost the only thing I did once they were introduced. They saved the game for many years imo. 
---
That's simply not true. Bonereavers edge and Spinal Reaper will hold up as decent 2hander PvP weapons for the entirety of the expansion. Only KT really starts to shake things up and introduce TBC weapons, but even no pservers not many people clear Naxx that fast, so if you buddy up, you will still be able to bring down enemies 3v1 if you know what youre doing. No such thing in retail WoW in which you start to clear bosses solo from the same expansion pack when you are at the last tier of said expansion.
---
Hah, think you've got me beat then! 
---
the experience CANT be 100% the exact same experience with different talents.
---
&gt;  Not to mention 99.9999999% of people didn’t even step foot in Mc yet let alone working on rag during this time
---
is there a proof to this or should i believe you because you're a random person on the internet and the etiquette says so? because I KNOW that 348.67777777% set foot in MC before DM patch. 
---
back in the real world though,  90% of the content was down BEFORE DM PATCH and this is [clear data not some assumed bulshit](https://www.method.gg/raid-history).
---
you're sorry? you've lost your teddy bear or what are you sorry about? 
---
this is a debate based on logic not on how you feel. most of the things you said are bulshit and you cant prove different.
---
Yep
---
Well, once you beat the game on a server, there isnt much to do. Is this breaking news for you? Do you reaload Dark Souls before the last boss time and again to not be out of content anymore?
---
Dont talk about retail, like its acutally world of warcraft lol. 
---
What if there was no level increase and minimal gear power increase? We could focus on reputation and gear for different situations. This is what I dream of.
---
Tell that to the shaman who wears 5/8 T2 for most of the expansion, because of its very good stats and  +sp. Mix in a MC/ZG trinket and elemental fury shoulders and pants, you still reck people just fine. 
---
This isnt a 1v1 arena shooter, you can bring a warrior friend with Spinal Reaper/BRE/Ashkandi (all weapons from tier1/2) and wreck the rogue in T3.
---
He said he looted it to himself. Can only imagine he was ML at the time. You're not wrong though. 
---
Would love to have TBC! 
---
Do you think vanishing stuff like  deathcoil will be possible?
---
Guess it depends what type of guild you were in. My guild wasn't quite that awful. Wasn't the best but knew that you didn't give a binding to non warriors or rogues if it was going spare (my brother got one half on his rogue) 
---
That's a big assumption they'll keep Vanilla going for many years. I don't see that happening.
---
Nah up for 8hr + stretches today. Bad crashing is definitely over.
---
They promised not to.
---
pre-bwl era best era. been saying this for years. 
---
vanilla powercreep is insane tho, mc - naxx is like an expac's worth of growth in power.
---
Loot trading for money is a HUGE difference from vanilla. Learn your stuff dude, and stop spreading misinformation. 
---
Some minority of people will exploit this to the max and that is the issue
---
Google Netherwing.
---
Joined it yesterday! Feels great. 
---
No, Classic will sustain as will TBC.
---
I'd love for it to be possible but I don't think it will be, if you can provide a source that would be great, if not then we'll have to see.
---
disconnected combat and no content are minor issues?
---
It's the rares that he was talking about. Blizzard started going in the right direction with one shots if you didn't avoid stuff. I wish that was still in. 
---
I know, but let them pay for classic sub with retail gold for all i care. 
---
The only thing that matters is that you can't directly sell tokens on classic to gain gold.
---
yes, that one is pretty good too!
---
it didnt fail because of raid difficulty it failed because there was nothing to do besides that. players need variety thats why classic wow has such staying power most players dont login raid then logout for the week as they do with most mmorpgs nowadays.
---
i found rift to be amazing until they put in the second raid and started nerfing content and making things much easier to expand their playerbase to the super casuals, rift was never hardcore but when they made it even easier alot of players gave it up because content was being consumed faster than they could make it, much like retail wow as it is today.
---
Got my tf in mop after 35 runs. Then In WoD after only 2 runs. Some guilds are going to have several of these and most will likely have 1 or none.
---
I kinda feel bad for new players thinking they will get one without being a tank
---
So you are saying that no game progression is a good thing?????
---
You should keep your old gear for time walking.
---
Are you suffering from binary thinking? Loot trading will make ninjaing worse, because it enables systematic ninjaing, especially from MC/ony/ZG pugs and similar.
---
Thus both are true:
---
- ninjaing is risky because it wears on you reputation
---
- ninja looting should not be made easier or more profitable through game systems
---
But it wont
---
Retail, new raid soon. 
---
I'm looking forward to the return of 19 and 29 twinks.
---
yeah, or it could not. nobody knows.
---
Lol, Ony. It's about the journey, not the destination.
---
why would the current generation like it any less that our generation?
---
Yup ! Why not other extensions with classic playstyle :)
---
Point still stands. Gear from earlier tiers is far from usless. Hell, ToeP from fockin MC is a great item through all of vanilla for PvP and even naxx raiding mages will want to get it for outdoor endeavors. 
---
And dont forget lvl 36 trinkets that people will fight over tooth and nail in Arathi: Tidal Charm
---
There is a minority of dimwits who argue that blizz bothers to jump through PR hoops to implement loot trading for ‘greed’ items only - despite the fact that this covers about 0.1% of all loot support cases, despite the cost cutting agenda, and in spite of knowing that 100 GM’s getting shown the door in blizz. It blows my mind every time I see it. Oh, and because, “it could be implemented that way”. LOL
---
Well, if You want to be in a decent guild, rerolling Will set You back alot. Since vanilla is pretty gear dependtent
---
Nice try, sir.
---
As of late either nothing or black ops 4...ashamed I bought another fucking cod, originally just wanted to get it for blackout....annnd I end up playing multiplayer. If you want an MMORPG suggestion ESO isn't terrible, it's not WoW classic, but it's alright. My only real criticism of it is horrendous PvP balance which idk if you care about PvP. Champion points (same thing as paragon levels in Diablo) kinda make old PvE content completely irrelevant. Kind of a dickish playerbase too, I mean that's all games, but there's certain ones that seem kinda more commonplace than others. Honestly in the 10 years I played WoW it's one of the best playerbases I've seen as far as toxicity goes...except modern WoW...people aren't joking about how bad it has gotten and I'm not being bias either cause I don't like the game design. 
---
Its been up for 16 hours as of right now. Stay salty kiddo
---
I am praying, truly praying, that we won't see stupid shit like itemscore or stuff like that. Because I can already see those retards being like "LFM UBRS, 500+ iscore only" (drops 450pieces, figuratively speaken). That's kind of the one thing where I feel idiots can destroy fun for many people who don't have many friends to play with.
---
Even most private server gms aren't that blatantly corrupt, at least not in that way.
---
I hope not, that would make it worse.
---
Why mention leveling specs? Those should be a given.
---
You can make do just fine with pvp gear, though raiders will eventually have far better stuff.
---
Looking for a different MMO, or something competitive to play instead of retail because I just can't bring myself to resubbing to such a horrible expansion as BfA until Classic comes out.
---
Maybe I might reinstall Overwatch, because from what I've seen it's the only Blizzard game these days that isn't in a bad state, or I might try to get back to DotA 2 after promising myself I'm done with that game. Just something until Classic comes out.
---
But you can get out of combat when fighting another player. Warriors do it a lot to be able to charge. 
---
ive seen the glaives 3 times in like 10 BT mogruns on my palading
---
first time i was wow, too bad i cant use them
---
next run i was wow, those again!?
---
third run i was ok, idc
---
never got the 2nd bindings after i got the first half on the first or 2nd clear and stopped farming after 30 runs or so.
---
It sure is. I never played Diablo but I have played Torchlight I &amp; II and I loved them.
---
Depends on if you need a subscription or not to play classic.

Same, but I decided to check the netherwing hype. I quit within the first 30 mins, not because of the crashing or anything, I quit pretty much all private servers within a couple hours simply because I can never shake the feeling of it being artificial and I've always got the thought of me working on a character for nothing and all the shady shit from people running them throughout the history of them. Only server I've actually put a decent amount of time into is RetroWoW and that's just because I didn't feel like I was wasting my time and love on a toon I'm not gonna keep anyway once classic hits felt like I was just playing a PTR toon. There's too much unpredictability and volatility within private servers on top of the inherently scuffed scripting. Even if not for classic people would hop on the F R E S H train anyway. 
---
As Ion said, players need a stable place to call home where they know their character will always be for years to come and that's exactly why I could never take private servers seriously. Don't get me wrong I am burned out after so many years, but if I have a toon i know is mine and isn't going anywhere it'll give me the motivation to sit down, level, and earn my gear again. 
---
Yes! I would move some points around, but this is basically it
---
The same who doesn’t want to pay subscription fee.
---
A gnome warrior. I'm not a afraid of many things but that...it terrifies me. Good thing they're on my side.
---
Just like those gold sellers 
---
\+damage on weapon shouldn't work while shapeshifted (+damage on other slot like ring do work tho)
---
I think Elemental sharpening stone is the only thing you can put on your weapon that boost your damage. 
---
If classic runs on the same subscription as retail then there are tokens. So classic players could trade classic gold for retail gold with someone, and pay for their subscription that way. 
---
Similar things already happens on retail between servers. You can't transfer gold between servers, but you can buy/sell each other tokens and make it even out. My guild sold a few boosts to people on other realms that way. 
---
No the vast majority of groups don't and even if some do some masterloot run with items reserved at least you know in advance and can decide to not join if you need the item too.
---
That's not what he said. What is good is that there is no progression reset. 
---
There is still progression in the game, but it's not suddenly cleared like at an expansion release. 
---
So if you are at some raid progress, you come back a year later and you are still where you were.
---
The warrior needing the item for ransom might not be the leader.
---
If the leader do that he will be blacklisted by the entire server whereas with loot trading, only the victim know he did that.
---
Give me the divination b0ss
---
well wait and see then
---
If people ninja using loot trading, nobody will know and they won't get shitlisted.
---
Leveling a flock of gnome mages to 20 :p
---
I should actually make it to raiding this time. I’ve always started the game/ expansion, burned out at level cap and come back for the best pre expansion events.
---
Wow congrats on being fucking retarded.
---
For some1 who played only newer version of wow, what you think will i like same classes i play now in bfa ( hunter / rogue ). Which one have more core stuff left now and back than?
---
Colored links, in *general* chat? What version of the game do you think this is son?
---
Maybe that's a hint that people want the fresh experience and don't really care to spend 5 years at level 60 doing the same 3 raids. 
---
I think everyone is older.
---
https://youtu.be/EyPH2P88aQQ
---
I started monk on bfa, and gona do loremaster :D , i have like 60% more quests to finish. No hairloms and stuff, just pure questing and exploring world.
---
Ahh going with the true vanilla experience of slow internet. 
---
&gt; other people may see an opportunity to pay $20 for a token for someone in exchange for classic gold
---
Yes but my point is, to buy classic gold you need people selling it, and people *selling* classic gold *for retail* will be those wanting to pay the sub with gold while not playing retail. There are no other reasons to have gold on retail if you don't play it, because if you play it you certainly don't need to trade classic gold to get gold on retail.
---
It's true, as you say, that gold on classic gives you an advantage, but you have also to consider that having gold to spare in classic (to sell it) is much more difficult than having gold to waste on retail (and you can buy it with money while on classic you can't) so you have to be a damn good grinder to have a *steady* income to have enough classic gold to give away every month to pay for your sub that way.
---
People capable of doing that are a minority and if you're that good at farming, you're better of grinding retail to pay your sub, even if you don't intend to play it consistently, much less hassle than grinding classic for it.
---
Sure those trades will happen but they'll be much less common than people seem to think.
---
Yeah for sure dude. Take your time, soak it all in and experiment so you don’t burn out! There is no rush if you aren’t interested in being an elite raider. 
---
Do dungeons to get some cool gear (I’ll be spamming WC for Stinging Viper), do your professions and try out other classes. The majority of people will take well over 3 months to get to 60 and if you draw it out to much longer than that to avoid burning out you are at no disadvantage in trying content/raiding etc. 
---
Good luck with it. 
---
That creates some issues though. Couple examples: you copy your 1.12 character to TBC, don't plan on playing 1.12 anymore, you giveaway all the gold to your friends thus influencing the economy. Ex.2: you don't plan on playing TBC, you copy your character anyways and give everything away to your friends, thus influencing fresh  economy.
---
Now multiply those examples by how many friends you have. Now multiply that by how many people will do that.
---
Europa Universalis IV
---
Vanilla and TBC XD
---
hey dude check out my warrior leveling guide
---
Divinity 2 atm.  After I manage to finish that I might do a 2nd playthrough or alternatively pickup PoE again (haven't played since early release) or continue my Crusader Kings 2 SPQR run.
---
Was playing retail but it is boring af, while checking what I got i found people still playing battlefield 3.  I have bf4 too but 3 has something I love it. I don't like ww l-II era weapons so I don't have I-V.
---
I was obviously exaggerating. I do however believe that if Felstriker/Ironfoe drops, you will definitely see these kind of things. 
---
No, colored writings on reddit toemulate the chat.
---
Let's goo
---
&gt; Expecting classic to still be there after a few months hiatus 😂
---
We are talking about very different things, I'm pretty sure. I'm completely against QoL additions, and I think most of the community is as well, because every person wants a different thing. I was thinking more along the lines of options: for example, the ability to use the newer models and even to get a 4k texture pack or ray tracing into the game in a few years. I'm personally not of the mind that, say, if shadows were shit 15 years ago then they better be shit now, too, because otherwise that's not Vanilla. I don't see it that way *at all*. And I also see no issue with adding new zones so long as they don't make the same mistakes as they did with the expansions of invalidating everything else. After all, wasn't Hyjal initially planned for Vanilla and later scrapped? You could enter the unfinished zone, at least.
---
And content can be done right and wrong depending on whether or not you understand what made Vanilla good. For example, I would love player housing. I can't see anything detrimental that it might do to the game, at least, as I would implement it. But I also know that if it were up to Blizzard, they'd make it so that you can hearthstone there, and then never have to leave because you'd have an auctioneer, a battleground queue, portals to different capitals, etc - it would damage the game irreparably, as much as anything in current WoW. But that's not because the *idea* is bad, it's just that [some people](https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/news/25507-ion-hazzikostas-legion-interview.jpg) wouldn't know how to make appropriate decisions about how it should be incorporated in a way that makes the game better rather than damaging it. 
---
I agree with you that Blizzard are too incompetent to be trusted, for the most part. They would take a simple idea like adding in a new dungeon and suddenly invalidate every other raid by giving it the best gear imaginable. In an ideal world, I'd want Blizzard to die, for Vanilla to become free from their deathly clutches, and have different private servers catering to everyone's needs and desires. 
---
1. I guarantee that will happen.
---
2. If people having standards bothers you so much, there are bigger issues in your life. It’s completely natural.
---
3a. Make your own group and invite anyone regardless of gear. Yay, problem solved.
---
3b. Join a casual guild. They won’t care about your gear as much.
---
Undead rogue. You just know it's an asshole. 
---
Not all of us followed pserver drama. I don't known what debacle they're talking about either. 
---
What's that make alliance? With fairytale princess-esque castles everywhere? Lol
---
I always assumed it was little kids who wanted to play the "good guys" 
---
I assume if you need on something it will bind to you. Only greed be or master looted stuff will be tradable.
---
I'm saying whatever it was during vanilla at the relevant time of their patch schedule, is what the drop rate will be. It won't be higher to match say, whatever it's buffed to in BFA currently. 
---
When people at Blizzcon asked about earning stuff in Vanilla for the modern game, they said no &amp; further explained they want prestige for what you earn to still exist in the modern game and for those who go into classic and earn it on classic. They want people to grind the same way they had to back then, so this means the drop rates will be the same as they used to be back then for the relevant period. 
---
As someone else said, join a guild. In vanilla guilds are large enough and active enough to be entirely self sustaining. Just got to find a good one. 
---
2 years then TBC seems fair, inbetween that another retail WoW expansions, BfA 2.0
---
Icecrown
---
Damn have you missed it, get the DLCs too, Blood and Wine is like The Witcher 4, truly
---
Grim Dawn. Very entertaining :)
---
Its way less of a headache when you're playing with friends. I'm against it, but there's undeniable upsides.
---
I mean hand of justice is considered bis forever pretty much. And that's brd.
---
I mean that was quite an extensive answer but interesting nonetheless. 
---
Just to add a detail from what I gather from the numbers you posted here. 
---
It seems gray quests can give anywhere between 10-80% xp. Any other color is 100% xp
---
On the other hand, gray mobs will always give 0% xp. However, the one remaining question is: is there a difference between green, orange and red when it comes to xp rewards from killing mobs?
---
Or maybe, more specifically, is there an xp multiplier per level difference between player and monster, that varies even within the same color?
---
This is a huge deal, private server population was always limited by this. Some trolls will claim that having to pay will scare people off, but the truth is literally the opposite. We all want a safe home for our characters, with no risk of them being lost without any warning.
---
Do you have evidence or do you just like pulling anti-private server arguments out of your ass in every single comment you post on this sub?
---
Sadly Automod can only be made to post the exact same thing at an interval. The date will change, but there's no way to make it update the post. 
---
We could have a wikilist update, with each Classy Friday manually added to it, and have that be a part of the post, but this search result would give you functionally the same list: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=%22Classy+Friday%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
They have stated that they are committing to vanilla servers and once they are up they will never be discontinued or shut down permanently. So I'd read up on what blizzard has said...
---
and you don't even know what you are hating...   
---
you suggest I should rather hate the unknown instead of wait and see what it actually is? 
---
and you call that logic?
---
lol wat? there are alot suggestion on how loottrading could get implemented properly.  
---
if you cared to read and understand them
---
No, it's a roll. 
---
This is nonsense. Nobody who took long breaks during vanilla came back. Not because of the game, but because being socially active earns you your spot. Good luck trying to get gear in a DKP system you haven't been active in for a month.
---
Problem with smite is that if it gets kicked you are locked out of healing spells as well
---
Groups or raids? Rogue suck for finding groups but raids are happy to have a bunch, warriors are fine for both, hunters get in groups easily enough but struggle to find raid spots, and mages... I have no idea about mages tbqh.
---
assuming this is how the system will look like.
---
what if its restricted to ML only? 
---
In blue gear you have sub 3000hp, PW:F gives you 77 (sth like that) stamina, which is 770hp, so i strongly recommend buffing yourself up. I always use that 3min cd where your spell doesnt cost mana, forgot the name, for that
---
To be fair, items play a huge part as 99% of all fights either person in a 1v1 outgears the other, but otherwise you are right
---
There will be exceptions, but then we can just look to the fact that rogues dominate pvp bar endgame warriors, and even then a good rogue in t3 will beat a good warrior in t2. The gap between aq40/nax gear and the rest of raid items is huge.
---
&gt; this achieves NOTHING, all the people leaving those zones will still be congested as they exit them
---
Not all of them will exit at the same time.
---
&gt; Or do dynamic spawns 
---
I'm iffy about that. I saw it on Nost. I would enter a cave, grind my way to the quest target and by the time I am halfway through the mobs behind are respawning. If you die you're fucked as there's no safe spot to regen when you ress.
---
restrict it to ML or if everyone greeded and its fine. 
---
accidentially need in group loot? SOL 
---
you get easier distribution in ML and can sort out 1 of 2 cases of missclick in group loot.  
---
that doesn't sound negative to me. 
---
oh yeah, and pls make need rolls in group loot soulbound. even BoEs. tyvm
---
I think some will discover that they enjoy the hardcore grinding aspect, though, even if it's not what they're used to. That kind of gameplay just appeals to a certain kind of people. 
---
You don't need to hit 60 to play or enjoy WoW. 
---
this solves 2 out of 3 missclicks.
---
missclick pass? if no one else needed you can still get the item. 
---
missclick greed? same here
---
missclick need? still a chance that the right person gets it.  
---
if not, SOL
---
What's the point then in implementing it ?
---
and this solves another problem aswell. 
---
no more need rolls on BoE to sell them. 
---
AQ and Naxx are apparently too hard for most people. Even today only 12% of guilds are clearing Naxx.
---
Most are sheep's, only the ugly duckling looks further then its beak. And it's ugly because it points out the fault in the system.
---
I'm currently play on a private vanilla server (and Have been since 2012).
---
So was it in classic, you ninja item -&gt; Added to ignore and make sure you don't group up with those people again. So it's not an argument.
---
If it won't affect need rolls then I don't see the point. For example, a blue bop item drops, if you need it you need on it. If you nobody needs then you all greed. Simple as that. Loot trading would mean that if nobody needs it then you all greed and what then you try to sell it ? No because if one of your members needed it then they would've pressed need. 
---
Loot trading is only to cut costs in GM's and Activision is showing that through the recent lay offs and employees who speak up about the work ethic.
---
If they do this I hope you can export your character over so you can still play on classic but also carry on playing from 60 as if the expansion has just come out
---
&gt; ive seen the glaives 3 times in like 10 BT mogruns on my palading first time i was wow, too bad i cant use them next run i was wow, those again!? third run i was ok, idc
---
Blizzard drastically increased the drop rates of "transmog legendaries" at some point after Cataclysm.
---
upvoted since its not the usual hate circlejerk or weekly topic carousel.
---
besides that? 
---
perception could also make you immune to fear and mindcontrol, but can only be used pre-emptively. 
---
Played the Dark Souls trilogy.. Prolly gonna start with Diablo 3 when season 16 starts 18th Jan
---
You probably play the wrong games ... there are plenty of great games out there and more still being made.  The problem is only for the MMORPG genre itself that basically burned itself out for now.  Waiting on Pantheon personally to see if I can really get back into an MMORPG or if it fizzles out and I stay with non-MMO games (Divinity 2, PoE, CK2)
---
More believable then Jezus.
---
Remove Kebab
---
Here here !
---
that's one of my  favourite things about it, that and every single item, resource, currency, etc is all relevant.
---
So, you with your way back up or join another guild. You got time
---
Paladin with Engineering, just use your death ray through the bubble.
---
Monster Hunter W/GU and an occasional backlog assassination.
---
Also probably giving Hytale a shot if it's released before Classic.
---
This is the main reason I would want to play it again. If classic had a lifespan like retail WoW expansions, I wouldn't even think of touching it.
---
Maybe. I still have a hard time seeing most people rolling on something they can't use themselves, it's just such an obviously shitty thing to do. But maybe I underestimate how many assholes there are in this game. 
---
Either way, I really only see this being a problem in some random 5 mans. Most of the time if you do dungeons with a group of friends you will be doing master loot anyway to prevent people from ninjaing your shit. And in UBRS and raids and such you always go with master loot. 
---
It would also solve way more issues than it would cause in 5 mans. Preventing those random hunters or whatever from taking stuff and then saying it was an "accident" and stuff like that. Or in case it is an actual accident it would no longer be an actual problem. 
---
&gt;Play a 4:3 Resolution
---
... You uh.. do know that Wide Screen monitors existed and were becoming more popular at that time right?
---
&gt;Move back into your parent's house?
---
Im ahead of the curve on this one!
---
^^^:(
---
Most classes are quite different from live and classic as all of the class fantasy fluff has been removed along with the general dumbing down of rotations. That being said i believe rogues are pretty similar, at least assassin and sub rogues.
---
In your first comment you contradicting yourself by saying: "The fact you won't need to wait days for a GM to swap loot about is one, especially at low levels (which is a bigger part of the game unlike on live)."
---
Then later on you say: "Although ninjaing for friends was still possible in group loot situations since you'd just get a gm to swap it still."
---
I hope you can see the damage it will do now, much more ninja and loot funneling since you don't have to wait for days as you said in your first point.
---
None what so ever. I am literally just spouting nonsense. In fact I bet private servers got it right and I'm just salty about something.  
---
I'll get over it, I'm sure.  
---
Oh, right. I have no idea what they're talking about if I'm being honest.
---
I uh... I must be missing something here, what is the point of your post besides adding extra A's?
---
Leveling is a big part but not necessarily because of the items, you'll swap most items every 5 levels. From lvl 45 + it goes slower though and bis come into play. ZF, Mara, BRD... And here is where loot trading will do the most damage. 
---
Patch of Exile will definitely keep me entertained until classic release. I think everyone who liked wow will be captured by POE. I am playing mostly with old wow players there.
---
They said officialy that there will be no tokens, did they not ?
---
That's correct, but goes against OP's point. That's currently the case as well.
---
Also, rerolling in classic is pretty much a death sentence. The amount of time to level alone sets you back months. Don't fool yourself: nobody will take the blue guy that just came back when you could take the purple guy that played continuously.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think those are all good things. But alts and longs breaks were never much of a thing in vanilla and it should not be made out so that classic will be this magic place where comparison based on gear progression is not a thing. If anything it will be much tougher for those who can't put in the insane hours that it takes. 
---
You also don't really need to be in a raiding guild to see a fair amount of the end-game raid content. Most pservers have PuGs running BWL and MC both in under an hour. This seems to be within a few month of release as well so casual players don't have to wait that long.  
---
A lot of people won't be 60 until a month or so after release anyway. I think a lot of people forget how boring the game becomes of you are trying to powerlevel in vanilla. That will ultimately stop them from hitting 60 within two weeks.
---
Taurens can pick flowers out of the ground instantly.
---
Walk while shadowmelded? So every Night elf class would basicly be a rogue? That's a bad one.
---
Would love to have a totally new trait for dwarves that if you get drunk your damage increases.
---
The other greatest game of all time, Diablo 2
---
One thing i quite like about this classic community is that for the most part people are on the whole civil in their disagreements between the factions outside of when they are actually playing pvp, you ask this same question over on the current wow sub and you'd see messages removed by mods for the first 10 answers.
---
Thats retarded. Someone also could just straight up buy Classic Gold... it has nothing to do with tokens. 
---
Someone could trade Classic Gold for a Blowjob... wtf is your point? 
---
Undead's Underwater Breathing also gives you 3x longer in Fatigue water.
---
I don't think they're trolls I think it's just people who don't wanna pay. Do I want to pay? Not exactly, but it's hardly a problem to pay the same damn fee I've always paid to play the game, least I'm paying for one I like now. Really there has to be incentive for Blizzard to even make legacy and money was obviously the way, least we're not getting charged a premium or some shit. Now if you wanna argue modern should be free or at least b2p I'd support that since they have a cash shop. Either way the monthly fee really isn't much, especially if it means never having to touch a private server again.
---
Apparently, if you /sit and aren't eating food, it increases your health regen (and mana?) slightly. I've heard conflicting info on this largely based on private server data, but, what *is* the actual rate increase from a /sit? Asking regarding Vanilla rates, which I assume/hope will carry over to Classic.
---
I hope so
---
When the game dropped I was 15-16 years old. It felt great to be a part of the Horde - I started off as a Tauren Warrior and then Undead Warlock. However, this clip makes me think a bit about starting as the Alliance in classic WoW. Many of the points you made, speak to me more today as a 28-29 year old than it did back then.
---
Thats the thing man. If you want to avoid these situations, just clear up these questions before the runs. Thats exactly why people reserve items. 
---
&gt;wtf is your point?
---
It's not my point. OP was the one who was asking. 
---
&gt;Someone also could just straight up buy Classic Gold
---
Yes.. that's what we are talking about. But we are talking about people trading retail gold for classic gold, instead of trading real money for classic gold. 
---
Wisps can explode while dead doing a mana burn and damage for 10% hp, but send you back to the spirit healer and has a 10min cooldown.

Well I have been playing the Bioshock trilogy. After playing through all of them it is amazing how much of a downgrade Bioshock Infinite is after coming from 2 in terms of gameplay and game world design in general. 2 had the best gameplay, 1 had the best story and visual design, infinite looked the best (though those humans models have not aged well). Playing through the Burial at sea DLC now which is good but I still think they should have gone to the effort or changing the vigors back to plasmids (or at least changing their names back to the original bioshock versions).
---
Think I might go back to Fallout 3/NV/4 after this.
---
posts like this are pure idiocy and get repeated entirely too often
---
fresh servers launched after 1.12 so it might not have been your experience but this state was the experience for some people
---
stop trying to replace thinking with feelings 
---
Oh I'm absolutely not worried about myself :) More like the gen pop
---
Yes, but:  
---
&gt;If classic runs on the same subscription as retail then the retail tokens work for classic too
---
As in, if you buy tokens on retail you can use them to pay for your subscription for your entire WoW account, including classic. 
---
Because somewhere along your experience you will run into one of those rare items that will make even the most selfless players to get "purple eyes". Thats where the problems arise. Some people would risk their reptuation for that one chance theyll probably ever get to win Ironfoe/Felstriker. 
---

But you can get both bindings? Because that's the real bottleneck.
---
God damn it..
---
Of course. Shaman, Druid, Priest, and Warlock can farm it solo as well.
---
If by "decent guild" you mean elite guilds, then sure I agree. 
---
Humans detection works like Dust of appearance in Dota, it reveals stealthed targets in a large area and prevents them from restealthing for about 15 seconds.
---
Yeah its kinda shocking Blizz's current policy of how fast content becomes outdated.
---
Not sure why you had to go /s. It's like you don't believe had the right idea from the start.
---
I really hope so, since I plan to play a mage.
---
The pathing will probably differ from what people are used to on private servers though.
---
Hi, so I thought after scrolling through playlist I'll make an addition of mine. I opened my music folders from 2003-2007 and added the songs that I remember most playing WoW with. Now maybe not a lot of people are familiar with these songs so comments and discussions are welcome. Also great list so far... Listening to Straight to Video brought me such a nostalgic feeling that I ended up making this list. I remember a wow vanilla exploration video with that song back from 2003 from beta/live it was truly inspiring what got me to stick to wow mostly in the beginning. Exploring all those hidden places. If anyone has any idea where I can find this video I would be truly grateful!!!

Be prepared to buy reagents. For a rogue this means buying poisons for your weapons and for blind. For a hunter this means buying ammo and food for your pet. I believe if you run out of ammo you can't use your ranged weapon anymore, you pretty much have to fight melee. One of your bags will probably be devoted to ammo all the time, so you will likely want to buy an [ammo pouch](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ammo_pouch) for this purpose.

Also in Classic hunters have a [dead zone](http://et.worldofwarcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Dead_zone), so from close by you can't use any ranged abilities. From what I've read your damage is lowest of all pure DPS classes in WoW classic.
---
Cannibalism - can also be used on living humanoids
---
DPS warrior personal impression (Pserver experience).
---
1. **5** if your guild is good, the boss gold drops are sufficient to buy consubambles for the next run. Warriors are rather poor solo farmers, but you still can make 40-60g/h by certain collective gold farms which is comparable to DM mage solo farm, so it's **4** if you know what you are doing.
---
2. **4** if your spec is 2H fury and you got decent gear. Standard DW build is worse, around **2**.
---
3. **4** if mobs are green or grey, **3** if it's approx. same level humanoids which drop cloth for bandages, **1** if they are elite.
---
4. **2** for the resources you have to pick up (like herbs), your only mean of CC'ing the interfering mobs is 3min CD fear, Hamstring sometimes works out too if the terrain favors it.
---
5. **4 to 5** depending on a server situations. Generally DPS warriors which are also happy to OT are in pretty high demand.
---
6. **1.5** Only low-lvl and somewhat obsolete dungeons are suitable for solo farm.
---
7. **4** for tier set looks. Pretty nice but nothing beats T2 pala imo. 
---
8. **5+** if you step up and take the tank role, **2-3** if not. 
---
9. **5++** if you take out your shield and play the tank role to dictate your own loot rules. Otherwise **2-3**.
---
10. **3** Warrior is the slowest leveling class, but the gap is not that huge, getting lvl60 in 5-6 days /played is possible if you do the things right. But it is easy to make it wrong and have a pretty damn hard leveling experience.
---
I feel like this would be a trend for classic if it happened on private servers too. But it doesnt, almost never. You might be required to get inspected for raids in particular, but no gearscore or anything like that. Maybe because in vanilla, the gear doesnt mean as much as it does on retail nowdays.
---
post like this are pure autism.
---
fresh servers are launched every month for teh last 12 years but still everyone knows that authentic vanilla experience was the one from 2004 till end of 2006.
---
and patch 1.12  was introduced on 22 august 2006 so actually the vast majority of the player base spend more time in vanilla before the 1.12 rather than after.
---
how ironic that you speak of idiocy :)
---
I remember twinks were pretty common mid vanilla, at least on my server. I stumbled into a couple 19 and 29 twinks pretty much every BG when I started making alts at the time. It certainly is a rough time but I don't think that's any different from the original experience.
---
thats what i thought nerd 
---
They fixed their issues, yes.
---
&gt; stop trying to replace thinking with feelings
---
ironic again, idiot
---
If all pvp was one on one, sure. But it ain’t.
---
Eh. Im fine with it. 
---
Good to hear, we need a quality tbc server out there
---
tldr
---
The bindings were only added in 1.6 originally, the BWL patch. Some private servers have them in from the start, others who do progressive itemization will delay them until BWL. We'll see what Blizzard chooses to do.

stop kidding yourself, you didn't understand what you're reading because you're stupid but who knows, maybe someday you can get just below average.

Where did they say servers would run as long as WoW exists? Not doubting, genuinely wondering because if you have a source for that I’ll be ecstatic

NEXT
---
Free realm transfers were a thing much earlier. 
---
I availed of a one off offer to transfer out of my realm during 1.8 at the latest, possibly 1.7.
---
Troll regeneration now halves the duration of Bleed effects. Berserking increases movement speed slightly as well.
---
Yeah I have all of it, tried to play it 3-4 times before but really couldn’t get into it.
---
5th times the charm 
---
What? 
---
FFXIV, Destiny II and maybe it's time to start playing numerous games I purchased in Steam but never even downloaded.
---
what do you mean, there allready exists a singleplayer WoW. 
---
Its called retail :&gt;
---
Human - Perception: Can now see through clothes for the duration perception is active
---
Gnome - engineering is now default profession and does not count towards the maximum count
---
Dwarf - Stone skin - is now passive but dwarves can be banished
---
Night elf - Shadowmeld - shadowmelding for longer than 5 seconds will transform you into a tree. while being a tree you regenerate much faster absorbing nutrients from the ground
---
Orc - Blood fury - now glow in bright green, Hardiness from 25% -&gt;27%
---
Troll - Berserking -  unleash blood freezing roar which decrease enemy attack and move speed
---
Undead - Will of the forsaken now projects Sylvanas figure dancing to korean pop 
---
Tauren - War stomp can now be cast again if enemy was hit for the first time, can not be activated for more than 3 times.
---
No, I mean like why would you trade your hard earned classic gold for retail gold?
---
Glad to hear it.
---
by the looks  of it you've never won an argument in your life, so yeah, i want fries with that.
---
That's not contradicting myself at all. I'm stating a fact that it will mean less waiting, not an opinion that less waiting is good. I then stated the downside to that is it will increase ninjaing for friends as they don't have to wait. 
---
Economy was important in vanilla. I prefer it stays that way.
---
6k gold? are you crazy?  the extra mats are FREE because you will never get both bindings without the support of a guild, and the guild supplies the ores as well. 
---
Maybe you did some gold dkp runs on private servers where rich auction house tycoons could buy into such a legendary, after 3 years of clearing  the content, but that is not how it would go on retail 
---
Catch up mechanic is dogshit design, I don't do shit until it is nerfed lol
---
Because they want to play a game, not work a job which is basically what vanilla WoW is. The game is a huge grind and I hate it but I'll suffer through it.
---
Never had anything against them, to be honest. Being trapped on a dead realm is awful.
---
I'm travelling right now and didn't bring my book, but I'll check when I get home later tonight.
---
Same, I own it but can't get into it.
---
those are the real expense!  the elementium ore is supplied by the guild, but most guilds expect the champion that gets the blade to farm at least some (or a lot) of his own arcanite.  Of course his friends will help, but you can't expect a guild to cough up 100 arcanite bars 
---
Bye retailkid
---
if you are any serious or long term for classic. just level a gold farming alt (mage or hunter). thats what many ppl end up doing. and the sooner you realize its the best solution - the better.  its much easier than trying to farm with a healer, or class/spec which is bad at it, or juggle and paying for respecs all the time. and all other headache. 
---
i'd love the movement speed on berserking. that's a really cool idea tbh
---
I never had anything against this by principle; As long as it is:
---
- Expensive
---
- Has a cooldown, like 3 months to keep people from realm-jumping.
---
Classic is classic, just because it was a bit poorly thought out isn't a reason to change it.  I personally never cared about getting that high of a pvp rank, just PvP'ed for PvP's sake.  Poor guys aiming for R14 are going to feel a bit of pain though probably but they should be well prepared for it considering they know it is coming.
---
The best solution, I believe, is to have a both permanent vanilla section, and an evolving section that incrementally receives the same updates as WoW originally did throughout the years.
---
Its going to happen
---
tl;dr from [the FAQ from 2006](https://web.archive.org/web/20060901052228/http://www.blizzard.com:80/support/wowbilling/?id=abl02008p):
---
* Cost $25
---
* Cannot transfer to "full or densely populated" realms, and this restriction _"may"_ also apply the other way around too (i.e. can't transfer away FROM a dead realm)
---
* Cannot transfer from PvE to PvP (but the opposite works)
---
* Cannot transfer to a realm launched in the last 6 months
---
* Cannot change faction, race, appearance, etc.
---
Very true, I forgot about this point to be honest
---
I was in a guild that would compete for server first and usually got all horde firsts , and we gave the 1st thunderfury to a rogue.  While the main tank was a tauren warrior + guild leader.  But he didn't want to give the impression being the greedy guild leader  giving stuff to himself.    I don;t think we had lout council back then, but the rogue was well respected and everybody thought it was a great idea of him having it.   We also didn;t know how rare these would be.
---
On that same server, a hunter also got one :D .  Those were the days 
---
This is the solution.
---
Cultivation can now be manually casted over any grassy terrain to graze. Restores HP similar to Cannibalized at the cost of looking ridiculous.
---
No changes.
---
Deep Rock Galactic and FFXIV. For all the hate modern wow gets, I liked Legion's endgame a lot (except legendaries). But BFA is bad, so I'm giving FFXIV a shot. Enjoying it so far.  
---
DRG for my dwarf fix.
---
I understand, however if I see that "significant" title it tells me that guy had 3-4 months of vacation and LOVES PVP. I understand maybe EU guys can get that kind of Vaca time but if you get r14 in America you probably need to get a job or go to school.   
---
  
---
Now this is based on what people have told me it takes for r14 and the amount of time investment it requires. This also doesn't mention the style of play is skewed with premades that force less fun BGs usually. Again this is other people's stories I have read on here. Maybe someone can convince me otherwise that these people have a life, because account sharing won't be a thing.   
---
However when I see the title it will tell me that people is either addicted, ruined the game for himself or doesn't have a job/go to school.
---
Not sure if it is because it has been such a long time but why do people need to gold farm to begin with?  Besides the extra farming to get the epic mount I never really needed to focus on extra cash during all of vanilla (multiple characters multiple servers).  It was pretty easy to be cash neutral with repair bills/consumables with just a bit of gathering pre-raid once in a while (low time low effort).  The only people I ever saw needing a lot of gold were people buying runs in MC/BWL/etc for gear/drops.
---
Wrath? Jesus fucking Crist yikes.
---
Thanks for your discourse
---
Yeah, the free transfers were usually a trap, or ruined both servers in the process.
---
Yeah, neither of us know. Could be more popular with this generation. Nobody knows 
---
Aftershock to Tauren War Stomp.  Basically if someone else is in X range of the person affected by war stomp then it chains and can continue to chain until no further targets.  Hilariously OP but would be funny to warstomp/aftershock a full MC raid in blackrock mountain chokepoints.
---
ooh that was a good one - even though logging in again technically disconnected the old login, making room for the new login - this error was still happening, for some reason.
---
no, we'll show you the realm list... again.
---
Nobody's fooling anybody.  The classic is any the journey for me. I can care less if I can t get back into raids because I took a break. Oh well, I just play and be a guy with blues and with my way up. If you stop caring about trying to keep up with other players it becomes fun and stress free.  Rerolling is just as fun. You take about 3 months to reach 60.  If the journey is fun, who cares how long it takes. 
---
I think, it'S probably going to be
---
Connecting
---
Logging in to the game world
---
because that's how the current infrastructure works.
---
Back then, it was just...
---
It usually meant a hacker was on your account selling all your shit...
---
"Molten Core DLC - buy now!" - that's what would be worriesome...
---
Just don't set those standards too high. We might be older, but apparently we didn't grow up. Either that or vanilla is just as attractive to 13 year olds as it was back in the day.
---
I won't be installing it
---
WITHOUT L000000PS
---
a bit of magic the gathering arena  and old games like skyrim and fallout
---
Let Weapon Specialization unlock the weapon skill on classes that normally don't have it. It could be a fun way to make those racials relevant to all classes, but it needs restrictions to be balanced. Two-handed weapons on a Rogue would be a bit too much, and it would give Dwarf Paladins a ranged weapon. In a lot of cases, the added weapon skill would not be particularly viable, but I'd rather see a harmless fun racial than effectively no racial at all.
---
I also feel like Humans are generally too weak in PvP. They only edge they have is Perception, which is only useful in very specific cases. Thematically, I also don't even see the relevance (how are they more perceptive than other races?). Blizzard did change it in later expansions, but the new racial felt very uninspired and awkwardly named.
---
I would've liked to see Humans with a racial that was more in line with tenacity (which their spirit racial already alludes to) or teamwork (like Diplomacy). It could be a very short death immunity, or a short morale buff that could be either AoE or targetable on allies. Anything but Perception, really.
---
The only real hybrid class is warrior, don't you know? I don't want dps shamans or paladins ruining my raids, that makes the game less fun. Also moonkins are only needed for dance. #nochanges
---
didn't you read Greek mythology?
---
"don't fly too close to the sun, wax will melt"
---
too op
---
What we know:
---
They are implementing it to save money.
---
They have NOT confirmed HOW it will work.
---
Loot trading can be horribly abused and ruin the game for a lot of people (not the only reason they use personalized loot on retail, but still significant).
---
I would upgrade hardiness so it can also resist fears 
---
You’re only going to get useless comments about no changes in this sub, it’s a circlejerk.
---
&gt; because there was theorycrafting to suggest it would literally never not be BiS if gear continued to scale by the standard ilvl formula.
---
Wow that's hillarious
---
It's retardedly easy. literally google lh repack, second link for windows
---
If they are gonna add additional content i would love them to poll things like osrs does
---
No let's all bow down to your personal entitled opinion instead. What is this logic?
---
Everyone has thier own idea for what would be ideal. You can't seriously expect blizzard to pick exactly what you have in mind that's where this whole problem stems from in the first place. Having an authentic vanilla expirience is the only way any other way will be the wrong way because everyone sees it differently.
---
(I agree with you opinion on the matter it's just that it does not matter because there are thousants of other opinions out there and it's isn't going to happen the way you want it to.) Just imagine the shitstorm that would come from many people of different opinions than yours if they went through with the change you're suggesting even if it's a good one IMO.
---
Yes. That was the best version of WoW.
---
Lol, it was the worst of the 3 early expacs 
---
Thank you, that is what I'm looking for.
---
It's a good game for all types of players. There's a lot of flavors for you to enjoy.
---
LFM UBRS, must have all Mythic cutting edge content in BFA. Lol
---
Ahh, interesting.
---
Having them on the loot table from the start will make a pretty huge difference in getting a Thunderfury for the MT ASAP.
---
I hope this will be possible in classic, I'd really hate to be trapped on a ghost town of a server, which is entirely possible when the tourists leave.
---
I know going to some streamers realm would make sure this won't happen, but that would have more downsides than not (there's a vid on yt about this) + everyone can't join the same server.
---
Migration would be a decent way to help this problem.
---
It was not.
---
This is why I have been playing older time locked servers for WoW and Everquest. As a busy father, husband, student and employee I cannot keep up with any sort of expansion release schedule. 
---
Agreed, this is one of the best things about Classic. To be able to play at your own pace and never worry about your dungeon, raid or PvP gear becoming obsolete is great. 
---
I think the vanilla pvp system is fun.
---
Why would e.g. dps shamans make the game less fun? Seems to me more options would add variation and make the game more fun.
---
Also, the issue is bigger than hybrid classes imo, it's also about being forced into one single spec for the during every raod throughout the game. Such as warlocks just doing SM/ruin (or possibly DS/ruin, which is essentially the same thing).
---
I dont want egoistical people like you ruining the community with my game and my fun is more important then everything else.
---
Is it possible to do any damage with rpal in classic? It is it totally useless?
---
I will start with your last sentence and argue that gear in Vanilla meant more than in any other expansion. This is because most rotations are so simple that the only thing affecting your DPS is your gear (and consumables, which everyone should accordingly bring).  For most classes there is very little room for skill to make a significant difference. Secondly, almost every class has certain specific items that make such a big difference because they are itemized perfectly which is rare in Vanilla. Example: edgemasters handguards, lionheart helm, the feral head piece which gives energy on shapeshift.
---
Will there be GS addons? Yes. It’s a good counterargument to state they take more effort to make than in retail, but Vanilla will see many times more developers than private servers. So while Vanilla gear has more variables than just item level and weighted stat distributions, it isn’t impossible to give items a rating for each class.
---
Twas a joke sir. 
---
well he made the whole 0.01% thing up and what im saying is blizzard would never use that as their permanent drop rate if for some reason they originally made it that way for a month or something. 10 thousand runs for one binding
---
… and other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself vol. 2
---
&gt;Free realm transfers were a thing much earlier
---
Free character migration (FCM)\*
---
The "trap" is that you subscribe and thus get access to retail, hoping that some players will come back and play that, where they have the cash shop, wow tokens, and a hundred other ways to monetize you.
---
I hope not. Safe haven from wPVP while you farm thousands of gold.  
---
But if it is? I'll abuse the absolute hell out of it for extreme personal gain.  
---
Well I have long term plans, that is for certain, but I never twinked in Classic, because I have a hard time leveling.
---
But I'm going to think about this one. Thank you.
---
I sure hope they do some balance changes. Having just 1 viable spec as a class is just outright stupid. I have even seen people defend it: '' Thats vanilla, if you dont like it, dont play it. '' 
---
What does that even accomplish? You basically kill off half of the spec options simply because the other options are twice as good. It doesnt add anything to the game. Not seeing boomkins, prot pallies, arcane mages, etc. isnt an integral part of classic wow. It only limited the variety that could make it far more fun to play.
---
Completed Head Over Heels for the first time today. I’ve been playing it on and off since 1987 o.O
---
Moving onto Final Fantasy Tactics A2 next. I’m 32 hours in, but not holding my breath that I’ll finish it before Classic.
---
That feeling when you uncover 13-year-old news article from a news website that's still doing good, and has 2019-worthy, updated layout.
---
Maybe wait for TBC?
---
what fairytale princess castles? having medieval castles is fairytale now? 
---
I was being sarcastic, variety is the spice of the life and balance changes should happen after a year or 2 I believe. I think the best way to help hybrid DPS with litter change to PVP is to add some form of Mana Regen/use reduction to the end talents in a tree.  
---
   
---
Spell crits make your next spell free in moonkins form. Stormstrike causes your next damaging spell to be free(applies buff not debuff). Repentance completely scrapped for something better. Make fade give Mana back in shadowform. Make mindflay not a debuff for bosses. Fix how redoubt works and give palys a fucking fucking judgement taunt or something. Help pallys and druids reach uncrushable, or at least just druids. Reduce +10 defense/armor talents down to 3 in their trees, this goes for shamans too.   
---
All of these are tweaks to minor changes that I would love to see, that wouldn't fuck up PVP too much. Focus more on buffs not nerfs and focus on Mana Regen. Also just give ele shams magma blast, make curse of elements affect arcane and we're set
---
The paranoia is getting more and more absurd on this sub everyday. 
---
What does Blizzard want to achieve with Classic? Profit. By selling more subscriptions: getting those that dislike current WoW back to pay their sub fee. 
---
What's the fastest way to make sure the people they are trying to get back don't subscribe or unsubscribe as fast as possible? Stuff like you mention in your post. 
---
Testing out leveling ideas on my PTR for now. Will take a 3 month break from all video games before Classic launches.  
---
The classic audience is much less compatible with MTX than retail. The same contrast can be seen between OSRS and Runescape 3. The latter is full of MTX, the former has only one in the form of bonds (=WoW Tokens). Now, because WoW and RS are different games, Vanilla would be much less enjoyable if Tokens were introduced. In OSRS the effect of bonds is smaller and dare I say beneficial for the health of the game. 
---
Anyway, if Jagex (owned by a Chinese mining company) is wise enough not to introduce MTX to OSRS, then we can assume Blizzard won’t do so either. The negative goodwill of MTX outweighs the profits they would make of of them.
---
I thought trolls were better for priest and mage? Or is that PvE only?
---
&gt;Though, from memory this rarely actually worked
---
yes, and they also tried to balance faction numbers, so there were restrictions like "Alliance: server A to server B, Horde: server C to server D", and the B and D servers were dead servers, so I would be surprised if someone actually used it, and was not drunk or high at the time
---
Same here. I haven’t touched retail WoW in over 2 years and haven’t experienced Vanilla in over 12 years or played any servers. My experience will be fresh since there’s so many things about Vanilla I don’t remember. I’m going to make a bunch of alts on both factions and experiment in roles I haven’t tried in a long time. I haven’t played a healer or a tank for more than 1 dungeon or so, or done PvP in a LONG time, and I’m willing to learn how to do so. 
---
lots wrong with this post. 
---
The Ten Storms set is Blue and Grey/Silver
---
The TBC off-set is purple/pink like what you're wearing in the screenshot
---
a father *and* a husband. how do you manage 
---
We did this, while waiting for big content patches to download. Everyone in the squad had their own game in the meantime, I played spider solitaire, my hunter buddy was playing freecell all the time, one other friend went with pinball, etc.
---
Magic the gathering arena and cod blackout on pc. 
---
When did activision do any smart long-term movement, not just instant cash grabs? Never.
---
Just wow.
---
Might be better, I don't know. But there are way more undead of those classes than trolls. People don't always play the race with the best racials you know. All PvPers would be alliance if that was the case. 
---
Berzerking also grants mana regen in combat on top of health regen
---
Can we just get vanilla now and talk about this in 2-3 years?
---
It’s the last point that is most contentious
---
I’m torn between Dwarf, Undead or Troll Priest. Even after trying some out on a private server. Decisions, decisions...
---
I hate those meeses to pieces!
---
Only health regen. Not 100% sure what the true value is, but should be +5-10 extra health per tick (regen ticks occur every two seconds) regardless of level and spirit.
---
[Forum post of people discussing from 2006](http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21&amp;mid=1138070096228285115)
---
really nice idea. well not the walking while shadowmelding (also known as stealth) :), but the concept of improving on the creativity side would give vanilla a fresh look for veterans or add something extra to what you find on private servers. 
---
changes like make crusader recipe drop in totally different part of the world than it is now wont change the vanilla concept but it will bring back the satisfaction of discovery to a game that has been overplayed for more than a decade and stripped of most of his mysteries. 
---
Adding changes to an MMO is necessary. Almost any change has been met with positive feedback. Everyone loved getting t50 talents in TBC and t60 in WOTLK. Everyone was looking forward to playing with their new abilities. Over time this reaches a critical mass where adding new abilities would stack up to be too much, which leads to pruning.
---
It’s damned if you do damned if you don’t. WoW wouldn’t have survived 15 years on patch 1.12. But most of us here will agree that Vanilla or maybe TBC was the best version of the game.
---
I personally hope for a nochanges period of 1-2 years after launch. Afterwards, Blizzard will be forced to add changes or add TBC realms to keep the servers from bleeding dry. That’s the reality.
---
Even with PvE servers the streamers are screwed. They'll be screwed out of every mob, every mine/herb, etc. Even if they're not streaming, all people need to do is know their character name and realm and /who. 
---
Streamers aren't going to have a fun time leveling imo
---
I totally get that desire but I fear that talking about it two to three years from now will be too late.
---
Sometime in -05, friend told me to play, we were kids and having a blast!
---
I left during wotlk when achievements came in, and having raided EoE (the most lmao raid in wow history) I decided to call it quits. Too spergy and too casual, I didnt really like wotlk at all, and after hearing of the release of Cata I knew I made the right choice to bail
---
So, its been a long time since I have touched WOW, why wouldn't this be in the game? I understand it is very profitable and safe, however I don't really remember being gold being a big deal in classic other than your epic mount. I don't recall ever thinking OH MAN if only I had more gold, I could buy X item or do X thing. Enchants and stuff were costly, and so were consumables but you I had enough to do just fine with just herbalism.
---
Again though this is a more of a question as to what you would need to farm this much gold for? Or is my memory hazy and you need more money than I remember.
---
How I see it, is not a copy of your character but a phase shift to BC, wotlk, cats, etc.
---
Items and money acquired in classic are available in BC. Items and money acquired in BC aren't available in classic phase shift
---
That would be awesome
---
Cheeki Breeki, comrade.
---
Explain, as this has been shown to be true on all major Blizzlike pservers I have played on.
---
There's still MP content in current WoW. 
---
I wonder the same thing, I don't recall ever being strapped for gold, and all I did was pvp and herbalism, outside of raids.
---
I'll be part of the 88%. Ain't no one got time for that this time around. Those who do are young, and won't play Classic. They are the Fortnite generation, the generation of the loot box. 
---
Shaman is on the high end of keybinds. Maybe only Warlocks have more. This is assuming you engage in all endgame activities (WPvP, BGs, Dungeons, Raiding, Goldfarming). Many Shaman abilities benefit from downranking, such as Earth 
---
shok, Frost Shock, all 3 heals. You also have many keybinds from totems. Expect roughly 40 keybinds.
---
Ofcourse if you’re only interested in healing raids it’s much lower.
---
Yeah, I agree! 
---
From MMO-champion I gather that the counter arguments seems to be 1. that unbalance is an integral part of vanilla wow, and 2. that the vanilla experience is (presumably) very fragile, and that any changes what so ever might jeopardize it. So better make no changes at all.
---
Except it has no negative impact on launch, while it does if they do it in Silithus, or wherever. Also, you can still play the game (go do something else, play an alt, whatever), while you can't do anything else at game launch.
---
COMPLETELY different situations IMO, and just because they do it for launch, doesn't mean they have to, or would be right in doing it for any other part of the game. If they try, I'll be right there calling them out on it, with the rest of the players. But for launch, sharding is necessary as far as I'm concerned.
---
Best part with Classic is that now that it will be run by blizzard, our characters wont disappear every couple of years when one server shuts down and another one replaces it.
---
I have had a 60 of every class in classic and miss them all.
---
A change of meta doesnt change the fundamentals of a game. It changes what classes/specs are optimal and create a whole new focus on itemization. Right now everyone knows what is BIS, they know where to go with what class, where to farm xp, where to farm gold, how to rotate between spells in pve and pvp, etc.
---
Changing the meta will stir things up. Not everything will be known from the start. That is what a lot of people seemed to like in vanilla. They liked to feel little in a huge world, feeling like you know nothing, playing without knowing if what you are doing is the best option. Balance changes could bring some of that feeling back. 
---
&gt; Almost any change has been met with positive feedback. Everyone loved getting t50 talents in TBC and t60 in WOTLK. Everyone was looking forward to playing with their new abilities.
---
in general everything new is exciting
---
&gt; so you can remove some of the least used abilities, but not change the entire rotation and add some mechancis like max 3 time-limited soulshards or balance druid attunement.
---
&gt; WoW wouldn’t have survived 15 years on patch 1.12.
---
true
---
&gt; But most of us here will agree that Vanilla or maybe TBC was the best version of the game.
---
it was good, indeed, but two problems:
---
1. daily quests
---
2. it was artifically separated from the original content - the "retired content". Post-raiding level cap increase brought WOW to the BfA-like tactics - all the hard work you've done, means nothing now
---
3. the tier system - even though vanilla had tiers, there were items with special qualities that made lower tier raids still count. A bit in TBC, and more in WotLK, you had to have some GearScore to even start with raiding - and, in order to get it, you had to raid... WotLK, basically, was the non-catchup expansion - myself, I'd call it the worst - not only because of the non-catchup, but also because of the fact that since 3.2, it was a huge construction site for Cataclysm.
---
When I tried BfA for a month I decided I will never play again, so I got $45 worth of sub money by selling my pets and BOEs.
---
I am not sure that the jumps to fresh are done out of boredom.
---
IMO it's the perspective of "maybe this time I won't fall behind the pack".
---
Hey everyone ! another classic wow gold farming guide. Let me know what you thought. Gonna be making more guides on the blasted lands soon. Hope to hear some feedback :)
---
Yeah, "Also moonkins are only needed for /dance" sort of gave it away as sarcasm, but it's hard to surmise in text. I thought someone was sarcastic in the balancing thread over at MMO-champion after making an argument like "Just pick a rogue, mage or warrior and you won't think about changes." and they got very pissed of, so I just went with the boring safe option of assuming it was not sarcasm, haha.
---
Anyway, these are some good suggestions I think. I think mindflay is a debuff for bosses atm. I think attaining class balance will be hard without getting rid of the debuff limit though. And that might actually be pretty hard to implement without making some fights a lot easier and other a lot harder, so that'll take some tweaking.
---
I think this might be a sarcastic reply to a sarcastic post? But then again, Poe's law...!
---
I do not imagine them splitting the game even more. They were against two versions of the game for CEX reasons from the very beginning, I don't see them making even more. 
---
I'm about as sure as one can be that the game won't just remain at 1.12 content forever. They'll either do TBC, and so on, or they'll develop the game horizontally, with original content. And not on separate realms!
---
Warlock, Mostly classic exp, some P server
---
1.  2, farming soul shards sucks, depends on how lazy your raid is though
---
2. 4, SM/Ruin is perfectly viable in both raids, SL and Destro = 2
---
3. 4, Pretty easy farming, good kill power
---
4. 2, Zero movement abilities, best way to gather is to be in and out before a fight starts, if you have to fight over it, warlock works pretty well though.
---
5. 4, warlocks were in rough shape for a long time, and even after the talent buffs farming shards and having super lower +Hit chance until ZG made people not like playing them as much
---
6. 3.5, Better than most but still worse than hunter/mage
---
7. Tier sets looks pretty good, wish t3 was a different color but the model is cool
---
8. 4, pretty average, some people don't like taking locks because of their hard to use CC, if you know what your doing though they are perfectly capable fear juggling with COR. Gets bumped up to a 4 just because of soulstone and summons.
---
9. 3, not terrible have to fight with other clothies for stuff but at least you don't have to get devilsaur stuff.
---
10. 5, very easy to level not much can compete with leveling speeds except hunters.
---
Unfortunately I agree. I personally hate TBC, but that is probably what they will be going for.
---
I hope I will start to be bored of the game before the Dark Portal opens, sparing me some of the pain.
---
On retail, I started about a week before patch 2.4.3 launcher. I remember this because they reduced required level for mount form 40 to 30 in this patch, and the patch hit just about as I hit level 30 :D
---
I never really left, I played every expansion (though I haven't seriously raided since cata), and will continue to do so.
---
Fully agree, I guess it depends how you play the game. But I swear if they announce BC at some point (including the item level reset) on the classic servers I'll organize a 40 man raid of their HQ. 
---
This level of paranoia deserves it's own flair.
---
&gt;vanilla is just as attractive to 13 year olds as it was back in the day.
---
unless they've been spoiled by big numbers and quick progression elsewhere.
---
100% yes. It will be in the [battle.net](https://battle.net) app as a separate game, and will download separately. I don't see them doing it any other way.
---
Playing on p server.
---
I have the hunger for vanilla, but a healthy scepticism that Blizzard will screw up. So I’m getting my kicks now before all the p servers update to TBC.
---
Keep in mind that not everyone will have BiS. Also, whether or not something is BiS doesn’t mean that’s what you may be comfortable using or what may be “BiS” for certain fights might change. A lot of people are acting like it’s only a matter of time until they have every single piece of gear they want. They are in for a rude awakening.
---
When blood fury is activated for orcs, it also gives orcs an instant melee ability by the same name that deals weapon damage.
---
Alternatively, Orc Axe weapon racial allows all Orc classes the ability to use 1 and 2 handed axes. 
---
BiS , by definition, is just one slot.  This is a combination of three shots.  Individually, it isn't even a comparison, as I would gain on average about 40 heal per slot and typically double my mp5 per slot.  
---
If your trying to DPS yeah, 30/0/21 is a pretty decent raid healing spec though, not for bleeding edge progression but pretty solid overall
---
Path of exile
---
Killing floor 2
---
Dark souls 3
---
While you do have some point, I don't think that you are entirely understanding the that you can't just make all the specs "viable" and every decision will have it's own consequences. 
---
For example - Elemental Shammies. The issue is mana and resistances in terms of raiding. If you remove or nerf the resistances from the mobs in MC and BWL you are going to make the situation better for them, but on the other hand it will kill PvE frost mage spec. If you give Elem shamans better mana management then it will make them brokenly OP in PVP (Because mana is the factor balances out the insane damage they deal in PVP). 
---
Things go a bit more complicated when you start thinking about the possible implementation of these changes and their consequences. It might be a personal feeling that it is not possible to fix all the problems without a global revamp. And this inevitably leads to the next question whether that game could be even considered classic or not.
---
Honestly it should be a non factor. While leveling you should use an addon to switch to gear with spirit as this greatly decreases downtime
---
If an enemy dies while afflicted by devouring plague it will spread to all nearby valid targets within 10 yards.
---
10.0 yards ≈ 9.1 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

---
What pieces did you keep? I am probably going to focus on mp5 because my +heal is getting outrageous.  Stuff like the hammer of the twisting nether (+238 heal) kinda pushed me over the edge
---
Because if you can invent technology that can reduce costs (in this case, by needing fewer support people), there's no reason not to do it. And no, that's not being greedy, that's just good business. 
---
The abuse methods mentioned in this thread, do people actually do this? Loot trading has been on retail for a long time and I've never run into such situations. 
---
omg same 😂
---
I was thinking the same xD
---
I saw someone in my guild realm transfer minutes after getting scarab lord. That is why I will always hate transfers. It's a licence to ninja and get away with it.
---
BiS is more of a one slot comparison using a scoring system for int, spirit, mp5, heal and crit.  It is good for comparing individual pieces, but typically doesn't include set bonuses.  However, there are versions for late game (Naxx) that favor crit and slightly tweak the score (example crit scored 10 vs 12 in early vs late game).  I would be giving up 40 heal and mp5 or so for some items, so clearly the slot item is better.  I was trying to see from people's experience if 120 heal and a bunch of mp5 was worth giving up.  Their experience says yes
---
Lolwat
---
Nah, you know what, you should stay alliance.
---
Thank you. Will go and clone one right now.
---
can't see why. 
---
greed for greed    
---
need for need
---
pretty straight forward concept.  
---
with a rule to enforce it you will have way less reason for arguments. 
---
Because they want to roll an a pretty female elf or human.
---
way to op 
---
Calm down bro, it’s a prank.
---
i prefer perception as a powerful on use ability instead of a weaker passive 
---
There are screenshots from retail vanilla.  They were posted here a few months back.
---
I think you might be mistaken. My BC shoulders that are similar are a dark red tint. On my character is says they are transmogged to the Ten Storms, which is ofc t2 
---
Early BC - late Cata
---
wtf the first one is retarded op 
---
Moron. 
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/emerald-dream/Ketoguido 
---
Check that out. You can see they are T2 shoulders 
---
would have to say this would ruin black lotus hunting
---
&gt;Or even better. We clear MC, Onyxia, BWL, collect materials, ring the gong, try to get a follow-up - "This quest required the Ahn'Qiraj DLC, 50€ only". This way, everyone will buy it right now, because everybody will want to get as much as possible from the event.
---
This type of DLC approach has never been done in WoW, ever. Expansions certainly require payment, but dungeons within an expansion have never required extra payments. I'd say you're worrying too much, although I don't blame you for being somewhat apprehensive.
---
There is not a doubt in my mind that Blizzard is going to offer paid character transfers for Classic WoW. In fact, I'd say with 100% confidence that Blizzard is already counting on server transfers to be a MAJOR source of income for Classic.
---
Launch will have multiple factors more players log in than will be back in even two weeks, let alone six months. Even with sharding, I suspect Blizzard will create FAR more realms than will be necessary to support healthy Classic populations.
---
As a result, I suspect an enormous quantity of those servers put up to help support launch will turn into absolute ghost towns and the majority of the population will begin congregating on 5-6 realms. Rather than do the REASONABLE thing and merge servers to alleviate this problem, acti-blizz is going to force us to pay that $25 to get onto a halfway decent server.
---
That's my plan. 
---
Streamer xfers to your server and his legions follow.
---
i would like to see blizzard bring back undeads are truly undead and cant be feared. but in return exorcism would have to be buffed and undeads would fear paladins doing an exorcism on them. 
---
League untill RE2 remake and then the division 2 
---
Yes. The biggest problem with being lower level as a healer is aggroing mobs from farther away and not being able to skip some packs groups are used to skipping.
---
Davay! davay! *360 headshot noscope*
---
Well, to be fair, a warrior with 1/2 is much, much better for the guild than a paladin with 2/2.
---
I got got, then.
---
Of non WoW stuff: Overwatch, Hearthstone, Master of Orion II, and some of my Steam backlog that I acquired from 2008-2016.
---
Depends, I could see them nerfing it easily by just a terrain adjustment or ai tweak.
---
you can even raid MC.
---
though with todays playerbase it is less likely for you to get accepted.
---
you can start es early as 52 with BRD.   
---
maybe even before that with a dedicated group.  
---
it may also depend on the rest of your group and their level/gear
---
&gt; Cannot transfer to "full or densely populated" realms
---
I was on one of the most popular realms back in the day, and this rule definitely wasn't followed by Blizzard.
---
Yeah our MT xfered the week after we gave him the eye from raggy #feelsbadman
---
from pserver experience people wont want to take you.  though dire maul for example isnt that difficult so shouldnt be an issue if you go.  sholo and strat may be a bit trickier because of aggro ranges
---
There are no issues. You can do them as DPS or even tank as well. Of course, it is more difficult as a tank due to wanting every bit of threat you can get your hands on, but I've done Dire Maul/LBRS with &lt;60 tanks and we just held our casts on big pulls and on 2-3 mob pulls you just nuke skull anyway. If you pull threat, use CC or a threat drop. Or of course, just don't pull threat.
---
You can respec at 55-56 as a healer and just run BRD/LBRS/DM:E (if at launch) and be fine to 60. As a mage, I leveled 58-60 almost exclusively off Strat/scholo/LBRS due to getting spammed in whispers.
---
Trying to get inside rank 5000 of Dota 2 European playerbase. I'm close but its a grind..
---
That’s funny because you just lost the argument that started this whole thing.  Honest question is there actually something wrong with you?  You got really mad about the whole patch release thing for zero reason.  Considering you were also wrong about it I would think maybe you have a certain condition?  
---
i actually really like perception. its crazy when you see a rogue stealth/vanish and then use this and watch them try and sneak up on you. its like you can ruin their opener everytime 
---
You can buff classes via synergies as well though. For example, I'd start with adding +10% nature damage to Curse of Elements and +10% holy damage to Curse of Shadows. Totally irrelevant in pvp and solo, occasionally comes up in 5 man, relevant in raiding. Would that be enough of a dps bump to let the utility of the shaman justify their lesser dps?
---
If they fixed the debut cap you could actually synergies with a Enhance shaman, have them set you up with Stormstrike. Or you could move storm strike to a personal buff like they did with Bonereavers Edge proc and that way Enhance gets a more interesting rotation and damage buff that doesn't really change how they work in pvp but does in pve.
---
You're right, you can't just buff one spec and expect there to not be effects. But you can look at raid-specific mechanics to see if you can help out classes in the raid environment without effecting the rest of the game, it is possible.
---
In theory yes, but mostly BRD. Depends if people want to bring you along at 58 or not. I remember doing MC at 59.
---
this is the kind of satire I enjoy.
---
its satire though, isn't it?
---
nerf, buffs and fixes happened all the time. 
---
some were even rather drastic. 
---
I am willing to accept further patches when they have the same quality as the wc3 updates.  
---
small and reasonable adjustments. 
---
I know this isn’t classic-related, but I was so disappointed when they nerfed the belf racial in 8.1. Now instead of a mass-silence it’s a spell-steal (almost useless). At the same time they made void elves extremely powerful (no spell-casting pushback, dmg and heaing buff, and an extra blink). I’m pretty sure Blizz did this so that people would pay for the race change. My 2 mains are both belfs and it’s just annoying that they would nerf a racial that’s been there since TBC so much. So yeah, I’m looking forward to classic cos I already know what I’ll be getting into.
---
the one in the video? 
---
Start of vanilla until end of tbc. I didn't enjoy tbc in retrospect. It robbed me of immersion and ruined the game imho. When wotlk came out I called it quits and didn't buy it.
---
Then played on several private servers which confirmed for me that vanilla wow is the wow I enjoy most by a long shot.
---
pandering to casuals requests and what's actually good for making Casual play enjoyable are two very different things
---
After playing the open beta, I rolled day 1 of classic, November 23, 2004. Human Paladin. This was my first MMO and I was blown away. I didn't rush to 60 (didn't even know how), and took several breaks before finally hitting level cap about a year after launch. Did some MC raiding, and played off and on through late TBC. Quit to focus on college.  
---
Later in college, Wrath launched and I tried it out. Didn't stick with the game for more than a couple months because I didn't have a community to play with. Quit again for what would've probably been the last time, until
---
...  
---
An old friend from classic messaged on AIM me about resubbing. I didn't see the message for months. When I did, I replied, but he didn't see my reply for a *year*. By that point WoW was well into Cats. We finally got talking and I resubbed to joined his guild. Been with these people ever since, and many of them are some of my best friends.  
---
Played off and on through MoP and WoW, pvping and raiding but never instensly. Really enjoyed legion and raided heroic for a year and a half or so. Quit due to burn out. I was planning on picking up BFA but I decided to skip it because I was finishing a PhD and starting a new job, and wanted to focus on that.  
---
I still stay in daily contact with my guild. It's more than a wow guild now. We've branched into a dozen games and grown steadily. But i have no interest in BFA. Absolutely stoked to step into classic again though!
---
Does anyone have a source for aoe farming with mages? Im looking for talents, rotations, camps, efficacy, etc.
---
????
---
To be honest the art style of stormwind always looked like what princess castles looked like in Disney cartoons. 
---
It basically sparkles. 
---
&gt; I eventually rerolled when I saw how bad ass Blood Elves were
---
/laugh
---
And I think that's one of the real difference between #nochanges and #somechanges. #nochanges doesn't just want the fundamentals, they want the exact same meta that's been burned into their heads over years of eternal 1.12 balance private servers. #somechanges people are more aware of the changing nature of MMOs and multiplayer games in general, including vanilla-as-was. We're less hung up on any given meta, after all "pure vanilla" contained multiple metas. We just want the fundamentals back.
---
Dwarf stoneform makes you sink as if falling in water when used
---
Joined early 2005 right after it released. My brothers and I had to share an account so leveling took a lot of patience and many arguments over who got to play.
---
Left in 2009 when I went off to uni. 
---
Very excited to get back in and play casually now that I have a career and family. Also excited to have my own account and not share with anyone! My husband will be getting his own! 
---
ok fine we are gay sprinkle sparkle kids and you are retarded kids who live in mud huts lol
---
Four entirely different points. In order: Irrelevant, stupid, obvious but off topic, what you aim for and what you get in the interim are different yes.
---
Patch notes 1.13: Cultivation has been renamed to "Grazing"
---
'Best in slot' means best in slot. You can mean in general or in a fight by fight basis, but you can't change the definition of the words themselves, that's tomfoolery.

Prot Warrior - Vanilla Experience.
---
1. How time consuming is the farming and preparation before the Raid? 
---
   1. Fairly time consuming as you need to make sure you have your own food, flasks, and pots. But the most consuming prep is getting your gear in order, running dungeons and then crafting resist gear. 
---
2. How well does the PvE specc work in PvP?
---
   1. I can carry a flag and generally be highly annoying. I could usually kill rogues and give mages/locks a good show with the silences/interrupts but prot dps is low. You can tank PVP bosses.
---
3. How easy is solo farming in terms of killing Mobs for reputation?
---
   1. Not easy. Not bad, but takes a long time.
---
4. How easy is solo farming in terms of Resources for crafting?
---
   1. Good if you know where to go.
---
5. How high or low is the demand of the Class in Raids?
---
   1. If you're good, always easily in demand.
---
6. Can you solo farm Dungeons?
---
   1. Not really, but you can put together a group and do it.
---
7. How would you rate the T-Sets in terms of looks?
---
   1. I hate t1, LOVE t2. t2.5 is a bit of a wtf. and T3 is bad ass.
---
8. How easy is it to find a Dungeon Group?
---
   1. Super Easy
---
9. How easy is it to farm BiS Pre-Raid gear in terms of competition?
---
   1. You'll certainly be the only tank in the group.
---
10. How fast or easy does the Class level to 60?
---
   1. Warriors are the slowest to level, and you shouldn't level Prot.
---
They should imo make it a one time switch , like you could one time transfer your character from a Vanilla server to a BC server, but theres no going back
---
Fun fact.  Parts DM farming was ninja nerfed/or made impossible by adding additional mobs/reduced changed drops.  As was ZG and Mara.  This lasted for all of a few patches.  1.12 apparently made them possible again.
---
I think you are missing the point its not about returning to the same guild and being in the same raid, it's about if they raided MC got geared out and take a break their gear doesnt just get fully outdated by a fresh 60 who uses a catch up mechanic, it will still matter and people will still be running MC, BWL and AQ40 even when Naxx is out so they can return to the game and still continue on their own progression with new groups who need people at the gear level they had when they took the break
---
I love the gnomish engineering idea. Would it also apply to tauren for herbalism?
---
There is no change in definition.  The BiS is straight forward.  The deviant grown helm is clearly the BiS for helm.  I am asking for a comparison of multiple items, not a simple comparison of one item vs another
---
I'm afraid I don't have the answer you seek, BUT if someone tells you what to farm and is on a Pserver, be aware resist values are wrong on Pservers etc so it may not work anywhere near as well on the Blizzard Live Version.
---
If you're a priest, you could mind soothe.
---
I think there's one important addition: a willingness to roll back changes. Rather than tying together giant lumps of content releases and across the board changes, they should be more fine grained in playing with balance. Be willing to try things, and if they push to far be willing to roll things back.
---
Shadowmeld breaks when you finish casting a spell instead of when you start casting a spell. (my ex was really enthusiastic about this for hunter ambushes with aim shot but I'm just imagining the mind control griefing)
---
If you kill a target while berserking, the buff duration refreshes.
---
nice, thanks. wouldn't a tank suffer a lot from misses? looking around the wiki, it seems like a lot of end bosses are level 61-62.
---
So, I'm Alliance biased. Typically in fiction, I like the weirdos, the abnormal. For Horde, one of my biggest detractions is that it all seems a bit dopey. Like, if I were to play an Orc in a fantasy game, the capital better be dark, grim, and foreboding, like Mordor... Orgrimmar resides in a tropical savannah. It's also kinda ugly. Something about this video made me see it a bit differently though - it \*is\* an imposing capital, just plopped down in a warm savannah, the last place you'd expect to see it. Imagine just being a zebra and stumbling upon a giant fortress of spikes. It emphasizes how alien the Horde really are to the area.
---
I'm still not convinced, especially since I'm going RP-PvP and I hear alliance has the better RP goods, but I've been looking for a reason to consider Horde and this has been the first major drop in the bucket so well played
---
That’s fair. I guess you just have to accept it if you’re streaming.
---
curse of shadows already effects arcane.
---
Idk why, but i can never watch your linked videos from reddit. It gives me an error, can still watch them if i go on youtube to find your channel tho.
---
Yea I'd like to see them actually develop new content with the ethos of classic- the areas and extra dungeons originally planned.
---
I started on a private server, my uncle was playing on it and suggested I should try aswell. I dont even remember what expansion it was on. I think it was TBC. There werent a whole lot of people online, so running into someone would mean you would stop and talk to eachother. Thats how few people played on there.
---
After a while I started playing retail because a friend showed me it. There were so many people, it was amazing. Within a couple of days, I was playing myself. At first I got classic and TBC, wotlk was available, but I didnt think I would need it. After a couple of days of playing different classes I settled on hunter. Then I hit level 15 and dungeons became available. At first I was like: this is amazing! Its so easy to level up. The private server I played didnt have enough people to do dungeons or bgs. Then I got to max level, bought wotlk and leveled multiple chars to max level. I got slightly bored with how easy everything became, so I started playing less. I came back in cata for a couple of months and did some raiding and pvp. But it wasnt the same. Everything became about queueing up for something in SW and play the instance/raid whatever. It was just boring. Collecting spirit beasts for my hunter and getting transmog kept me busy for a while, but I stopped playing again. In WOD I played for a month or 2 and stopped for good. I didnt play Legion or BFA. Now I just want to enjoy my slow progressing classic ;)
---
The amount of fortnite memes in world chat on private servers is one indication that kids still play vanilla. We actually had quite a few young adults as well, 18-21 ish. Yeah I was astounded as well when I first bumped into them. 
---
Joined 05 some time. Only thing I know for sure is that it was before 1.6 when they added battlemasters, because I remember all the people (on alliance) sitting outside the portal in Ashenvale. But not sure how long before that it was I started playing. 
---
Either way it took me until just around TBC launch for me to finally reach level 60 on a character, an Orc Warrior with like 13 days /played. I didn't play the game too much, and made way too many alts all the time. Was also pretty terrible since I never really played a game like this before, was more used to RTS and stuff like that. 
---
Then in TBC I started playing with some of my friends from school, since I was caught up at that point. Remember three manning ramparts and those early instances with two of my friends, which was really fun. But just a couple of months into BC I stopped playing the game for whatever reason. I think I was busy with other stuff. Then I moved out from my parents when I started high school and didn't really have a computer any more. But I had friends who played both BC and Wrath so wasn't completely out of the loop. 
---
I think I played a little bit towards the end of wrath, don't remember exactly, but I quit again a few weeks into Cata. I think I got bored and started playing minecraft instead, haha.

Then I came back to the game in WoD, first time I played the game somewhat seriously. Found a nice raiding guild and went through Blackrock foundry on heroic and stuff. Got stuck on Blackhand though, and after some guild struggles we pretty much all quit around the same time a few months into the expansion. 
---
Then I came back now in BfA, not because I was hyped about the expansion, I just felt like playing WoW. Has been alright so far, I think mostly because I couldn't be disappointed compared to Legion, since I didn't play that. Also took a 2 month long break in autumn while my guild was stuck on Zul, so hasn't burnt out like everyone else haha. 
---
...and a druid could just sneak past. niice, that's the two classes I plan on playing.
---
though mind soothe can easily lead to dire consequences iirc, since resist means instant aggro.
---
Pallys bubble and hearth whenever its off cooldown!
---
Oh, why does the tooltip say fire and frost? I thought vanilla was frost fire and shadow.
---
I'd prefer them to start developing new content for classic which fits with the game design ethos of classic- rather than moving onto spaceship tokenland that is tbc. 
---
I'd even like them to develop content for classic that has since been done for retail wow. Quel thalas as part of the main overworld could be very cool.
---
14 years older if I have to put a wager on it. 
---
Imo WoW is just a big chat with a couple of minigames worked into it to give you an icebreaker and have common themes to talk about. 
---
Why should that work as singleplayer?
---
Again, 2,500 pop servers will be ghost towns once the initial wave of tourists die down. 
---
Which is the main reason they’d make them larger.
---
They honestly wouldn’t need to even mention sharding if they were planning on servers that small. The inconvenience would be so brief in that case that they honestly wouldn’t need to implement it. 
---
November '04 till I left middle of Firelands in Cata, just got burnt out after doing all those dailies.  Skipped MoP and most of WoD till the end when I wanted to farm Pathfinder for easier alt leveling in Legion, played Legion till Argus and once again dailies burnt me out, and then BfA I think has been the deathknell for my WoW playing at least on retail.
---
I got 3x garr before I got the other. 😤😤😤
---
thanks a lot of the answers guys, it's nice to know a healer could indeed level from 58 to 60 doing dungeons and gearing up, albeit with a few minor problems.
---
This couldn't be more right
---
Yeah, I suspect they'll do something similar with Classic and potential future classic expansions. Share what can be shared.
---
That's strange. All I do is use the share button from the YouTube video to link to this subreddit.
---
Maybe next time I should just copy paste the link in myself. Your not the first person to tell me this.
---
Yea, in retail there is absolutely no incentive to come back if you've taken a break as a mythic raider. Even with the catchup mechanics you are permanently behind in progression based on play time. I miss there being achievable goals in progression per tier rather than the cash-grab infinite progression we have now in retail.
---
Im in a guild right now on a private server. My friend has played an been main tank for more than a year here. His guild didn't even get a single binding drop yet.. but you might get lucky.
---
Btw it's not just getting the bindings. You need alot of expensive mats. You should really look the whole weapon guide up. 
---
**ಠ_ಠ**
---
Lots of pre-AQ/Naxx BIS is crafted items, plus consumables, plus enchants... Not to mention getting epic mount for a lot of people was a feat in vanilla from what I remember. Took me months to get it (of course I had no idea how to farm gold).
---
It's not fast at all. Game needs to stay fresh in order to retain player base. I remember there was once a 10 month content drought in Cata when loads of people left the game including me.
---
When you have raids on farm or are sitting at appropriate glad rating, there is not much to do in game.

You said yourself you never cared - but as someone that did and still does, it's a terrible system.

started with classic WoW and then faded away at some point during Wotlk
---
Median xl sigma in 2 Days!!!!!!
---
I'd love to see Kara adapted to a lvl 60 dungeon intended to come after NAXX.
---
That's not how BiS lists are constructed tbh
---
It happened in vanilla, too. I remember people inspecting you and kicking you out of raids (or hard dungeons) if your gear was trash. Honestly, I believe only bad players are afraid of gear inspection. If you are good enough you will be able to farm pre-raid gear relatively fast. 
---
Which, people should remember, has a 16% ( i believe that's the number ) chance to be resisted and therefore aggro the pack.
---
AQ was only one example.  My point with that example is that any area that is under similar load outside of starting zones (e.g., Ironforge) will also be sharded for the same reason they performance-related reasons and,  therefore, will be not limited to starting zones.  That is my problem. 
---
My ideal would be where they added in expansion content, but retune everything to level 60 and with the vanilla stat system. All new zones added would be high level / max level zones. More like patch content than expansion content.
---
indeed it is, though some people don'T get it
---
well, this is mostly a joke/funpost, but people don´t get it seems. Guess, too realistic in terms of activision.
---
It's troublesome how it only works when you know the Rogue/Druid is there, which you usually don't. It'd be more useful if it actually worked on Vanish.
---
&gt; Maybe because in vanilla, the gear doesnt mean as much as it does on retail nowdays
---
Lol what. Vanilla was completely gear dependent. 
---
Battlefield 3 was the last good battlefield game they made. Started slipping after BF4 and I can't stand the new ones.
---
When I was 10, one of my friends and his father were playing - I was lucky to get the game and a subscription from my parents by Christmas 2005; spent 5 months leveling a druid to 60. I progressed up until Nefarian, which I never downed.
---
Most of TBC I spent goofing around, doing some raids, a couple of arenas and a lot of battlegrounds, but I never amounted to much.
---
Wotlk was announced, and my parents didn't want to pay for another expansion, so I had to get a job to afford it; eventually I became more invested in my job and my school work, so I never returned to wow to play wotlk.
---
This time around I am looking forward to doing all the things of which I had little understanding and a lack of maturity to do.
---
&gt;Probability increase with sample size
---
Again, no. The drop chance will remain the same with increasing sample size. Drop rates are just static values in a database.
---
&gt;and will get close to x.
---
Kind of, but all that's really happening is that over time as the sample size increases, the actual amount of bindings looted per run will approach the drop rate. That doesn't mean the drop rate changed over time.
---
Let's say I flipped a coin 10 times and had an outcome of 7 heads and 3 tails. In this case, surely you wouldn't say that the chance of getting heads is 70% and tails 30%. Those just happened to be the outcomes for that limited sample size. If I continued flipping for a total of 10000 flips, you'd see outcomes approach ~5000 for both heads and tails. See what I mean? 
---
That's pretty much the point! These online games that update frequently are in a weird spot where you can't simply go back &amp; play a specific version. I can easily turn on my N64 and play the original version of Ocarina of Time lol.
---
I really hope that whatever they do with expansions, they allow character transfers in some nifty way. Maybe you pay a one-time fee to move characters forward freely per expansion, or character transfers become a very cheap &amp; automated feature. Eventually, Classic will die, but it will die in the correct way &amp; they'll need to release the game for download &amp; offline/custom server play. We'll see what happens though!
---
I played multiple private servers with friends on and on off on pretty much alle expansion except wod. Tbh, most of the times it was the race to endgame ( fast xp servers) only to discover that i can't keep up with raiding schedule due to irl stuff.
---
The only time i managed to do it, after 3 weeks of not finishing Icecrown (it was all the raid one night and Sindragosa and the Lich King in another, but i was free only the first night every week) i got bored. And probably i would have quit anyway after downing the Lich King for i would have accomplished the Argent Crusade.
---
For me Classic will be the same. I just want to journey till i get Rag to yell me "DIE INSECT". Then the eagles can pick me up and bring me to the Shire for i am done. Which means i will go back to League.
---
Chtun would be iconic as well tho...
---
Imagine if classic wow beats the shit out of retail and GGG decides to release a quick mobile ARPG alongside their usual content updates just as immortal launches - then proceeds to beat that as easily as they did D3. 
---
2019 gonna be fun to watch from the sideline, while questing through classic again. 
---
You should probably decide wtf it is you want to say before throwing up on the keyboard and expecting other people to read it
---
Shadowmeld in combat. I miss having two vanishes.
---
They are the same.  Both areas will have load.  
---
Something tells me Blizzard will not suddenly reverse their load-balancing architecture in non-starting zones, based upon what Lasher2018 thinks.  
---
Once sharding is used in the starting zones for performance and stabilization, it will only follows that it will be used in all areas under load (e.g., cities) for performance and stabilization.   Then, we will no longer have the “authentic experience of 2006 WoW” which is the goal of this project.  If you want sharding, there is a game for you.  It’s called Battle for Azeroth.  
---
lol its funny how much i used to love the old gamespot layouts they would probably be hidious to look out now
---
I don’t think the people who scream for realm mergers over early sharding ever experienced one of those free server transfer abominations. I was on Frostmane US Horde when we got free transfers from Frostwolf. The server had a Horde lean before the transfers, but it wasn’t horrible. We ended up with a massive influx of Alliance who were further progressed than anyone else on the server (for the most part) which absolutely destroyed the server balance and fucked the community up.
---
You really wouldn't need your classic money in BC, it gave you sooo much more money than classic ever did. I started BC pretty damn wealthy but the quest rewards etc made my poorest friends as rich as I was in classic basically as soon as they hit 70. I was better off but gold was pretty much trivialized in BC
---
Everybody remembers not getting into a group because of their gear.
---
What people don't remember, or more likely didn't experience, is trying to get a competent 40 man group together. 
---
That makes sense. Thanks for adding that caveat. Just to clarify I mean to say leveling by aoe grinding, and not as much farming for gold at higher levels.
---
I joined in open beta and stopped about 3/4 through WotLK. I came back for about 3 months or so in Cata and then quit for good. Game went in a direction I couldn't accept. I began seeing this already in WotLK.
---
Looking back I agree. I prefer Vanilla, but I was quite happy with BC as well, but should've had some tweaks.
---
Well, this is true of course.
---
But still, taking a longer break will still hurt your progress, ESPECIALLY if there's new content after Naxx. If you're neither ahead of the curve or behind, you'll see that the majority of players will have moved on from whatever content you were at 6 months ago, so it will be harder to find groups. This is because there won't be a steady influx of completely new players as Classic's playerbase will most likely not be continuosly growing but rather start out at its peak and constantly shrink over time until only dedicated players are left. 
---
It's honestly hard to tell if it's a joke or not on this sub though.
---
Did they say it's about performance and stabilization (genuine question), and server load? I thought it's about the players being able to complete quests, which you can't do if there are 200+ people in an area designed for 20-30 people (thinking about areas like Northshire abbey here).
---
In the context above, there most certainly IS a difference between the two. 
---
Mage, play it at 60 on an undocumented
---
1. Best farmer besides Hunter, I have fun doing the AoE farms personally. Preparation for the raid is easy with that as a gold resource, but other than that you'll make like 500 water before the raid to hand out to healers. 
---
2. Pretty big difference w/o silence, Ice Barrier, Frostbite, Shatter, Cold Snap. Still can be effective in world pvp, etc if you're good with PoM and AP usage. If you get a nova --&gt; bomb --&gt; sheep --&gt; burst in an opener in the open world, odds are you're gonna win the fight. Probably makes the biggest difference in duels and premades. 
---
3. Best class for this if you're doing stuff like Timbermaw.
---
4. I would just continue whatever AoE farm you're doing and buy the resources. DM farm gives most herbs from the plant drops and has herb spawns if you go herbalist. 
---
5. Medium, maybe something like 4-6 is ideal? Mage is a heavily populated class, so don't be surprised to see 8 in your MC if your guild can't manage to snag a lot of melee. 
---
6. I don't know exactly what this is referring to. You won't be farming any dungeons to completion, solo, as a mage. 
---
7. T1 shit, T2 not bad, T2.5 shit, T3 decent. 
---
8. Mages might be/probably are the most sought after dps for a dungeon group because of AoE capabilities, water, good damage and excellent CC.
---
9. Really easy for the most part. Getting your Briarwood Reed can be annoying, although I got mine in 7 runs. Items like Freezing Band and ring/wand/neck? 'of Frozen Wrath' pieces are considered BiS, but are very expensive and aren't required. 
---
10. This was my first time playing Vanilla WoW to level 60 since 2006. I got it in 5 days, 19 hours using VanillaGuide. 
---
This wasn't on your list of important aspects, but the PvE rotation for a Mage is extremely boring. By the time you're able to have fun in PvP with a Deep Frost spec with decent prebis gear, you'll probably have at least 8+ days played. If you wanna progress to an Elemental PvP spec, then you'll need a lot of BwL gear. So you'll be spamming Frostbolt (and later on Fireball) for an extensive amount of time. For me, this made the class not that much fun to play at end level, and as such if I roll another Mage on classic, it will only be to support a Warrior/Rogue main. 
---
in my experience, 50-60 goes really fast compared to the preceding levels.
---
whether that is because it starts getting really real at that point, or if there's more experience to be had at that point I'm not sure. But I've always experienced 50-60 going by in the blink of an eye.
---
might just be because around 52 I can start attacking 60s in wpvp.
---
By adding relatively slight changes like that won't fix the OOM issue, or the thing that many mobs have around 300 Nature resistance or completely immune to this school of magic. Just as it won't help the 2.0x Earth Shock threat modifier. And for this specific case I disagree that it does not have any impact on PVP  since Elem shamans are already capable of producing sustainable and 4-5k burst damage and adding 10% more is a bit crazy.
---
Stormstrike applying a debuff on target is probably one of the least issues you get as a raiding enhancement shaman, especially with 16 slots. 
---
The way some class mechanics just work in vanilla are simply bad for raiding environment, and probably the reason why Protection pallies received a massive overhaul and Shamans got stripped of 2h weapons in TBC. 
---
I had the bad luck of choosing Crushridge-EU back in vanilla. It was literally full of italians who almost never spoke english so when i had the chance to use a free transfer i got the fuck out of there.
---
Kingdom Come deliverance...that’s about it lol 
---
I started in March 2005. I more or less broke down. I'd been playing Dark Age of Camelot, Star Wars Galaxies, City of Heroes and EverQuest 2. Because I was trying so many MMOs, I was determined to not get into another. So many subscriptions and so little time. Needless to say, once I did break down the rest of those subscriptions all eventually ended.
---
I heavily raided in Vanilla and Wrath, but beyond that none of the expansions really held my attention. Cataclysm was the last expac that I bought 
---
You're getting Curse of Shadows and Curse of Elements confused. In TBC and beyond they merged them together into Curse of Elements, which I think was just +10% spell damage across the board.
---
The biggest reason I don’t see that happening is it’s basically blizzard admitting that everything after wrath was them fucking up and taking the game in the wrong direction. Some would argue even wrath was that first step...but yeah let’s just get to vanilla and BC and see how things are at that point :) 
---
Joined in TBC left at the beginning of Catan, hated the changes.
---
Yea, this one is pretty important. Blizzard has a track record of doubling down on universally hated changes (like titanforging).
---
Not everyone survived long enough to make it home again.
---
I thought I joined in vanilla but looking at my account info it was actually right when TBC launched. At least the whole leveling experience was still vanilla though. I didn't even realize I was supposed to go through the dark portal at 57 or so and was leveling in plaguelands wondering where the hell everyone was. Until someone asked me what the hell I was doing.
---
Quit a few months into cataclysm because it was boring as fuck.
---
I mean, its a great game and all, but it bored me after about 150 hours already.
---
Fucked my first character up, started a new one and killed uber elder with it after my first 200 hours.
---
But you can always try new builds i guess
---
joined early TBC left mid/late WOTLK after pvp got completely out of hand with the DK balance situation (Blood DKs regularly 1v2ing people in Arena)
---
&gt; You can't seriously expect blizzard to pick exactly what you have in mind 
---
I have no expectations. Never have. I'll buy Classic, like everyone else here, even if they package a physical piece of human feces and write "ClAssIK" across the front of it. I'll probably order the digital deluxe edition too.
---
From a business standpoint does it make more sense to worry about individual itemization from patch to patch and try to replicate that, or to simple tune the content? I would bet that they will simply modify the gear stats and tune the content (cost effective). I wouldn't even be surprised if they tuned down some incredible pieces like edgemasters handguards.
---
&gt; I agree with you opinion on the matter it's just that it does not matter  because there are thousants of other opinions out there and it's isn't  going to happen the way you want it to 
---
People dont voice their opinion with the expectation that it will become reality... They voice their opinion to add to the conversation that leads to that final decision. I'm just contributing to the conversation. 
---
I'm not here to argue specifics, I'm here to argue an approach. That rather than some TBC style grand class overhaul, they could look for ways to slowly nudge hybrids to at least a 1-of raid viable without stepping on pure dps specs toes thanks to their utility. Even if you never reach TBC level viability, a little push in the right direction can help reduce the downside of bringing along your favorite meme spec players.
---
I don't think you can really compare the moves made in TBC as proving that the vanilla design could not be brought in line, they never even tried. I'd attribute the massive overhaul in TBC to the new design space opened up by the fact you no longer had to deal with the faction-specific nature of Shaman and Paladins.
---
Item level does a shit job of predicting the efficacy of vanilla gear.
---
Thanks that is perfect.
---
Voice chat in other multiplayer games has shown me that those immature idiots saying stupid things are indeed 18-21 years old. 
---
&gt; Over time this reaches a critical mass where adding new abilities would stack up to be too much, which leads to pruning.
---
I think they could have learned a little from how Legion's PvP talents were laid out. From Honor Level 1 to 10 you gained new abilities to fill out your toolkit, but then from 11 to 50 you gained the option to replace those tools with alternative ones.
---
Doing something similar for regular levels and abilities would help tone down bloat. New abilities don't fill up hotbars and rotations if they're replacing existing abilities. The developers could continue to add new and interesting abilities without having to worry about giving players too many cooldowns.
---
Even if this didn't work dont mages do well aoe farming trash in lbrs including the arena fans for similar gph? 
---
I really doubt they will ever get rid of a vanilla option. Will TBC exist eventually if Classic is popular? Absolutely. Will it be a forced expansion like it was on retail? Very unlikely. 
---
Well maybe I consider this, but I feel like not a lot of classes have difficult or exciting rotations for Raids. They bring much more to the table in Dungeons and PvP.
---
Maybe except for Cat Druid and Hunter.
---
I will think about this. Thanks for the comment.
---
When we had daily queues of \~1000 ppl and waiting time of an hour, the majority of the raiding pop jumped on the possibility to move to a new server.
---
What's the racial ability for troll priests? Is is worth anything compared to Forsaken ability?  
---
Asking the question mostly as a PVE player  
---
You can literally sit at the entrance to DM:E and fuck every Mage leveling for free honor..
---
Yeah, Prot is the most powerful in Groups.
---
Always admire the people who play this class in vanilla, it's something you have to go all in.
---
The progression model on retail is horrific. People had hit the base item level like two weeks after the expansion launch. Outside of RNG upgrades or waiting until the next week do their weekly m0's again, there was nothing. People complaining they had nothing to do were all over the forums.    
---
Essentially that's what happens in retail. It's easy to get to the base point. Due to all the catch up mechanics and invalidating all previous content every patch, people can be there in no time even if they didn't play in years. Then the only thing left are daily/weekly chores hoping you get a nice RNG upgrade. Do this on repeat, and repeat, and repeat. Oh it's the new patch now, all your effort chasing the RNG upgrades is wiped. Here's another couple of weeks of content for you. Then you can do your chores on repeat again.   
---
I couldn't do it, and it's why I stopped playing BFA even though I was actually enjoying the content.   
---
The thing with the old model for progression is it sticks. After quitting BFA I logged back onto an old private server character that I hadn't touched in about 1.5 years. Naxx has been cleared on the realm now, but my character was still at it's relevant point of progression. I was able to jump into BG's and be competitive. There were fresh 60's that I still out geared. There were ZG, MC, BWL Pugs to join.   
---
I've never understood this supposed need to rush the newest tier. I started vanilla late and this didn't bother me at all. Progressing through all the content in order gives you so much more to do. You start fresh in vanilla and you've got the whole expansion worth of content to play through. You start fresh in a retail expansion and you have one patch of content. It's madness, and I blame blizzard for it entirely. People want to be at the end game because it's all that matters in the new model that they have created. It never used to be this way.    
---
I get that at some point there needs to be some leeway to help the top guilds replace their losses, but minor catch up mechanics and a reset per expansion was fine. It doesn't have to happen every sodding patch. 
---
I can't speak for a lot of things you're asking since I never played a paladin back then.  But in terms of what race to play I'd argue you pick the one you like the most. You're going to be staring at it for houndreds of hours. Screw minmaxing. (Dwarves are dope man)
---
He was just demonstrating how little time he has for video games, no need to be an assass.
---
I've seen a few comments about The World of Warcraft Diary by John Staats, and I would love to read it, but I have no idea where to get it. No matter what I try to google, there's no results. I've checked a lot of ebook stores, but to no avail. Any ideas?
---
If you take a break for 3 months retail you are on the same level as a freshly dinged.
---
I might try "Kenshi" kinda looks like a rust mixed with runescape and mount and blade. 
---
Pathofexile 
---
"Blizzard is getting ready to take the wraps off of a new realm-transfer system (with European servers following suit after) that will let players move their characters to less-populated realms to get more breathing room."
---
Looks like something went wrong somewhere along the way.
---
Back in the old days, I leveled a lvl26 white wolf from Ashenvale after hitting 60, I remember it was very long especially since only mobs that were at least green gave exp to the pet.
---
Blood elves in Azshara were my usual targets as they are all casters and died really fast to my arrows!
---
I am now vey careful to plan in advance the pets I want to tame ;)
---
Retail wow. Its still not a bad game when playing more high-end. It was and could be way better.
---
Kinda same for me. I didn't know what was it about TBC that deterred me from WoW, but looking back it was mostly because of the flying mounts, which I think developers themselves admitted was a bad idea. It made traveling way too convenient. And too much convenience means the end of the adventure imo.
---
Classic will be, ironically enough, perfect for people with little time, who have a life and responsibilities. If you only have an hour or two after work, you can quest a little, which is actually fun in vanilla. If there is a particular Sunday afternoon or something where you will have more hours, say 3 - 4, you can even do a dungeon. If you can't play a few days because work or family was too demanding, then no problem, everything stays where it was, waiting for you.
---
OP has a fantastic point
---
I think there’s probably a very good chunk of people in my age range (about to be 21), who started playing in maybe late BC/early wrath, and stopped playing end of cata or sometime in cata. Even though we werent there for vanilla we’re just as invested in it because largely the social aspects of the game that we remember from early wrath time are very similar to how vanilla was (im talking pre LFG). I have a ton of friends who are very excited to play and have the type of community back that we had during the earlier expacs.
---
Quit when I went to college in 2007, didn’t have time to sit around raiding when I could be out drinking 
---
Started closed beta and left after the BC pre-patch. Came back at the end of BC and stayed through Cata. 
---
I was a druid in beta, and started as a Paladin on retail. I then switched to warrior after a few months. It wasn't obvious which classes were going to be best at 60, but I remember warriors with Arcanite Reaper were giving everyone trouble. I was a slow leveler and didn't know how to afford 400g for my Reaper. Luck8ly AV was coming out soon and the data mined Ice Barbed Spear was 95% as good now that weapon speeds were being normalized. 
---
I played a lot for a 14 year old and kept my gear competitive for a warrior until Naxx came out. I farmed myself an Earthstrike and was too burnt out to learn a new raid, and it was harder and harder to keep up with gear as a warrior.
---
I still liked tanking but I could not get a new weapon to save my life, so PvP became a chore when locks had more HP than I did now and without even a BWL weapon PvP as a warrior became a chore. (I had lost Spinal Resper and Untamed Blade both to ret pallies) and was cursed to never get another weapon. 
---
Ive never played alliance druid sadly but I was sad I couldnt get an equivalent on horde.
---
Looks like its prolly bis for leveling bear till maybe level 50+ if not 60 
---
I left at Cata, will I have to buy any new expansions or just renew my subscription?
---
OSRS my man
---
The private server I'm on doesn't do pets quite right, and it at least levels pets on gray mobs.
---
The problem is that its easy to plan for 2 pets, but your 3rd pet is going to be late because you need that slot for pet abilities.
---
Weird, look at the colors of the wolves and headpiece: https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/99527-the-ten-storms.jpg
---
I guess they must have changed it way later, or you're standing next to a particularly purple sunset in your SS
---
Idk to me they look exactly the same lol 
---
I started trying out project1999(EQ private server that's really well done, original + 2 expansions). Going back to EQ I realized that a lot of vanilla WoWs choices were more trade-offs than improvements. Been playing for a month and EQ has really been a complete blast and I highly recommend it to anyone who has not tried it.
---
Yes. 
---
“...realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). “

Sharding is a common load-balancing architecture.  See:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture) 
---
My problem with sharding is it was never part old 2006 WoW.  And it negatively impacts my gameplay by turning all of us into anonymous ghosts.

It negatively impacts the “core premise” of Vanilla WoW, as Nost stated, which IMO, is community is fundamental to WoW.  Vanilla WoW was about sharing one world together as a community of adventurers - not sharded ghosts appearing and disappearing anonymously around me like it is today.  
---
I have bought some games on sale to entertain me until the release of Classic. I have just finished Marvel's Spider-Man and started Celeste. Next in line will be either Nier Automata or another indie. 
---
How much g per hour is farming like this roughly?
---
Depends on the fight, on shorter fights where Mana pots and runes are enough, you can get other items (t3 etc) but on longer fights where mana is an issue keep the 3 t3.
---
The thing is that there us very few casual guilds in vanilla. Becaus very few casual Enjoy wiping On garr for 3 hours becaus They are casuals
---
That's because the content they release isn't enjoyable enough or replayable enough to space out releases wider, plus necessary things are locked behind time gates and boring arbitrary, useless in 3 months rep grinds
---
Sure you can. You need a GPU that can see both monitors as a single monitor, and then limit the area the game renders to using some mod like CT_Viewport.
---
The result would be something like this:

---
At least outland was destined for flying mounts (and you had to level up to get them, forcing you to explore on foot), I think the real problems started when they introduced flying mounts in the old world.
---
TBC had issues and more casual/"quality of life" aspects were implemented, but there was at least a balance with hardcore grinding, progression, pace, endgame content that was not available for everyone and challenges (especially with the introduction of heroic dungeons). 
---
To me TBC was a continuation of vanilla, with introduction of some new ideas. What was a real overesight was how irrelevant the old world became with TBC, it became pretty empty after a while, only people who were leveling alts were left...
---
Fury warriors are a lot more than just a rotation and gear though, cooldown and threat management, inching out the extra hits here and there on bosses like chromaggus where you can't just stand there forever, staying alive in fights. 
---
Theres a lot you can do to get more dps that isn't rotation, gear, or consumables, for fury warriors. They're almost unique in that sense, hunters also take a shit ton of work to dps to their potential.
---
But yeah in general you're right for mages, warlocks, they are both pretty straight forward, though rogues have some of the same things I mentioned above.
---
I'd rather watch classic burn, than trusting current blizzard to open the "changes" box.
---
On mobile so I don't have math on me. But mobs give up based on level, no variation. If memory serves, it's 45 + level*5 for killing an even level mob. So level 11 killing an 11 mob is 100xp. Elites are worth double.
---
Higher level mobs. +5% for every level higher (11 killing a 12 is 105xp) and lower level mobs are a sliding scale based on the ZD range above and a lot steeper than the higher level mobs, like -10% to -60% depending on level difference.
---
I have a Google doc somewhere with it all if you're interested.

Your spec probably wouldn't be brought into  question until wipe nights start happenning. You know, when voice comms start getting less fun and fingers are being pointed. You may not even be the first to be blamed, but you will eventually if you don't have a full pve spec. Or maybe not, who knows? Worth a shot.
---
This is what makes classic so exciting to me.
---
I was always the kind of gamer who either plays a lot (like staying in the basement for an entire free weekend) or doesn't play at all (for up to a full year cold turkey, depending on work/life/studies).
---
Classic will allow me to progress at my pace, even if it takes me several years to clear the main content.
---
You'd have access to all content up to the very last expansion (BFA) which you'd have to buy.
---
Started June 2007 - Bugged by a friend to start playing. But I kept making fun of him for it being too nerdy.
---
Flash forward a couple years...
---
WOTLK I was in a server first ten man to down Heroic LK. 
---
I basically stopped playing during Cata because of life and guild fell apart. I came back for legion because of nostalgia and the game had changed SO much. The class fantasy was really fun but it felt like more of a single player game. 
---
I'm subbed for BFA only because a buddy of mine gifted me a year subscription. I can't get myself to max level because of how uninteresting the game is. It's a grind with out any reward. 
---
or you could be like me and somehow manage to lose a pet 
---
Sounds fun af, try to divinate me :)
---
Played up to Cata. Mained a rogue, hard time getting into groups, hardly ever raided- but had a blast in wpvp.
---
Made a priest to get into raids and had the best time raiding during WotLK.
---
Thinking of going Tauren Druid-skinning/LW to enjoy both worlds, knowing druids are not the best. 
---
Druids, please tell me I'll fall in love with the class I never played. 
---
I always enjoyed having a druid as a healer/tank in my groups, and being part of a 2 druid 3 rogue 'sneaky' group. 
---
Fair enough, regarding their intention for it. My general opinion remains the same, I want it at launch for the reasons previously mentioned (even if their intention is server stability, it will still accomplish the goal of actually making the game playable, questing wise, if implemented correctly) , I don't want it at any point moving forward. 
---
I think the "anonymous ghosts" and splitting of the community is a bit of an exaggeration for two reasons:
---
1. At launch, there are hundreds of people in the same area. Everyone is anonymous to everyone else for that simple reason, too many people to remember anyone. 
---
2. It will be relevant for a very short period of time, in the grand scheme of things (again, assuming they keep their word and only use it a short while at/after launch, and then don't again). 
---
Well, in some ways. I don't think it's easy to compare to retail.
---
Yes, if you have pre-raid BiS, take a break and come back it is still the gear you need to have. The thing is, you are still somewhat behind. Say a new raid came out while you didn't play. You have the BiS you would need to start raiding, but you are still a raid behind and need to spend more time catching up. The exception is those BiS items that are still BiS through some raids. But people will still progress further than you while you take a break, so effectively you are left behind.
---
On retail no gear carry over to new content. Item level is king here. On the other hand, if you go back it takes like a week of casual playing to be raid ready and not super long to be considered really well geared.
---
So vanilla might have items that "carry over" for a long time through content, but other slots will need to be upgraded and you *are* left behind and need to catch up, which takes longer time than on retail where it is laughable easy to get catch-up gear. It's two different progression styles, but honestly I'd still say retail is the game where you catch-up the fastest.
---
The trick is to either have people not farm raids after 2 weeks or give them other stuff to do outside of raiding. Pre-cata people loved playing outside of raiding too, but now its log in twice a week to raid, log off.

Do me next!
---
Yeah, but that journey sucks monkey nuts.  I had an entire team dedicated to getting me Ony keyed and it still took an entire day, with mage ports and lock summons for the Test of Skulls.
---
The easier attunement was actually the reason I went Alliance when I played on a private server, although as a warrior, the weapon skill bonus and access to BoS for the DPS really solidified it.  And Fear Ward.  God bless Fear Ward.
---
Nonsense. When you need to wait 3 days for the GM to respond to the ticket and transfer the item then needing the items to trade to your friends will almost never occur.
---
It's not "the exact same thing" at all, and you know this.
---
Item scoring would have to take into account BIS and everything. Like, the belt that drops off in Rag for plate DPS is the cream of the crop-- if its itemscore is '90' when a belt dropping in BWL or AQ is '100+', it's the system that's wrong.

Someone will definitely make an item score addon, but it will be irrelevant. Warriors will be wearing mail and leather, pallies wearing mail, leather and cloth as BiS. Because of the phenomenon, the item scores will be out of whack.  
---
It will come down to joining a guild and staying with them. 
---
Yes, you will have to go through a lot of mental gymnastics indeed to not see that being able to freely trade loot with eachother will leat to more abuse.
---
Feb 2006 until somewhere in WotLK.
---
As a private server player that often takes long breaks (6+ months)  I can say that the easy catch up mechanism is also somewhat available in classic.  Because your guild has moved on and most steady core members have gotten a lot of gear in your absence, you, on return (and any other newcomer)  get gear in a much faster rate.  Not all the  current frontline gear, but certainly that of 1 or 2 tiers ago, which in vanilla quite often is still very good.
---
So you raided MC, then took a break and now the guild is at AQ40. You missed BWL.  Most stuff that drops in BWL will quickly go your way, because the others already have it  or better AQ40 stuff. And  even aq40 stuff often goes to newer players, as there are many reasons why it's 2nd class for a core raider but a huge upgrade for a newcomer. 
---
As long as you had a good agreement with the guild it is very easy to return after a long break.  I made sure I was a reliable raider in those months that I did play, so they knew  they could count on me upon return not disappearing again.  I take breaks, but I announce them. 
---
My god that would be such a terrible system. If a 1000g world epic drops, you should not be entitled to that item just because you happen to play a warrior. Since the item is BoE it's basically worth the same for whichever class was in the party.
---
The warrior needing to equip it just saved 1000g he would otherwise have spent on the AH to buy the gloves, while the 4 remaining party members get locked out by the need/greed system to spend the same gold on potential upgrades for themselves.
---
Farming Simulator 19, Company of Heroes 2 and Dirt Rally (soon Dirt Rally 2.0 when it comes out in Feb).
---
I have been looking for this pic for awhile, thanks! 
---
OF COURSE they add the system to save cost. Imagine not being able to see that.
---
Joined November or December of 2006.  Didn't make it to 60 before TBC (which is half the reason I'm so excited for classic, all the 60 dungeons are basically new to me).  Hit 70 not long into TBC, did some light raiding, mostly PvP and farmed gold because I found it relaxing.  Got a bit more into raiding late in the xpac once bigger guilds had Hyjal and Illidan on farm.  Hit WotLK hard, raided the entire xpac and cleared all the content when it was fresh.  Quit a few weeks in to Cata and never came back.
---
It doesn't need to be expensive if they put a long cooldown on it.
---
The only reason it needs to be expensive is to deter people from constantly using it but if there is a very long cooldown then it's irrelevant.
---
I join vanilla beta and leave the first time 2 weaks after cata release.
---
After wotlk the game was gone the wrong way
---
I’m playing grad school and fatherhood 
---
Literally nothing :( I can't find any other game interesting so I just waste time on the internet looking at Reddit and youtube 
---
You can only blacklist people and tarnish their reputation when you can prove the ninjalooting happened. In the case of loot trading, a smart team of friends will make it so you cannot prove it.
---
Example: 3 rogue friends wear UBRS, two of whom have an epic weapon from MC but are currently using a blue sword so they can needroll on Dal'Rend and trade to their friend. You cant prove this unless you are tracking the gear of everyone on your server at all times.
---
I had the same experience with dailies, they just became a chore.  Any amount of thinking about it led me to the conclusion that I simply wasn't having fun while doing them.  I'd rather just fly around and farm Mining Nodes or Herbs and play the AH if I needed gold, at least I found those activities peaceful and relaxing while I did them.
---
Started May of 2005,I stopped playing hardcore around mid Wrath. From that point on I’ve dabbled in every expansion however, I’ve never played consistently more than a month. The game has not been for me for a Looong time. Super pumped about classic!! I’ve been hoping this would happen since BC dropped. 😁
---
And for the next person, having flying and LFR wont affect their gameplay experience.
---
Which is why its stupid to change anything.
---
that is not my experience, and I really take these 6 month long breaks. (I wrote about it above) 
---
The thing is, a guild at naxx, keeps clearing aq40 and sometimes BWL. You don't 'find groups' for a particular raid,   you are part of the guild that does all.   The people in naxx gear still help in BWL, either for themselves or an alt or just for the sake of the guild, gearing up new members.  and the  new recruits (or me the returning player) go help in naxx, not getting much naxx gear immediately, but still being useful.  
---
We also still do ZG runs, since everybody including the most geared people need the Idols from time to time for the enchants. 
---
And people like to play alts.    MC is the only raid that really gets skipped at a certain point as being totally obsolete and even then a smaller group might organize bindings runs for the thunderfury .
---
After a long break, I usually got a lot (5-10) epic upgrades within a few weeks  and after a month or two I barely noticed any difference.  Only if you really want to go for a legendary or want to be the first player in your class at 9/9 tier 3 then it;s required to play non stop,  but if you are content with  being among the 2nd wave of gerared people, then breaks are fine. 
---
Even if there's no gear score, elitists will still be around to ruin the experience because they tend to run dungeons only needing like 1 or 2 specific items, and expect others to be at that point too. Gone are the days of naively running a dungeon as a fresh 60 with the hopes of encountering random unexpected upgrades.
---
That's no different from retail though. If you quit during heroic progress you can always start with a group which is still at that level.
---
What you all don't seem to understand is that this is a relative problem, not an absolute one. Yes, your blue gear will still be good but if everyone else has progressed to purple you're still fucked. Don't be fooled to think that group as well as raid selection processes are going to be any different in classic. 
---
If we're talking about bis gear the point is moot anyway. Either you aren't decked out and selection matters or you are and loot doesnt. 
---
I started just when BC was released and quite just after cata came out. I was desperately hoping cata would change the direction of the game so that it would be better, but we got the opposite of that instead.
---
if you're rerolling to a different class an elite guild should have you power leveled and geared pretty quickly tbh
---
Escape Artist, in addition to the snare removal, now grants a 50% movement speed boost for 3 sec.
---
I will quickly shed my involvement in any private server once Classic launches since they are inferior and make deals with gold sellers and all that. 
---
Yea, just today I came to the same conclusion. I'm not a fancy high-end raider who needs to minmax everything... and in my opinion dwarves are best fantasy race ever!
---
Nice and to the point!  Only thing I'd add is at the 3:00 point where you're summarizing what all you got, give a quick estimated gold haul with it.  Even if only vendoring the tusks and such.
---
You would just be at the same point as a new recruit.  you will get more than enough gear, just not the highest tier.  but anything that is the 2nd or 3rd choice will go your way cheaply , as the veteran raiders will have no need for it and that is not a bad thing if it is still an upgrade for you.  
---
Also most guilds use loot council these days. And they give gear to newcomers all the time for various reasons. 
---
I’ve never played a priest, but wouldn’t the resist be on the cast rather than when you walk in range of the mob?
---
I'm playing a paladin so I don't have much of a choice.
---
maybe you have a bit of a min maxer competitive raider mindset? 
---
Tons of guilds let people reroll  and leveled alts or took blue geared people based on their character, play skill and social skills.  Not all guild are or were about competing for server firsts. 
---
Especially if the game lasts for more years, the cycle of guilds going through BWL-AQ-Naxx keeps returning and you can always jump back on the wheel if you took a break.  
---
Yeah I took one, totally regretted it almost immediately. 
---
I think also something good about Classic that Blizzard has scrapped later on beginning in Wrath is catchup mechanics and catchup dungeons. In essence, you can re-start Classic as a new class and you have to begin progression at 60 from Square 1. No extra dungeons added in later that bring your gear up to speed for the final tier and obsolete the last 3 tiers of raiding. It's linear.
---
I think you vastly overestimate the amount of gear available to a raid in classic. I was a raidleader and we ran DKP - you had to be pretty damn lucky (drop that you can use while nobody else needs it) as a newcomer to get anything in the first months.
---
Again, all good things in my book.
---
A new vendor appears that sells only one item, Super Concentrated Vanilla Extract. You drink the whole bottle, vomit profusely, and get kicked off the server and sent straight to the Classic realm select screen.
---
I'd like that, but they seem reluctant to do so. There's a lot of space for a lot of content. Grim Batol, Uldum, the Dragon Isles, Azshara Crater bg, Mount Hyjal could be used for something, the original Karazhan before it got overhauled for BC.
---
The only issue I could really see is that the expansive chasm between players in gear would be ridiculous. A player in AQ40 gear (depending on class matchup) can 1v2 people in preraid gear, maybe with some raid gear. Imagine now if there are 3 more tiers beyond Naxx. It would be pretty nuts.
---
This just doesn't make any sense. You really think Blizzard stands to gain more from some $25 realm transfers versus $15 a month subscription from all the people who would quit and never look back if they were stuck on a dead server? 
---
Long term subscriptions are where the money is. 
---
Joined on EU release day, played through all of vanilla and left in TBC just before the Black Temple was released (which seems to have been a mistake because I hear it was a great raid). 
---
I started working full time and I just couldn't keep up with the time required for high end raiding anymore, not just the raids but all the consumes farming too, and it was all or nothing for me. I have come back for brief stints but never really got into it again.
---
Started playing at vanilla release. I lost myself in that game for years. I've had no better experience with a game than I did with vanilla. 
---
I have purchased every expansion and too quickly leveled nearly every class to max level to experience the changes and what not. My interest has died off in every expansion within a few months (except wotlk). 
---
I bought BFA, but 3 levels in I was so underwhelmed with the game while simultaneously filled with excitement over the announcement of classic that I let my sub expire and moved to a private server(for the third time).
---
It was worth playing each one to see the creative worlds, dungeons, and spell graphics updates, but the degrading difficulty and lack of community made each successive expansion less and less appealing.
---
Yea they were pretty common, but the community size was definitely much smaller and people weren’t minmaxing as much as they are today. A month into the vanilla server, twink tryhards will be missing only a couple bis pieces while months after they will be fully geared. 
---
I’m saying that with the release of battlegrounds, there will be hundreds of twinks awaiting bgs being fully geared and will wreak havoc on the new players that will be trying them. People didn’t know what twinks were, nor did any more than a couple people maximum prepare any toons in order to destroy in battlegrounds on their release. 
---
I’m trying to explain that I really am sure on it that it will push new players and casual players out of the pvp scene early without even giving them a chance. Rather than having early battlegrounds and being able to experience a pvp 10v10 with everyone in whites, greys, and the occasional green, new players are going to experience the constance of being 1 hit over and over on the release of battlegrounds and will remove any chance they might have of wanting to learn pvp or play it. 
---
Sadly those who can't afford a realm transfer tend to get left behind as their servers die leading to a significantly negative experience over the course of the server. I'd much rather see free transfers being given from High/Full to Low/Medium combined with merging servers with the intention of keeping server and faction balance.  
---
In short, I'd rather my server merges 5x then having to deal with people being left behind.  
---
Only sticky point on server merges comes with unique names.
---
I started in open beta, played until late TBC. I played WOTLK a little but didn't play again til Legion.
---
I still have nightmares when I see those pink ponytails....
---
Metal af
---
This has nothing to do with min-maxing. 
---
Yeah if its in, you would have to be pretty stupid not to exploit it. Though I would prefer it isn't in, because I planned on playing priest, this would make me have to play mage!
---
A full resto shaman will have access to Mana Tide totem, which you won't have. So you might get called out if people are wanting that? Overall though it's not like people can examine your talent points so as long as you can keep people up, I don't think anyone would notice.
---
That's a fun idea!  I haven't played since Cata but enjoyed your writeup, would be neat to see them do something like that.
---
It really depends on what type of guild you join. A casual guild probably won't mind, but more hardcore guilds would probably require you to get Mana Tide.
---
Has my full support. Blizzard and their shareholders will do whatever makes them profit so hopefully when/if Classic is a huge success they’ll consider models like the one you suggest. 
---
The mobility of Gnome Rogues would be ridiculous. Wish this was in game. 
---
Do not forget Shackle Undead. ;)
---
Expansive Mind, in addition to the passive bonus, on use now allows instant spell casts.
---
You can actually calculate the armor values of bosses from retail vanilla videos.
---
You take the damage of Bloodthirst with and without Crusader proc and solve the formula for armor value.
---
Almost all bosses had ~3730 armor in vanilla, with some exceptions being the Flamewaker bosses in MC for example.
---
christmas 2004, convinced my parents to to get it for me for christmas, spend a WEEK downloading everything because of dialup, didn't actually get to play until 2005 rolled around lol.
---
I left pretty early in cata, I didn't decide to quit or anything just stopped playing, didn't really relate to the classes I had played for so many years.
---
I eventually came back for a brief stint in MOP, frost mages felt very similar to how they used to, so I mained one for a few months, did really well in the arena/rated BG scene then left when they started talking about adding cast times and other crap that fundamentally changed how frost mages worked, in WOD. 
---
That's probably true. I didn't really play WoW until mid-Wrath. I spent those years in the Koprulu sector.
---
well I played vanilla for the past few years (with breaks)  and it's not my experience.  as soon as  t2.5 is on farm the t2 pieces or equivalent usually went for 10dkp (the minimum in our system)  Not the premium drops from nefarian obviously.   It was not rare that a new player got 4 items in one night.  One thing is, by then we would do MC+ BWL  + Ony in one go , or BWL + aq40.  so that's double the items compared to old times when we needed a whole evening for 1 raid. 
---
It also depends on class.  A druid gets all the stuff thrown at him, because we only had 1 that needed anything at any time.  a Rogue or mage might have 6 or 7 others in his class, so naturally he would get leftovers in a much slower rate. 
---
I started playing in late Vanilla and didn't actually hit the level cap until mid-cataclysm, so yeah this is going to help a lot.
---
And Dwarves for mining.
---
3 different old school runescape accounts at once. About half as interactive as playing a single version of classic WoW
---
&gt; It's not fast at all. Game needs to stay fresh in order to retain player base. I remember there was once a 10 month content drought in Cata when loads of people left the game including me.
---
Content droughts between the last major patch and the new expansion wasn't new to Cata and it certainly wouldn't be the last time. They were introduced in WotLK, where it took exactly a year between the last major patch (3.3: Fall of the Lich King, 9 Dec 09) and the release of Cata (8 Dec 2010), and were a direct answer to people not having enough time to clear the last raiding tier before the new expansion launched. (Naxx was 6 months and only because TBC got delayed for over a month, Sunwell Plateau was even less at 3.5 months) Essentially it was a change in their design philosophy. Where before the last tier was exclusively for the most hardcore raiders, by WotLK they began employing the "content is for all" philosophy. Which has its advantages and disadvantages.
---
Ironically despite being known for its end of expansion content drought, DS to MoP had less time in between than both the expansion that preceded it and the expansion that followed it. The reason it felt longer was because Dragon Soul was just not a fun raid, whereas ICC was. Also WotLK at least had Ruby Sanctum to soften the blow.
---
The people who quit Cata because of its content drought would've hated the end of MoP though. The SoO drought was more than 1/3rd longer, lasting 425 days or 14 months. At that time this was the longest content drought ever seen, a black mark on an otherwise excellent expansion.
---
As it turns out, the SoO content drought was a side effect of an expansion that would make droughts its hallmark: WoD. WoD development was a burning shitpile that Blizzard gave up on halfway through the process. It was still months from being finished by the time it release. 
---
As I said WoD was a time that saw the biggest content droughts ever. Not only did its end of expansion period broke the infamous record set by SoO, but there was also almost nothing to do outside of raiding and because they skipped out on two content patches (one of which was a full raid tier) there was also a massive content drought in the middle. Sure there were two full raids at the start of the expansion, but that doesn't change the fact that the time between the launch and the release of 6.2 aka the first content patch/raid (which also happened to be the last content patch/raid) was over 8 months, with only the infamous 6.1 Selfie cam/twitter integration patch in between. It's why I can't take people who say WoD is better than BfA seriously.
---
if a mob resists the cast, they'll instantly aggro you. at +2 lvl, it's "just" 6%, but go any higher and it sharply increases - +3 lvl means 17% resist chance, at +4 it's 28% percent. can be a bit quite risky.
---
march 2005 till january 2009.     It certainly feels like 10 years to me, but it was less than 4. 
---
&gt; When you need to wait 3 days for the GM to respond to the ticket and transfer the item then needing the items to trade to your friends will almost never occur.
---
This sentence makes no fucking sense... They answer the ticket when they get to it. I never had it take 3 days in classic. By Wrath tho, yeah tickets took a long time but that was peak subscribers.
---
In any case when they got to the ticket they DID xfer the item. Its the same fucking thing with a 2 hour to 2 day wait. I know because I got my Leaf, my T2 helm and my USTRAT XBow this way. 
---
Its the same fucking thing, only you didn't know friends and guildies were doing it to you so you feel better about it. But it doesn't change what actually happened.
---
It will depend upon the server population and skill level of the players -- and if those players can stay together as a guild for all of AQ 40 and Naxx.
---
Look back at the high-end / guild and player transfers trying to clear both raids.  Thunderfury rogues were transferring off to get into a better guild.  Main tanks who wanted to see ALL of these raids were transferring off to join into a better raiding guild; and sadly, some of those transfers killed servers, wiped guilds, and left many guildless and/or stranded on their servers.
---
The problem isn't gear inspection in the sense of "do you have decent gear from the previous tier?" it's, do you have T2 to join our MC group? The people you replied gave that specifically as an example, requiring 500ilvl gear when the dungeon it's for drops 450ilvl gear.  
---
This isn't something you can out prepare.
---
I actually only got up to Twin Emps and wiping in Naxx so I never got a chance for the upgrade.
---
In my mind though, you're right to prioritize mana regeneration precisely for the reason you just mentioned: there is so much more +heal than there is  +spirit and/or mp5. If you do happen to get something like the hammer of the twisting nether or the AQ version or grand widows hammer and you slap a +55 heal on it, even your low rank heals are going to be super juiced (especially with gear of tier two caliber whether its stormrage or miscellaneous pieces cobbled together, particularly when you add the "Animist's Caress" from ZG.

I know a lot of people will disagree with me and they will say that things are different since I played, and they are probably right. And I don't want to spoil people's dreams or be seen as a negative influence on the community, but we have to be realistic when we think about what gear we are going to get based on how many people might be playing, our schedules and other obligations, etc, etc. I'm going to have so little time to play from now until December that I will take anything people will give me! Some people will be able to no life it, and i envy them, but most won't and, as a result, won't get the best gear available. I don't care how easy people think the game is now, if you think you can casually walk into naxx, you're mistaken.
---
Saved. Thanks, sounds cool and something different than the usual recommendations.
---
There were restrictions that you could not transfer your PVE character to a PVP realm.  Unless you were a special guild, and I believe that only happened once.
---
But there were transfers off of "old ninjas" who had their characters basically die after having such a bad reputation on their server; but you also had guilds transferring in and/or better-geared players transferring in to fill spots in high-raiding guilds.
---
The loss of better geared players as well as the influx of better geared players played havoc on the raiding and pvp scenes.
---
And it destroyed a lot of the community.  Sadly.  Happily, it allowed some of the raiding guilds to clear content with the better skilled players.
---
I'm excited to see how it will be. 
---
&gt; Even most private server gms aren't that blatantly corrupt, at least not in that way.
---
This is stupid. Stop and think... The GM is doing a job xferring the item. They have no fucking idea that two or three people teamed up to roll on it. And you are absolutely mental if you think every GM that gets an item xfer request is going to go through millions of daily logs to find that specific run then read 10 minutes of group chat to get context.... lol
---
Theres no corruption. They are just doing their jobs.
---
I really love the idea of going back through the expansions week after week. It's kind of like timewalking events.
---
If that is your only argument as to why there won't be many casual guilds in vanilla then you are wrong.
---
Take GW2 as an example, every raid in that game is way harder than Garr (or anything else in vanilla). The only thing that can be considered harder in vanilla is the amount of time it takes to farm raids to gear up and this is mostly an issue with late raids (Naxx). Still, GW2 have an overflow of casual guilds and yes, a ton of them raids weekly. Casual guilds will not have problems on Garr and even if some have a bit of difficulty then it won't be that big of a deal - people won't quit just because they can't afk auto play while watching netflix.
---
You either overestimate vanilla difficulty (like all the "vanilla is hardcore!" people) or you underestimate the averenge gamer nowadays - people are not like during vanilla.
---
Id be cool with that if they scaled it abit. So Nax gear isnt outdated by 63. But simply have it feel like the next zone so no major boost to gear, health, etc.
---
Wonder if they could do occasional free realm transfer deals for people on low pop or faction imbalanced servers. They could also put in stipulations such as the server you transfer to must have a population above X and a faction ratio between X and Y%. 
---
I left it out since the tusks will be maybe 1.5g at best. Then depending upon the quality and makeup of the BOE green items. They will either be sold to a vendor as is, or sharded and put up on the AH which will also vary server to server.
---
Oh lord that would be amazing ;)
---
Methinks they're gonna cycle through to TBC and WOTLK, which had peak subscribers.  Not sure if they'll do cata, but I don't think so.  Then it could be a "season" or "ladder reset" thing.
---
On EU servers you can usually tell their age by how well they speak English, if at all. Younger kids tend to have worse English, but for Russians it's the reverse, but there are not many Russian kids online. I guess they must pass the gulag before getting a computer.
---
Games don't need to stay fresh. They need to stay good.
---
Nothing wrong with plopping another game cartridge into your system and playing something else - or go do something else for fun.
---
Football or Chess hasn't much change in the last few years and I see no one making any push to change them.
---
Wisp Spirit has a chance to activate when you are close to death, potentially allowing for escape. I mean it kinda sucks when an iconic ability of your race can only be used when you're dead...
---
"He can open the gate himself then!"
---
Very good video. I had no problems watching it in browser here.
---
A few comments: it would be helpful to note how popular certain zones are. Blasted Lands has basically nothing going on so it's a nice, peaceful grind. It would also be helpful to show the vendor prices of some of the drops just so you can have at least a bare bones understanding of how much you make in a worst case scenario.
---
Also, in the beginning I could see you looking down at your computer and breaking eye contact which you corrected at the end. Your hat also gets in the way of making that connection with the viewer.
---
Otherwise a great video. Keep up the good work!
---
Joined february 12th 2005, the day after EU launch i believe, or at least that's when i can see my first billing in the battlenet sub history. Quit for about half TBC, played most of wotlk, and quit for good about 2 months into cataclysm. 
---
Looks like they've got [pfUI](https://shagu.org/pfUI/) and [Natur Enemy Vast Bar](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/Natur-Enemy-Castbar).
---
I really hope it's not in, since it should be taken in consideration in class balancing. Gold per hour shouldn't be a shunned metric. 
---
A paladin is never totally useless. 
---
Have I ever chosen a Ret Pally over nearly another other DPS class? There was once a hunter who was IRL a 10 year old boy with a mic who did less dps than the main tank who wanted to join a raid. And a Ret Pally who wanted the same spot. I chose the 10 year old Hunter.
---
if the mob is only two levels higher than you, it's "just" a 6% chance, but above that, it increases rather sharply - +3 lvl means 17% resist chance, at +4 it's 28% percent.
---
Well, they specifically said they don't want to do that. They don't want to "run two MMORPG's at the same time". Also don't count on modern WoW dying and being replace by Classic. While some vanilla fans might say that it won't happen, too many modern gamers like it (by modern gamer I just mean how there is now a big audience for a the type of game modern WoW is).
---
What could happen is Classic becomes a major success and they change their philosophy on the matter once the last patch have been out for a while. This does mean Classic needs a high number of players even after 2 years (or however long it takes to get through vanilla content).
---
And if it happens I'd honestly think they would split subs. Currently you don't need to buy any game and you can play Classic from a normal WoW sub. If they have to actually run a second MMORPG with new content they will need a whole new department for that game like they have a team for Overwatch, WoW etc. They won't do that without a steady income. Giving 2 full MMORPG's with new content for each and only *one* initial purchase (modern WoW current xpac, the rest are free now) and only *one* sub is too much. It is a business after all, not charity.
---
Joined the 1st or 2nd summer after release. Played to 45 then ran outta money for sub. Came back at the announcement of BC and got to 60 the day before release. Played all of BC then left for abit because irl things. Came back at the announcment of WotLK and played all the way to Cata. Logged into Cata, leveled to 90 but did nothing but run through old raids I never did. Hated what they did to the world so i quit. Came back at Legion but absolutely hated what they did to talent trees so I quit and wont go to retail again. Its to dumbed down and they spoon feed everything. 
---
Invis pot has a 10min CD. You're probably not going to want to spend the gold on invis pots either at 58 when mount, preBIS/BIS, enchants, etc. are so close.
---
Scratch all that I'd go with a quest to kill 10 gnolls and which you turn it in for 30 copper.
---
If undead can counter warlocks because of their fear immunity and be countered by paladins I think it's fine if humans can counter rogues and feral druids. It would be pretty cool if how you played as, with, or against a race was different from how you played as, with, or against other races.
---
Do you mean Regeneration?
---
I see what you did there.
---
Are you thinking of East?
---
You are missing The part that is making a roster of 40 ppl
---
But what if they walk veeeery slowly?
---
anyone can support this tbh. very reasonable
---
Hmmm, pfUI has very different party and Unit Frames though no?
---
would like to know this. very vague answers here only. 
---
Fortnite.  
---
Just because.
---
PVP, no rankings, relaxed, and it's pretty much skill / chance of finding weapons.  Plus, changing scenery.  Can solo or group.
---
Try to track it down through the Kickstarter page
---
there is a good way to level your pet in azshara on elite blue drake caster mobs. They have low hp for being elites, and hit for pretty low damage on their frost bolts. You can nuke each one quickly from range while pet is at your side and will recieve high xp from the elite bonus. 
---
&gt; You just said it can be eliminated by not having loot trading which obviously isn't true.
---
Exactly. I wonder why people keep trying to float that lie in there.... Its like... there's no need to lie about loot trading. I don't mind if they take it out either, but stop claiming removing it eliminates people rolling together to screw someone. It absolutely doesn't. GM tickets accomplish the same damn thing.
---
I don't know why its more comforting for them to lie about such a small thing.
---
Take my upvote for your effort!
---
Ele shaman is beautiful and always my favorite PvP class! But it requires a lot of movement skill for kites (I remember Moonwalking 90% of the time), quick decision making (grounding totems, timing Earthshocks against casters etc) and you'll need decent gear to survive Rogues stunlock. It's a fun class to play, but its a pain for a long time gettin there. Many people prefer Enhancer for good reasons.  
---
That being said: I was raiding with that exact same specc and up until mid-BWL it was no big deal, I even told my Raidleader about it and also said, that when theres need, I will respecc. No need to be secretive about it, I think it just hurts your reputation in a guild/raid when you lie. Healing became MUCH more fun when I specced to full heal though, bc more Mana, more heal power and Manatide gets you a lot of value in raids.
---
&gt; Yes, you will have to go through a lot of mental gymnastics indeed to not see that being able to freely trade loot with eachother will leat to more abuse.
---
He never fucking claimed it wouldn't. And... you are changing the subject. Not to mention, you would have to go through a lot of mental gymnastics to not see how it would aid mistakes on masterloot and rolls.
---
"I'd rather be shot in the foot than trust someone to shoot me in the foot."

Thank you for the feedback.
---
I'll make shure to ditch the hat moving forward. When I dont shave the old noggin it looks like a a dying cornfield.
---
I will also try and give a rough estimate of gold made before the auction house as well. It's going to be tough cause alot of the BOE items will be disenchanted and sold or sold on AH as is. 
---
Shadowmeld changed to be useable in combat.
---
pfUI is VERY customisable.
---
My experience as a Resto Druid in original vanilla. from Dec 2004 - Aug 2006.
---
1.   How time consuming is the farming and preparation before the Raid?
---
(2) - It can be very difficult due to the inherent inability to do damage Druid's have. However, Druids can farm their own materials pretty easily (just takes a while) and if you play the AH and have a good profession you can definitely get by. I'm not that smart and I was always able to get by just fine.
---
2.   How well does the PvE specc work in PvP?
---
(5) - Extremely well. Resto Druids in PvP are tremendous healers and the undisputed best flag carriers in WSG. Resto Druids are also really well suited to using their wide tool set to swing the tides of PvP battles without subjecting themselves to too much risk.
---
3.   How easy is solo farming in terms of killing Mobs for reputation?
---
(3) - It is pretty easy, it just takes forever. I slapped on my best feral gear and was able to grind furbolg rep to exalted as a mindless way to make money and get a fun trinket. Nothing to write home about
---
4.   How easy is solo farming in terms of Resources for crafting?
---
(3) - See above. Druid's can farm just about anything, it just takes a while. Mob's don't usually have ways to escape roots, so Druids can farm Devilsaur solo as well as other high value mobs if they don't mind grinding it out.
---
5.   How high or low is the demand of the Class in Raids?
---
(3) - All raids love Druid's for their utility but there aren't usually more than 3 or 4 per raid. Like any class, it's important to have at least a few around to soak up some gear and to provide that utility, particularly with poison and curse healing and sleeping, but otherwise not too terribly essential.
---
6.   Can you solo farm Dungeons?
---
(?) - I never did. I did do some stealth run with some rogues and druids that were fun though.
---
7.   How would you rate the T-Sets in terms of looks?
---
(4) - Dreamwalker and Stormrage are among the better sets, but Cenarion is only OK and AQ is godawful.
---
8.   How easy is it to find a Dungeon Group?
---
(4) - A lot of it has to do with being a nice person, but I never had problems finding dungeon groups before I was really into the raiding scene. Literally the only thing that stopped me which I completely understand was "we don't have a priest or shaman, so we don't want druid as we have no rez abilities".
---
(4?) - "BiS" didn't exist to my knowledge when I played, but Druid's have access to great leather and cloth healing gear. Technically Shaman might horn in on your gear, but I think most people were pretty good about letting each class keep their classes armour type.
---
10.   How fast or easy does the Class level to 60?
---
(5) - Even back in Vanilla I loved leveling my Druid and it was really not that difficult at all. I got up to 60 within about a month's time and never looked back.
---
Hope this helps. As always, I acknowledge I haven't played vanilla in 12 years but if anyone has any questions or wants to chat by all means send me a PM.
---
Vanilla realm transfers were from designated high population servers to low populations.  I transferred from Blackrock to Daggerspine because I was literally in 3 hour queues to play the game.  It wasn't a giant freeforall.
---
Hi, /u/sintaroactual
---
Joined on the launch date of Xavius EU (maybe someone can chime in when that was - early 2006 I think?) Left during Wrath. Returned a few times over the years but never for long periods. Just never found retail the same:(
---
I better plan would be to have server merges preplanned.
---
Vanilla wow of course! 
---
Every main boss from every raid become world bosses sprinkled throughout all the worlds. 
---
Quest, kill them all for a specific piece they drop
---
Complete the quest by assembling all pieces which opens a portal.
---
Go through the portal and defeat The dead Stormwind King (or Thrall depending on faction) in their Classic hut/castle.
---
 Once they are killed you get a fancy title and a horse mount. Congrats
---
In 2 months you'll be able to buy the mount for 25$
---
Stoneform is a permanent passive effect that boosts armor by 10% and makes all dwarves permanently immune to poison/bleed/disease, however it also permanently slows their movement speed by 10% 
---
&gt;99% chance in 130 runs
---
Bullshit. My guild got to 4H in naxx and never saw the second binding. We still raided MC while we were progressing in AQ40.
---
&gt;Most people feel very unlucky not getting both Bindings after 60 runs or so, but in reality it's pretty common
---
More bullshit. Just because it drops like candy on private servers doesn't mean it was or will ever be like that in Classic.
---
Maybe they can in classic. We dont know yet.
---
None of those addons will work in Classic so I'm sad to say the information won't do you much good. 
---
Could you cast Fade to bridge the aggro gap?
---
I would argue TBC was that first step: 1) Flying Mounts, 2) All high-level players leave the world to go to another planet, never to be seen again by lvls 1-69, 3) Too many zones where Alliance and Horde could look at each other semi-comfortably, losing the mystery of the other faction, and 4) they fucked up the lore and sense of belonging with horde paladins and alliance shamans, which were representatives of their two very distinct "religions". On based on being good, one based on being balanced. All that went to shit.
---
Im of the opinion that if the Classic community insists on small cap servers of 2500 to 4000, then we had better **also** support server transfers off of dead realms man...
---
It would be the silliest self inflicted wound to refuse to acknowledge the number of people that are going to try Classic then quit (leaving a lot of empty servers) then fail to support a system that could help those people on abandoned servers find a sizable community to play with.
---
We will see I guess. 
---
Exactly. What’s funny about current wow is that in the same first patch of hitting max level and being raid geared in the first tier, there’s like 100 ilvls difference because of the stupid amount of raid difficulty levels. My fresh 120 would never ever have a chance against my geared 120 to even take him down by 5% health. 
---
To contrast, in vanilla... I’m pretty sure the lvl 55-60 dungeon tier 0 set has like a 3-5 ilvl difference between it and tier 1 raid gear. Gear helped and felt great to get, but wasn’t as stupid. 
---
Oh yes! Achievements, I remember them
---
&gt; Free realm transfers were a thing much earlier. 
---
Yup. I mean, imagine that. Back then WoW was adding subs at an alarming rate, yet some servers still ended up dead from low populations. Imagine whats going to happen THIS time when an even higher percentage of people will probably leave the servers after trying them + the game is no longer growing subs at a 2004 rate...
---

---
Omg, yeah I pretty much have to roll alliance druid now, that sounds amazing
---
That's my problem if I'm not pushing glad, hero in RBGs or cutting edge in mythic i feel like it's not worth the time 
---
Fade doesn't reduce the radius mobs will aggro you. It temporarily reduces your threat, so if your heals outthreat the tank on a mob you can hit fade and they probably will go back to tank.
---
I'm assuming this is what retail is like now? I just downloaded WoW and opened up my account to see all my characters with name changes 😢 I might get a month sub just to take a look around but can only assume everywhere will be empty (Main is level 80)
---
I got the game after Christmas 04 but before new years. I remember calling every store in the city trying to find a copy but they had stopped getting new copies as the servers were overloaded. I was lucky enough to find a copy of the collectors edition in a Circuit City.
---
I played for most of TBC and Wrath but never went back into hardcore raiding and I stopped sometime after Trials were released in wrath.
---
North can be 100-150 per hour.
---
&gt; Will I be able to join raids with that spec? 
---
The question is, do you really want to join such a raid? I mean if the MC run takes 2h longer because its a raid with a bunch of slackers you could just farm 100g in that same time anyway...
---
No.
---
I tried to google it but couldn't find. But i am sure i have seen it in some of their interviews. Maybe not in exact same words as i have said, but the idea was that they don't care how popular Classic will become, they will still keep it up and running.
---
Played on my Parent's account for a few years, since probably 2006. Got my own account in 2008. Been playing on and off since. Always come back for a new xpac for a few months at least.
---
Oh alright. I just started playing a priest on a ps so thats good to know lol
---
&gt; I don’t think the people who scream for realm mergers over early sharding ever experienced one of those free server transfer abominations.
---
Congratulations, your server is dead and merging with a popular server!!!!
---
It's Asmongold's server.
---
Anything with stam. There arent that many but check on dbvanilla the superior (blue) maces.
---
They usually go for cheap on the ah since no one uses em!
---
Theres no real good daggers.
---
You rly dont have to go alliance just for that item tough :p horde druids are amazing for that 5% more health, stun+ heal combo and they dont face shamans in pvp.
---
Netherwing server
---
Why is that?
---
maybe they will merge servers, like move all characters from A to B, with name changes if the name is taken, or something? I assume they won't do that -Silvermoon -Moonglade -Ravencrest, hopefully.
---
I don't know. Vanilla is vanilla, no name changes is no name changes, but post-merge could be an exception?
---
I think it would be cool if the race you chose drastically changed how you and those around you played the game. I don't want to see tiny 1% changes in stats. I want to see *20%* changes. And those buffs that are on a cooldown? Make them always active or toggleable with a downside.  
---
I want to see a Warlock cower at the sight of an Undead because not only will Undead take heavily reduced Shadow damage, they're also just outright immune to Charm, Fear, and Sleep.  
---
I want Dwarves to always be immune to Disease and Poison. Make Stoneform a toggleable ability that prevents Bleed and reduces physical damage taken but also reduces haste and movement speed.  
---
I want Gnomes to have a reduced movement speed but be far more affected by effects that improve movement speed or induce motion. I want Tauren to have the opposite. Rocket Boots won't do much for someone as massive as a Tauren but against a knockback effect they'll be unmoved while gnomes will go flying.
---
Not all fathers are husbands, not all husbands are fathers.
---
you are probably the type of person that rolls need on weapons when everyone else greeded since they vendor for good cash. 
---
if you want to sell it you press greed ffs.  
---
if you happen to get a fitting drop during a run then you should have the right to get it if you want to use it.  
---
One thing: AQ gates. &amp; Scarab Lord title.
---
People with fully completed scepter will hop to another realm with closed AQ gates and open them just to get the title. This can happen when a person was a bit too slow open on their own realm but went ahead and finished the scepter anyway just to transfer somewhere else to open AQ there.
---
Henry, my boy !
---
I pugged Garr in Vanilla. All you really needed were enough warlocks to banish the adds. I think the only things we didn't pug in MC were Executus and Rag.
---
I want something new. They could easily do Kara, CoT, and fill in the dead/unfinshed zones wuth content without releasing a new xpak.
---
I love TBC but wasnt the biggest fan of WotLK so for that reason I dont want them to re-release the xpaks.
---
However if they go that route I hope they modify it abit so Nax gear isnt outdated in the first zone
---
&gt; vomit 
---
you think you do, but you don't. That's just an illusion.
---
Thanks, and please do post the link, I love data. Would appreciate it.
---
I am super excited to get back and playing casually, I thought about maybe checking out retail for a bit but thought what's the point! I'm excited to get WoW classic back in one of my go to games ☺️
---
Where are you farming 50g an hour in classic?
---
Yeah thanks man :) Definitely troll abilities seem quite poor :(
---
I could see the effect being far less effective while moving. Moving wouldn't take you out of Shadowmeld but if your target isn't facing the other way you would almost definitely be spotted.
---
Except for your friends that started fresh with you God dammit Larry how'd you level up five times I was only asleep for six hours!
---
Like the Matrix, you could have a text box open up before drinking saying something akin to “I only offer the truth, nothing more.”
---
I wanted to play earlier, but I was in high school with no pc. Started early 2006 with graduation money and my first job.  Made it to lvl 60 a few months before BC dropped. Got my epic mount right after the gold reduction.  Never unsubbed until lich king. About 2/3 into lich king I unsubbed. Came back for cata expansion launch, quit after about 3 months of cata and never looked back.  Havn't played since. Cata changed far too many things for my taste.
---
THIS!!!
---
I never got to see molten core, or any of the 60 raids. I have no idea the order they're in or anything, so it's completely new to me!
---
I started on a Resto/Ele Shaman just before the AQ40 patch and raided hardcore into Ulduar. I quit hardcore raiding right around Trail of the Crusader patch in WotLK. I started again during ICC and then quit again after clearing it. I started again during the launch of Cataclysm rolling a new class (Hunter) and did the first raids of that expansion before basically quitting the game forever. I played Legion and WoD for a bit, but could never get back into it.
---
I'm looking forward to having a nice, slow progression through Classic again and I think I'll either play Hunter or Mage although Warrior would be fun too.
---
No I am not. You are saying, and I quote,
---
&gt; Becaus very few casual Enjoy wiping On garr for 3 hours becaus They are casuals
---
So we are talking guilds that have 40 people to raid, or maybe they pug 10 of them. The problem of getting enough people for a raid is a different issue not related to casual guilds having trouble clearing bosses once in the raid.
---
That's what I'd like to see. New dungeons, raids, factions for level 60 characters. Perhaps even new dungeons for lower level characters.
---
I know, but its fun to think about bs like that that will fortunately never happen.
---
I played on EU. Joined around april-may 2005. Played until a few months into WotLK.
---
Never played WoW every since. Never played on pservers either.
---
My best period was TBC, but closely followed by Vanilla.
---
That is perfect, Druid is on my list.
---
PvP a solid 5 looks really great. Playing the BG as a Resto was something I'm interested in.
---
So screen shotting someone master loot ninjaing and black listing is different from someone holding an item for ransom in a whisper and screen shotting and black listing is different how ? Either way it comes down to black listing for being an asshole with a screen shot.
---
Awesome game, Hans is easily my favorite character in recent games.
---
Free ones were available even earlier than paid transfers. Though they were mainly intended to manage population sizes to avoid massive queues and dead servers. You could transfer characters in Vanilla in exchange for money apparently after 1.11. I know from personal experience that they existed back then because I've used the service to get 60's characters on both factions on a PvP server. 
---
That will not be possible without spell batching, no.
---
Played between Jan '05 until July '09. I got a summer job with unreliable hours which cut into my raiding schedule, and without raiding I couldn't find much to enjoy anymore. TBC was my favorite. I will always remember long nights in SSC and TK making Vashj and Kael attempts with my guild!
---
Classic uses a completely different API than the one you see in the video. The one private servers use is from 2005isch, Classic at the moment uses a modified version of the Legion API but I wouldn't be surprised if it uses a modified BfA version at launch. 
---
Do you know how many ninja changes  there were in Vanilla?  You wouldn't know unless it was a big part of your game play.  Just like rolling ignites used to not have a limit.
---
But a lot of that has been lost.
---
Weren't realm transfers virtually always *to* dead realms rather than off of them?
---
Free realm transfers were, but a lot of players from dead realms used realm transfers to go to a more populated one, or from a realm with a massively under-represented faction to the opposite
---
Played in the open beta. Didn't like the idea of paying for a game over and over so i didn't buy it.  Played on a friends account a little. Sucked it up and got my own account maybe 2 months after release. Stopped during Cata after pandas were announced. Wasn't really in love with Cata but knew they were jumping the shark with pandas. Heard good things about legion so i picked it up for about 2 months before stopping again. 
---
I think it would be interesting if Regeneration was just way more powerful. Like, 1% per second during combat. If you're facing an army of trolls you *really* need to focus them down one at a time because anything but a killing blow won't mean much a minute from now.

What are you talking about? You can take a break and come back and suddenly your old tier set is now outdated. The longer you spend on break the more outdated your gear will get with no catchup mechanics to help you to get to others’ level. 
---
which is better for farming, DM North or East, and what professions do they require?
---
&gt; And the introduction of arenas and resilience gear destroyed PvP for me.
---
Resi and Arena saved PvP. In vanilla you had unskilled PvE heroes one-shotting people in battlegrounds. TBC exposed so many overgeared players with huge time investments, instead of pure skill.
---
Yeah it doesn't play from Reddit iOS app for me.
---
&gt; ...Naxx was 6 months and only because TBC got delayed for over a month, Sunwell Plateau was even less at 3.5 months...
---
This is something that has always annoyed me. Hardly anyone actually cleared these raids. 125 guilds (5000 people) for Naxx before TBC was released. Compared to around 8 million subs at the time. They could have really stretched out the release dates. Maybe added some stupidly long and hard quests to keep the the ultra hard core busy.
---
You will meet people for sure with sharding.
---
GMs aren't paid to be your Blizzard news source 
---
Eh in the current game it's so easy to catch up gearwise i'd say this is a non issue.  I know this is a circle jerk for classic but facts are facts.
---
Joined opening day, got a little beta action. Played BC, WotLK, left right at Cata launch. It was boring, also didn’t like the new “shake ups” of the world, Art was ugly. Came back mid Cata, left due to Panda expansions due to Pandas and wasn’t feeling the whole panda culture. Didn’t play Mists and played last 2 months of Draenor, not a fan of the time travel story bs, mostly to level for Legion. Played hardcore again first time since WotLK. Loved in and then found out the artifacts are all going away. Was tired of grinding and having all your progress reset again and again and again. Going to play Classic. It was my favorite. 
---
Sure, but even for the hardcore base they were geared towards they fucked up some fundamental aspects of engaging those players, hence my list of problems.
---
I started like... just before launch. (I think I was in the last week of beta testing, essentially).  Played PvP for a bit, then went to RP-PvP.   
---
I stopped... I want to say 3 zones into Wrath?  By that point I had just burned out on the game and didn't want to continue, which I sort of regret as I heard Wrath was sort of the last 'great' expansion.
---
My bet, Aug 22nd. 
---
Hey? Because that was the release for Vanilla
---
You people need to make your mind, either changes or no changes. Like get real.
---
A different team than the original, with different vision will somehow continue to change the game post naxramas in a way that won't destroy the game. They will keep the old content relevant, and will release items just as broken and nonsensical as the ones before that.
---
There are so much potential for disaster if they decide to keep the game "fresh" that i can't help but wonder what you people really want.
---
Short answer - No
---
Long answer - These types of questions are why we have automated GM replies and long wait times for real game problems.   The only time you need to /petition a GM is if you're character is physically stuck, bugged, exploited or scammed.
---
Id log back in for this event.
---
Girlfriend and I are playing through the Kingdom Hearts ps4 edition (The one with like, 6 damn games in it) in prep of playing KH3 later this month.  On the side I'm playing Overwatch and working on my own unreal project.
---
Oh wow, I didn't see your comment before I posted mine but they are surprisingly similar.
---
I think Vanilla WoW actually hits a sweet spot right in the middle. You can play it solo for the most part, but group content is exactly that group content. Unlike later expansion where you can solo 3 man quests, etc.
---
And totally irrelevant to your original point.
---
You have no idea how much people are paying for character services. 
---
Oh so that means I might be able to use my Retail UI then?
---
That he endorses pedos.

---
Long. The grind from 50-60 will be just like leveling your character itself.
---
Yep I kinda went the same road, was Elem/Resto, would mainly do dps and support in raids and heal when needed. Once we were short on healers I was asked to go full healing for manatide and ended up pleasantly surprised how much more fun raiding was a full restoration than the 30/0/20 hybrid pvp build. Had to change how I played pvp, but was still viable as a more of a support role there as well.
---
I remember the day I first played very vividly. It was 2005. My friend's older brother was an avid blizzard fan. We would often watch him play matches of Warcraft 3 ladder. My buddy said there was a new game where you could actually play as the heros in the game and level up. This concept completely blew me away. I had played runescape before but this was something completely different. We booted up the old dell laptop, logged in his brothers account and made a Tauren Druid. I kid you not we sat there and played and played until we were almost level 30. We ran all sorts of dungeons, participated in ashenvale world pvp, played wsg back when you had to walk to the portal. We were complete noobs and died often but that didn't stop us. I became obsessed. I would sleep over just to play more of this game. Soon I was asking my parents for my own PC. I was too young. A few years later I did eventually get a PC for Christmas and got my very own copy of TBC. I never hit max level but I never quit playing. Managed to cap out in wrath after they made the game easy mode. I thought it was great at the time but looking back I can really appreciate the old gameplay. I was a noob in wrath. Became a hardcore raider in cata. Quit in mop. I've played retail on and off since but it's never been the same.
---
Thats not a very good joke though..
---
Cant you just take it into 5 mans and leave it passive?  zero risk to you, easy xp while you work on end game
---
Conquering an enemy city while dead would actually become a viable strategy for night elves LUL
---
OP said "jokes or stories" and that is indeed a story.
---
Well I cant argue with that.
---
What if the cooldown was dependent on the regular cast time of the spell you chose to cast with it?  
---
1 second cast time? 0.5 minute cooldown.  
---
3 second cast time? 1.5 minute cooldown.  
---
*10* second cast time? 5 minute cooldown.
---
Started about a month or two after launch. Quit 3.0 prepatch.
---
I don't get how everyone points to LFG as if it was the thing that killed WoW. The argument that LFG killed the social experience is nonsense. People did not stop talking to each other in dungeons because of LFG, they stopped talking because the dungeon was mind-numbingly easy. In Vanilla, you had to communicate just to get the job done. As if spamming LF1M healer in the cities made it more of a social experience. 
---
Joined about 8~ months before TBC was released. 
---
Warlords of Draenor was when my guild officially disbanded (having survived in some form since TBC) 
---
The last time I raided was in Legion (quit after downing The Emerald Nightmare). 
---
I guess I could say Battle for Azeroth was where I officially left. It’s the first expansion where I haven’t leveled a character to max, and I have no intention of going back to do so. 
---
Yeah kinda. Addon developers will probably have to make some small adjustments but for the most part retail addons should be able to be made to work. 
---
That’s why I can’t return to BFA.
---
I didn’t have too much fun when it first launched and recently tried to get back into but I was so behind everyone that I literally felt like I was playing World of Warcraft: Battle to Catch-Up.
---
I really can’t wait.
---
Seems like a good reputation to have in BG’s. Maybe more rogues will avoid you then. I know I hated going after orcs because of the stun resist.
---
Perception allows you to understand all languages temporarily (1 Minute buff, dispellable, 15 minute C/D). Useful against /yell horde in AB, WSG?
---
Mind control
---
Short answer is “Yes.” The long answer is “Yeeeeeees.”
---
\[The Kicker\]
---
Human racials are incredible and should not be overlooked. Gear matters more than racials and the human PvE stats will help you gear.
---
Be forthcoming about it. Eventually you will hit a wall. Eventually they will figure out you dont have mana tied etc etc.
---
Especially if you have good attendance, and come prepped with buffs/potions etc, you wont have that much of an issue for the first two tiers of content without a doubt
---
Classic should be available and inviting to anyone who wants to play it, but I don't think it should have ANY link to current retail at all. I don't think we need to encourage any kind of tourism, like making g a trip to classic just another achievement for the completionists.
---
I totally agree that there are catch-up mechanics. After all, many people joined WoW over the lifespan of vanilla and still ended up raiding.
---
I'm just pointing out that it's not harder on retail. Replacing all slots on retail is just as easy as replacing the slots you needed from, let's say BWL (by following your example). It's just two very different progression paces, but overall I'd say it require less gametime in retail to become raid ready for current content after a break than in vanilla. Been playing through all xpacs and honestly, the catch-up mechanics in retail are ridiculous.
---
I guess I just assumed OP was comparing with retail because I haven't seen people worried about taking a break and come back to find they can't catch-up.
---
I don't think you want forum posts made about you saying how you can't 1v1 without consumables (I wouldn't be the one to make/participate in those, but I always saw players who were called out). BG's isn't just about winning/getting honor points/gear. A lot of it is improving, becoming a name in the pvp community, etc. It's complicated.
---
yeah, no catch up mechanics and there were always enough people to make the level 60 dungeons relevant. thats why dungeons and entire raids become obsolete within a single expansions lifetime, those catchup mechanics
---
Started day 1 vanilla, left before WOTLK hit. Was taking over my life so I had to give it up.
---
Yes and no. Im thinking more about "elite" in the sense of applying to one of these guilds. If the top guilds on a server (lets assume 1 alli 1 horde) are looking for a specific class for their roster, they will look for someone who has put in the effort and has not only BIS in every slot (actual bis, not "top 3 in bis list"), but also all enchants. They have the pick of the litter, so theyll only take the best of the best.
---
A "decent" guild (in my eyes) might be short 1-2 players on a raid night and look for people who just have the right class, not the perfect gear. Theyll bring along a green geared priest/pala just so they can fill a healer spot. 
---
Thats the difference I see personally. Not elite in sense of skill, but elite in sense of ambitions and the corresponding demands of their raid members (+ flask and 50 mana pots)
---
GM's are no longer allowed to interact in the game world and any ticket is going to be ignored for being off-topic.
---
Undead's Cannibalize - works on Hunters who have feigned death, and deals percentage damage to the hunter and has a 40% chance to horrify them each tick.
---
Troll 10% Regeneration in combat - also works when dead and not released, unless the troll took more than 10% of its max hp in fire or nature damage in the minute before it died. Upon reaching 50% hp, the troll can choose to ressurect.
---
Troll's Thrown Specialization - Reduces the chance that thrown Engineering explosives will backfire, and allows you to equip grey items from your inventory to the ranged weapon slot slot. 1H grey weapons deal roughly 75% swing damage (using rap instead of ap), 2H weapons: 50%, and junk grey items like Gelatinous Goo deal 1 point of physical damage (before attack power). Items thrown this way may end up in the other player's inventory.
---
Troll's Berserking - When Berserk, all text is capitalized, and /say becomes /yell.
---
Orc's Blood Fury - While affected by blood fury, all text is capitalized and /say becomes /yell.
---
Orc's Command - Additionally allows Orc Hunters to tame critters as pets. They fight and die like regular pets, but can't be resurrected, stored in a stable, or affected by mend pet. They have an extremely small aggro radius, except vs mobs that attack critters. Squirrel Espionage.
---
Tauren's War Stomp - now also deals damage based on current level to critters within 5 yds, and sends critters within 15yds running in terror.
---
Tauren's Endurance - Additionally extends the time until the fatigue bar drains by 25%.
---
Gnomes get a new racial: Tempting Target, which causes them to start at (current level) threat rather than 0 when added to the threat list.
---
Mate, did you even read the post?
---
The only way vanilla will survive is if they go the way of OSRS and make changes in the spirit of vanilla.
---
I'm even more excited to see this to be honest lol
---
Why would it kill frost mages ? Lowering nature resist has nothing to do with frost mages ?
---
Every shaman on Alliance gets transformed into a female dwarf priest and every paladin on Horde into a troll priest.
---
At Launch with everyone in greens you probably wont be taken and tbh you will be doing dungeons for a long enough time after hitting 60 unless you've got a guild that will carry you through mc, and even then you have to drop by now and again 
---
Ugh, well now I have to because of you.
---
I first played WoW on a friend's account in mid BC, but I didn't have my own account until a month after Wrath's launch. Loved the game until mid-way through Cata, but stuck around and raided because of friends and family. Quit early pandaland but came back to raid from Isle of Thunder and Siege. I liked early WoD, but Garrisons killed the game for me. Tried out Legion for a month, and I've never looked back. 
---
 Sometime in mid 2015 I tried out the Feenix classic private servers. Although I only played for a short time due to IRL obligations, I fell in love with the true WoW.
---
Booty Boy
---
2 weeks into TBC after months of watching my friends play and researching what I wanted to buy PC wise with my paycheck savings.  I quit a month into Cata and never made it past Lv80.  
---
&gt; I don't think we need to encourage any kind of tourism, like making g a trip to classic just another achievement for the completionists
---
it is not meant to encourage tourism, but to make classic players, who occassionally sub for BfA like 3 times a year, to make them buy 2 more months... and spend their last gold on wowtokens that someone else bought for $.
---
I think it would be interesting if they did a different approach entirely. As it was with TBC and onwards, whenever the expansion came out, everything pre-existing was effectively obselete, because of the higher level cap, new continents etc (I'm not saying they shouldn't add new zones or continents, hear me out).
---
What I would like to see would be to create an alternate storyline, from Vanilla onwards, in a way that kept the entire world relevant, entwined and intact, be it regular patches or "small expansions" with new raids, single zones etc, and with a progression system that revolved around gear instead of levels. I read somewhere that their initial plan for the first expansion was the South Seas, but because of technical limitations they went with TBC instead, so imagine instead of releasing TBC as it was, they could go back to some of the ideas they initially had. For instance, release Zandalar, Kezan, Broken Isles and then later Mount Hyjal, Uldum, Gilneas, Karazhan etc in stand-alone patches, preferably without increasing the level cap. Think of it as a re-imagining of how the Warcraft story could unfold, of course with the Vanilla values kept intact.
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved TBC, but as the years went by, I realized it's a real shame that anything pre-TBC is effectively irrelevant after you hit level 58. The goal of my suggestion above would be to - if not eliminate - at least mitigate this problem. I would love to see a WoW, where Naxx is not the end, but to still keep Naxx relevant, as you move on to bigger challenges.
---
I hope all this made sense. I acknowledge that there are huge issues with this idea (difficulty switching from a level-based progression system to a purely gear based system after hitting top level, creating an "alternate timeline" is also kinda stupid). I'm basically imagining that the core of the game is completely re-designed, which would be ridiculous, probably impossible. It's just a funny little thought I like to waste time on every now and then.
---
I don't know why, trolls rule!
---
Did some scholo and strat at lvl 57-58 as a druid tank and didn't have any problem.
---
don't do this. you're just taking up 4 spots that could be actual people. It's a social game, play with other people.
---
Tauren racial - smokes herbs out of a totem pipe. +10 intellect for 15 minutes group wide buff.
---
Joined in vanilla. Stopped playing seriously in cata. Picked up again in MOP than played a bit in WOD little in legion, and leveled a toon to 115 before calling it quits in BFA
---
I'm not disagreeing with keeping them separate though, it just has nothing to do with this post :)

Played during beta thanks to Filefront (RIP) and liked it, but my PC died and I had to start saving potatoes to buy another.
---
Never really 'left'. I have periods of 6-7 months where I don't sub now (especially nowadays) but I doubt I'll ever leave outright. No reason to. I've had too much gold and nothing to spend it on for a decade, and now I can use it to play Classic and Live until 2026.
---
Am I crazy or does this sound expensive and super unfun? I mean the whole thing about vanilla that made it special was the community. What's you end game goal here?
---
So female troll?
---
Booty Bae
---
How is that fun? To me, fun is enjoying the game at a steady pace, making new friends a long the way by being helpful and social. What you described sounds like an easy way to burn yourself out

Joined in ‘05, started quitting every few months in 2011 (? Or whenever Dragon Soul launched) and only quit live WoW for good in 2017.
---
Yes it is, it's "in slot". 
---
You hit the nail on the head for me. I hate working so hard on a character only to lose all of his badass-ness the next expansion. Don't get me wrong, i love retail and im glad I wont have to choose. But damn, I am gonna look forward to  good set of greens that will last me a month
---
I hadn't considered the possibility of retail wow giving a nod to vanilla release
---
Dark Souls as usual, but I also just picked up Jak and Daxter 1-3 so that will eat up a few months of my time.
---
Deus vult
---
I didn't even make it that far in Cata.  It was the heavy phasing that killed it for me.  You couldn't just make your way to a new zone like Twilight Highlands and grind mobs because the zone was empty unless you did the starting quest chain.  It started in Wrath (phasing) but they doubled down on it in Cata.  Culling talents in Cata and again in Pandaria also heavily led to my ultimate despisal of the games direction.
---
Can someone recommend a leveling route for a Human Warrior with a nice 2h weapon progression?
---
I don't want to break any records, just want the leveling to be smooth and enjoyable without too many frustrating quests and corpse runs.
---
The best way to get Exalted with a faction is do all the quests that give faction for them at level appropriate times (i.e., the quests need to be green or better never grey). Pservers, to my understanding from the theorycraft Discord, have higher reputation rewards then actual Vanilla did so it'll be harder in Classic. Also remember gaining reputation with Tauren, Orcs, or Trolls will also raise your Forsaken rep slightly. 
---
I starred upon release. I am 24 y/o now to give you an idea of how young I was. My friend and I would hog our home phones and talk back and forth as we played because we could barely type fast enough in the midst of battle. 
---
Once our home phones died we would type only the necessities and always had a backup plan incase we were being attacked by the enemy faction. We would just smash the keyboard in all caps as a S.O.S. 
---
Anyway, I quit yesterday, game time expired. The game is not enjoyable to me anymore unfortunately. I had 336 days played on my Druid and can’t bring myself to do it anymore.
---
I can’t wait for classic. My friends and I are coming back and I hope to feel just a small glimpse of what I felt during my childhood. 
---
I love this game and everyone that made my experience so great back in classic.
---
I was playing high end in legion and moving in to BFA i quit 4 weeks after launch, it is for sure still pretty bad at high -end for some people
---
Based on the blizzcon panel a change like that would be highly unlikely
---
You played Bloodborne or Demon Souls yet? Those are the only 2 Souls games I still haven’t beaten it. Bloodborne kicks my ass and Demon Souls seems to make PS3s kill themselves.
---
Hunters Bark gives hunters taunt in melee range to protec their pet.
---
Nothing really, played a bit of terraria, gpu is dying and can't play most games without crashing my pc.
---
Both. I can do dogs+bugs in DMN and small lasher packs in DME and still would hit 5 instances/hour cap going like that. 
---
You can clear 7 (?) satyr packs in DME on top of that too, but that's only if you need Demonic Runes/Runecloth/Fecloth. You can also do guard/water ele bosses by your own, but that's again, only if you need those caster neck/cloak/bracers, not a part of a regular farm where you focused to get valuable greys to vendor it.
---
DME = Herbalism, DMN = skinning. None of those required ofcourse. One may even argue that it not worth the time, as you kill all the dogs/lashers packs and then have to stop/run back in order to skin/gather. 
---
Also this video and DM in particular is a child's play. First days ZG is where the NUTS at. You can make like 250g/hr if you have the right patterns and know what you're doing (and if you're not, well... prepare yourself to die a hundred times, that's what the learning takes). 
---
I'm gonna fucking take a vacation when it's releases, make a 15k and forget about the gold farming forever :)
---
Nothing really, played a bit of terraria, gpu is dying and can't play most games without crashing my pc, sad days.
---
You can't possibly expect retail players to put up with the Wrath pre-event. That was probably the riskiest thing the developers of this game ever did.
---
I failed my lord, cant win the tournament while being a fully stealth, agility, shortsword perked rogue...wish I could keep my own gear for tournament, but they force heavy armor and mace...meh
---
Kingdom Come, Pubg, Fifa...
---
Yeah i've played Bloodborne aswell. Only missing Demon Souls, guess im just waiting for a remaster for PS4 or PC.
---
Meanwhile you can put a few hours in leveling a toon in Classic and feel like your making progress.
---
Isn’t Chromie female?
---
Just give them cloth undeads love cloth
---
As someone playing a mage, I hope not. Gold is such a driving factor to be a part of the world. Having one optimal single player grinding spot is pretty lame.
---
So interesting to see everyone joining at different times and then leaving around WOTLK / Cataclysm. Looks like we are all after the same thing and hopefully Classic WoW will give us what we're looking for!
---
Joined the first time in the 2004 September Stresstest and it ended in 2009. Didn't agree with the direction the game was taking. 
---
Pretty much always raided hardcore and going to do that in WoW Classic again. Very excited.
---
Gold is pretty much always sought after. Especially if you level an alt, the urge to buy that one epic will be too strong. But yeah, consumables, spellbooks, crafting mats, goddamn enchants are stupid expensive. Unless your amazing at managing your items and spending, gold is a commodity.
---
I would suggest making a list of all quests that give undercity rep and what level they are and doing them at the correct level. Do not depend on hand ins that might not (shouldnt) be in game at launch.
---
I started playing with TBC, so missed the classic train.
---
I mained an UD Shadow Priest, and loved it. Just wondering if that's a viable option for classic?
---
I've been tossing up between recreating my character, or enjoying a fresh experience though. If I make a priest, I'll probably roll a Dwarf, as I never really had the Ally experience. Otherwise, I'm wondering if I should main a Mage or Druid instead?
---
I live Dadlife now, so time is relatively limited. Certainly won't be playing hardcore, but I'd love to get into a casual guild and get into raiding etc.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Hey guys! After covering a few of the hardest bosses in Classic so far I really wanted to return to the basics and origins of raiding for Classic WoW and decided to dive into the Molten Core.   
---
I am currently experimenting with a new video format for this series and my goal is (hopefully) 3 minutes or less for each Boss Guide.  Thanks for watching as always.
---
Started in early vanilla. 
---
Stopped mid wrath.
---
Imo wrath was when the game started going downhill. Dungeon finder ruined the world, made everyone stand afk in dalaran, ruined world pvp and made the heroic dungeons a joke compared to tbc.
---
But since it was the highpoint population wise, I guess not everyone agrees with me, and that's ok.
---
How dare you play the game how you want to, you should be ashamed of yourself for not playing the way other people want to play.
---
in DME, what do you need herbalism for? can you use it on the lashers to gather extra herbs?
---
as for ZG... does the thing you're talking about require a specialized implement and a certain gathering profession? :D
---
Probably. If they keep it similar to what the old client I think it should be less the 10 gb.

Yeah I never understand how people say Vanilla is hardcore. It takes a while, it moves slowly, and if you die it takes a minute or 5 to get to your body. You have to use your spells effectively in dungeons. 
---
But that’s about it. Vanilla is a very casual-friendly game because they have a whole game to explore and be a part of. Endgame raiding is only a small chunk of gameplay compared to later iterations of WoW where the non endgame is the small chunk.
---
It’s hard enough to encourage interaction, which becomes the addiction itself, yet it’s also easy enough to hook non hardcore gamers.
---
Staff of Westfall -&gt; Whirlwind Axe -&gt; Bonebiter -&gt; Ice Barbed Spear. Those are all the good 2h quest reward weapons. If you can afford it, buying a rare BoE 2h in the gap between Staff and Whirlwind, and between Bonebiter and Ice Barbed is ideal.
---
I like how this is tagged "Discussion" and not "Humor"! :D
---
Looking at private servers (never played actual vanilla), flasks are 50 to 100 gold each. Pre-BIS can cost a fortune, like 200g at the very start when nobody has money and 500g to multiple thousands depending on the item. Also people talking about changing specs multiple times a week might need more income.
---
IMO unless you are going to try to be in a world first guild, I wouldn't want to take the hundred hours (probably more unless you are speedruner level of good) to level a hunter or mage alt. Almost anyone can farm Dire Maul lashers and make plenty of money, and if that gets nerfed I can see the image and hunter losing their instanced farming spots as well.
---
raids in wow even at the most casual level until lfr was added where pretty underpopulated hell most people just didn't raid at all or if they did never left MC so taking a break never mattered hell even in retail now taking a break doesn't matter unless your trying to be top 500+ for mythic raids.
---
So, I think Pservers are a bad example for this given how large a population they tend to support. Many of them also sell gold thus injecting gold into the economy artificially. Back in Vanilla there were often people who could not afford to repair their gear after a bad raid. As a tank, fully broken gear cost me about 10g if I recall right? It was pretty rough for a lot of people who literally had no gold. Epic mounts weren't that common.   
---
While yes, there aren't gold sinks like new content etc, there aren't daily quests producing gold. In theory, someone could do every quest and not have any further quests to do. You can farm, but not everyone knew how or where. I always did well on the AH etc but a lot of people just had no gold.   
---
I don't think you're going to see massive inflation in the economy for at least several years, and even then, I doubt it will be significant overall.
---
Isn't multiboxing against the tos?
---
I get what you mean, but I think that growing a thick skin is also part of the vanilla experience. We all went through it, that didn't stop us from playing PvP and the new generation of player will also have to go through this rough moment and suck it up instead of whinning on the forum. I know, unthinkable for today's WoW demographic ahah.

The downside is that if you're late to the game it can be tricky to catch-up since most guilds still doing the early content will be bad ones. 
---
This isn't what you asked for, but...
---
*Thunderfurry*
---
i mean WoW since vanilla has been a game made to pander to casuals and that fine it works that way 
---
Dreamfoil. https://classicdb.ch/?item=13463#reagent-for
---
As you can see, that's a herb used for high lvl potions, and all of them is useful in raids, so yeah, always in demand. Approx ~50s a piece.
---
If you go further to the elite part you may also find gromsblood/ghost mushrooms. Lashers can drop those too, as well as the other herbs.
---
No professions required for ZG either. I mean you could go the same and skin those crocs/tigers or gather bloodvine (each can go for a 5-7g a piece approx). 
---
It's more about execution. The path I do requires you to take a ~8 minutes fight with no mistakes allowed, as the mobs kill you in 2-3 hits, and you pull 20+ at the same time. Gotta watch for a resists and stuff.
---
The time in BfA before Uldir opened was actually good in my opinion. This was before gear inflation was let loose and dungeon gear actually felt a little bit exciting to get. 
---
I’ve just started my first tabletop dungeons and dragons campaign! Having so much fun as a gnome Druid. My favorite race and class from wow 
---
Chad :(
---
Good plan, may copy you. 
---
There was content is was just inaccessible to the vast majority of players. 
---
Having an extra set of gear in your bags while leveling(especially the first time thru) is impractical. Your regular gear should have spirit mixed in wherever possible.

---
Here are the quests that give the rep you want. You can just follow this as you go, or make a nicer spreadsheet guiding which zones/quests you want to do in order. Which is what I am working on but for the raptor mount.
---
I don't believe so as long as someone is hitting the buttons to make them do things, BOTs are against the TOS but I don't believe boxing is. They'd probably welcome the 4 extra subs.
---
I mean it's creative and well thought out, but what's the purpose of it? To hype classic for the retail crowd? Or to lure the classic crowd into playing retail for a month?I guess I don't see the appeal either way.
---
ah, I see. nice.
---
yeah, I was thinking about a specific method of bloodvine farming, but that would also require you to be a rogue if my memory serves.
---
never heard about ZG mage farming though, that's something I'm gonna have to investigate, though it seems to be way more challenging than DM farms.
---
I was disgusted to see that you're essentially given uldir mythic quality gear for free now. I wasn't even a mythic raider but that's catch-ups gone way too far.
---
Uldir normal quality gear would've been reasonable so you could start normal mode whatever the new raid is called. 
---
Goblin Rocket Hem - for tailors who want a few more explosions in their work.
---
Venomtail Scorpid (Scorpid Poison + Claw) or one of the red raptors West of Org (raw damage) are other good candidates for 1st pet. I’d still get Claw/Bite rank ups when you reach a spot with a spawn not far out of the way and stable close.
---
I'd like if Trolls' regen racial was a Blood Craze- or Blessed Recovery-like effect, still passive regen but not totally awful
---
Flying and lfr aren’t on the table 
---
I see. It destroys the environment of the game for the other players though. Totally takes you out of the experiance
---
My issue is with your ridiculous attitude. You just said you rather classic be ruined than have blizzard ruin classic. Get a grip. I don't support new content, or even have an opinion on it. But the "take my ball and go home" shit that pervades this sub is toxic.
---
Not hard, just get that rune cloth.
---
I got the green one for my orc. WORTH IT. 
---
:/
---
I mean, gold was more important in classic than any other expac sooo...
---
Not playing, may I have a link? Bored and curious. :)
---
Video feels rushed. Molten Core is easy, but if someone takes the time to look up a guide I think they'd appreciate a more in-depth analysis.
---
Something not covered in the guide is managing distance from the boss since his major mechanic of aoe curse and magic effects have a 40 yard radius. While killing the adds only Lucifron's tank and two dispellers need to be within that radius. When killing Lucifron hunters can outrange the effect and so can all dispellers except those dedicated to the tank/melees.
---
Took me about a year to finaly get one of my toons to level 60 (mage) back in 2004-2005 and it was the most fun I had in wow.   
---
My mindset was changed playing wotlk and with every new expansion I got more and more corrupt 
---
I was gonna get the quested white lion from barrens, echayakee and just use that from like 19 to 60. Is that such a terrible idea? 
---
They never said that, they haven't said anything.
---
I don't disagree, but from the standpoint of making money Blizz doesn't mind it. They want it to be 1 button for 1 action of a character, thats the way they try to separate boxing from botting. It's not fun to see it though, I recall someone running 5 box pyro mages in BGs, maybe in TBC? Made a video of their 1 man 5 man 1 shotting everyone in the BG that got in range.
---
6 months before TBC, played constantly up until WoD, played about half of legion and 2 months of BFA.
---
What exactly are you expecting a GM to know about Classic? You realise the game is in the early stages of development? 
---
Also maybe telling people that you can chug a 4g resto pot and make his curses redundant. Works very well and you dont need to dispell really
---
If you are still doing this I would love it

---
I just don’t want them to sell name changes. I know you could just create a character with that name or have a buddy do it but they shouldn’t make it easy to do regularly. You should have to live with your reputation on the server. And long cool downs for server transfers 
---
Stream delay isn't very viable though, as it diminishes the social interaction between the streamer and their viewers, so PvE best option I think.
---
No, stop being a moron. 
---
You are simply wrong. I will link the interview when I get home. 
---
Depends on how hard you minmax... if you going for 6 days /played to 60 you will have to do that. Spirit on a warriors gear will probably be a bad idea
---
TL;DR: "Mages don't dps, spam decursive instead.
---
Nuke the adds and clean it all up"
---
You will have to ask the people who write support tickets...
---
Yeah, that's for a stealth classes. IIRC each herb has a 15% chance to drop bloodvine on top of itself if you have the Blood Scythe, which also drops in ZG. First two are there right after you enter the instance, you'll have to pop invis potion to get them though. 
---
That's doable on any class, but the potions have 10m cd. Separately, which mean you can do Invis potion and all your other potions will go on 2m CD. After that, you can pop Lesser Invis, and vice versa. It's not worth going like that only for herbs, though, that's just a small bonus.
---
And I've forgot to mention the point why you're there. Mobs have a chance to drop bijous, those are used to increase the reputation with Zandalari, and you'll need them alot. Everyone needs basically, as there's juicy rewards you couldn't obtain otherwise. So-called bloodvine set, for example, considered as pre-bis for casters and basically as good as T2, and you have to get atleast Revered in order to learn the recipe. 
---
Same goes for enchants, mages can get +18 spd/+1% hit to Head/Leg slots, for example. Which is preeeetty good, but requires you to be Exalted. 
---
Another way is to get your class Punctured Voodoo Doll (and a primal hakkari idol, but that's a boss drop), we also have a chance to take one during this farm (hoodoo pile on the tiger area). Could keep it for yourself or sell for a good money :)
---
Isn't DM frost mage farming difficult to do as an elemental shaman? 
---
Everything looks correct except the: *"I believe if you run out of ammo you can't use your ranged weapon anymore, you pretty much have to fight melee."*
---
You can not use any of your spells when you are out of mana (obviously) but you can auto attack with your bow even when you are out of mana. As long as you have the proper distance from you and the mob.
---
Either case has to be screen shotted though to be black listed. Black listing is effective by spreading it to the entire server which is usually done by 1 or 2 people relentlessly spreading that information. So whats the difference if one guy is spreading it vs 2 or 3 ? Not much until he starts doing it to other groups.
---
I want this
---
Yes no problem, you wont need you max rank healing spells anyway. The only issue is if 1. The tank is bad (geared) 2. Your group has no cc 3. Your group takes tons of damage like in the baron fight in strat, as aoe heals are expensive. But yes if you are patient you can start hitting dungeons at 58 and have most pre bis items at 60
---
Like Kul Tiran's Brush It Off racial?
---
I think they should just buff the regen and and maybe throw in some bleed duration reduction.
---
That’s a 2.0 speed Cat so it would be considerably worse than STV or Thousand Needles 1.2 speed Cats once you reach pet crit talents.
---
I have a really rough Hunter leveling compendium here with a link to all pets’ attack speeds: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fkg3Nla8jCXlMdpLscLTdJR7P0LDIHfvMdIo3ZcAyfY
---
ammo not mana 
---
I read in some discussions that there is more competition on alliance side for one handed swords for rogues than on horde, why?
---
Down to 10%.
---
But they reward full rep until you outlevel them by 5. The first 10 quests in Aldrassil vary between 2 and 6, so full rep between 7-11. Once you hit the first hub, Dolanaar, the quests are 6-12, so full rep until 11-17.
---
TL;DR: If you level in Teldrassil in a reasonable manner, you will get 100% rep 100% of the time, you won't outlevel them ever.
---
Ofc its toxic, because people for some reason haven't noticed that literally every second thread has something to do with changes. Both there and on the official forums.
---
I honestly don't know why people can't figure out for themselves that changes at any point have great potential of ruining the game. 
---
Hi, /u/leftyswinger
---
Love your guides Raserisk! As a player who never saw the inside of Molten Core back in the day, or any other raid, your videos have been great to both see how to beat encounters and what the content looked like. 
---
One criticism I must have though is that this new format isn't really working for me. This video felt extremely rushed, and whilst the encounter is an introductory one, plenty of players would be experiencing this for the first time and I'd love to see something more in-depth, like you did for the other bosses. It doesn't have to be as long as your 4 Horsemen or Kel'thuzad videos of course, simply as long as it needs to be, rather than trying to fit things into a time limit. 
---
&gt;  I mean the whole thing about vanilla that made it special was the community.
---
For you. Other people like different things.
---
&gt; **J. Allen Brack:** One of the things we do know is that by announcing this, we're in the WOW Classic business forever. Once that starts, there's a commitment on our end that we're going to continue maintaining those servers for as long as there is a World of Warcraft.

Drain Lite - when you use lower ranks of drain life
---
Why would they know anything you don't know?
---
&gt; Would I get a good amount of XP compared to questing
---
Absolutely not. Maybe the first dungeon run if you can get all the quests in a reasonable time, but for the most part, dungeon grinding is not worth it.
---
I've done the math for some optimal dungeon grinding, and unless you can kill 1 pack of 5 every minute (including mana / hp regen and travel time to the next pack) you will NOT benefit from grinding dungeons. And assuming your group setup, with warlock and hunter doing minimal base damage / pet and the rest, due to 5 class abilities not lining up... you'll be -slow- so no, not worth it at all.
---
All I'm saying is the money that realm transfers generate &lt; money of subscribers who would quit if stuck on a dead server. 
---
Aaaaaaaaaand I’m a moron 
---
Started during beta. Joined vanilla, stopped at the end of BC. Played on and off ever since. Nothing comes close to the initial game for me. I haven't played any private servers and can't fully get into my mind whether classic will be awesome or pointless.  Time will tell.
---
Sorry to hear that! I'm always looking into new ways to enhance the guides whether it's visual or informational quality and I'll definitely be looking to see if things can be expanded a bit more on some of these very early raid encounters.  
---
For Molten Core and specifically Lucifron, it's very bare bones when it comes to covering what the boss does compared to later fights and since the boss fight takes an average guilds maybe 30-60 seconds to burn through, I tried to stretch out as much as possible from my perspective.  
---
Aside from that thanks for your input and support!
---
Lol The irony
---
if anything else fails, you can just do it with rollover reputation from [repeatable AV quest](http://classicdb.ch/?quests=6.2597#0-4+1+2), like [this one.](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=7224)
---
...at least that's how I farmed my troll rep and sexy ass raptor for my blood elf back in TBC.
---
I'll definitely take that into consideration for future guides! MC raid encounters are very bare bones compared to AQ/Naxx and from my raiding perspective never felt very complex or intense since most of the fights feature mechanics that can be brute forced with modern knowledge on gear, consumable, world buffs etc.  
---
The Molten Core of 1.1 is very different compared to 1.12 and I fully expect players in Classic to have little issues until they get to Garr/Domo or even Ragnaros. Thanks for your time!
---
Is FFXIV worth getting into at this stage? Consider it.
---
Yep! Absolutely, I included this in the tail end of the video and it's great for new raiders or PUGs until they get their dispel / decurse rotations down

Hi, /u/Amory501

id suggest watching cadet\_15 on twitch hes a good hunter !
---
me am that kind of orc
---
Joined a couple weeks after release in ‘04.
---
Left the day after my guild at the time had our first Lich King kill in WOTLK. Felt like the game was over at that point.
---
Played a hunter through TBC with mostly mediocre guilds (but we had a lot of fun). Rolled a Druid for wotlk and mainly played with our servers top 2 guilds. Hit a few top 10 US kills.
---
Oh I wasnt taking the previous comment as context for ele shaman I thought it was just a general how to make 50g an hour, my bad.

im sure it will

Does training cost less depending on reputation with the class trainer's faction?
---
Text to avoid shortpost?
---
hey, you there, you're finally awake. Tried to cross the border, ya?
---
Its because at parts it sounds like gibberish.
---
I think most vanilla gear checks were more to see if your warlock was wearing lvl 45 "of the falcon" bracers or Hunter trying to run Ubrs with the ravager axe.
---
Expensive is better than long cooldown imo. I guess I don’t understand why you need to put a CD anyway because as long as it’s not free there won’t be insane migrations that seriously mess with economies/communities. I foresee a very real possibility of having different friend groups going to different servers and some quitting at different periods of time, so it’d be nice to be able to move over to be with the next group if that happens.
---
Humans have +5 weapon skill for swords and maces which has a significant impact on DPS.

thanks for the suggestion, im looking at his vods atm

---
It's also suddenly completely different from the source material, which is night elfs in warcraft 3 stealthing during night while standing still. I feel this would first of all be a bad balance choice but also a bad flavor choice. If I had to make a change I'd undo OPs change.
---
You don't know that.
---
Shouldn't people wait until classic beta to make these guides, how do we know for sure everything will be exactly the same as 2005?
---
It's not really even needed to see a guide for MC bosses there is no depth to them so it's not his fault. Like other than Ragnaros there is like 2 mechanics going on for every fight
---
Druids are great. I mained a Tauren Druid throughout Vanilla, and enjoyed the hell out of it.  Druids may not be topping healing meters, but I always felt like I was contributing to groups and raids that I was a part of.  Even with scrub gear I was able to heal any non-raid instances at 60 with no problems and once I geared up I was one of the more mana-efficient healers and excelled at the longer boss encounters in raids when other healers went oom.
---
I didn't play much PVP, but even as a complete ignoramus I never felt under-powered. Druids are pretty durable with bear form and healing over time spells, even without great gear. A well-geared and skilled druid can be a force in PVP.
---
Who knows how classic's raid scene will be.  Even if it is still 95% authentic, there will still be min/maxing and theory crafting to be done.  The build you have may not even be optimal for PvP, let alone raid viable.
---
Honestly my answer is I hope you will not be able to clear naxx with PVP build players.  In vanilla you would have been a liability to the raid.  Especially as a druid, you would be oom constantly.
---
Cone of old.  Changes the enemies appearance to the race’s oldest/most wrinkled face.
---
Yeah I don't know what I was thinking. I must not have been taking raiding very seriously.
---
I think it's because I'm not very experienced with how flexible some classes' raiding speccs are, and how important their talents are for them to perform well. For example I see a lot of people say Paladin's don't need 31 points in Holy to raid.
---
Lash of Light - Summon a whip of Holy Light to punish your enemy.
---
Your feral points aren't going to do a whole lot, you'll be fairly squishy in bear form anyway in resto gear. Really the way to play this in bgs is to stealth/travel form at 40 yards from the frontline and just do supporting heals/damage. With those extra point in resto you'll be fine to raid heal and be better as support in BGs.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxhMxsZZxtcotq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxhMxsZZxtcotq)
---
The problem is the talents you'll want for pvp is very far from what you want healing raids. I haven't done organized pvp on my druid. But the build I linked is completely viable for raiding through bwl (its as far as I have gotten). And it's a semi boomkin type build. 1v1 fights will be more around kiting and dwindling down the enemy with dots and occasional casts. 
---
Imo a build beyond this is straying too far away from necessary resto talents. And might not be acceptable in harder raids. Your best bet is to farm gold and respec often.
---
Goes well on a paladin with his Rigtheous Furry.

Were transfers between RP-PVP -&gt; PVP possible ?

Stealth puts you to %50 speed already, so it would be like Stealth exactly... Or am I wooshing the joke here?

Playing TBC. Super casually without any intention to get to actual TBC content but instead to play a bunch of different classes to get a feel what class I want to main when classic comes out

Yes, but I wouldn't expect to have fun the lyseium or whatever its called at the end of BRD.. your aggro range is going to make it really shitty
---
[this might help](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXuknLbKTNw)
---
You make a good point but I wouldn’t say that LFG didn’t hurt the social experience at all. It does make it so that you don’t have to ask people to do a dungeon with you or go out of your way to meet new players. When people have to go out of their way to meet new people I find that it works better. But you make a very solid point about difficulty
---
The aggro radius is a lot larger than your character, so you might not be able to skip packs without dismissing and not be able to resummon until you are past a lot of mobs you will be killing.
---
Yes, it's in quite a solid state right now. But the game is strongly story-oriented, and most of pve content is tied to main scenario quests.
---
I guess you've already seen this, but just in case:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/9r3vf3/welcome_recent_wow_refugees_heres_all_of_your/
---
lf you have any questions, feel free to ask me.
---
That actually depends more on the class and situation. In a duel obviously gear matters more, but in a wild 1v1 or small group it's not nearly as important for some classes.  Mages, locks, hunters, rogues, druids, change their play style with gear but matches vs lots of classes can be won with luck and strategy.  Of course, other matchups become unwinnable (lock vs ud warrior?).
---
Dungeons will be a nightmare if you don’t stack a class with good aoe for your dps aka warlock or mage. You could even do paladin for your tank since you mostly just need an AoE tank and if you have 3 warlocks you can use voidwalkers to pick up the slack on single target fights.

Bro WTF! What a coincidence... I have for the last month been figuring out what I want to play, and I recently decided to try on multiboxing. I am going to main a mage, just like you. My team comp will be Mage, Warlock, Warrior, Priest (Shadow), Paladin (Holy). Your post made me overthink if I should switch out my paladin for a hunter tho. 
---
Classic is not due in (hopefully) a few months, but what are your thoughts about multiboxing UBRS? Two 5-box players would be a fun challenge for sure! 
---
The same mutant 
---
Game time in retail? Why would they want game time in retail? They play classic 
---
This zone is almost impossible to farm in my experience. There is always people farming every type of mob in the zone for leveling quests, and for the items you listed. I imagine there will always be people here leveling and taking all the mobs for months. I guess it will be more dead like 3 months into the server though.
---
Also that flawless thing I have never seen and I have farmed for probably 30 hours in that zone (Not the dragon mob)
---
Your getting hammered even though you're not really wrong wrong because you're having a different conversation here.  It's true that Naxx itemization potentially borked everything in vanilla but it wasn't out long enough to really see.  However, Naxx is hard and Naxx guilds were pretty insular so it didn't really make other stuff irrelevant for the server as a whole.
---
Because it’s the same subscription 
---
K...... 
---
But shaman literally has no dps option when it comes to raiding. But I do see your point
---
I started July 2007 patch 2.1.3 and I played until the end of WOtLK. I didn’t like it when they started to cut back at the talent trees. For me Vanilla-Wrath is classic wow. The classes got fine tuned in that 6 year period without altering core gameplay.  All the classes were viable while maintaining uniqueness. 
---
 I’ve been playing on vanilla classic servers the past 2 years. 
---
It’d be cool to relive the previous expacs in some sort of event, for sure. Just FYI - Rhonin is dead. Unless you were planning on resurrecting him with time magic fuckery.
---
Seems like you are grossly overestimating the amount of people that would give up hundreds if not thousands of their classic gold to save 15 dollars.
---
But it is like this sub to make mountains out of molehills 
---
**hex of weakness**: -20% healing (even at rank 1) and -2/-20 melee damage (rank one/max rank), essentially a ranged mini mortal strike, you can fuck up healing even when no warrior/rogue is close and max rank cuts fast hitting classes damage output by quite a lot. 
---
**shadowguard**: 3 charges, when hit with *anything*, be it melee or ranged attack or even a spell, you'll do a hefty bit of damage. about 3 seconds internal cooldown. the beauty of this is twofold - for one, it can hit for a quite a bit with shadow talents and a bit of spell damage, for two, **it procs blackout**. there a few funnier things in the game then when a rogue tries to gank you, attacks and... instantly gets stunned.
---
however, these are more-or-less for pvp, mostly effective if you're deep shadow or tri-spec. for pve...
---
**berserking**: 10-30% casting speed increase, depending on health. if you're a pve healer, there's no better racial ability, period. even in pvp, it can be rather effective, though for healers, WotF is somewhat superior.
---
So like Wonder women?
---
On some realms gold was being sold at close to 2:1 so yeh, probably more like 30gold for 15 dollars 
---
Classic isn’t out yet so there is no way to know the exchange rate of a game that hasn’t been released 
---
I might add two more things:
---
1: expect to get smashed regardless of spec. Even with bear form, sometimes a warrior will charge you or a rogue will stun you and just bury you 6 feet under. It sucks because even if you root and swap around, It can be really hard to pull a fight back from the brink. That being said, with some consumable use or a well timed NS you can completely negate someone’s work and go on the offensive which feels amazing.
---
2: feral Druid’s really don’t do a lot of damage. I know everyone has seen Shedo and other Druid’s and talked about the theoretical limits of what Druid’s are capable of, but unless you’re an insane player, assume you won’t do as well. That being said, good feral play with smart consumable use can actually make some of your worse match ups really doable.
---
And yet you claim hundreds to thousands of gold based on nothing. 
---
Where as my projections are based on past trends.
---
There are no past trends, the game hasn’t been released 
---
Agreed, I think they have a pretty good opportunity to do that. This time around they don't need to add any new content, so no need to make huge patches packed with overwhelming changes, so this time around they can focus om making well rounded, smaller, balancing patches instead.
---
What’s the mountain? You asked who would want to trade classic for retail gold. 
---
I told you who?
---
Servers won't die because of transfers, they can die because of lack of transfers. 
---
The mountain is making a non issue into an issue 
---
should be
---
You realise this is a legacy game right?
---
What is the non issue and what is the issue?
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_game
---
Holy shit that is legit sad ON SO MANY LEVELS. 
---
What about wow classic is a legacy game 
---
IMO mergers are the best solution for this I know that that isn't exactly what alot of people want to hear due to name issues and having a bunch of people you don't know dumped in, but allowing transfers opens up the musical chair search for raids that is retail and let me tell you looking for a solid mythic raiding guild can hurt your wallet depending on your luck.
---
There is no issue, the non issue is thinking people will trade their hard earned classic gold for retail gold.

adjective: legacy
---
1.
---
denoting or relating to software or hardware that has been superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use.
---
It’s being rereleased 
---
How can a game yet to be released be legacy? 
---
Ice Barbed Spear won't be available on launch
---
The TBC aspect is interesting I think. Clearly TBC and vanilla should be separate games, but also clearly TBC has better balancing. Maybe there is a way of balancing things "vanilla style". Alice has some good points about implementation being hard. Someone in the thread linked in post above suggested adding some new items as an alternative to drastic class changes, I think that might work. E.g. moonkins has a good damage output as it is, but they have no way to sustain their mana, that might be fixed my simply adding more leather casting gear.
---
I agree it’s a non issue to think that.
---
Because of private servers and demand 
---
Unique names can be solved by having 1 single name list, IMO
---
Private servers would be legacy. Classic isn’t legacy. 
---
Classic has never been released before and therefore is a new game 
---
It’s never been released before 
---
afaik, for raiding (and even dungeons?) no. in pvp, shadow priest melt faces.
---
however... the shadow tree got most of their fun stuff in TBC, so the experience will be very different. no vampiric touch, no shadow word: death, no shadowfiend. you're no longer a mana battery, you're the oom guy in slightly wet paper.
---
as much as I've loved TBC shadow priest, I'm kinda shying away from the classic iteration, though tri-spec does look fun.
---
Yeah, being 15 years older I now realise that this dude is just a regular old s**tbag who doesn't even warrant making jokes about.

An in-game GM would know about as much about projects 6-8 months in the future as the receptionist at the front desk. 
---
Don't open a ticket about this. You'd be wasting their time and everyone else's time who *actually* has an in-game issue that needs to be resolved. 
---
we would need more shit to fight over if it were to continue
---
and armor pen because fuck t3 paladins
---
How are private servers legacy?
---
Wouldn’t have a clue, they probably aren’t 
---
I got you!
---
I joined in October 2005 and left about a week after you started.
---
Cooldown is way more important than cost.
---
12/25 2004. Left... a few months ago. BFA just ain't for me. Theres been something redeemable in every xpac except these last two to me.
---
Thanks! I'll keep that in mind.
---
those first 2-3 weeks were the most fun ive had in wow since wotlk
---
SO rolls her eyes every time I mention Summer 2019 ;)
---
A general observation: I find it interesting that Reddit seems overly positive towards balancing patches in some form and MMO-champions seems overly opposed to balancing patches of any form what so ever.
---
Paying for 5 accounts in an MMO just to play by yourself xd
---
SO: She's probably more hyped than I am despite me having played the game back in the days and she didn't. :D 
---
Friends: More hyped for Warcraft III Reforged than WoW Classic.
---
I think part of it is that this fight doesn't really have any special positioning or anything that is needed. It's just a tank and spank with decursing. I feel like part of the more in depth guides he has explain a lot more because of the positioning and movement that is required.
---
plz tell the adult that's supervising you that he is doing a horrible job translating from english to english.
---
you must understand that ppl are lying to you, you're not special,  you're just delayed in terms of intellectual progress and you will never be to catch up. saying that someone is wrong has no value, you kinda must prove that :)
---
also there is a strong possibility that i may have played on the US servers but it feels like it's time wasted explaining that to a drooling mongoloid.
---
btw, egg = feelings ergo all spoons are godless
---
next?!
---
good luck in life, it seems like you're gonna need it with so many *lols* around.
---
Yea I had ended up being told the guild will provide 80. Just in case for months in advance I had worked on getting my own supply. I got 80 myself and the guild supplied about 10 and other guild members donated the other 10
---
If DME lasher farming works yout can do that with holy nova
---
Why
---
Yea a year ago I was MT for one and got them both before BWL was out then had it the 2nd week BWL was out finished. Never did Nefarian without it lol
---
Thanks for your clueless contributions, it’s been a blast.
---
Same to your friend 
---
Two ideas:
---
Continue progressing through TBC, WotLK, maybe Cata.
---
Seasons.  Ladder resets like diablo.
---
You can test it on live it hasn't changed even. I've had 2 times on live where I got both to drop in the same run in about 130 clears that I have done trying to get eye of sulfarus which I never got
---
4 person spreading the information is gonna be a lot faster than 1.
---
Also, some people don't even bother to spread this (and if the victim still get the item even if he has to spend some gold, this is an even lower chance) so it could take many ninja before someone react whereas if all the group see the ninja happening, the odd of the information spreading is a lot higher. 
---
And as i said, if he ninja for his friend, nobody will be able to see it.
---
Thank you!
---
What if it was 10%?
---
I think it’s modui 
---
I guess. Or you could just smash out the last two levels and you'll be fine.
---
I didn’t care much for it but just a few months ago. As time goes by, I’m getting more stoked! I have one friend who is for sure going to play, and he’s getting divorced so he’ll have time. My brother has expressed lots of interest. A couple other friends seem interested but are probably on the fence. 
---
I don't think you realize just how hard it is to multibox 5 different classes, let alone trying to do a dungeon. 
---
Dualboxing 2 different classes can add a fun amount of complexity to a somewhat dull leveling experience. But trying to do that with 5 classes would require an insane amount of multitasking, you'd have to bind just about every key on your keyboard. Then deal with issues like casters not being able to cast on the move, hunters having a deadzone, tanks don't have good AoE threat and healers don't have good AoE heals, etc, etc.
---
There's a reason why people typically do this sort of thing with 5x ele shamans.
---
I'd like to ask the same question regarding 2h weapon progression but on a Tauren Warrior. I had in mind that around lvl 20 I would get the Reef Axe or Strike of the Hydra from BFD, and of course Whirlwind Axe after that, but then I'm not sure. I also don't know what I should try to get for the 10-20 range.
---
if anything its your type that has no time to dedicate to progression that is the generation of the loot box.
---
you need at least heroic uldir gear for the new raid
---
Rogues don't just buy poisons, they have to craft them, which means you have to level up your poisonmaking skill using vendor bought and/or character gathered materials.  Vanish also has a reagent.
---
Hunters start with an ammo pouch or quiver.  As they give a bonus to ranged attack speed you will ALWAYS have one bag slot lost to storing ammo.
---
These are necessary videos. I think MC boss videos are things that a lot of us see as unnecessary because they're so easy, but as a guide maker I think it will be a good thing to have them in your inventory for the small percentage of people who still need them. When your series is complete, the community will hopefully have a Raserisk quality video for every boss in the game, and I consider that to be a great thing because there is no better quality than that.  
---
Also, I would resist the criticism that these videos are "rushed". You and I, and the rest of the MC running community know these bosses are just easy, and that's just the way it is.  
---
this folks is what we call a strawman fallacy.
---
Mortal Strife. When Mortal Strike misses... 
---
Joined late vanilla, left early TBC. My server/guild was too slow to progress and I didn't feel like transferring.
---
Twice on what the best dps is putting down and 100% atten. 
---
You have the most important role and slacking on any consumables ever will put you off the throne. 
---
I joined when my uncle bought the game at launch back in 2004 and loved every moment of it especially when BC and Wrath came along. 
---
I initially left after late Cataclysm (adding raid finder really took its toll on the game). I came back fresh into Pandaria since I always cherished Warcraft 3 (and Chen) and was what I wanted ever since vanilla but soon got burnt out with World of Dailycraft and the "KF Panda hate" when Thunder King released. Unfortunately this was the final straw for me.
---
Ever since I've tried Draenor, Legion and BFA each for less than a month (quit BFA within a week of launch) due to a friend but I just couldn't stand the game any longer being overbloated of new "content and features", unnecessary changes/overhauls to almost EVERY class EVERY expansion, new races that look worse than the original and despite the "positive reaction" I loathe artifacts which in turn made legendaries lose their uniqueness, rarity and "wow factor". 
---
I guess the entire time I've also just had this small false hope that Blizzard would turn it around one day but ever since late Wrath, it has not been the same. Classic WoW is Blizzard's last chance to gain some fan trust back with their recent decisions.
---
um no this isnt a strawman. This is literally what he heavily implied. A strawman is "an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument." 
---
I didnt make any argument, nor did I misrepresent anything. It simply surprised me that some people want the pace to the game to be even slower than it is now, given that the vast majority of people want more content than is being delivered atm 
---
In classic it won’t matter since you can just do cloth turn ins, so you don’t have to do any quests there. 
---
What you did is the exact definition of a straw man. Either you’re intellectually disabled or a troll.
---
MT goes beyond just raiding time. You're gonna be the guy tanking Ony attunements for 90% of the guild. Healers need a tank to farm their pre-raid gear? You're tanking. UBRS runs? You're up. And since you'll be at most of the UBRS runs, makes sense you're the one that's gonna farm LBRS for the key.
---
Then toss in cash farming since you'll be maxing out consumes, and the fact you're one of the worst farming specs in the game, so that'll be fun. You can always do reserved runs and tank for PUGs, but that can get blow up in your face when you get idiots.
---
Basically, you'll need to be logging on at least 5 days a week with time to hit a few instances on non-raid days, and maybe some extra time if you're working on progress and need extra cash for consumes.
---
good ad hominem :)
---
Not once in his post did he say no game progression is a good thing.
---
&gt; he’s getting divorced so he’ll have time
---
Wow, hardcore.
---
That’s not an ad hominem.
---
mmmm
---
Aimed Shit
---
Remember that runescape devs did not whant to run two mmos at onse too until they did. it all depends on how successful it will be. But the great thing about it that even if we dont get any new content what is already here is very good on its own
---
An ad hominem is attacking your character to discredit your point.
---
I discredited your point then insulted afterwards.
---
Please research proper use of logical fallacies before attempting to use them in open discussion.
---
Since when would anyone ever need training to score a virgin? Most virgins are desperate, especially the older ones. 
---
Depends on the guild. The guilds I was in put in the effort to help each other out for progress. I was given the Foror's book by a guildie for being a raid tank.
---
Depends several things.  How good you are at farming gold and materials?  Our MT would have 100 gold repair bills on progression nights, 4 nights a week.  The guild officers helped out a with that cost but he carried most of it himself grinding our gold and crafting BoE blues to sell on AH.
---
How experienced are you at tanking?  Boss positioning is not always as easy at it looks and DPS is going to ride you for threat even if you are perfect.
---
How reliable are you?  MT needs to be there for EVERY raid, early and fully supplied with consumables.  True for anyone who wants to raid but if the MT doesn't show, the raid is at risk.
---
Are you willing to run your own guild?  MT is highly coveted and it is usually not something you just slide into.  Best chance is to start your own guild.
---
My SO also played vanilla (though we didn't get together until years later) and she's just as excited as I am! We have one other friend who's very hyped and will play for sure, and a few who are in the "I might check it out" camp.
---
As long as we don’t get wrath, that was a trash heap.
---
1. you didnt discredit my point at all you simply stated that you dont agree with it and concluded that your opinion is the right one 
---
2. you literally called me a troll in order to discredit my point of view. Calling someone a troll is without a doubt an attack on their personality aka ad hominem 
---
Dungeon leveling is very slow in Vanilla. While your roster is very balanced, I dont think its that quick. 3 mages would be about the quickest but still be prepared for moderately slow leveling (nothing wrong with that). Pick what sounds feasible and fun, with an eye toward speed imo. 
---
I stated it’s a straw man, which it is.
---
I didn’t call you a troll to discredit your point of view, I called you a troll because you are trolling and straw manning OP.
