My backdoor is always exploitable.
---
---
---
But what about enemies who don't grind pvp and are decked out in top raid gear? What insane and unfair advantage those individuals abuse, sidestepping the immortal law of gear visibility!
---
&gt; Rogues can do just as competitive dps if you look at logs,
---

---
Do you know what scaling means?  They're only competitive because everyone is at best in full MC gear.  Wait until AQ.
---
He‚Äôs talking about elemental mastery our 31 point talent. Basically because of spell batching or whatever it is you get a guaranteed crit off your lightning spell and shock spell, even though the tool tip only says your next spell gets a guaranteed crit. 
---
I feel like blizzard will eventually fix it. But it‚Äôs sort of underwhelming when it‚Äôs working as intended and they didn‚Äôt fix it a decade ago for whatever reason. So maybe they‚Äôll continue to ignore it now.
---
Must be nice wearing tier gear and actually getting loot from raids
---
All right. Ragnaros, geddon, shazzrah (until you can outheal the AE), ony are all melee friendly. Gotcha.
---
Just shows how little you know. And, as it seems to be your main strategy in an argument, lol.
---
...what job?
---
Its cause bucklers turned into shields. Bucklers where those small ugly ones we still see that hunters and rogues could use in the beta. they where later changed to shields and skill removed from hunter and rogue.
---
Sm lib.
---
Clear out your bags. Nothing more than hearth, bandages and some food.
---
Every run turn your silk into bandages.
---
You should be able to clear 3-4 times per filled inventory. 
---
Hearth to southshore vendor all the greens, send the promising ones to bank alt.
---
Rinse repeat. This should get you ~30gold per hour depending on drops.
---
You don't need more than 6% hit with 305+ weapon skill - provided you HS and preferably HS stopcast. 
---
HoR is not a great warrior weapon, especially not when considering the investment.
---
Weapon skill softcaps at 305 and nearly hardcaps at 308, getting 312 doesn't do much.
---
We call the FP tower in Org the Honor Tube fwiw.
---
&gt; That's awfully specific. Wait: Mages have the highest single target and AoE DPS of all casters. There. I can do that as well.
---
Would it be better if they had just said "[absolute highest DPS](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/wow-classic-dps-rankings/) in the game, that remains solid throughout Classic, and which unlike Rogue actually has AoE?" Because thats more accurate. Warriors the best DPS in the game once its geared, by far.
---
&gt; Which helps you tremendously when you are in the middle of nowhere with hearth on cd.
---
Yeah, thats Mages special utility. You could argue getting instant groups and always being desired as a tank *or* a DPS is Warriors.
---
&gt; Until it comes to raids. Where mage is better once again.
---
I don't even know what you mean by this... In what way? Warrior is higher DPS as well as taking the tank slots, theres a reason you see so many in raids. And either way... both are some of the most desired DPS, so who cares really, they both get slots.
---
That's certainly a risk when you see someone with a temporary disguise on!
---
Exactly so vs a priest I will almost never use ice barrier unless they are trying to mind blast me. I don't think you're getting what I am saying. You seem to be arguing as if I've said I keep ice barrier up all the time vs priest which is literally the opposite of what I said
---
Maybe, they haven't said anything about battle groups though and I'm not sure if they have enough servers to justify battle groups. You might be right about them locking it to server types though.
---
Any chance you could talk more about the tools you guys had? Say that for instance, player would ask restoring an item that he accidentally deleted from inventory, how would you go about to find about what happened? Did you have free reign to do sql-queries in production environment / backups or was the there a logging system so good that you could figure it out without access to the database?
---
Thats insane. My luck is so bad... really disappointing but i guess we can try again. Are the blasted lands mobs solo/duo-able?
---
Druid tier 1 is only good for PVP.  Tier 2 is the first set which is actually itemized well for healibg.
---
No, obviously those fights are ranged friendly. But warriors are so op that it doesnt even matter.
---
The AOE stun talent doesn't work as well as you'd think. There's some crap about it only triggering 17% of the time of the WHOLE cast, not every tick.
---
I was wondering if that dude on the left was a human model or some gorilla from UnGoro?
---
Lmao imagine actually believing this. Boomer is truly a mindset isn't it? If you think you were playing WoW at peak efficiency after a year of picking up an MMO for the first time ever you must still be a terrible player. Are you guys the same people saying classic WoW raiding is as difficult as retail raiding?
---
Any rag wep will do, both have a ~5% give or take drop rate. Anyways, with BGs comes AV, and with AV warriors will get The Unstoppable Force which is a great weapon to start out with.
---
Truth.  According to armory, I'm around 50/50 in every BG except WSG. In WSG it's almost 2 of 3 win rate.   I've been a flag carrier since quake 2 and as a feral I can win almost single handedly.
---
It's not really worth doing that as a tank since you get raid gear so easily. But even if you really wanted to, it's still easy to get the dungeon gear. You have no competition for any of your loot as a tank. You will get it the first time it drops.
---
[removed]
---
Yes, you're talking about Flamelash, which is a horde PvE server. You're describing the experience of a full on carebear who'll occasionally get ganked once in a blue moon, unlike the alliance on your realm who get ganked anytime they go anywhere, even if they group up. Alliance on Flamelash are transferring overright now, big time. The only reason alliance can contest world bosses is how hardcore Veritas, meh, venture and big dig go after those kills, while pretty much every horde guild is bad atm.
---
Imagine being this mad about pvp happening on a pvp server... yikes
---
Darn. Oh well, thanks.
---
Sure, then you laugh/cry as every weapon, Cauterizing Band, Wild Growth, or Salamander Scale gets given to the "good" healing classes.
---
I demand those scoundrels drop their disguise and use fair tools! They are even worse than transmoggers and achievement hunters who do it for titles instead of rewards that fill inventory slots!
---
You on skeram?

"Zero resistance"
---
Yay insults!
---
Yea, but my mate is new to WoW, and since we got this lucky he really deserved to have one :)
---
I\`m keeping the other one, might make a Twink myself. :)
---
Okay mage t1 helmet is better than t2 and t2 gloves are really the ONLY thing you'll want from t2 come aq20 and zg and by then you'll have ditched t1 helm for mishundare
---
Delusional because you invent a straw man that asserts alliance would never do this. I don‚Äôt think anyone doubts the situation is flipped on some servers, but the reality is alliance are mostly the ones dealing with being permacamped everywhere they go.
---
So if im a Human that uses sword or mace. How many pieces of ‚Äú+1 % to hit‚Äù gear do I need to Wear to be hit capped?
---
All classes get stronger, what?
---
Mages eventually lose the crown of best ranged DPS to Warlocks. Can't wait for that to happen so all my Lockbros suddenly get vindication and all the Mage band wagoners turn into salt mines.
---
Meanwhile, Warriors scale absolutely crazily.
---
This will just make the imbalance worse, fuck no lol.
---
If 'aesthetics' are part of the religion female nelf priest worship then I'm hella religious üòç
---
Ehh.. druids definitely highest skill cap with great 1v1 potential but "highest" might be a stretch.
---
I mean if you were an example of how alliance on my server are, id be playing a pve game. Thankfully, theres more shit coming out of your mouth today than comes out of your ass every year so i dont have to worry :)
---
Imagine playing alliance and not playing the superior race. Not playing gnome on alliance is a waste. Paladins and gnomes is what makes alliance PvP good. Just morph to a human or whatever if you can't stand how they look.
---
Careful, this is an Alliance sympathy and support sub. Don‚Äôt interfere with those brave heroes ransacking the place.
---
I started an alt on a medium-high server and it's pretty easy to find dungeon groups, but insanely difficult to find quest groups compared to when I started playing a few weeks after launch. I'm not sure I'll even complete the Hillsbrad elite quests.
---
Spy checks the combat log continuously, I guess that's what they mean?
---
This isn't entirely true.  I really don't think your opinion on PvP matters much as to whether or not being told to "g O tO r Et Ai L" while getting corpse camped endlessly by a raid of 20+ players constantly getting spit on.
---
The current state of the game really encourages a lot of toxic behavior and being on a PvP server removes your ability to turn off that highly engaging and immersive aspect of the game.
---
With battlegrounds coming you will be able to PvP when you want and you won't need to deal with a lot of the troublesome stuff some many people here complain about.
---
What's this Grafana looking stuff?
---
Sadly it's less useful than it could have been because you'll just end up staring at the countdown before you can resurrect for longer. At least you can AFK and browse the internet instead of running.
---
Rogues scale with gear as well. SoF daggers with the AQ books does some pretty serious damage.
---
That aside.. something I saw from the launch of vanilla to its close, and am seeing again now, is that warriors tend to shine the most once you have the content on farm.  When things are going well, the tanks have solid aggro, the healers aren't having mana issues etc... warriors fucking destroy everything. But when you're working on progression and threat is an issue, you get the boss down with half the raid dead? I always see rogues well ahead of warriors on those attempts, staying there until you really do have the content down pat. That's when warriors tend to be able to push out that extra damage and really put up big numbers.
---
And honestly I don't get why people care so much about winning the little box. I'm not bitter about warriors at all, I rolled a rogue again because I love rogues and I give zero shits about who has the highest theoretical damage in the world. I'm almost always top DPS in my raid and when a warrior beats me? Great! The boss died faster and we have a skilled warrior with us. But I don't get this whole "ONLY WARRIORS MATTER FOR PVE MELEE LOL" when the reality for 99.9999% of raids is that the person playing the character matter a whole lot more, and that rogues more than earn their place in raids.
---
Hell on a more personal note.. I've been expected to be top DPS in every raid I've ever been in since vanilla. Generally am as well.. it wears on you, being expected to perform perfectly week after week with everyone gunning for your spot when sometimes you just wanna be one of the hybrid class/specs who lift everyone else up and happily sit in the middle of the pack yourself.
---
BWL is coming early Jan? Source?
---
How does being able to level fast make it busted? Warriors are notoriously shit to level, and its well known they don't have so much of a power curve as much as a power *cliff* when they start to gear at 60.
---
Fuck man I can't wait until BG's come out and people get to witness holy pally + arms warrior. People don't know what busted is until that duo hits them in the face.
---
nahh, i'll still be farming you and you'll still be making QQ posts on the forums while a ghost in game. that's just who we are, and 2 weeks won't change that.
---
cheer up bud, and good luck out there!
---
Its funny you say 2 or 3 gold but you also say 56 times a day so thats like 110 gold a day for very little time spent which isnt bad lol. Only a mage would complain about such easy gold.
---
"I don't feel so well, Mr. Stark."
---
Blaumeux is a good server. I would wait to see what the ganking is like in a few weeks after bgs release before making a hasty transfer to a worse server.
---
There are account-wide achievements in wotlk. If you care about those kinds of things, your characters won't count for each other. That's about it.
---
I think I just got bingo.
---
Yes that is true. I kinda hope they do a TBC+ with a few changes, as well as a no changes TBC version.
---
Yeah but swords suck. Seriously, I just.. don't enjoy them. Never have in 15 years.. rogues just feel right using daggers.
---
Combat daggers and SoF dagger do more than enough damage to be competitive in every raid of vanilla, with SoF being by far the most fun raid spec IMO.
---
‚Äú60/40 isn‚Äôt even that bad‚Äù is the most infuriating thing. Most people Don‚Äôt realize that 60/40 is 1.5 dominant faction player per minority faction player. 70/30 is 2 and a third dominant faction players for every minority faction player. 
---
Not to mention that the numbers getting thrown around are out of date and don‚Äôt include the disparity brought on by the players who have literally stopped playing until BGs come out because they can‚Äôt level.
---
Lol, yeah.  This is completely different.  Big brain 1000IQ here.
---
My upvote button. got you bro
---
Haha, what game are you playing?
---
Then quit.
---
To everyone reading this, class discords usually have much better info than the easily available stuff on wowhead or icyveins. I strongly recommend joining them.
---
That was added after vanilla.
---
There are several things that exist which I don't know if they are bugs or not.  There was plenty of shit in vanilla which was always fucky, FD and vanish among them.  Is this in particular a bug, I don't know, but vanish and feign death never worked all the time in vanilla.
---
Trick really only works on people with 3k-3.5k HP. (Kinda depends on how much spell power one has.) Much more and they begin to have enough reserves to retaliate. PvP gear should alleviate this a fair bit as a lot of it is focused on stamina. 
---
You have pally as your flair so I am assuming that's what you play. If it makes you feel better you too can cheese people with a ret/prot build that makes use of reckoning. Just prep a 5 stack of reckoning and unleash 6 hits worth of damage in a single swing. Even if they survive you'll likely pop off a couple extra double/triple hits from them hitting you with crits.
---
I make 6k during the first month of classic selling devilsaur sets at 450g each
---
Honor was always scheduled to be released in p2, while BGs were slated to come p3. 
---
The fact you don‚Äôt even know that basic fact tells me you‚Äôre just arguing to argue and know nothing about what you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
Also servers snowballed due to transfers. These transfers were majority alliance running from 50-50 to 60-40 servers because they didn‚Äôt enjoy PvPing without a massive advantage. If people just stayed put instead of a knee-jerk reaction to any perceived difficulty, we wouldn‚Äôt have nearly as much of an issue. Again - forethought, critical thinking, etc. 
---
Have fun with your crying, bye
---
That‚Äôs smart dude. I made the mistake of leveling BS a useless trade for money
---
Wah I play the easiest class with the most free convenience and I can't deal with people whispering me.
---
Wait till 49, the real pain train rolls in once you hit that level, every raid geared 60 is licking their lips when they see you walk by. The sad thing is I‚Äôve won some duels against them too as a shadow priest.
---
Yeah stalagg lost alot to this server. It's ridiculous they let people transfer so hardcore. Our server is okay at the moment, but definitely could be better off with my allies. I think because of grizzly the allies actually hold out a bit.
---
As you can see, they didn't.
---
You are a super hypocrite. Enough is only enough when I wanna level!!! Crybaby. Take your ass to PvE.
---
How would it fix that though? I players are still able to view and compare ids, they would still be able to coordinate using that.  It would just mean the order of character creation is not relevant.
---
Zeals. Good thing the seat next to me was empty.
---
^^^^Paul ^^^^is ^^^^dead.  ^^^^Paul ^^^^is ^^^^dead.

Damn are you for real. It seems like there's always a lvl 60 horde around though. Now I'm level 33, so I have the WORST time questing right now because my options are Stranglethorn Vale, Arathi Highlands, Desolace, and Hillsbrad foothills. STV IS INFESTED with horde. They're always always camping nessingwary. Lvl 60s too. I pretty much finished most of the quests in Arathi and the only ones left were the elite quests, I might go back to Desolace, but again there's still a lot of horde there, well anywhere really. Right now I'm at hillsbrad, a lot of these quest mobs are green and I'm getting little exp. I hate hillsbrad. Maybe it's just the atmosphere, but I don't like it. A lot of gankable noobs my level or lower, and it was really fun at first, but damn I'm stuck.  So bored. I am just AFKing now. But people are saying I'm too low to run Scarlet Monastery, so I'm double stuck. Ugh.
---
Yeah had this happen to me a lot as well.
---
The issue with this is not only are PvP servers more populated than pve servers, but there's significantly more of them than pve. Horde will have longer queues no matter what.
---
For BS to be worth it you gotta be one of the first on the server with like Arcanite Reaper, Lionheart helm or Elemental Sharpening stones. There was some paladin on my server that was the only one with lionheart helm on both alliance and horde for a good while. He made an absolute fucking fortune.
---
Ok carebear.

---
do you have to download drivers and stuff to bind these keys in WoW? I've never had a gaming mouse before
---
I find it funny seeing posts like this at the point we are at lol. I doubt there are that many fresh groups. Those who are raiding are clearing content already and those who are not are struggling to group. If you're just starting a character Yeesh xD.
---
Just when I think I came up with something original....
---
Can‚Äôt tell if being serious or not XD
---
...but Blessing of Freedom and Cleanse...
---
Literally can't do dungeons because there's a 5min delay between chatting? 
---
How is that not gamebreaking?!
---
Maybe change server and stop complaining
---
That requires you find a priest who has the same play schedule and speed desires.
---
Once you reach Naxx it's close to even with swords once you get geared out from Naxx SoF scales better than combat swords. Due to the insane crit almost every backstab is a crit, and you gain 2 combo points allowing you to dump 5 point eviscerates left and right. 
---
Added benefit is you don't have to fight everyone for swords.
---
My experience on Sulfuras as Alli - EPL is usually horde controlled but goes back and forth. Same for WPL. BRM is the new Orgrimmar
---
It sucks for anyone still levelling. It's like if you didn't do a bunch of spellcleave rushing, to the meat grinder you go...
---
You're thinking of the Cato institute. Nice try though
---
Yep. Horde have only one class with a defensive dispel... and serious rankers who play that class (Priest) are usually playing Shadow.
---
Alliance is so much stronger in Classic it's actually pathetic. But people see the faction imbalance and think it must be because Horde is better.
---
I play Alliance on Sulfuras and have found the exact same thing to occur with the Horde; no pvp unless you outnumber us 3:1 or more, not counting the metric fuck ton of bored 60's ganking low level zones and FP's. It happens on both sides equally.
---

ive leveled 50-58 in record time when phase 2 released, i was doing about 4-5 hrs a lvl played. smolderweb server, its not as bad as people make it out to be, just do what they do when you get to level 60 because u will if u dont quit
---
Join Skarm's, and ask him questions while he streams. Super knowledgeable tank, and responsive to chat. Good community.
---
So HoR is a pvp tot and you agree ret will be useful in p3... so why are you giving your holy paladin HoR over the guy who plays ret? You can do whatever you want in MC and ony. You dont even need 40 people. 1 ret isnt useless lmao
---
Oh I understand. Entitled person wants to everything on THEIR time. When they want to pvp everything is cool. When they want to stop than it isn't. That's not how multiplayer games work. This is pure entitlement. Someone being a spoiled child. This is exactly the reason why PvE servers exist.
---
im not trolling anyone. redddit is just weak
---
You get software for it to change the defaults and colors. It also let's you set up to 3 profiles if you want the buttons to be mapped differently for another game. The other huge thing about this mouse is the button on the right side that gives you an extra modifier (doubles the buttons on the side). That plus shift or ctrl alt etc modifiers in wow make this thing a dream. For $27 its an absolute steal. I might have to get another one at that price just for a back up.
---
why would they lock it to server types? everybody keeps assuming this but i don't really get why. wouldn't it just make sense to group people from both server types together if it means shorter queues for everyone?
---
You mean 1 mage is gonna get a top parse because it credits them for all the other mages' ignite stacks?

Blessing of freedom should last less than 1 second if the horde are paying any attention.

When i first played wow i lived it now i am married work full time and i am lucky if i play a few hours a few times a week. I am slowly leveling and mainly just questing with one of the few friends i have who played with me back in the day. I dont have the time to corpse walk places and a group of pvp‚Äôers would essentially ruin that days play for me due to my time . If i had time to play and rush to 60 and had a lot of people who also liked that to play with maybe. 
---
For reference i still dont have a level 60 toon. Working to get money for level 40 mount :) i am happy on pve.
---
I don't. This reddit gets spammed with these threads every day so it should be easy to find.
---
I do like it despite its flaws, but that doesn't mean I can't call them flaws.  That's all I've been doing yet people in this thread are somehow mad at me.
---
sounds fun to me gives us horde rankers a little variety
---
The combat drops when the imps lose interest, but they will re-engage you almost immediately since they're still near you. You have time to use invis pot but you need to time it well so you have enough duration left when imps lose target of you (if they aggro again after you use pot). Stealth/shadowmeld makes it much safer.
---
Doesn't matter, you just need to cast it once to remove those debuffs. Frost Shock and Earthbind both have cooldowns and can't be instantly re-applied.
---
I'm convinced that Reddit must be mostly alliance. Because if you even dare mention that alliance are just as big assholes as horde you get downvoted. And the front page is almost exclusively anti-horde. 
---
Not every horde is a retard, not every alliance is a retard, but both factions have them
---
Is this really what people think? Just because there are more horde than alliance so the alliance get camped and are forced to have a terrible time doesn't mean there is a difference in skill between the two groups.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The populations are so large that I highly doubt there are any non-negligble characteristic differences between the two.
---
This tribalism stuff is getting really weird.
---
The hat choice makes sense with the level of gameplay that I just witnessed.
---
Must be worth a lot of Kupfer!
---
You don't need taunt to ping pong the boss, just jump up and down on the rock.
---
Exactly. You get it. Like there should‚Äôve been less contested areas, more faction based areas dedicated to questing so you can separate what you want to do. World Pvp areas (not just battlegrounds) and faction based questing areas.  Being on a pve server would be so boring when you actually want to pvp.
---
&gt;Source: Played alliance in every single expac and have never made a single horde character.
---
No bias at all
---
Reck-bomb maybe? Id say that counts as a oneshot.

I like how every Warrior thinks "wow that's some bullshit" when they see a mage at the hillsbrad farms.

Organized PvP groups became more common
---
Yeah, they were overly strict as well, but I‚Äôm talking discords currently. EJ was a forum.
---
Dunno, maybe because consumables are not fucking mandatory since everyone has been min maxing forever now?
---
I‚Äôm an orc warrior that just got viskag. I‚Äôm at 28% crit 10% hit, will be at 12% with lionheart. Will edgemasters be worth it? I would be breaking my devilsaur set breaking the gloves and losing 1 crit and 2 hit.
---
As a horde player in retail I always thought AV was super horde favored. I played a rogue and would just go solo cap both towers despawning all of the guards. It was such a huge advantage that we'd just steamroll from then on.
---
Also can't you get up the alliance GY in wsg making it much worse? Or do I have those reversed?

Dungeons go in waves it seems. When I worked on my first reroll? No BFD groups. First alt? Tons. Second alt? None.

But who would buy, when any pug no matter how bad can easily clear it? You're basically only selling the key access.
---
This is what the nochanges people wanted.
---
Nothing has been announced, that was even asked at blizzcon and they said right now we are focused on classic and we have not discussed BC.
---
Well weed primarily but I don't know if it's relevant... Mages are strong rn but a top tier lock player with equal tier gear is going to out DPS most mages by Naxx (the exception being the 1 ignite mage)
---
Because there isnt a TBC subreddit. Thats why this sub gets spammed with it.
---
&gt; Improved thorns. 
---
No, that's never going to increase your DPS enough to actually be the difference in a drop or cap situation
---
"Ghetto hearth from RFC" what do you mean by that?
---
That‚Äôs why im making a mage as well
---
Zomes are either dead or ran by honor farm raids
---
Hope your horde if so I don't give a fuck you rat bastard
---
Blasted lands mobs are unrealistic to even duo.  They're basically raid mobs with 80k HP.  They hit harder and run faster than the WS mobs.  You need a 5 man group (realistically even a 10 man) to make farming them efficient or possible
---
Khabib
---
You can't just look at top parses... One mage is going to get assigned the damage from ignite that all the mages will contribute to
---
That's weird they made one and it gets linked all the time in these spam threads.
---
Between level 20ish and 60 it takes forever to find a dungeon group now. Most casuals quit around 20, and most non casuals have already hit 60 it seems.
---
I'm on a fairly well populated server (incendius) and couldn't find a RFD group after almost an hour of looking.
---
There's no line for quest mobs though, so I got that going for me, which is nice.
---
I believe they locked battlegroups to server types in vanilla
---
You could just res and port out instead of attacking someone at half health after watching all those guys run that way

I'm not 50+, not even close, but wouldn't mind such servers.
---
They do and that doesn't make this post anyless flase.
---
Not really...
---
Same. Will probably quit PvPing until BGs come out if this actually doesn't count on Tuesday.
---
‚ÄúThe whole farm‚Äù - I see you‚Äôre in the plaguelands.
---
As the other person said, Shift keys. I find organizing them by function helps (Shadowbolt/Shadowburn are Q/Shift+Q, Curse of Exhaustion/Curse of Tongues are E/Shift+E, Drain Life/Drain Soul are 3/Shift+3, etc.).
---
If you're used to holding Shift while looting, it's not a steep learning curve to get the hang of Shift+ abilities.
---
Alliance Kromcrush here. Leveling a mage alt (lvl31). Almost impossible to find dungeon groups up to this level. There seem to be a lot of LFG/LFM for 40+ dungeon content tho.
---
Devilsaur is perfectly fine. Threat is IMPORTANT. I can't stress that enough. 
---
even with devilsaur set, I rest around 68-70% DR. 
---
If you need more mitigation during a raid fight, use greater stoneshield potion. That puts you near mitigation HARDCAP. Then the bonus armor from priest/shaman crit heal will put you at hardcap. There is such a thing as too much armor/miti. When you go over hardcap its wasted.
---
I did this; it sucked at first because I strongly dislike the early-game grind but I‚Äôm *much* happier and enjoying the game a lot more now.
---
a little quality assurance would be nice if it isn't too much to ask them for
---
Dreamfoil dropped because it's easy for some classes to farm it inside dire maul east without having to get ganked.
---
Icecap is high because it's only in winterspring, and there's a LOT of pvp going on there.
---
Long encounters such as? No boss should last longer than 3 minutes and if they did just spam runes+pots. 0 mana issues
---
Its actually a side effect of the modern macro system. It wasn‚Äôt actually possible in vanilla, from what I understand.
---
What you said doesn‚Äôt quite make sense. As a rogue you solo cap towers which isn‚Äôt possible before the change. There wasn‚Äôt a single spot you could stand where a bowman couldn‚Äôt hit you. As an alliance you could solo cap any horde tower no problem, but horde had to always kill 1-2 bowmen. But maybe as a rogue you were able to sap one and blind the other. Regardless, the fact that you have to cast a single spell means it‚Äôs harder for horde than alliance. An alliance player can simply run through the entire thing and once they make it into the room, no bows can shoot them. 
---
As far as I know, you can‚Äôt just go up the alliance gy. And if you can, it‚Äôs no different than warriors charging up the horde mountain or ranger characters shooting through horde‚Äôs terrain to hit the people up top. Also, to break out, horde have to pretty much take fall damage while alliance don‚Äôt.
---
I actually think "i hope its just 1 or 2 so i can get my free honor!
---
&gt;Would you like it?
---
Nope.
---
This.
---
Takes like 10-20 mins max to get one of them to drop if 10 people from the guild helps out. We always do this when eye froms from Domo. After raid ends we help the priest who won the eye get the other eye from demons.
---
Best way is to quit, wait until middle January and see how is it going. I'm not angry only for 1 hour corpse run to brd. I got mad for disconnecting people from battle net client, queues and more things. It's possible I will need to quit this game for forever. I feel addicted. I feel chill and joy playing this game. But retail is one big toxic place and classic become unplayable
---
....
---
yes! thats wat i was lookin for, ty!!
---
Yep people don't give a shit about others experience if it gets them something.
---
I remember playing The Division at launch. They have a "Dark Zone" where you fight really tough NPCs for really good loot... and PvP is allowed. But if you kill another player, you get marked as "rogue", and every other player is both alerted to your presence and allowed to kill you for zero penalty. If you kill a rogue player you get a *big* XP reward and the rogue *loses* a mass of XP. Like hours worth.
---
There were 5 levels of rogue, with level 1 lasting 20 seconds and level 5 lasting many minutes. Every PvP action you took extended the timer. Idea people that someone who accidentally tagged another player or only killed one person would have an easier time evading rogue hunters than someone out to just murder everyone.
---
Anyway, a common thing to happen would be you'd be fighting along with someone and helping them out annnnnd you'd accidentally clip them with a bullet, marking you as rogue. At that level it would only last 20 seconds so hopefully everyone would be cool, accept that it was an accident and let you run out the timer. Right?
---
Nope. Nine times out of ten it didn't matter if you'd been fighting side by side with other players for an hour, they saw your name change and they instantly would gun you the fuck down. Reason "I need the XP". Zero shits given that they just cost you an hour of playtime, you could go fuck yourself basically.
---
This is how people behave in online games, sadly.
---
wow and mindless blizzard shills are a combination as old as time
---
If I only get engineering as a secondary profession. Secondary profession you can only level up till like 150 I think? So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wondering, is that a high enough level to make them or do you only get to make them in the higher levels when it‚Äôs one of your primary professions
---
Meh. To me it come down to what you consider P2W.
---
To me P2W is gaining access to exclusive stuff when you spend extra real money. It's mostly present in mobile game or really greedy games.
---
As for the rest, to me it's pay 2 save time in game and almost everything game have this. Running 10 accounts does that. Having 10 accounts will never give you something someone with a single account can't get.
---
Havne't even got 1 atl to 35, feel like such a slakcer :P
---
I've muted 22 users across all channels, most of them for 24 hours and only 3 permanently, since Classic release 96 days ago. That's one every 4 days on average.
---
&gt; more than that within a few hours in just the tank channel on multiple occasions
---
I'm starting to believe you're talking about another discord, because you're surprisingly misinformed for someone that pretends to be so aware of the *extreme* abuse of the *remorseless* moderating team.
---
If that's the only criteria they use, that's really dumb. Essentially they are giving their overall progression the smallest upgrades. 
---
They should be looking at other things like overall attendance, performance, as well as the extent to which a piece of gear is a % increase.
---
Hunters mark would also make a good addition.

Don't worry, you're just gonna have to wait until AQ opens.

Tis a joke mang, dont take things so srs
---
Wow, stunning argument "UR WRONG"
---
And you have your data from...where? your ass? You *OPINION* does not mean it's true. not every realm is the same you moron. If you can't find a single brain cell in your head you aren't trying very hard
---
Level a warlock
---
"Even wotlk" as if it didnt hold the record number of players.
---
Get him, boys; he's crepuscular!
---
Well your warriors probably shred the meters then. If you wanted to parse 100% on Ony you could intentionally pull and AoE whelps the whole time. Domo just keep dots up on everything if you can and hellfire.
---
this isn't how the pvp system works, rank 14 requires 60,000 ranking points which are gained by how much honor you have relative to your faction, and those ranking points decay at 20% per week, the max you can gain per week is 13000
---
I‚Äôll second Arcanite Reaper.  I‚Äôm a casual player and I transferred to Arcanite Reaper early on to escape the log in queues.  I‚Äôm currently lvl 52 on the ally side.  There‚Äôs still some light ganking to be had but not enough to slow down my casual leveling (2-3 hours 3 times a week).  Nothing near the horror stories that I‚Äôve heard in other posts.

When does this change happen? I don't remember if I mained my rogue before TBC or when it came out but the entire time I played him I'd solo cap towers. I'd win the vast majority of my AVs this way. It was a pretty small spot to not get LoS aggro.
---
I'd probably also quit player if all I was doing was farming herbs and gold.
---
i didn't criticize, i asked why he had 6% hit.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=292085/hit-cap-in-classic-wow-clarifications
---
Pagle is absolutely crawling with lower level Alliance players and a lot of them are pvp server refugees (me included, I didn't want to deal with the bs of being camped while leveling so I made an alt on a pve server away from my main's server). There's a decent number of lower level Horde players on Pagle as well but they are quite outnumbered due to the faction ratio.
---
Ya got it in the mail.
---
No joke, I've made so much money selling tarnished elven rings. Still 30-50g depending on when I'm farming.
---
Never tought about it, does it work with a druid?
---
Why? Alliance can do the exact same thing to thunder bluff or Undercity.
---
This would be and incredibly quick way to ruin the game if that is your aim then you are doing a wonderful job. If you like classic wow then let's not destroy it so quickly I'm still having fun.
---
I've been playing only since October and am level 40. I'm on a PvE server, but there's always lots of people leveling and running low and mid level dungeons. 
---
The primary barrier I encounter is the time of day since I am on an EST server and play later. Even then though I've had some decent luck at odd hours.
---
No reason why mageblade would go to mages over warlocks though
---
I'm just very pissed off!
---
I was literally chased for 15min by a group of 8 hordes in felwood.
---
I'm trying to rank up and it's practically impossible. I only made 8k of honor in 12h of gameplay today.
---
And I'm in the top 20 in honor farm on my server.
---
You are forgetting the "/s".
---
so because people have been min-maxing forever, people in a hardcore raiding guild shouldn't be expected to minmax?
---
what sort of logic is that? you get a bunch of people who are trying their absolute best at every step, looking for every advantage they can and the new guy comes along and doesn't farm for consumables? that doesn't make him an idiot or a bad person, but it does mean he's probably in the wrong raid group.
---
The thing is, no else wants them. Ofc I'm gonna pass if someone wants it for pvp if it's only a minor upgrade for me.
---
I don't refuse to use bis gear. I literally took the hammer because no one else would and it looks good for the guild to have one.
---
If you think this is a case of me taking every fucking 2 hander that drops you're dead wrong. The guild wants a 2h warrior to make it easier for the rest to get their 1 handed. I took that place knowing I wont be top dps.
---
No I‚Äôm not, it‚Äôs just that on that server horde outnumber the alliance.
---
Lol can't even play his chars
---
I've had maraudon pulls go badly every time I've gone.  A mage allows the giants and rock adds to be kited and focus fired down.
---
Yes I‚Äôm sure everyone who rolled a pvp server thought they would be getting ganked in the middle of a major city...
---
Would be hard to do unless your able to bring over the entire faction to a new server. Otherwise you would be potentially splitting up people.
---
Why not? It happened in vanilla as well..
---
Go prot, get silent fang from scholomance.  It has never let me down.
---
reminds me of that scene with Will Farell in Austin Powers 1
---
I‚Äôve noticed that if you put more than 3 buffs on a member the fourth is not visible on the raid bar but is on their character if you target them.
---
The best gold/he is going to be farming the best items for the next phase. Farm them, sit on it for a while and drop them for huge prices the day p2 releases.
---
Archers getting a target fucks you because they don't despawn on the flag capture.
---
I just found AV so trivial on my rogue. I promise you that you do not have to use blind. I don't think I sapped either but I know I didn't have to use cooldowns unless I had archer aggro and had to vanish them off to get them to despawn.
---
Is that selling even worth it? 
---
I make like 60g/h if nothing special drops and when I just vendor everything (my runs are like 17 minutes and I probably kill too much).
---
But let's say I have a ring that I could sell for like 30g. Then I would have to wait to find a guy, then wait for the guy to get to DM, then wait for him to actually get to the chest. I would be a miracle if that takes less than 30 minutes.
---
Why are people going with sm/ruin for pvp rather than speccing deep into destruction for conflagrate and rest into standard afflication? Or is that viable as well? I'm considering myself to do that burst damage on this crazy pvp life we have now (I'm lvl 46)
---
rp or pve server?
---
I understood that reference.
---
Resto druid is boring af
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain they do. Archers can‚Äôt exist on a contested flag. Contesting a flag always despawns them on both sides.
---
I do Tyr's hand almost every day, if silithus elemental farm is to pvp heavy tyr's is usually less and you can hide in the hills or behind buildings, lots of cover. Im DW fury and it works just fine, once you get all the timings and interrupts down you can kill 2 maybe before you need to eat or bandage. They drop so much rune cloth you can farm there forever, keep making bandages. Timed it last night and did 14g/hr not including stuff I put on AH. So it's close to 20/hr I would think if my AH stuff sells.
---
Not my fault you warriors are generally Stupid.
---
I can't tell you how many times i'm just running to UBRS to help friends and I suddenly get charged by a Warrior looking to fight me. I demount, root them, Frostbolt/CoC and 80% of their health is gone to which I just Fire Blast and Arcane Explosion while kiting you forever. 
---
Also AOE farming isn't too hard but AOE farming elites is actually difficult for a mage as any hit at all will probably kill you instantly. If you want to be mad be mad at a hunter or a warlock being able to kill actual bosses while never being hit once.
---
If unly yoo rowled a PVE server den it never would of happunz!
---
You're*
---
Yeah friends are hard sheesh
---
You know, that was how Alliance players acted 15years ago because they were outnumbered the Horde players.
---
The real Horde experience on Classic is playing Alliance.
---
Sorry to burst your bubble zoomer, but you act exactly like the typical Alliance player too-proud-of-himself 15years ago.
---
(Also he's your raid leader and probably manages the "guild" bank)
---
I have 8/10 people ready, still looking for a second hpally, and a GOOD hunter. Should be a fun time.
---
As a Mage, I average anywhere from 75-90g/hr in DME by farming Lashers/Satyrs with Herbalism. I hit instance cap, even while doing self-resets, so I just log onto my alt and do professions in the downtime for a bit more gold/hr on top of what I'm making in DM.
---
Warlocks and Hunters supposedly have even greater income potential than that with solo Tribute/Jump runs, although I don't have either of those classes to verify the exact gold/hr numbers.
---
Lmao embarassing
---
As someone else has already asked, why leave Sulfuras? Its balanced, high pop with no queues. If you're having a bad time on horde reach out to me and I'll see if I can make your time played more enjoyable.

I‚Äôm not actually, I‚Äôm a alliance player on a 90H/10A who doesn‚Äôt complain about pvp on a pvp server even when drastically outnumbered.
---
I never said a customer service tech could do anything.  It's the company I have issue with.  They are literally just copy and pasting a canned response why would I get mad at the individual?  I wouldn't even be upset that they got the name wrong.  It's a brain dead task mistakes like that are bound to happen.
---
Mage main, leveling a warrior with a guildie who‚Äôs leveling a shaman. WF totem + heals and the fact that my mage can just shovel gold and BoEs at my warrior has made leveling incredibly fun
---
Do you really think he'd do it on livestream?
---
it very well could be, but I do have fond memories of it from a while ago... nothing could sow such chaos and confusion.
---
That is still a solid chunk of time doing repetitive shit.
---
I'm not insanely fast, but I can reliably get 2 tribute runs in an hour. If I sell elven rings and potions (I keep the health ones for pvp) it averages out to around 45g a run along with selling the blues. It would take me 223 runs to get 10k gold not counting mats (would probably be 230 runs or so). 
---
That is a lot of tribute runs when I wouldn't even need the money for anything. I could buy the blue sinew along with both gianstalker boe pieces and still have 8k gold to spare
---
You good?
---
lemme guess you guys just don‚Äôt have all day to play cause you work full time jobs and have 42 kids and have to deal with not only your wife but also your wife‚Äôs boyfriend
---
Since he doesn't speak German, he won't know what they're on about anyways. XD
---
I'm sure it must feel super op! :)
---
It's 10 mins tops with warlock summoning alts to get a group from MC to Ony... Do you guys not plan ahead?
---
Then you just don‚Äôt understand how unhealthy this is for the game. Especially when so many new players are starting.
---
I've pretty much always used berserking with it to make cast time bearable, but the range is, indeed, a huge problem - if you realize what's going on, you can just run the hell away and probably avoid it.
---
I did this on release. We were slightly slower than the hunter who quested. Maybe realm tenth or so with 4 mages 1 priest premade.
---
The difference between you and I is that I was making a joke.  You seem legitimately upset about this issue.
---
I owe them. This is my second alt at 60. I‚Äôll never look at alliance the same. Let this be known, mcdruid, mcrage, and mcmageface will never touch a questing alliance from this day forward.
---
I do get it, but there is nothing that can be done about it, people need to realise that as well.
---
Yep. I started playing Classic with a friend who rolled a shaman. I‚Äôm not sure I would even made it to 60 without him.
---
Thr gnome? Hmm. Didn't check. The thorium guy was empty and didn't allow me to repair.
---
I feel it man.. I could use some of the same love to get my 54 alliance rogue on that server to 60 lol
---
The item is deleted. A GM might restore the item if you submit a ticket, but no guarantees.
---
Your name plates not being center really bothers me lol
---
You complain about PvPers complaining about PvP but I can't name myself anything fucking interesting in a RP server without being suddenly flagged and forced to name change because some RPers doesn't believe it's a "RP Name"
---
Ah yes, but how many times did you get told "gO t o rE tA iL"
---
That's what I thought, alliance still has it worse.
---
Me too.
---
Saying there is nothing that can be done and ‚Äúpvp? On a pvp server??? Gasp! Who would have thought!‚Äù Are two majorly different point of views. But the more this is pointed out the more blizzard have an incentive to do something about it.
---
Maybe change subreddit and stop reading the complaints
---
With that farm that guy either overburden or got addicted to game hard so quiting is good for him
---
I went and did every dang quest in Azeroth to get Loremaster before Cata hit it was an absolute blast! I saw parts of the world I'd never seen before and would have never been able to see again if Classic hadn't been released.
---
Sounds like you just suck.  Horde outnumber Ally on Incendius, apparently Yanggang was too busy farming the menethil-theramore boat to help.
---
I get it
---
Engineering is a primary profession and you can level all the way up to 300 with it. You'll have to drop one of your current ones to get it. The only secondaries are fishing, cooking, and first aid which all also go up to 300
---
Warriors on Horde side have a unique problem with burst threat. Gearing for sustained threat is not going to solve the problem of burst threat. The only thing that solves that is throttling your damage - or just saying fuck it, going all out, and praying the stars don't align at the start of a fight.
---
Can't agree more.
---
6 for bosses. That is if you are not duelwielding.
---
Why? They have bgs coming. You want them to start locking people out of the game to try and balance it? Because that‚Äôs the only solution. 
---
Reality is people are fucking soft now and unless they are winning they have a cry about it on the internet.
---
Yea u can recover from boss fights but mobs and such a pain sometimes. You keep being wild.
---
I want the set for pvp.
---
Can confirm. Was killed in my bed 30sec after posting this
---
And to think, you worked so hard farming that Thorium Point FP.
---
Have you considered trying sleep once in a while?
---
Faction based queues for Herod.
---
That's a lie, you're replying to a post that references /r/frenworld which is a neonazi subreddit. I also doubt you can even find any popular upvoted memes that have fren in it. If you ask most people where they've heard of 'fren', most would either say they don't know or they know about r/frenworld. Even if this wasn't the case, it's besides the point because the whole point about dog-whistling is to co-opt things that can be passed as an everyday thing as to have a completely different meaning to a certain group of people.
---
DEATH TO THE SCOURGE AND DEATH TO THE LIVING
---
Gz from a fellow German player! :)
---
t1 is amazing for pvp(although obviously it fades over time as t1 stats aren't as high). T2 is pretty good for pve and decent pve. t2.5 is a weird one but good for pvp. t3 is great because all t3 is good.
---
So going full t1 is a good way to set up your hunter. Perhaps try to get ashruethul in bwl but that's a hard one.
---
so one does not have to wait for the other?
---
I'm in a very casual guild currently (as the guild landscape will change a lot anyways and I don't need the hassle as long as it's cleared with ease). And I'm usually top DPS overall and also on every boss where melees can be first basically. So there is nothing to worry about even if we change up our system.
---
We use EP/GP rn so attendance is more important than impact, which again is fine as we're very casual.
---
In my totally anecdotal, since this is all your evidence is, experience  it was the opposite. My hunter took uhh 7-9 days to get to 60 /played
---
My warrior with 3 mages and a paladin took 5.
---
VE is a curse, it won't get caught by Cleanse. Only Shadow Weaving and SW:P occupy the same slot. And considering SW:P takes 3 seconds to tick, the Paladin has multiple chances to remove it before it does even 1 tick worth of damage.
---
This is like the worst possible situation to prove your point. There is a reason Shadow Priests are not used in group PvP.
---
Username checkouts
---
ah word. cuz i've tried some other button mice that wont let me just plug them in and bind the keys in WoW
---
There is a vendor in the zone near the wpl entrance &lt;3
---
&gt; o you‚Äôre basing this entire theory off of the fact that the general community was wrong all these years, deep battleground analysis was wrong all these years and the sheer win rate of alliance was not telling in any meaningful way.
---
See this is where I take issue. I don't value the insight of the general community or the "deep battleground analysis". None of it takes place in a controlled way and a lot of it is starting with a conclusion (AV is baised against horde) and looking for evidence to support that conclusion. 
---
This along with an echo chamber to rattle all of this "proof" around is exactly how misinformation gets widely spread and accepted as fact.
---
&gt;We can write it off as ‚ÄúAlliance simply gets to him more because lol horde sucks‚Äù which I‚Äôm sorry, isn‚Äôt an answer. By that logic, horde should have a lower win rate across all battlegrounds which wasn‚Äôt the case.
---
This was directly addressed in the last comment. I specified very explicitly that Alliance might be better in AV not because Alliance players are in all superior, but because the the better horde players would specifically avoid a battleground they erroneously percieve to be disadvantageous to them. This would impact the average Horde performance in AV while not affecting or even helping Horde performance in other battlegrounds as they would then be somewhat over-represented in those. 
---
I'm not discounting the possibility that AV is indeed biased toward the Alliance. I am simply unwilling to accept it simply because general population of WoW, a group of people for whom I have absolutely no respect or consideration, tell me it is and give me some shoddy evidence that wouldn't be out of place in /r/conspiracy .
---
You're fine for SM GY and probably even LIB. There's also RFK but I imagine trying to get there would not be fun on a pvp server unless you can find a group dedicated to multiple runs.
---
I'll write a full response when I'm home. But yeah we've asked on every 2 hander if anyone wants them. We're all in discord all raids so yeah. We're obviously prioritizing weapons for pve but if anyone wants a weapon for pvp they will say so. If they don't have the balls to tell gm they want a weapon for pvp that's honestly their problem.
---
My favorite character in this was definitely the warrior! Join the Forsaken!
---
Fuck those goblins anyway.
---
Join the multiclass theorycrafting discord. It dwarfs Fight Club.
---
Questing during peak hours at launch was painfully slow. Mobs in instances are not contested. And give more XP.
---
Are you even aware that they mindcontrol you back to the flypath ?
---
if i was revered and needed only to loot feathers/bead, i wouldnt accept either, also not everyone is obliged to join when someone instantly proposes invite for whatever reason, you basically blackmailed those people that didnt accept invite
---
All my totems are showing on raid frames except windfury
---
Nope. They hit together at the start of the fight but once they're going they have independent timers.
---
Yeah, you? Or did one of those jokes hit too close to home for ya?
---
not everyone cares about min/max though, you can clear MC in an hour using MS Debuff. It still works.
---
What do you farm if I can ask?  60 dagger rogue here. Currently mining thorium/arcane crystal for about 40k an hour.
---
This ^ I tanked everything so yes i understand it was easier for me to find a group, plus more people were still levelling to 60 than right now I think. But yeah just start your own group. You don‚Äôt have to be an expert on the dungeon. Half of the time I didn‚Äôt even know the dungeon as a tank but I just communicated that
---
Until they have a have an actual reason for removing it
---
Not true fall damage doesnt take away honor.
---
Nah bud, just quite a rant for someone.
---
ask dumb questions that have been answered every time over 12 months and that the answers are in the multiple faq channels and are also easily accessible with the search bar and complains about people's reaction over it. grow up. learn to fish instead of asking for the fucking filet.
---
quitter, traitor... you keep collectin' them fancy titles mate
---
I just advertise in chat, wait a minute or so, then loot if nobody in DM is interested. Most of the time it is a rogue who can get to the chest in 5-10 minutes. Worth it imo for 30-50g
---
I mean, rule 3 of the sub is pretty clear and this breaches it..
---
Imagine getting two of the same helm in ony instead of different helm

Have fun playing on a PVE server after all the alliance quit.
---
TBC is not vanilla. Blind got a huge buff by not being a posion and rogues gained CloS which is **insane** and completely changes the game for them.  
---
  
---
Please refrain from posting if you dont know what the fuck youre talking about.
---
Early jan? Wheres this info?
---
Hunter! Very good beginner class. You get a pet to help you, can move fast, and are simple to understand
---
You‚Äôll be good and ready at 60 to tank and get some purples then! I did so many dungeons while leveling my warrior I had to pay the full 100g for my mount because I wasn‚Äôt honored with UC yet when I hit 40
---
Why would I be upset? Just bored of the 'jokes' that make up about 90% of responses to people talking about PvP sure do get old.
---
Just wait another 2 weeks and bgs will be out...
---
What server is this on? I feel like this is the type of amazing shit you see on an RP server
---
Lol damn homie didn't mean to make you so upset
---
engineering is mandatory for pvp. whatever for your second, up to you.
---
Same. Got my warrior to 36 so far on a PVE. 10000x better.
---
That it‚Äôs not fun?
---
Been sick all day. This made me laugh. Thank you

I think it looks better than in the provided screenshot
---
I think you may have misunderstood the tone of my comment buddy or maybe I wasn‚Äôt clear enough. Either way I am saying it is frustrating but your right it is part of the game and I am sure I have frustrated others when I have done PvP that is what it is. I think the mentality of factions plays a huge part in people‚Äôs experience as it appears alliance in general are more PvE focused and horde PvP focused there are exceptions to that but in general it appears that way making it hard to quest as alliance when raid party‚Äôs roaming every 5 mins, at the same time it is kinda what I signed up for so it is expected.
---
It's already fine for casuals on PVP - you just have to not be a snowflake.
---
So a rogue. Yeah fuck you buddy.
---
Kidding. Kinda.
---
You sound like a thoroughly unpleasant person, like the type of person people have in their lives just because they have to and not because they want to. I hope you change your ways, friend, because if you don't you will inevitably die unloved and alone.
---
It's pretty self evident, and I have 60s on horde and alliance.
---
Why?
---
Yeah, ganking ppl as they fight mobs is the honorable path, guys. fOr tEh HoRDe
---
And I regret nothing!
---
The spa is less than a fury warrior or 2 hand cleaver but they can certainly tank and aoe
---
&gt;This guide
---
I personally would pay at least 200g for uncontested reed. 20 runs in and still no luck.
---
This dude sounds like Otis from House of 1000 corpses. Lol
---
Thats almost 100g. I wouldnt have, but gz.
---
You act like scaring off all the babies will feel bad. Quite the opposite, my friend. 
---
Causing cowards to quiver and cry can be quite cathartic.
---
Get a swing timer add on and see what happens
---
No it doesn't lol
---
What server time do you play? Id love to be able to freely walk through BRD as ally on Mog but it's legit ALWAYS 40 horde camping both entrances and then 20 or so picking off those of us that make it to the chains whenever I play.

??
---
Seems you think that being killed on a pvp server is not somehow "playing the game".  Weird.
---
Yeh all my 12 year old friends think it‚Äôs SOoOo funny just camping these alliance NERDS over and over!!
---
ZuG ZuG!!
---
I've off tanked MC as straight arms. I've also picked up bosses a few times if the tank has dropped but I wouldn't MT as arms. I tanked Ony as arms easily.
---
For everything else arms is also fine.
---
Officially the dumbest question I've ever heard a person ask.
---
Not since p2... On Noggenfogger-EU the LFG channel has slowed from continuous spam to a couple of msgs per minute at prime time.
---
üòÇ
---
Youre an ignorant twat....   
---
Let me give you my experience. I got 40 hks on wed 40-50 hks on thursday. All solo, none at flight path. Both days were between 2-9pm PST on a West coast server.  
---
When I logged into WoW for first time today at about 2pm PST, it shows I only have 43 hks for the week, still being tallied under the Today's hk area. There are 0's in the "yesterday" colum, and the additional HK's I got yesterday have disappeared.  
---
I have killed the same person no more than 3 times, diminishing returns isnt a thing for my experience. Plz explain this since you are all knowing?
---
Just want to point out that to many it appear like a whine but I think this is more of a venting to help clear the salt that has been induced by the op today, I think deep down they are loving the game and wouldn‚Äôt really change what is happening but sometimes you just need to vent to clear you head a little kinda like post but clarity if you will.
---
A botting problem
---
Because MC is the only real raid right now. Obviously by the time you have MC on farm you'll have better gear.
---
&gt;you can still speed it up by not having to sit down to drink as often.
---
Healers drinking is not the bottleneck for raid clear speeds unless you're intentionally trying to speed clear
---
Must be on a low pop server.  Shitloads of people in the low level zones on high pop servers.
---
Let them make their daily salt posts and complain that Horde players are virgins and losers and alliance are just trying to play the game honorably üòÇ you‚Äôll never change their minds.
---
That's true but I'm not a big fan of torpedoing classic wow at any point since it's a good game and destroying it doesn't sound good even 3 years from now.
---
Just makin a little joke
---
Yep you can start farming gold in ZF GY as low as 42 and it gives great EXP / gold per hour.
---
They deleted it because it was gaining traction
---
I wouldn't go as far to say that. Classic definitely sticks to a more traditional MMORPG (seeing as it is) and retail is that game at the core still, there's just so much flash and  modernization to it now that it lost that feel.
---
Just wanna say f you.. didnt find out about this till months after it was sold out lol. But eh I took 5 years off so it's what ever.  But still it's pretty cool. And I hope it comes to life and burns you..
---
What it needs is an executis alarm clock that goes off like 5-10 minutes early then rag yells too soon..
---
With the current meta mostly revolving around duels and world PvP, when battlegrounds come out what specs are going to become more prominent and likewise, what currently powerful specs are going to see a drop-off??
---
You can just stop defending people who fill this subreddit with their whining. Just stop.
---
I'm not Alex üòÇ
---
#nochanges man. Warts and all.
---
Lololololololololol
---
what faction?  cuz it's always hard to find BFD groups on alliance even when the servers launched...
---
*is sapped*
---
*gets up and AFKs to watch tv*
---
Sold one for 150g in 6 hours of posting
---
only one upset here is you, which is obvious since you downvoted my post. Im honestly laughing at you because of how absurd the claim is that youre making.
---
Sounds like ironforge on Skeram.
---
Keep thinking that..
---
Then stop deleting it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
How good is having a crusader enchant while leveling a warrior alt?
---
Bariyeth : Charlie
---
Loadmilker : Mac
---
Frankenstina : Frank
---
There is absolutely no reason to dial world tank in this phase. The gear just isn't there yet
---
After getting worked by rogues more than a few times I actually thought about rolling one just to do it back.  I honestly gave it more than a few hours of thought over a few days, no joke, but I decided against it.  Entirely me and my thought process, and I‚Äôm not saying my decision is for everyone, and it really wasn‚Äôt about the entirely of world PVP, all the things that go with it, or...fuck I‚Äôm rambling.  I don‚Äôt have all the answers, but personally I decided against because I couldn‚Äôt believe after having days and days /played on a Rogue and ganking someone that I‚Äôd have an ounce of ‚ÄúHah, payback!‚Äù feelings.  
---
Like I said, rambling, just my thoughts.  Rolling a class just to get back at someone just seems like letting them live in my head rent free, and that seems like a waste of time.
---
I got bone spurs ok, it's not my fault!
---
Do you really think it's normal to have to spend 12h ONLY doing pvp to earn 8k of honor?
---
You can't stop to make DGs, you can't stop to make gold. Spend everything you have buying dozens of invisibility potions, invulnerability potions, among other consumables, just to have a chance every 10 minutes (because you're always dead) of catching a kill in a 3 player group (when you're lucky) )?
---
And now what was supposed to be a no-change experience (#NoChanges), when they release BG, will be cross realm! HAHA HA
---
Because it is not enough for the dominant faction to have all the freedom to play as they please, poor guys have to wait a lot of time in queues for BGs.  
---
Not only speak for me! the game became shit because they didn't try to balance the servers.
---
Many players simply stopped playing or started leveling up other characters (which when they reach level 50 they stop again because it is impossible to do anything).
---
Any server where you have a very large discrepancy is shit.
---
Guilds losing players because they stopped logging in and the difference only widens, no one makes DGs anymore because you spend 30 minutes just getting to the entrance.
---
I will get my rank up, but at what cost?
---
Most of my friends are stopping playing, the faction I'm getting more and more empty, (my guild that had over 100 active players now on a friday night has only 15 players online, 12 are alts, 2 60\`s and I)  
---
If you don't see a problem with this, you must be the kind of person who looks only at yourself.
---
I can spend 12 hours a day trying to get rank, but 95% of the players can't, and what is the point of playing on a server where there will only be me and a half dozen active players while all my friends who leveled up with me, that we had great experiences together, won't they be there anymore?
---
And who is in the dominant faction and has no problem with that, I want to see what they are going to say when they leave cities to look for something different than doing other than BGs.
---
They will die of boredom and stop playing because they can only do BG\`s all the time, go to the raid once a week get a gear but for what? There's no one else to fight against.
---
Oh wait, BG\`s will be cross realm so fuck the others and their experience with the game, right?
---
U never step outside.
---
üíØ.
---
I was Horde in vanilla. Rolled Alliance to ‚Äúsee the other side‚Äù. Most of my guild seems to be former Horde from vanilla or didn‚Äôt play it. 
---
Seems like most of the vanilla allies rolled horde and vice versa, and every single ‚ÄúI want to be on ez mode‚Äù rolled Horde too.
---
They act just like vanilla allies did too, it‚Äôs kind of funny - but I think that‚Äôs prob just what happens when you outnumber your opponents 3:1.
---
Got ya, but we bring meme specs because the content is trivial, so could certainly see an arms warr.
---
However this guy already having IF/BB and not knowing the answer to this question gives me Aids...
---
The odds of hitting those crits in a row on a player that much higher level are nuts. Hitting would be rare even
---
Bro
---
90$ is too steep for a game I probably won‚Äôt play
---
It is
---
I leveled an alt via dungeons and at a guess I'd say 20 stocks, 30 SM various wings, 30ZF GY, 30 BRD prison - golem. 
---
That's an estimate though. 
---
However long 5 days played is when you only travel between dungeons once at the start level and go repair. 
---
Maybe 100 or so.
---
What I find completely unreasonable is that a bug if this magnitude has survived for more than a day or two.
---
/petattack, /cast !shoot, /cast [pet:dead][nopet] summon X, /cast [mod, @player][] devour magic
---
Those are a few of the conditions that locks are likely to use
---
Or use it to pretend to body pull a raid boss and freak everyone out  :)
---
he
---
Luckily you don‚Äôt play with my settings!
---
I think it is a great package and I think you would enjoy it.
---
All day 24/7. Look up "hyperbole".
---
Gotta blow them the fuck up before they cast Curse of Tongues on you. You need to get them low enough to where shocks and melee damage can finish them off. Only works if they don't have Soul Link and you get the jump.
---
If they get Curse of Tongues on you, DoTs up, and they have a Felhunter out... it's game over. Even without Soul Link.
---
Their actions are literally a drop in the bucket. You're crying about the .01% alliance on the server that can actually fight back your sadistic corpse camps.
---
Killing aoe farmers makes me so giddy, even if I can get a same faction player killed
---
It depends mainly on you being good
---
In coordinated pvp, if you are being targeted with slows, you aren‚Äôt living long enough to get diminishing return unless bubbled.
---
r/classic is literally just a giant therapy session for alliance.
---
Osrs devs are usually high level players of the game and actually care about its health going forward... The company's execs genuinely care about the game and when it was sold to a Chinese company they refused to add microtransactions. Can you say the same about Blizzard? No, because it had become a soulless shell of what it used to be since Activision bought out Blizz
---
I can‚Äôt believe this isn‚Äôt getting more talk on here. The main thing in p2 for people is honor and it‚Äôs completely busted. This would be like if your gear disappeared after an MC run. I don‚Äôt believe that things are 100% ok so would be good to know what‚Äôs going on.
---
They literally make DM unusable for massive streches. Eat my ass nerd.
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Albatrosses can smell out prey from over 12 miles away.
---
For real. Im on a lopsided server as alliance but i love it as a feral druid. I sit outside kargath at the path horde take to blackrock and gank horde all day with other rogues and druids.  Im only rank 4 but i dont play much...all the rogues are already rank 6 there on alliance. Its like the one spot where i actually feel good in phase 2. Its great seeing all the horde bones laying in the pathway all day everyday.
---
All they have said is that it is supposedly just a visual issue and they know the real honor. But I don‚Äôt want Tuesday to come around and find out I‚Äôve wasted hours of gaming. If it‚Äôs broken let me know and I‚Äôll level my alt.
---
your so wrong its hilarious.. takes 1 second to remove all magic effects and dots
---
If you clear the area and have to wait for respawns, then that advantage is nullified.
---
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs the same reason why all the mages are frosty instead of flamey, gear available during this phase is probably better suited to one over the other
---
Yeah ridiculously lucky. And I feel as though the Rogue must have been a fresh 60 with crappy gear. (or maybe he had res sickness? Just thought of that posibility)
---
Every other 60 rogue I've tried to defend myself against, I've been wrecked of course.
---
I got downvoted to hell when I said before release that Joana was just some boomer that got known for speedleveling before there was really any competition for it. Now noone talks about him anymore.
---
The tribalism is weird. But - horde were legit better at PvP in vanilla. And it seems like allies are too.
---
I just 2v1 camped a level 60 warrior with a lvl 48 priest as a 54 mage.
---
Sure, 48 v 54 is an obvious advantage and mage v war, but there‚Äôs no way I should have won, and been able to camp. I just started even bothering to PvP on my Mage (literally just to get trinket because I‚Äôm sick of getting chain feared by gankers) because I was just trying to get to 60 first.
---
Maybe they just really sucked - but I think constantly having backup can make you soft. I was 3 man roaming the other day, only CC anyone used was Fear and Blind. No sheep, no charm, nothing else. Even when fighting 5 man groups with multiple mages/locks. First thing I do when someone comes at me is sheep because I know they‚Äôre not alone, ever. Doesn‚Äôt seem like the mass majority faction thinks that way.
---
yeah keep applying  dots il keep removing them faster than you can apply whilst costing less mana... you ever even pvp?
---
Dankesch√∂n! :p
---
The argument salty allies are making is that all alliance are quitting the game from griefing. 
---
They are trying to make the argument that since all the allies are quitting, horde will have nobody to queue vs in BGs. 
---
Forgetting that there are plenty of pve servers, balanced servers, and servers with majority alliance. So in reality its more like they really hope people have to wait hours, it won‚Äôt be the case though.
---
This is every day.
---
The bone is protruding from the skin.
---
Same here. I've played mostly Dwarves but I tossed a couple NE in there for the classes Dwarf can't do.
---
I‚Äôd rather look up ‚Äúpedantic‚Äù.
---
I killed like 10 bots in Tanaris today. Stunning amount out there recently.
---
I'm not sure that you meant to reply to my shitty WW2 bombing joke.
---
But the people want to cry more
---
Skinning knife with +30 spell dmg and just pass it on to all of your alts
---
Bad take.  I don‚Äôt like this take.
---
It gets worse than the 60/40 ratio.
---
Because Alliance are dominated on most servers, even more alliance players are discouraged from even leaving cities outside of doing dungeons/raiding, which leads to an even more scewed and hidden number.
---
Me and some guildies run around in a 5-10 man squad almost every evening, and it always ends with us being outmanned after a while. We just switch zones when this happens, but it always ends like that.
---
Yeah especially since he would have a vod to send to blizzard  saying he didn‚Äôt know the guy. It‚Äôs honestly a perfect cover. Mad props to this guy
---
You should have gonna alliance on bene dude. What were you thinking?!
---
One thing to keep in mind is that, if they continue the trend they set with the last few expansions, you'll likely get BfA for free once Shadowlands drops. They did that with the last big expansions, at least. So it being included in the deal now only really matters if you intend on playing it *now* instead of waiting. 
---
At least one level boost is also usually included in a new expansion.
---
The fact that they detract from the experience of the majority of their playerbase will hurt them more in the long run than a few extra subs, especially since the vast majoirty of them either purchase subs with credit card fraud or will only be subscribed for a month anyways.
---
Are you actually implying running around by yourself is a shittier thing to do than camp flight paths?
---
It's not to late you know
---
How many mods does it take to clean up trash posts like this?
---
i mean yeah, everyone that is not the ultraslack player has some sort of enemy castbar addon or ui. but still, in the heat of combat, this gets often overlooked and they just react to your green glow.
---
i mean i once baited a cs against og like this, and that guy is certainly very far from a noob.
---
Grobbulus is the best server I've ever played on.
---
This might be true for now... I eagerly await having better gear so I can get to farming stratholme reliably for 100g hour
---
Is this a copy pasta? I hope so, cus dear god its embarrassing for allies üòÇ
---
They need the BG's.  I think it's too soon for the gear, but it is what it is.  
---
As for the world pvp.  They fucked up launch way too bad.  The world pvp for longer would've been fine, but with the problems servers had and opening up free transfers they fucked up the balance on literally every server.  Things went from like 55-60 horde to 75-80 horde on most servers, which transfer servers being heavily alliance.  That makes world pvp completely terrible and worthless for most people, and will lead to more people quitting the game.
---
More facts
---
Closer to 8-10, depending on your current SP and hit chance.
---
yeah I agree, its just them being bitter and hoping to ruin others fun so blizzard can, I dunno, forcibly transfer off half the skeram and stalagg horde populations or something. If BGs are cross server then even if all of the alliance or horde was wiped out on one server it won't effect your ability to pvp except in the world which will be far less rewarding then spamming WSG all day anyhow.
---
That doesn't answer my question. I'm well aware of mage farming.
---
9k in 4-5 days? LOL no.
---
Even on  the two servers I play on (incredibly high pop PvP servers) I have had no issues questing on 4 different characters to 50+. I'm not sure it's a problem the way you make it sound.
---
I get killing enemy faction aoe farmers but why mess with people on the same faction? Seems pretty fucked up.
---
As a former retail botter, I can assure you blizzard takes botting quite seriously. Look up glider or honor buddy banwaves.
---
I've had close to a dozen accounts receive bans ranging from 6 mo to 18 mo and one permanent ban on my oldest main acc.
---
It's a never ending battle between the bot programmers and blizzard. The more successful and well known bots have even had legal action taken against them.
---
Trust me when I say the botters will get what's coming to them. It may take a while, but a brainwave will come.
---
Why are you talking out of your ass?
---
OP has been talking about being benched because they'd forget their Onyxia necklace. So much so that they are fucking afraid of making a mistake in the game, talk about entertainment.
---
My comparison was based upon how their RL would escalate the sanction were they to make another mistake in BWL, sarcastically saying that they'd be kicked out of the guild.
---
Where did you understand that OP's guild was hard-core and trying their damnedest to clear fucking Onyxia (as 40 people...)
---
actually only on like 3 other servers, most servers have a decent balance or have more alliance then horde. sorry but for most of us, p2 is awesome, sucks to suck
---
Does he kill last boss? What's his gear like? Any tutorial?
---
Seems like it lately
---
It's not fun for one class to be able to kill 3-70 times as many quest mobs as another. It's not fun having nothing to kill because a mage decided to farm nearby. 
---
The thing, the one thing that mages are bullshit at, is AoE farming. Not good, not amazing, not broken, but absolute bullshit.
---
Crit is better on mages because locks cant get enaugh hit
---
Maybe in phase 2 Tarren Mill battles. Try slowing a flag runner in Warsong Gulch with Frost Shock and let me know how that plays out. Meanwhile, Alliance has cleanse for their flag carriers.
---
It's a non-issue compared to high level dungeons like BRD or Strat. You'll probably see a couple lvl 60s, but that's it. The graveyard is right there as well. Getting there has never been an issue for any group I've been in.
---
but muh reddit hyperbole
---
As soon as his stun lock finished, I turned around and judgement/ bonked him on the head and splat. There was no time to react to that level of luckiness. No skill involved, just RNG gods on my side lol.
---
Theyve already addressed it by having Warden scan all CPU processes and your RAM. These bots will be banned eventually unless they are running a streaming based pixel bot which isn't effective enough to worry about.
---
I disagree. As a mid level tank I basically got fat eating chili. It makes SM so much easier to manage. As an arms warrior tanking it procced very often during a sweeping strikes/whirlwind opener. And was a lot cheaper than oil of immolation.
---
I have unsubbed. Disgraceful!
---
I'm on a warlock and I can get to the last boss no problem.  Currently struggling with killing the mage ad or draining his mNa without the boss killing me.
---
So it is actually something that you think. And you base it off anecdotal evidence.
---
It‚Äôs really weird man. There are so many people on both factions. It‚Äôs statistically  improbable that any side is better skill wise than the other. The populations are way too big. It‚Äôs just ridiculous to think so. 
---
I get it. Like when you‚Äôre getting camped all day it‚Äôs frustrating. But nothing about getting camped makes you better at something. 
---
This is like saying everyone who plays Protoss in Starcraft is worse because Protoss is more popular. It‚Äôs just an irrational way of thinking.
---
Not rly. Fastest clears still have 8-10 healers.
---
According to the sheets I've seen, 1% hit is worth around 12 spell power while 1% crit is worth around 9 spell power. You can use those numbers to easily do the math on most of your gearing. The Mage Classic discord will have more precise numbers for you.
---
What is your experience with WoW?  Have you come across any new players while questing?  How are they doing?
---
not on kurinnax, not on grobb, not on most others except stalagg, skeram, streamer quarantine server and herod
---
Is Ban'Thok Sash better than Sash of whispered secrets for raiding?  It feels bad to waste for me to have this beautiful epic just sitting in my inventory for the spell hit.  I have the spell hit necklace as well, and the robes of volatile power.
---
&gt; most servers have a decent balance or have more alliance then horde
---
i don't really give a shit about PVP but you are delusional if you actually think this
---
It's very useful if you charge into a pack and use a sweeping stikes whirlwind opener to maximize procs.
---
My eyes are bleeding lookin at that UI
---
I mean I rolled alliance to be on the underdog faction, and horde being pieces of shit just enhances the appeal lol
---
This is bad advice.
---
What +sp and hp do you have? Can you link to a guide?
---
4-5 days "played" is what I said. Which at the rates I've mentioned is easily possible.
---
If you‚Äôve only heard fren in the context of neo-nazis then I am seriously concerned about your internet browsing habits fren! 
---
Pupperspeak did nothing wrong, middle-state-of-matter the grammar nazis now!
---
Congrats, that's ridiculous!
---
I tanked Strat Live yesterday and we got Krol Blade off the mobs near Unforgiven. Like two blocks away, on the Timmy courtyard, we got Skullflame Shield, on the same run.
---
I won the roll on Krol Blade, and passed on the shield to be fair to the other guys, since everybody was friendly.
---
Wait.. are you.. are you seriously unaware? 
---
Buddy, every horde posts is getting immediately downvoted by butthurt people lmao. People with alliance flares can say the same thing and receive upvotes. 
---
Horde players are too busy playing the game to be on reddit in force apparently.
---
Go back to RuneScape nerd
---
1. Don‚Äôt disregard statistics in pursuit of being correct
---
2. You literally just admitted that you are biased against horde (‚ÄúFor whom I have absolutely no respect or consideration‚Äù) so how do you expect anyone to take your ‚Äúarguments‚Äù seriously
---
3. ‚ÄúNone of it takes place in a controlled way and a lot of it is starting with a conclusion‚Äù and you started this claim with an assumption and disregard for the law of large numbers apparently 
---
4. Hatred is like living with an abuser in your head. Why let Horde live in your head rent-free like that in the first place...
---
you can check server population rations pretty easily. Out of US PvP servers you've got Incendius, Kurinnaxx, Kromkrush, Netherwind, Rattlegore, Smolderweb, Sulfurars , Thunderfury, Whitemane, Grobbolus in US with balanced populations. most are horde leaning to be sure but not significantly. If you seriously expect 50/50 balance youre beyond delusional how tf would blizzard enforce that it would require micromanagement of server populations and cause incredible butthurt across all servers not just 4 in US that have severe imbalance issues (more then 60 percent one faction)
---
The summoning roleplay quotes are the biggest cringe actually, good thing you can disable em.
---
Flare is incredibly stupid in classic. I'm not gonna try say if it's blizzlike or not. But basically the raidus is 50% longer,and also flare sticks on you for like 3-5 seconds after you leave the area. Great game.
---
You can re-roll, or if you don‚Äôt have the time to level and gear again: you can quit. 
---
Allowing people to transfer off will probably lead to even worse faction imbalance.
---
Honestly,my biggest problem with my wari is that i cant realy do anything solo,and until bgs and more raids come out there isnt realy much to do for me. Call me stupid but i expected them releasing the whole classic instead of duing this phasing bullshit,i mean realy who enjoys this? Who likes that you cant do bg-s, and if you want to raid you are fucked until bwl comes out.(raiding 1 and half an hour a week isnt realy enough,and the current content takes that long if you and your guild gives twoo shits about the game)
---
8/8 both bindings within a month yeah man game sure is super fun when everything you want is just given to you like retail, glad I have a reason besides OS gear to raid now
---
Wanted to be an undead rogue so
---
what mod shows cds with timers?
---
He's saying everyone should have the privilege not just him, like? He's saying we all should be allowed to
---
Could not agree more.  I was on two very crowded PvP realms and the experience was not great at all.  I just leveled up on a PvE realm with a medium population, and it has been way better.
---
Totally recommend the switch!
---
It‚Äôll be worse by horde by a fair amount, but it won‚Äôt be *sweet vengeance* bad. Like maybe 2x longer at most.
---
I enjoy classic at the moment too but we also need to think ahead classic will be over by autumn 2020
---
That sounds about great really. I'm not looking for a beast setup. Just one I can run a couple times a week in between work downtimes. 
---
Appreciate the info.
---
Holy crap you're mad! ‚ù§
---
Holy shit this reads like pure copypasta.
---
As I keep repeating, eat my ass nerd.
---
no, it does not. do not listen to the other comments.
---
it *did* on private servers, but not in classic. you can test this yourself by having your voidwalker pull two mobs, and damage one of them. then drain life on the vw's target and you'll see the second target does not pull even though the voidwalker generated no threat against it.
---
In 2006 my battleground had 30+ minute queues, every private server has 30-60 minute queues, and I have not gotten the sense that Classic has radically better faction balance for the queues to become 3 minutes.
---
Hi, /u/bloatedplutocrat

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3psf4/why_is_perception_a_human_trait_when_a_major/). 
---
i feel like im constantly corpse running as horde
---
Even easier if you get a level 60 mage to port you to darnassus.
---
Garr have a soft enrage? oO
---
We just kill the adds first (with max amount banished depending on warlock count of the day)
---
Never took even remotely close to 6min to kill Garr
---
There is literally 1 NA PvP server dominated by allies. 1.
---
It is heartseeker and we all know it exists. It just doesn‚Äôt magically make every other one not horde dominated.
---
Try and think of it this way.  Why would they join the two products?  So it saves the jobs of the game developers on retail.  If retail dies, they are all out of work.  By tagging it to Classic, they preserve their jobs.
---
So.... OMEGALUL... I can't believe you don't understand that!  &gt;.&lt;
---
PvP happened on a PvP server
---
I don't cry over games. That's an Alliance move.
---
30 spell damage for a rogue?
---
And unsurprisingly you are a UD rogue rofl
---
Wut?
---
dont play on one of the 6 servers with severe imbalance. you will never balance servers 50/50, alliance has other advantages to make up fo some small population imbalances of up to 10% which is about the norm for this game.
---
Damn I didnt think youd care so much as to look at my posting history, *then* think I give a shit that you did. Keep up the investigation there bud, you wont come across as angry when proven wrong at all lmaooooo
---
Excuse me for expressing a valid, and reasonable opinion. How about you stop whining about my whining, provide something useful to the conversation, So I can actually argue with you instead of insisting your opinions are wrong. 
---
Which they are.
---
Warriors are not the best class in the game for swooping into a quest spawn, and effortlessly slaughtering dozens of mobs. Or for escaping danger. Or for crowd control. Or for quality of life. Or for repairs.
---
It is almost like your whining about my whining is just whining about whining. Ye whiner.
---
&gt; Why would they join the two products?
---
... because it makes the most money?
---
&gt;So it saves the jobs of the game developers on retail. If retail dies, they are all out of work. By tagging it to Classic, they preserve their jobs.
---
LMFAO
---
I dont think this is accurate. Remember it is way way easier to get honor in BG's than pvp. At the very least horde will stop camping BRM or menethil harbour.
---
Warriors compete with everybody but cloth wearers for good gear. You're a ~~dingus~~ woefully misinformed if you think we have less competition.
---
it's genuine advice, it helps you see what's going on and can be interesting. i genuinely don't know the answer either so this is a quick way to test, and it might be dependent on resets due to using abilities
---
You complain about corpse camping on a server that is 85:15 lol I just gotta remind you how fucking soft you are for crying like a little bitch.
---
Nope it isnt. Preraid bis yes. But you will be running around in almost full plate in no time. If you choose 2 farm rank 13.
---
Warriors compete with everybody but cloth wearers for good gear. Only gloves and belt are near BiS in plate. 
---
Please try again.
---
oh hey that's me the warrior
---
can't wait for bg's to come out
---
You can't get hitcaped till P4 which brings Zul'Gurub so losing hit to higher spellpower item makes sense
---
Those are actually the frames built into healbot.
---
This is why I feel zero sympathy for streamers when they're sniped. The benefits grossly outweigh the cost.
---
I am kind of mad about how a player who wants to play the game and also that pay for it describe his experience like you mention above.I am a horde player and i don't experience this and i wouldnt like to.Im already aware of the issue of imbalance in many servers and really hope that when bgs come out it will give a break for alliance player and let them taste again the game they want to enjoy it.
---
And my hunter solos DM:N, which averages 25+g a run. (Under 20 minutes)
---
Yup. At 48 I hit a brick wall.  
---
Parked my toon at a spot so I can grind whenever I have time to log on (which is not much). Hit 50 just a few minutes ago!
---
i'm interested on how you know they are bot, what give you the hint ( i dont denie they exist, i know many game with same problems, justs curious )
---
Idk man, seems like ~50%  of people are under 25.
---
From the sheer number of ‚ÄúLoL, that‚Äôs how vanilla was‚Äù from people who are completely wrong and obviously didn‚Äôt play vanilla it‚Äôs clear most people posting here didn‚Äôt actually play vanilla, or were little kids who didn‚Äôt know what was going on.
---
I have a suspicion that it's the increasing amount of people using HonorSpy, as it uses its own chat channel to communicate between players constantly.
---
pVp On A pVp SeRvEr...derpppppppp.....more p's....
---
U can tank as fury too; just slap on some tanking gear; all 5 man content is trivial
---
It isn't but thanks for playing
---
I don't feel like clicking links. First world problems eh?
---
Haha this is amazing!
---
Don't forget all the trash that cleaves and AOE's. That's melee friendly too!
---
It doesn't affect your honor, just your blue bar. You lose 100 rank points, so 50 DKs is an entire rank.
---
To put it into perspective, during the final stretch of R14 push (or any other rank push if it is the max rank you can reach) you will get ~1k points per week.
---
lmao!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you say this shit you're literally some other species of ape, not my human (obviously lesser than human goes without saying)
---
Is that Leroy Jenkins in disguise?
---
Dude it‚Äôs not 2004 and this isn‚Äôt happening now.
---
They are all undead.
---
Why not use system-made LFG and Trade channels appropriately? THeres even a GuildRecruitment system chat, that's always empty and silent on retail. Instead all the spam is in the /world and as a result you can't have any sort of conversation in it.
---
&gt; Do you actually know that no one else wants them? Or do they just not want to take a piece for PvP and then be behind for the PvE 1h weapons?
---
Yes. I'm the only one getting two-handers for PvE. Like I said for the simple reason of not clogging the queue for 1H, and so that two-handers are not wasted if they're not wanted. If people want one for PvP that is completely fine and as long as they specifically say it's for PvP they will not get "loot locked" and will still have the chance to roll on their 1 handers.
---
I feel like I would repeat myself a lot by addressing all of your points but the point is this,
---
We are currently starved for 1 handed weapons. We haven't gotten a single Viskag or Brutality blade in 2 months of raiding. There are 5 or 6 people who are waiting. That's 12 weapons. Sure we've been unlucky but even when we're not I don't see us filling all of those any time soon.
---
I took the Eye knowing it'll be worse. But it's a status symbol and now we've currently got one less person we have to worry about gearing up. Someone was gonna have to get the Hand either way, might as well be me. It's not all about min-maxing for us.
---
Everytime I check r/classicwow I see 1-2 posts about Heartseeker being such a bad server for Horde &amp; 1-2 posts about Alliance getting farmed by the Horde
---
Kinda strange considering there is only 1 alliance server which farms the horde and like 10 horde servers which farm the alliance.10 Horde Servers which farm the ally?
---
It has nothing to do with one being better or worse than the other, get that shit out of here.
---
There‚Äôs literally nothing for them to use to promote classic. No cosmetics, no expansions, no paid services, none of that. If they had any of that, there‚Äôs be some sort of deals offered, don‚Äôt doubt that.
---
A lot, because of streamers and easily trollable PvP.
---
Im a new player which started playing 2 month ago now 1 month ago I hit 60 and have 7 epic items. If a new player wants to play this game he will and will not quit asap because he getting camped
---
XD
---
Maybe the problem is the super lazy design of the "honor" system.  Its like they called Palladium:Rifts.
---
Yea I bet they are running with more than that.
---
Yeah but some of these "oppressed" faction guilds take it too far.
---
Horde outnumbers Alliance on Herod nearly 2 to 1.  Was doing DM West with a guildie and some randoms.  Some weren't level 60, only two of us even had honor titles.  So we were dogshit honor kills.
---
Still didn't stop about 15 alliance from corpsecamping us to the point they recieved zero honor from it.  And then about a dozen more times.
---
When we finally got past them, they split up to camp the enterances to DM E and W (as we'd already corpsewalked past DM S), and killed us twice more before we were able to rez on the insides of the doors and run in.
---
In all, they killed us 17, maybe 18 times each.  The only got honor the first 4 times.
---
Sorcerous Dagger + AV offhand is comparable to Staff of Dominance for raid dps.
---
And people say the Sorc Dagger is bad, but the staff is really good somehow?
---
How is having kt best 2 h mace bigger chance than mc drop
---
Well,  I friend them.  Every time I‚Äôm on, they are on.  Sometimes I set my alarm for 3am, 4am,  some nights to get up and check AH.  They are still online every time all the time.  On work days I get up at 5:30am.  They are still online.  Constant literally 24/7.  They are never offline.  Same position, nothing has changed.  Still buying auctions.  And their character never goes AFK.
---
The best at what? You make a general statement like that and there's nothing to argue. 
---
The best DPS? Damn straight, it comes with the downside of producing more threat than any other class in the game. What? You didn't know that any ranged damage dealer has a base 30% less threat per point of damage than a warrior? 
---
That's just one example. Make a statement thats specific enough to talk about and maybe you won't sound like a whiner whining about a whiner whining about your own whining.
---
Similar related question. The current 15th bday AV on retail is the same as it will be in classic?
---
This has nothing to do with DR

Good thing priests have one button that completely defeats it, and good thing you can two shot mages.

Awww they broke you :( I heard guild wars 2 has a loving userbase
---
buh dum tsssssss
---
You mean that sheep that's doing circles behind me? The one called "HEalbotto!"
---
I agree that would be a reasonable way to split it, but as far as I know they haven't mentioned anything about battle groups or splitting servers right?
---
I mained a mage for 3 xpacks.
---
I play a warrior now.
---
You have nothing to bitch about.  It like playing Rock Paper Scissors and complaining about Paper.
---
QQ harder baby.
---
Totally agree on shadow weave--vendored all those hard earned quest rewards and SM drops and it cost me a lot of Sta/int but made my drains and lifetaps more efficient so soloing was overall more sustainable.
---
Re: instance trash mobs, I'd roll with rogues and warriors and noticed that my dots were getting 1-2 ticks and then the mob would be dead. For CoA, those are very weak ticks up front. Eventually switched to corruption on multiple targets to tick away at them all and multiply my Nightfall chances, and then shadowbolt spam the focus targets, switching to searing pain when it looks like I might not get another SB.
---
Honestly why tf are you this shitty towards players who got screwed by Blizzards content release decisions. I haven‚Äôt been affected at all, I rolled PvE, but leveling alliance PvP players haven‚Äôt been able to play the game for weeks. That‚Äôs so unfair and shitty, they should be able to transfer to PvE if they want, and Blizzard should have released BG‚Äôs at the beginning of Phase 2.
---
Yeah cause i had acces to runecloth while leveling at launch wtf
---
As a rogue, I can tell you it won't work.  Pretty sure our stealth works better than the potion.  They where the engineering stealth detection Googles.  Makes it to where stealth detection is like you're 4 levels higher (I think) when you're actually the same level.  So pretty damn far.
---
I'll just get into BRD a half hour before the rest of my group mates that don't have invisibility.
---
I mean, ok. 
---
If you plan on zerging, I guess - but you‚Äôll probably get rolled by greys you try to gank.
---
But yeah, rolling on a hyper majority faction on a PvP server because it‚Äôs the only way you have a chance to win a fight is a very Trash Player thing to do. It‚Äôs why this is all a thing. 
---
Because people otherwise should be on PvE servers realized they can roll Horde and basically have PvE with optional, no skill ganking.
---
But by all means, further prove the stereotype to be more obviously true, lol.
---
They know there's a problem they're not going to discuss it with you. Like, do you expect each and every CS person to effectively talk about the same problem thousands of times?
---
All the same class or different ones?
---
Tanks need 2 taunt simple as. If they dont or wont gkick make a fury war tank mc
---
Ohhgee is another private server player,... just saying.

those have been inaccurate for months

I sometimes browse reddit while I‚Äôm outside, thank you

What‚Äôs the bug ?
---
Can somebody explain what happened?
---
He sounds exactly how I imagined a wow multiboxer would sound
---
Also that one point into Dark Pact will let you keep an Imp out in phase shift, granting Blood Pact and a second, quickly-recharging Mana bar for you to tap into. Will often let you Mana up between packs while running and without having to stop to drink.
---
Thank you
---
I love you u/AnimalFactsBot &lt;3

convenient for you lol

By any chance is it an RP server?  Not trying to be lazy, just on mobile and am limited

But its easier to gear as a war. Just tank the dungeon.

I dont think it sims better. You can make the argument that its better than Felheart Belt

You said my name! Would you like to know more about me? I am written in Python. I am running from a computer in Seattle. I have given an animal fact to redditors 45434 times!
---
Dude no way don‚Äôt do it. Retail is dead as fuck. And no, I‚Äôm not some WoW fanboy. 
---
It‚Äôs just objectively a dead game. I assume you are looking for an mmorpg, and you would be getting an rpg. 
---
Sub numbers have shat for years for a reason, I would definitely listen to the criticisms of the games before WoW Classic was even announced.
---
It‚Äôs just a bad idea to drop $90 on a dead ass not very good game. 
---
Opinionated, sure. But I‚Äôm also informed
---
OP salty tears comes looking for an echo chamber to cry into.  
---
Are we really having class balance arguments in here?  That shit stopped in like 2007 I thought.
---
Nope. It's like complaining about Dynamite. 
---
Also QQ is insanely offensive and I'm reporting you.
---
No. We get the nerfed version sadly. Not the one that could last from reset to reset.
---
Ah yes, all those Rank 1 PVPers who went Horde for classic are weak players... LMAO
---
Real constructive and snobbish cool story bro bleed out in the bathtub
---
thats all the ally that transfered off of skeram and ruined the server and now they are stuck on a 90-10 server. gj
---
bleed out in the bathtub
---
I feel for ya guys. 
---
Need to have an honor, xp and gold penalty for every point over 55% for the majority faction and open up transfers so people smooth out.
---
You brave fucks, you‚Äôre the real Horde. The rest are The Herd.
---
i have 1 word for you my friend. FAP
---
Not quite this bad on all of them. But a lot, maybe even most.
---
Lol. This is why I've been raid logging for over a month.
---
It's so fucking bad on stalagg if your alliance
---
Boomkin over retribution? Not at all...
---
more facts

Regular Horde Dominated PvP Server
---
Honor gains aren't always added the next day and honor gains at specific times late at night aren't added at all for several people.
---
amazing idea, if you disagree you're on a server with pvp advantage therefore should bleed out in the bathtub
---
All the information you need is condensed into their FAQ. If you need somebody to spoon-feed you then it's at your own risk of being called a dyslexic mouth breather.
---
None of us say that.
---
Just because we don‚Äôt include a * for your feewings every time we refer to the super majority faction, which in literally every other instance on NA servers is horde and just say ‚Äúhorde‚Äù because it is true in *every single other instance* doesn‚Äôt mean we mean Heartseeker horde for fucks sake and *you know it*.
---
Hahaha, yeah, players back then weren't serious; they only wiped to the same end-raid boss almost daily for months on end! 
---
Also, I'm paraphrasing you here but "it's not about stupidity, but they weren't able to 'figure out' that they should not use fiery weapon"? Yeah, calling people out for not being able to "figure things out" is tantamount to calling them stupid. My comment is not a strawman. (Sorry that you weren't able to figure that out.)
---
I realize it's probably difficult for someone as myopic as yourself (which is why I'm sure you would have been utter dogshit had you played in Vanilla) to try and even imagine playing in a near blank meta without the ubiquity of encyclopedic knowledge that gamers have today, but it wasn't always like this. Back then there was far less time and there were far fewer resources available, both in game (gold) and in real life (mental attention) to have things like enchants minmaxed months into the game's released. There weren't billions of YouTube videos on how to farm 80g/hr in Dire Maul. People were still learning about talents, trying to develop new addons, thinking about gear and how much fire res to use on top of constant fire pot farming for hundreds of wipes.
---
Get the fuck out and never come back.

ThEn wHy dId yOu RoLE oN A pvP seRVEr?

Give me a break with this bull shit. There were gankers in vanilla. There wasn't 24/7 fuckheads griefing every part of the opposite faction's zones. Every cock waffle saying "this is how vanilla was" is full of shit.
---
dont play at degen hours dip shit you know what is going to happen
---
I clearly remember complaining about legions of night elves who thought they were Legolas in vanilla, so this definitely checks out.
---
Thank you. God I don't think I could stomach that, maybe if I decide to roll a warrior tank.
---
It‚Äôs a rarely useful spell and more of a Hail Mary. I was faced with a 1v1 against a raid geared mage in BRM and pulled a quick silence to mind control to get him to jump off the cliff and not kill me
---
Yeah idk where Reddit got this idea that all the Alliance PVP Gods are secretly hiding on PVE servers waiting to reek havoc when BGs come out, when pretty much every top alliance PVPers i know or can think of from both retail and pservers are on PVP servers.
---
Literally none of this is true.
---
Why you gotta lie?
---
Tried googling it but couldn't find a source on it, just a confirmation it's cross realm but no mention of battlegroups. They didn't say there wouldn't be battle groups though, so could go either way.
---
as alliance no not so much
---
The thing about SGC, for shamans at least, is that its bis up until Naxx. So imma be there for a while lmao
---
Just because your guild tops out at 300 DPS doesn't mean that everyone's does. 8/8 Might is hot fucking garbage.
---
40000 copper ofc.
---
they really need to fix this, we aren't here to listen to your advice on oh just wait or oh idc, just dont post friends. this is just a good idea blizz needs to get off their ass. if you rly disagree with these sentiments, bleed out in your bathtub and save us all
---
What does batching have to do with crit

My favourite is using distract on a raid and watching them scatter looking for me

Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?

That‚Äôs awesome! Can I know more?

I sincerely hope you‚Äôre 12 because someone who thinks ‚Äúclassic does not need game developers‚Äù should not be in a position of authority over anyone, including themselves

So i rolled warlock after i decided to start playing on NA servers (I'm from the UK but recently moved to canada) and since i have recently come back i'm wondering if the following still hold true as they were contingent for my choice of class.
---
are warlocks still sought after? as far as i knew warlocks were in decently short supply, at least on alliance. I'm wondering where the class competition is now in general although i understand YMMV here.
---
is the mage population still insane? my first choice was mage but since i'm behind the first wave of players now the competition started to get rough when i had to duck out for immigration.
---
are warlocks still as good in PvP as they were believed to be? i understand them to be as good/better than mages even if they're not as versatile and widely used. warlocks seemed a little more like mages that scaled slower and had different niches that they were uniquely powerful in which seemed like a great choice.
---
Hope this makes any sense, much gratitude for any answers from a highly passionate WoW fan.
---
Funny you bring up the Division's dark zone. WoW inspired me to build twinks in that game so I could have an amazing time in the dark zone.
---
according to population websites like https://ironforge.pro/ its not even the most populated US realm. the queues are only bad at night really
---
Obviously, seems legit, thx
---
If it makes you feel any better i play on a MacBook Pro üòÇ
---
Dude you have a 5:1 advantage. Fuck off.
---
I'm not sure why I can't understand being a new player. We all were new players at one point. Your being a weird gatekeeper about who's input matters.
---
Must be the worst UI I‚Äôve seen yet. Absolute eyerape
---
Please just stop. Many people play both and should be allowed to do so since, ya know, we bought the game originally.
---
nope not at all
---
How in the world is that a "no u"?
---
Dude literally said all his 12 yo friends.
---
Are you replying to the wrong comment? God damn Alliance are so butthurt that it's impacting their reading comprehension.
---
Bring me more salt.
---
YEW
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Depending on the species, adult gazelles range in weight from 26 pounds to 165 pounds.
---
Ok boomer you obviously never played Vanilla
---
Yeah, also cause they can turn it into content if correctly reacted to. More $$$
---
"Orange Druid needs food, Badly."
---
You're so wrong it's actually amazing. You don't even understand how threat works so there's no point in even trying to explain it to you.
---
Crit is incredibly important for Tanks, even moreso important for Fury Prot. The damage you get from Shield Slam is a huge chunk of the threat you're getting from it.
---
you are lying not me I can back up my facts easily bro lol
---
Likely story!!
---
I‚Äôve leveled from 1-38 over the past month. BFD was the hardest dungeon to find a group for.
---
In retail I have played every single class and in random BGs im always 3 or 4x the damage of the second place person with like 30 kills 0 deaths.  I have been 2350 in arena.  Is classic just not the same level of skill dependency? like the cooldowns are too high or something?  Is it possible with a combat rogue and ghostly strike and having high dodge and a pocket healer I could just run around aggressively teamfighting with blade furry up and doing huge damage?  I know most classic rogues are using daggers and oneshotting people but I'm trying to stay in the mix and do huge teamfight damage. I know warrior works... but I just dont want to be a class thats horrible at solo pvp, competitive for gearing, and as someone with little time to raid relies way to heavily on epic raid 2 handers.
---
Leveling an alt right now and yes, even on a med-pop PvE realm, leveling zones are still populated.
---
Fuck multiboxers, good on that mage
---
omg... it is literally the worst UI ever.
---
Easy with the toxic masculinity there, homie. Gatekeeping ass /r/iamverybadass over here. Can't even hold your own cities. Pathetic.
---
lol
---
To me it feels much more alliance heavy, or at least that horde get the most hate .. classic they are the new xxxxlegolessxxxx faction that alliance was in vanilla. Could just be me though. Or it could just be the date of pvp so we are seeing a trend.
---
more salt than the dead sea
---
Nah spell dmg for alt casties 
---
It can last until 60 so it can be a nice investment
---
They‚Äôve become sentient.
---
What don't I understand? Is Warrior threat not additive?
---
Lol, everytime I do this shit there are so many allies around.
---
Looks like the Herod I know and love
---
1. Subscription to one service gift subscription to another, it means players can enjoy both games, and well, use wow tokens to sub to Wow Classic while playing retail
---
2. I would assume at LEAST 10% of the player base is playing both version of the game, as we can look in to streams
---
3. Making subscription between classic and retail would not make people less overpopulated, it would only force people to chose to pay more in often cases
---
* **Will not fix overpopulated problem**
---
* **Will not fix "New comers safe place" problem**
---
* **Will most likely kill retail or classic for a % of the population**
---
* **Would go against 99% of consumers budgets.**
---
so let me downvote the guy who want to pay 30$ a month ...
---
Funny, I'm on Herod and I just tried to go to two separate places to farm and the entire zone was controlled by groups  rotating on all the farm areas, uncontested and killing low levels and farmers alike.  I then hearthed out and got a port back to my main city, where 4 rogues were camping the mage portal area and cc locking + killing people.  I then flew out to what you'd consider a low traffic area to do some sub-optimal farming, and there were several bodies dead at the flight master because people were camping in stealth there too.  This isn't unusual at all, and before I go out I typically try and muster together a group just to keep safe even though splitting a farm area between \~5 people is much slower.
---
Yet, I'm on the opposite faction as you, and it's claimed that the balance is lopsided and there's an uneven PvP scene.  I realize this subreddit is majority one faction but you guys really need to get outside of your bubble that everything is bad for you only.  Especially when you're on a server where your faction has a ton of avid PvPers that go hard spamming consumables and are constantly fighting and claiming control of entire areas.  They don't deserve to be lumped into this victim status that you so wholly embrace.  You have more than enough fighters to join and actively PvP with, stop coming here to get fake sympathy.

Idk man fully complete atlas seemed like it took about as long as 1-60 but I might just suck.
---
I stopped reading after the first line. You like ganking but Hate getting ganked.
---
stop thinking the tards on this sub actually represent the playerbase
---
Hey man, you have balls of steel for making that Xfer.
---
Literally the only people pretending this isn‚Äôt an issue are shit players and cowards who rolled the dominant faction to have a massive handicap.
---
If they balanced factions they would lose their mind getting 3v5‚Äôd by people who actually had to learn to los and use their crowd control. And they know it
---
I seriously doubt PvE realms will do nearly as many BGs as PvP realms.
---
People who roll on PvP realms tend to be more hardcore(meaning more playtime) and like PvP more. Almost all the hardcore guilds are on PvP servers.
---
Nahh most servers aren't decently balanced. But at least they have enough of the other faction to still enable finding PvE groups as well as PvP groups, even if farming spots and getting to raids is vastly harder.
---
You know attacking me doesn‚Äôt validate anything you‚Äôve said right? Why are you even talking about reading comprehension when you were whining about Horde thinking that AV was alliance favored. How about stop trying to deflect and stay on topic? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm pointing out how ridiculous and angry you look over a video game and you start pointing out grammar mistakes. 
---
Let me guess, the whole thing from the start was about protecting your fragile ego. Like why else would you write pages of angry words about ‚Äúohh horde can‚Äôt handle disadvantages.‚Äù And then you write an entire additional page (which is FULL of assumptions btw), to berate me for misreading your angry words when in fact it does nothing to address my point that you‚Äôre massively biased and willing to ignore data and statistics. It‚Äôs almost as if you can‚Äôt handle getting your bullshit called out aka you‚Äôre literally behaving like a child with ADHD.
---
Multiboxers are at a major disadvantage against mages thanks to them being clumped up
---
I would honestly prefer hours long queues.
---
I don't like BGs that much. If I could focus on world PvP for ranking I would be happier.
---
go get your own herbs
---
You know this is a joke post making fun of the other one, right?
---
Lol the Faerlina chat server is fucked regularly during prime hours.
---
Imagine playing a hunter and actually using your brain. This is next level.
---
Ret Pallies aren't that common.

Everyone knows they are trash now.

bro have you been to Winterspring a guild mate of mine killed 10 different bots one morning he loved the honor from its still ridiculous

I really like that disc priest that shields you up :)

The only well balanced server in the USA is Grobbolus.

You fox eared asshole
---
Step 1 - Reroll. Step 2 - Profit. 
---
The game has only been out for 4 months, remember that.
---
You shot me?!
---
It's not 60/40. Look at world of logs. It's still 80/20.
---
His entire Twitch and even YouTube are built around Asmongold and his guild.
---
Tons of his titles for streams would be specifically targeting him, as well.
---
pretty damn good but not as cost effective as say, +30 spell damage. Even with the proc as a warrior you need to be changing your weapon out more often to stay relevant. The weapon damage will matter more  than the proc. Maybe enchant your WW axe at 30 with it and then executioner cleaver after that, since you could theoretically use those 2 from 30-60
---
I got Parkinson‚Äôs so jokes on you
---
I was on one of the paladin discords talking about HoR when I learned about the slam macro. Went to fight club, searched for "slam macro" and found my answer in less than 5 minutes as well as an explanation. 
---
I can see why people would be mad over asking dumb shit about the same shit when it's been answered and easily searched. I only wanted to share it with our warriors so I put in the slam macro and a brief explanation of when you want to use it and that it's much better on horde for WF. 
---
I ask dumb shit on the paladin discord but it's much smaller and once I understand it better I can contribute to theory crafting too.
---
I envy your decision to go pve, PvP you can't even quest rn it's such a war zone.
---
In the exact same boat, and honestly that extra hit percent feels noticeable. I use the epic for dungeons and PvP tho
---
I think spending 12 hours a day to farm honor while receiving no enjoyment is exactly why every fp is camped by the dominant faction.
---
You can't seriously complain that others are just playing to win when you're also a fellow robot playing for a number.
---
Seriously, I‚Äôve had a huge project come up at work literally the same week classic launched. My main is almost 23...
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Puffer fish toxin is found in only certain parts of the fish. Specially trained chefs cut away the edible flesh and serve it as a dangerous delicacy.
---
They could just put in faction queues on Hearthseeker and Skeram and only allow horde to transfer to Hearthseeker and Alliance to transfer to Skeram.
---
me too.
---
&gt;long as 1-60 
---
1-60 is just a part of the Classic WoW journey. You have gear farming, raids, gold farming, alt leveling, and pvp grinding which can all add thousands of hours to your /played. A huge part of WoW is that your journey doesn't just reset.
---
Mages are shit in TBC, completely replaces by warlocks.
---
It's caused by the honorspy addon sending hundreds to thousands of messages a second through the chat servers. That's not an exaggeration either, it's actually that many.
---
Did you make that judgment off a few speed run videos?
---
Outside of that, it isn't worth the time or money to buff that much. Druid heals are fine.
---
I‚Äôve been finding more success in the massive waves in tarren mill fishing for conflagration+Shadowburn kills on over extended mages. I was trying to use ruin but it just didn‚Äôt get the tags fast enough.
---
"You spent more time than me accomplishing something that I didn't, so I'm glad that several hours of your life were literally wasted. I don't blame the system that encourages this type of play, I blame the people that are forced to play this way to get a competitive edge."
---
Yeah okay.
---
This is basically how I remember it too. Pretty much as far back as I can remember blizzard will basically ban bots in waves.
---
For sure worth it. The weapon skill gives you over 3% hit straight up, and the damage increase from higher weapon skill will outweigh the loss of crit. Higher weapon skill improves your offhand damage by a boatload (less damage lost to glancing blows, less misses overall)
---
Fly to ratchet first and you‚Äôll unflag if I remember vanilla correctly. If not TB will work.
---
agi, need to boost your crit rating since there is less % crit gear available at that bracket
---
I'm on Herod horde and I enjoy killing all alliance I see.  Hopefully I am one of the reasons you alliance bitches are quitting. 
---
All you do is fucking cry! Lol
---
Am I locked out of MC until Tuesday? I‚Äôve been looking over the instance save scenarios but can‚Äôt determine where this would fall. 
---
I was in a pug mc run tonight and my internet went out while clearing the first few trash packs. Since I dc‚Äôd i wasn‚Äôt able to drop group, and I‚Äôm sure the group went on to down at least a few bosses.
---
How was warrior? I‚Äôm thinkin that‚Äôs next after mage bc mage should take almost no time
---
&gt;I bet you think if you were born 100 years ago you could beat up Joe Louis, lmao.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;People like you crack me up. You act like people 15 years ago had an average IQ of 75. I would love to see you play without YouTube and Twitch force feeding you information. 
---
this is strawmanning
---
&gt; they only wiped to the same end-raid boss almost daily for months   
---
&gt; Back then there was far less time 
---
contradiction, also like i said it's not a matter of time to realise weapon damage would be more useful than fiery for ragnaros
---
&gt; calling people out for not being able to "figure things out" is tantamount to calling them stupid 
---
you didn't read my comment. i said "rogue with fiery enchant probably just thought they looked cool and valued coolness over optimisation", implying he knew about weapon damage enchants but wanted fiery because they looked cool making him less serious than top players today
---
in conclusion, you're an ape with poor reading comprehension
---
When transfers came out that server died instantly
---
8/8 T1 for hunter is super strong in pvp. It makes 30/21 marks/survival a crazy strong spec, because your multishots will hit super strong. Might be the highest potential burst you can output (aimed shot, auto, multi, auto)
---
Unironically it is useful though.  If you get in a big pvp battle with some horde and both sides lose people, you get back and get to drink and heal up a bit before they can.  Gives you an edge on round 2.
---
When they have a super majority, 100%. 
---
But some people rolled super majority for the ez mode, and some people when on ez mode, act differently.
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs not whether you prefer mud huts or castles that causes anything.
---
Thanks! I have custom raid frames that also track the incoming heals + mouseover macros set up, but I know a lot will just be feeling it out the first couple times.
---
Basically you want to always let an auto attack off first before aimshotting. You will lose a lot of damage by clipping your auto shots
---
CHT to a warrior over a rogue is probably the funniest shit I've heard all day.
---
Thanks.
---
You do you bro, I was talking to mr‚Äúwarriors have it so hard‚Äù while also reserving half the drop tables just to tank a dung
---
Pretty sure the guy that raid logs and sits in org is playing more PvE than I am. My standing is shit (830ish). All of my honour is from going out to where the horde are and fighting them there. There are multiple guilds on horde that control menethil boat for 20-30 minute intervals until 20 alliance show up to take it back. I play a fucking holy paladin and I go out of my way to make PvP fun by going to Org to raid them and sit at the gates.
---
But yea, it must be nerd gamer ego that rogues in org are not a huge deal. We're not #occupyingorg or some dumb shit, this is literally a few rogues doing what rogues have done in multiple expansions on pvp servers. OP is being obtuse and whining for no reason.
---
Waiting for anwsers.
---
You‚Äôre the man, thanks!
---
wtf is wrong with you?
---
Open your Social window by pressing O, click the Raid tab, and check if you have a Raid ID.
---
Haven‚Äôt had any issues as a feral. I simply back out and move in just like the rest of the melee. 
---
DBM timers are little off you need to actually watch for the WoR animation. It‚Äôs super simple
---
Everytime they ban bots. A new key has to be produced and that is what's making them money. Think of it as this, when they do a ban wave a possibility of 250k is generated in profits for diablo 2.  Because they all have to repurchase a CD key in order to play online. Let's say they do ban in quarters every 4 months. Every fiscal year blizzard is making a million dollars just by having botters repurchase cd for diablo 2. Now take in consideration how many bots are in WoW compared to diablo 2.
---
Reddit is a safespace for dadgamers, how dare you
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Although they are common in South America today, peccaries did not reach that continent until about three million years ago during the Great American Interchange, when the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting North America and South America.
---
I could solo a decently geared 60 at 50 as long as I didn‚Äôt get too many resists.
---
I don‚Äôt initiate PvP against warriors even 1 level lower than me. Like, I get hard counters, but it‚Äôs honestly a little too hard.
---
Level engineering 100% as a warrior. It might not be able to save you, but being able to grenade stun a partial bandage and ice reflector can catch us off guard.
---
Also, carry major health pots, they‚Äôre cheap, and use them. If Coldsnap is on cooldown and Iceblock, it can turn the tide.
---
I rolled mage first so I could make money/chase off gankers on my tank.
---
Look up fakeqt, 920+ lotus
---
Mage vs Pvp = Ferrari vs a Fiat race.
---
if you have one role (DPS) and you gear cant even help you do it... how is that not as bad as hybrids? hybrids can use their tier for at least one of their specs maybe it isnt their preferred sure but they can. mages cant even use their tier for the one role they do have
---
I was wondering about this same thing myself. There‚Äôs at least 50-100 lv 60‚Äôs in IF 24/7 while the horde raid wetlands, redridge, ect. 
---
Is that what end game is? Hanging out in cities with thumbs places in asses?
---
Thats why I Love being a hunter. Viper sting The healer until he is oom, and 100% dps on him, try to cc the warrior/rogue and its gg 2v2
---
An hpal who prios mp5 over +heal? Fucking yikes, would love to see those parses lol
---
Weird because mine uses parsings from Warcraftlogs to determine amount of players who were online in the past 14 days. 
---
This is a pretty hefty difference.
---
Pagle is mostly alliance and I've yet to have issues grouping on low lvl horde alts
---
Yep, I'm waiting for after AV release to farm it. Wish I didn't sell all mine
---
lol at getting downvotes for this. classic is doomed
---
I'm telling you, there is a place to stand where they will not.
---
Turtle island in Tanaris you say?
---
60's who dont raid, and guilds that don't log. I just looked up 3 guilds quickly on WCL I know on HS, but none of them log, and their players aren't available either. That should add towards the alliance # more than horde since pop is already alliance heavy, but I'm sure there are horde players who don't raid or log either.
---
Bro calm down it‚Äôs just a game
---
You only tryhard with all the warriors in one raid when you're going for speed clear records. Normally those warriors are spread across 3 or 4 raids to get gear.
---
That‚Äôs hilarious, I‚Äôm going to try this on my warlock
---
seems formatted differently than I am used to (as a table, and with simple numbers for time left)
---
&gt; i have never heard the word "fren" in association with nazis
---
&gt;That's a lie
---
...how would you know?
---
Yes, the frenworld used it as one of their catchphrases, but it's not like everyone knows what happened there. And yes, fren was a meme before they started using it. It's pretty common in "pupper speak", or at least it used to be. 
---
That said, it's good to be aware of dogwhistles. This isn't necessarily that, but it could be.
---
Is elixir of the Mongoose a popular potion? (+ agility and 2% crit)
---
lmao if 51/49 is your definition of acceptable balance of course most servers are not gonna fit but that actually proves my point there's clearly only a few there with severe imbalance issues
---
Found the guy who didn‚Äôt actually play vanilla.
---
There were no 80/20 imbalances in vanilla. 60/40 was extreme and most were ~55/45 in favor of alliance.
---
Capital ganking def happened, I did of all the time on my UD Rogue, but no, never anything like this or even close. I think once 2 other rogues we‚Äôre doing it at the same time.
---
they are, only a handfull are 60% or more one faction
---
Kargath is a blood bath for Horde lol
---
I guess its better than the pocket healed warrior compilations, but yeah...
---
&gt; That‚Äôs hilarious, I‚Äôm going to try this on my warlock
---
Works even on a PvE server :D
---
This isn't a good idea because having wow tokens apply to wow classic as well leaves at least some reason to play retail. On my server I need 177,000 gold to buy a wow token, and I have a 120 character, so I'm guessing I can do some high level gold grinds to get that gold in a few days.
---
There isn‚Äôt any even pvp servers, unless you mean grobbulus
---
Tell your pocket healer to heal the warrior and you disrupt in teamfights with sap cs blind kidney etc
---
Nah, you should expect capital ganking. I did it fairly regularly in vanilla as horde. But it wasn‚Äôt super common, let alone an masse.
---
This isn‚Äôt like vanilla. People should have expected it to happen, but it shouldn‚Äôt have happened like this.
---
It was definitely the most fun. I was also bankrolling gear really hard and it was before pvp so groups we‚Äôre easy to find.
---
Couldn't make a thing out of that picture with a telescope my man.
---
I‚Äôve opted to hide  my hide of the wild when I‚Äôm pvping so it‚Äôs less obvious I am a healer
---
Spy? yeah no that's not vanilla
---
&gt;It's intended to be a place for theorycrafting discussion and advancing our knowledge of the game.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Lately, its been flooded by a bunch of noobies who ask very basic questions 24/7. Having to answer the same questions over and over again is drowning out the interesting discussions people used to have there, and they are becoming jaded about it.
---
Man, they talk up a big game in their faqs but in reality its nothing but basic questions posted by the very same rude "old guard" edgelords that OP is complaining about.
---
Theres a handful of tryhard theorycrafters who are really into it and know what theyre talking about surrounded by mouthbreathing orbiters that regurgitate the knowledge theyve been spoonfed and use it stroke their own ego.
---
No one has mentioned winterspring furbolg camps.  Between firewaters, jujus, cloths, silver, and random greys/greens it seems to be decent (and pretty easy).
---
Farm the fire elementals in the middle of ungoro
---
When you‚Äôre 20% of the server it‚Äôs only 20% as likely for it to even happen. It‚Äôs way less likely for multiple to do it. And it‚Äôs about 5x easier to find and chase them out.
---
This isn‚Äôt hard to understand.
---
Sounds like a personal choice problem
---
40:60 is already a severe balance issue. Because it means one population has double the number. So for example, for every single alliance there are two horde players.
---
Horde fishing for likes
---
The fact there is a que is proof it's one of the worst. That site run on raid logs and a bad census addon. Good luck getting anything accurate
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone knows your point, it was just nonsense.
---
I make 30-40g/hr half assing SM spam, not including fees for lowbie groups whispering for carries. That‚Äôs usually another 1g/person per run.
---
What a great classic experience. The guards are paid off.
---
Could be ally on heartseeker, they can get right fucked too.
---
At the risk explaining the joke, op with the *me and my 12 year old friends* joke was making fun of you. And you responded with a sincere *why you got 12 year old friends?* which 2nd commenter interpreted as 'no u.'
---
I don't have a horse in this race. Just laying it out for you.
---
sure, easy way to kill Classic really quickly, lets do it
---
say you have 8 melee.  only 3 will get kicked.  so letting the 2 rogues get kicked allows 6 other dps to continue to dps rather than all 8 back out for a bit and do nothing seems really good.
---
There are actually a few even PvP servers but my 2 are Herod and Grob
---
On my end, I have an auto-queue to load up my engineering helmet when it is ready, but there's a few things I dislike about it.
---
When you swap to Eng Helm, it takes 30 seconds to be valid, so I would actually prefer to swap it 30 seconds before it is ready so there is 0 down-time.
---
Secondly, once and a while, I want to put at max priority Cats Eye goggles, say if a stealthie is nearby. How can I do that while making sure the auto-queue doesn't override. The "delay" feature on queue doesn't seem to work for me... I'm just not sure how to do it but I'm sure there is a way to over-ride. Ideally I could do that with a macro.
---
He didn't stream snipe and there's literally no proof that he ever did.
---
And you get all orbs in strat
---
If you're gonna be playing thousands of hours on it, you want out to be something you like.
---
On younger servers with less severe imbalances, yes. New players and alts.
---
Try benediction for alliance or Ashbrinfer for Horde.
---
Just don‚Äôt be a cunt and pick a faction/server with an 80:20 imbalance. It‚Äôs lame for everyone and you can only lie to yourself about not sucking at PvP for so long
---
&gt; I'm not gonna try say if it's blizzlike or not.
---
Its Blizzard that makes the game so ya its 100%Blizzlike its Blizzard. These aren't jank pirate servers with broken mechanics.
---
thinking alliance will quit en masse because of imbalance on 5 servers is beyond delusional and salty lol Imma go gank some more defenseless alliance in your honour tho
---
Really?!? Ohhhh that‚Äôs interesting. Ok that helps so much thanks dude
---
Did you ever get this resolved? I am wondering the same thing. The chicken isn't doing anything.
---
Lol y‚Äôall are silly. This stuff happens on both sides... uh x side only attacks if they out number is... x side is full of children... x side is camping brd. It‚Äôs a game people
---
Ashbringer is within the 55:45 split people consider fair. When pvp came out, an alliance group managed to kill UC lord. I think we had one raid on stormwind. Control of BRM and Searing Gorge flows back and forth.
---
But any time pvpers show up in the capital they get hunted down.
---
According to honor spy Hordes pool last week was ~2600 to Ally's ~3700 on Heartseeker. Pretty sure there was 8? bracket 1s for Horde. Its honestly not bad.
---
you need to redo grade 1 math bro lol
---
Unfortunately this is still a Special Characters-English translator. I really want an Orcish-English or Common-English translator.
---
Pvp happened on a pvp server bro :)
---
&gt; Alliance own the server
---
uhhh, we were literally camping the buildings next to the flight path in ironforge the other day, you sure you aren't thinking of heartseeker?
---
CoRPSe RuNS arE PlaYINg!
---
unironically this
---
also unironically I think the lack of alliance on stalagg and increase in raid-logging ally has driven away some of the horde. i spent half the day solo farming (resources) in azshara and averaged maybe 2-3 pvp encounters per hour. it's actually going to kill both servers.
---
"PvP is so unfair so I'll call flight paths"
---
Um, that's not how that works.
---
More like, "my flight paths keeps getting ganked, PvP is so unfair"
---
That's definitely better.
---
Another reason that Horde is overpowered I guess?
---
Glad I didn't choose the faction that has everything handed to them.
---
&gt; Asmongold calls people r*tards and c*ck-suckers nearly once every 5 minutes. Is it not TOS to attack people with mental disabilities and shame gay men?
---
God you're a little bitch.
---
Of allies rolling off the big imbalanced servers on the lesser imbalanced servers too.
---
Why is that?
---
pVp hApPeNeD oN a PvP sErVeR
---
Ah, so youre one of those death party ganker. 5 ppl ganking 1 solo person whos grinding takes so much skills. Do you also run away in 1v1?
---
Are you scared you will have to play fair games in battlegrounds?
---
There will still be some world pvp, but it will be solo grinder encountering another solo grinder who are gonna fight for territory, and it will be great that way. Maybe 2v2s sometimes.. 1v2 at worst.
---
Right now its impossible to play solo in certain situations/areas, honor without bgs on those huge servers with everyone so good at the game and organized+ streamers was a terrible terrible idea. It worked in 2004-2005, on the small servers, but in 2019, no way.
---
The best world pvp, imo, is 1v1 series.. you grow rivalries with certain players who have same farming tendencies as you, and its amazing.
---
When its groups ganking, I just take my hands of my key board, die, log off, go play another game.
---
Promise you its the same for a lot of ppl.
---
Every tier they are super strong, people have this belief that they scale badly, they really don‚Äôt. Their tier bonuses make up for it.
---
I believe the 15% from DS is for all shadow damage dealt and the 10% from SM only affects the base damage of the spell. Someone may have to confirm for me as its been a while since I went SM.
---
You‚Äôre really obsessed with bleeding out in the bathtub... are you ok? It‚Äôs like 90% of your comments
---
Yes. I always use them for raid nights, and almost all melee classes for top guilds are the same way.
---
Atleast wait untill the 10th! I have a list of like 15 bots that I check on every day for honor lol
---
You never see craftsmanship is more like it
---
Don't worry. we do.
---
Not every corpse walk is that short.  Any walk longer than 230 seconds is at least 10 seconds advantage.
---
horde stalagg honestly dogshit. i would estimate 80-90% of my phase 2 deaths have been with the honorless debuff active
---
I‚Äôm leveling a warrior right now and I‚Äôve been able to find groups so far and I‚Äôve also seen groups recruiting for low level dungeons. So far things seem healthy and alive! I saw several people in wetlands leveling tonight which was great!
---
The reason there‚Äôs so little on it is because warriors are garbage at 39. You only have WW as your instant attack, weapon choices are PoD for 2H which costs ~500g on most servers, or a budget nightblade blade which is too fast. 1H weps are decent but you then make much less use of your best ability - whirlwind.
---
I can‚Äôt convince you to twink at a different level, but warrior twinks only come powerful at 49+ at 39 you will rely heavily on engineering (which basically makes up for whatever class you are anyway, and anyone can do).
---
There‚Äôs like, no one there. Yikes. This looks low pop even for vanilla.
---
In that case, I am sorry you were forced to farm the Thorium Point FP during the middle of the night.  You earned that honour and deserve it for all your hard work.  How dare Blizzard allow this game not to function correctly.
---
Sorry bro, I didn't realize it was such a dire situation.
---
You absolute madman.
---
You‚Äôre looking at census numbers that are wildly inaccurate and dated. 
---
E.g. Kromcrush is essentially  60/40 favoring horde, this server was ‚Äòclose‚Äô to being balanced prior to initially transfers and then a multitude of alliance transferred off.

Activision-Blizzard bought back almost all of their shares from Vivendi (French company that used to own 63% of Act-Bli) and Tencent (Chinese company that used to own 5% of Act-Bli) in 2013.  
---
Activision-Blizzard has majority ownership over Activision-Blizzard. They are the major shareholder, they own their company.  
---
I don't know how the fuck you ended up thinking China buy out Blizzard, but that never happened.  
---
All of the decision makers at Blizzard are from Activision-Blizzard. They aren't owned by China, or anyone in China.

How is that a solution to a problem that should not exist? It's a MMORPG - having high pop realms shouldn't come with being unable to communicate with other players

DE-Everlook has so many players still leveling that I can't complete any quests in strangle Thorn. It's a pve server, by which I wanna say:
---
It's packed. Get to leveling, there's dozens of people who started later or are leveling alts!
---
very helpful, thanks.
---
I started a forsaken mage and there was a 60 running around "recruiting " new forsaken by giving them a care package of bags and pots. Barely costs anything for them but it goes a long way for a new character on a server

I rolled a horde character on Mankrik. Forget it.

I'm level 44 on my main and plenty of groups to be found. Sometimes takes a bit of searching. Leveling zones are full of people questing and ganking each other.
---
I don't do the main boss I go in the back entrance do pretty much everything around there then go back to the stick part plant the stick kill the chick and mine what I can and back to IF.
---
I would say either scholo or LBRS. Scholo has TONS of runecloth,  ad stones, ad rep, and boss drops. LBRS has many good boe recipes (greater fire protection pot, mage robes, etc.) and has high  raw currency since the mobs are tuned to drop loot for 10man but is easily doable with 5.
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Emus must drink every day, and they don‚Äôt waste water. On very hot days they breathe rapidly, using their lungs as evaporative coolers. Their large nasal passages have multiple folds inside. In cooler weather they use these folds to recycle air and create moisture for reuse.
---
large majority of players somehow means 5 realms, WEIRD
---
I can hit the bosses more frequently and vendor less often. Can't see how your way could be more profitable when you account for time spent vendoring and running back.
---
&gt; not like language is completely arbitrary 
---
It's not.
---
only on a few servers is this a real problem you can simply look at census data and see most servers are overall balanced
---

The threat from a wndfury + a crit from a tank is nothing compared to the threat from a windfury + a crit from a DPS Warrior. They hit much harder with their individual attacks than tanks. Warrior threat relies on bonus threat, which is a flat amount added to their abilities regardless of crit. 2% crit is much less than 2% threat to a tank for this reason.
---
Yes, Alliance raiding is way easier than Horde raiding. We knew this 15 years ago. People rolled Horde anyway for some ungodly reason. Threat will be a major problem for Horde in later tiers - but it's not an issue now.
---
Lol what? Horde shitters have been grouping up farming solo ally in every zone and every boat for the last two weeks. Ally straight don't even do that. They're a bunch of sissies.  Fuck heartseeker horde.
---
I'm sorry, but this is a pretty lame PvP vid. No skill whatsoever
---
I used to do the same thing back in school 12 years ago with a clunky mechanical harddrive, pretty cool seeing it on a small USB stick now ha
---
The sad thing is these hardcore gamers are blowing their time camping BRM or 50-60 zones as they roam on their mounts doing nothing. If you think grieving in an unbalanced server for a few items is worth the grind, then you are joking yourself. These players get their kicks corpse camping lower level players and causing grief. Most of us people with lives are just waiting for BG‚Äôs so we can have some real pvp. Real pvp‚Äôers look for real fights, not hunt lower lvl players or camp FP/instances.
---
Incorrect. My server is about 55/45 in favor of alliance.
---
Like holy FUCK. How are you fuckers so delusional.

---
Cock waffle is a great insult and I refuse to apologize for it.
---
&gt; What happened?
---
Over a decade of theorycrafting and conditioning that made people realize Horde is a much safer bet if you want to do anything relating to PvP? 
---
Plus Retail is 90% Horde for much the same reasoning.
---
Hello, fun police? I noticed someone having a good time!
---
I went to the shellfish cages in desolace to try for the fishing rod before I bought it and there was at least 2 bots there, this was on Herod. I think its a known botting spot though.
---
It's frustrating when you can't play.  Moving to a server where the element thats ruining your experience is removed isn't an overreaction, imo.
---
These gankers are literally farming their own community, which is a limited resource to begin with.
---
Can't do that shit and complain that people are overreacting by moving to other servers.
---
I love having tailoring simply for giving out bags to new guildies. Going for 10 slots to even 34 slots (4, 6 slot bags + your bag with 10) helps soooooo much.
---
Not true but whatever floats your boat, alliance scum.
---
Because it's a joke

Conclusion: Druids are OP.

Ah yes the classic WoW experience.

It's so different from retail. :D

I find a lot of horde bots in shimmering flats, usually hunters, but I found a mage once.
---
How do you skip rattle?
---
Class specific discords usually have the most fleshed out and detailed information regarding your class.
---
If you can get the retail version free trail or starter version, I‚Äôd suggest you give that a try. 
---
Retail has a very different look and feel.  Try it out and see if it appeals to you before buying.
---
BiS p2 onwards.

just wait for december 10, bgs whining will be the next thing here
---
I'm just teasing
---
Wow, Blizzard really didn‚Äôt think the initial server transfers through, it‚Äôs actually shocking how little thought they put into it
---
Tank Strat live and reserve a couple orbs or any dungeon and reserve unneeded loot.
---
Or.. find a healer and do 2 man DME jump runs (1 herb 1 miner) and make bank.
---
Even thrash blade + mirahs is higher DPS than using 2h fury with BRE on alliance.
---
There‚Äôs a grey area, and that‚Äôs an issue for some people.  Personally it doesn‚Äôt bother me when ppl have multiple accounts, but I do see the argument against it.
---

I have it but idk.. i think baron/shadow prowler's is better. Shrouded mists is fucking dogshit. Sergeant's cape or w/e is called doesn't look bad tbh, only stam tho so.. rip.
---
youre still getting your proper rank. its just visual you stupid dumbasses
---
Thanks!
---
I don't see any posts after nov 21st. seems like blizz on holiday
---
Nedder‚Äôs description is pretty spot on for blood sail buccaneers an RP pve realm. 
---
Things also sell a bit on the slow side and pretty low prices.  But we do have raid groups, works pvp and will have bg groups I‚Äôm pretty sure. 
---
The community is great though.  Love it.
---
The shaman talent Elemental Mastery is a 3min cooldown that makes their next fire, nature or frost spell a guaranteed crit. If you cast a spell and follow it with an instant cast, you‚Äôll get the instant cast off before the game acknowledges you already used the effects of this skill, so it applies to both spells.
---
So if you activate Elemental Mastery, hard cast lightning bolt, then spam Earth Shock as it‚Äôs finishing, your lightning bolt and earth shock will both ALWAYS crit. Spell hatching gives them their own POM pyro style massive dmg combo with a long cd.
---
I mean, it's a 0.5% drop rate. So we can use a statistical test to determine if the drop rate really was 0.5%. At 650, I don't need to even do the test to tell you he got fucked over and should guess that the drop rate is actually lower
---
It looks like a bed sheet wtf.
---
I was raiding at 10 lmao, bwl on a huntard in Vent with my guild who thought it was hilarious.. I was fucking awful at the game though don't get me wrong. Leveled to 47 pure Melee hunter - hated my pets.
---
Nope. I will ruin your bgs queue. Its as simple as that.
---
i am glad to hear i wont have problems ruining your bgs queue. just wait.
---
&gt; but it's not an issue now.
---
It totally is. DPS with current BiS gear is bursting ~1k dps in those short fights. This is with cooldowns obviously. Tank uses cooldowns too to make up for it (Deathwish and Recklessness). You take every bit of +threat you can get. It's the entire reason people came up with FuryProt spec. Don't forget Warrior tanks have a x1.45 threat multiplier. For the +2% i was counting in impale, which makes crits x2.2 the damage. The bonus threat on the abilities is flat unfortunatly. It doesn't scale with gear, so you have to work around it. With hit cap and then crit.
---
I have it but dont show it.
---
Inb4 downvoted.
---
No one could have predicted most servers would be 2-1 horde, which has just become worse and worse. What is your problem? If it was 50-50 we wouldnt have anywhere near the issues we're having.
---
*"Aight I'mma head out."*
---
For SM/Ruin, there are 2 filler points in Destruction. I see a lot of people get Imp Searing Pain or Intensity, but Aftermath's chance to daze opponents also seems good to me.
---
Does Aftermath result in a debuff that causes problems in raids? Or is it just that much more inferior than Imp Searing Pain/Intensity?
---
It‚Äôs how RNG works, I got it 2nd run. I know people who have run 20+ times to no avail :(
---
Can you explain what this solution is? Also i need to do this!

?? It's spelled liar and if you're claiming to not have read what is specifically in the post you're replying to I don't know what to tell you.
---
Ahhh glider... Good times
---
As a priest: respec to shadow at 40, 45, or not at all?
---
Planned on going all the way to 60 as holy to make dungeon runs easier, but there seem to be no spellcleave groups running anymore?
---
I don't think you should go for a "beginner" class, because it's easier to perform with. Classic is ultimately very simple and doesn't require much mechanic skill, so you're good to go with any class really. 
---
You should go with what sounds fun and appeals to you. Ignoring all the thoughts about optimization and what's "best", what class fantasy appeals you the most when you're in the character creation screen? Playing a class you enjoy is ultimately what's going to keep you interested in playing and learn more. 
---
There's no right or wrong decision, but you should make it yourself.

We did our 3rd guild MC tonight with a couple pugs, we got BOTH bindings in one run, SS for proof and a link to one of the pugs stream.

? what? I didn't say that. I said I didn't know what the droprate for might of menethil is, but BRE is rare.
---
I remember this being a thing in the original game, before launch of BWL.
---
Imagine playing alliance in 2019
---
Shadow Mastery states "increases the damage dealt or life drained by your Shadow spells by x%" while Demonic Sacrifice (Succubus) states "increases your Shadow damage by 15%."
---
Not saying you're wrong, but if what you're saying is right I feel like every Warlock video/guide/forum/etc. would strongly emphasize to switch from SM/Ruin to DS/Ruin at a certain point once enough +spell power/+shadow damage is acquired, since Shadow Mastery would always be a flat 10% boost (to the base damage) while Demonic Sacrifice (Succubus) would be a 15% boost that scales with the amount of + damage you have.
---
Ultimately, I have no idea, but there doesn't seem to be a strong community consensus (e.g. "DS/Ruin becomes progressively better than SM/Ruin the more spell power you have") for it to make sense to me.
---
I mean do you blame him? My raid geared near bis warrior can barely solo a level 55 elite, while my not even prebis warlock alt can melt that same mob without taking any damage. Warrior bros need support to really shine. Chad warriors can handle themselves well in PVP, but (generally) anyone who is unable to beat a warrior 1v1 really needs to reevaluate their play.
---
Respec SL.
---
The issue with PVP at this point have very little to do with faction ratios. Heartseeker is 80:20 alliance to horde but as alliance it's nearly impossible to quest in in 45+ zone. All of the 60 alliance members are off camping end game dungeons, end game zones, major cities, or refusing to take part in PVP. While outnumbering the horde by numbers, it means nothing when they aren't where the horde are.
---
Eh. Most normal raid groups have 7-10 warriors. 
---
Right now it sucks but once aq40 comes around we actually start getting lots of gear to choose from.
---
I trust hard facts more then anecdotes
---
The game is very different, with different goals.
---
Classic is more about the journey and the social aspects.
---
Retail has a lot more quality of life enhancements, which make the journey a lot quicker and easier, and its focus is more top-heavy.
---
Both have their merits. If you went for that deal, I would HIGHLY recommend, leveling from level 1.
---
lol naw it'll be fine
---
Lol hunters. 
---
Competing with hunters isn't a thing.
---
i just hit 48... this should be swell
---
There's a private server that does it. The reason why it works is because they have a VERY different ruleset from standard WoW.
---
Oops, forgot the /a. It's so hard to hear sarcasm in text form.
---
No, logical thought isn't welcome here.  Horde are literally hitler.  Does anyone else hate the horde?  Alliance btw.
---
Warrior Without healing is crap in pvp
---
I have one of each!

Oh i didn't know "last 7 days" was dated?

Which for kromcrush says 40/60 but you're saying that's wildly inaccurate? But it matches ironforge so...that must be inaccurate too?

"Just be level 60" - FP die. FP die.

I spend stupid amounts of time making this stuff. Nearly all of it is the creative use of weakauras but I did have to replace a bit of the interface files themselves. Particularly proud of the glass globe textures. Each player class has its class crest behind the target portrait. It's pretty cool.
---
Dude. 
---
You're whining a lot.
---
The addon works? And it matches what ironforge pro says. 
---
But yea any census that doesnt agree with your narrative must be wrong.
---
I'd really not call them that...
---
It's cheap and i'ts a big dps boost. It's only 2-3g generally.
---
F
---
I think you've got it exactly. 
---
The worst part is other than MT and primary OT in raids. Warriors can tank all content in dps specs.
---
40 * 2 is 80
---
60 / 2 is 30.
---
Jesus christ the kids an idiot!
---
SM/Ruin is ~the drain tank build everyone uses to level, and it makes you very effective in instances/raids and gives you a lot of utility for PvP. Conflag is awesomely bursty but gives you nothing toward survivability. You need great gear with dmg and crit because anything that survives that Soulfire/Immolate/Conflag/Shadowburst will proceed to fuck you up.
---
Plus, in this zerging PvP we currently have, it might prove very difficult to get off a long Soulfire cast.
---
Your ‚Äúgood group‚Äù has to actually GET IN TO LBRS. And they can‚Äôt. Try being a level 53 healer landing at either fp and riding into the dungeon with 125 horde lined up to kill you.
---
Mages are average at best in TBC. TBC is the xpac of the hybrid. After TBC though, mages are back to being gods.
---
honestly, that's a pretty valid solution.
---
I used to do a lot of computer repair work involving "reinitializing" and overwriting hard drive contents, making data quasi-unrecoverable, so the HDD can be sold... but since it's a gigantic, continuous write operation that goes on for hours on end, it often pushed drives past their safe operating temperatures.
---
throw in a few old pentium 4 heatsinks and they were downright chilly.
---
that is the textbook of an anecdote. that information is backed up by another site, ironforge.pro which shows 62 horde 38% alliance within past 2 weeks. If you don't believe me go run the census addon yourself and ask someone on alliance side to do it as well and that should give you a comparison for the time frame you are online at the very least
---
People came up with Fury/Prot in Naxx... No one had came up with that shit to clear 1.12 Molten Core.
---
There is no interface at all, it doesnt show in the map wheel, I've tried a few commands in chat but it doesnt work. I haven't been able to use auto but cause there is nothing for me to setup. 
---
How did you get it to show on your screen?
---
The horde are trash and that skip is undone by one mage with 3/3 blizz camping the jump. Not that ally are gonna need it. Ally will rape AV
---
aftermath's for pvp, dazing effect doesn't do anything against raid mobs iirc
---
No
---
Yeah, farming it is crazy. We‚Äôre you in just a regular group doing a normal run?
---
some people work night shifts and are naturally awake at these hours on their days off. some of these same people like to play druid and get honor by stealthing around solo, not camping FPs and running around in 40 mans. Wipe away ur salty tears, this is very much a problem that needs to be fixed asap
---
Only way to do that is either do it on another server or use a special letter by holding right alt and hitting 3 numbers Google special keyboard characters and you should find a list
---
Ah shit ok. Thank you.
---
I've been killed by ?? Ally on the boats several times.
---
Stop pretending Alliance is holier-than-thou.
---
It definitely has. The cities are more empty than before, while yeah sure some are out trying to pvp or just doing *things*, the server feels a lot more empty than before and its more difficult to get a group for things. All the popular spots arent filled with as many people as before. Even I feel like just playing something else because theres not anything for me to do. I want to pvp but finding a lone alliance is nearly impossible, I ran into just those in a group and the few times I might run into one thats alone, other horde jump in.  
---
It feels like Stalagg is on the smaller side of the servers that have had multiple free xfers and with this last one its like a shell of its former self.
---
I'm never even mad when ele shamans 2 shot me. It's hilarious
---
Did someone say shit joke parroted by everyone?

( Not you ik)
---
"You didn't play the game how I want, you should be punished"
---
Grow up.
---
Oh my alt lives in SM
---
then where the hell can i be foul
---
Because he is a shitty person, and has anonymity.  Almost certainly from one of those toxic as fuck pirated servers.
---
Maybe try and contact blizzard support? Say you were away and let your brother play your account or some shit and ask for a transfer back. Probably pointless but who knows.
---
This all sounds familiar... Can I ask where it's from?
---
Sorry for ruining it in advance!
---
On Fairbanks server towards the horde farming us alliance! :(

What are you talking about ? With the exception of the unnecessary buff bars, it's one of the simplest and slickest UIs you can have.
---
Austin Powers
---
I stayed shadow until 54 or 55 and then switched to holy for dungeons. No healing issues until those levels. Might be able to stay shadow longer depending on gear.
---
Then use this formula across all your dps. Will vary for spell used by different classes.
---
We know it's real because they misspelled your
---
I think you should add the /s at the end, because a lot of people will not get your sarcasm.

---
i'll give your wife a back massage tonight, Ian.
---
in that case, you have people focusing a SL warlock. if he has halfway decent gear, tell me how that works out for you lol
---
for reference i'm SL, have 5pc t1, and sit at right under 6k hp buffed(class buffs + food + rummsey), 30% dam reduction from SL, 20% armor, 89-129 resistances, felhunters at like 3.7k hp buffed, 307 resistances, 30% armor. 
---
unless you got 3 dps on him that can chain CC and kill him, good luck with that. even then if hes a decent pvper he'll have plenty of tricks to prolong the fight to make it a terrible decision to go in on him. if you send any less than 2 dps, unless they got heals, the SL lock should 2v1 them, unless there is a big skill and/or gear gap. 
---
you could go on and on and on forever with these theoreticals and "but if -" 's. i'm just saying a warlock sticking on your healer like white on rice isn't something outlandish or crazy and you'll need more than just one person to get em off, and thats not even taking into consideration if they're getting heals, any other people around, etc etc.
---
If you realllllly wanna spend the time you can actually figure out what the approximate dps increases will be.
---
How did this bot trigger? How do i make it trigger on other threads?
---
not a good idea. condensation kills electronics, and those reusable ice cubes feel like a magnet for that... USB3 and water droplets do not mix so well.
---
wtf is your problem?  You act like these server transfers are going to come out of your welfare check or something...
---
Most people aren‚Äôt going to be playing classic in 3 years, but they may with a reset
---
Ok

&gt; 100 level 60s in IF
---
"Why is the Horde rolling over everyone".
---
Just a bunch of crybabies.
---
What source are you using your this information? I know there are a few that are wildly inaccurate and will give people different results even with looking at the same parameters.
---
So what ideas do you have other than buying a new laptop (which I'm probably gonna do anyways)?
---
Bingo!
---
thats all? have fun in BGs LOL
---
That sounds dirty.
---
Looking forward to that
---
I‚Äôd feel the same way honestly. I‚Äôve been an on/off wow addict for close to 15 years thanks to WC3/TFT and LOVING D1 past it‚Äôs prime and D2. The fact Warcraft was based off warhammer and they don‚Äôt even have the decency to cast that piece in some metal for fans...c‚Äômon
---
lmao? are u joking me? i do 1v2 1v3 with guards on ME.
---
MORE FACTS
---
Yup, when alliance complain about this on literally every other pvp server it's just "git gud" or "yOu rOllEd a PvP sErVeR" etc. It doesn't matter what faction you play. Imbalanced servers are aids.
---
gl farming that one....
---
In a 5 man group?
---
IF Blizzard was wanting Classic to be a going concern (please look that up if you don't know what that means), they would be at least attempting to create something similar to retail in offering "New Player" realms.  This would mean growth of the product.  They are not.  We also have a player population that would have been housed with twice as many realms than what we are playing on.  A "Medium" realm population in Classic would be considered "High" in Vanilla... or even "Full".  The game was simply not designed to be this packed.
---
Eh, meant to type superior.
---
You sound like you run away from 1v1s
---
Your all good man, TSM stands for TradeSkillMaster and is a mega adding that helps people auction large quantities of items on the AH. It is seriously complex but I'd recommend installing it and trying to make what you can of it - I only use about 20% of the features but for example you can set it up to always maintain X amount of potions in your inventory - and when it goes under gives you a list of materials needed to restock up to full. 
---
Your honestly fine to pick and choose the features you use, as not all of them are neccessary. I only understand a little and my crafter is on a different account from my banker so I don't use the warehousing - just groups (which will group up your items into whatever categories you want examples - potions, meat, food and rare goods. Operations is the other part I use at I think allows you to dictate HOW you will post everything. A simple example would be I sell lots of potions and I want them sold in 5 stacks of 1 and 3 stacks of 5.
---
Once you set up your basic TSM groups and operations you can fill up your bank alt with potions and list everything with a few simple clicks - this is the key, it means anyone on the server competing in my market has to either automate the process or they won't win. I'm posting 200 auctions in 5 mins and constantly checking for undercuts, cancelling and relisting for cheaper.
---
Go for it - Just keep in mind that questing as a prot takes a lot longer
---
Yup, I saw like 6 of them in the same area on Loch Modan. It‚Äôs insane.
---
If you had 0% crit to begin with, 2% crit would be worth 2% damage.
---
If you already have 10% crit, adding 2% extra crit would be worth ~1.8% damage.
---
You should want it separate.  There is less incentive for them to actually produce a quality retail product if they are being cushioned by a couple million Classic players.
---
Lolol. Wow fanboy clinging to the falsehood that his childhood/adulthood game is dead and monetized to shit. Dude get real lol. It‚Äôs done.
---
My warrior is mining / herb and can make good money in EPL. Last few days had amazing luck with a few black lotus / arcane crystals. Only problem is PvP, my warrior is borderline useless especially against mages. If you can avoid PvP or be ok with the occasional corpse run it can be good money.
---
Dont get fired over a game.
---
I love all the Naxx cloaks
---
My lowest margin potions are my highest sellers.. 10s of a Mongoose Pot that costs 2.5g to make but the kicker is they sell like hotcakes meaning I actually make a lot of money off them. Same deal with Elixir of Giants, in 2 weeks I've sold roughly 300 of each.
---
Or not be on a 70/30 server
---
We expected the "classic" experience only to find that Blizzard jammed many more players onto each server than classic has.  So if you want to see what that looks like take something that is a fixed size (like a 3 foot by 3 foot map).  Put 3000 little pins on it... not so bad probably - somewhat spread out.
---
Now add 5 or 10 times that amount - now that map is literally so full that there is no space left.  Likewise - in Vanilla on a PVP server everyone was much more spread out and hence there were pockets of space to quest, farm etc...  Now that we have exponentially more people running around there is no stone unturned.
---
Even at level 60 you can't do anything.  Every time you land at Thorium Point you die between 5-10 times getting into Blackrock Mountain unless you happen to luck into your faction owning the zone or catch a raid group heading that way that you blend in with for the ride.
---
They aren't lying when they say it's unplayable.  I've had the "In Dreams" quest for instance (Fordring Escort) for a couple weeks now and every day I go make two attempts at doing it - and each time I get maybe out of the Keep, sometimes not and I get ganked.  So yeah... I have tried that quest probably 25-30 times so far.   Thanks Blizzard - we shouldn't have to convince 4 other people to group up just to do a quest and even if we did a group of 10 from the opposing faction would show up.
---
Oh ok that all makes it a lot more clear. There was just a total disconnect between the post title and post content.
---
You can't really talk about retail being monetized to shit, when classic players are paying $15 a month for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
---
The balance is lopsided and it is an uneven PvP scene... so what you‚Äôre seeing is the ‚Äòlite‚Äô version. It is legitimately a lot worse for alliance on Herod
---
Those are spells that are talent or pet specific. For instance conflagrate and siphon life are mapped to the S key because there will never be any conflict between them.
---
In the same manner, pet abilities such as spell lock and seduction are bound to shift+E because it's impossible to have two pets active at the same time, hence there will never be any conflicts there either.
---
On the F2 button I use a castsequence macro to buff unending breath and detect invisibility. It's IMO not worth it to use two separate keybinds for those spells.
---
I don't understand why people are so proud of being nasty and toxic or y people circle jerk and commend people for being inflammatory. 
---
Hey guys I did something intending to be aggravating and someone got aggravated... Am I in the in crowd now? Do you like me? Please somebody validate me.
---
Got paid to heal area runs till it dropped. Dropped the first time. Easiest 15g I‚Äôve made
---
Which faction and what is the faction balance?   On my server it's 50/50 almost and there is no way you'd get more than one quest an hour done assuming they need any kill or drop requirement that puts you out in the open world.
---
He's getting fired eventually. Might as well be for wow.

**This ticket has been marked as Answered.**

Or chop off their heads after not paying them
---
I use aimed and multi whenever they‚Äôre available and I‚Äôm usually 1-2 in dps for a whole MC raid. I do pop mana pots on Rag. I am also using rhok
---
Sounds like you want a class with a high skill floor. Meaning, even if you play the class poorly, you'll still have good results. 
---
This is the opposite concept of a high skill ceiling class, which is how well a class does with optimal, studied gameplay. 
---
I think the highest skill floor class in classicwow is probably the Mage. There's a ton of things a great mage can do to try to reach their skill ceiling, but even a half-asleep, netflix watching Mage can smash a dungeon or raid. 
---
The only classes I can think of with a higher skill floor for leveling is maybe Warlock or Hunter, because they've got pets. Even if you're not putting any effort into controlling your pet they're still awesome.
---
Jealous?
---
Seeing as those numbers aren't accurate, and the pop is so high. A 10-15% it's upwards of 1k+ players. That's a pretty big difference
---
Man this hits home. Vanish sucks dick.
---
You can barely quest regardless of level.  Everyone is riding around in groups of 5 or 10 killing everything in their path.  I have quests that have been in my log for multiple weeks as a level 60 that I haven't been able to do because I get ganked every time.
---
Yeah your actually right. It's funny if you look at my post history I made a similar comment on the forums about how easy it is to make gold with Alchemy explaining my process. Downvoted and ignored!
---
It's no big deal to me, but considering I can't expand my business on my server anymore I'm looking to expand onto about 5 other servers to continue the empire. All I need is a lvl 35 and I'm going to try the highest pop servers I need the game.. People are just lazy and defeatist, I play Oceanic on the highest pop server and had no issues..
---
Fuck the whole reason I made that post on the WoWEcon forum was that I found it funny my lvl 35 crafter out-earns my lvl 60 main.
---
Agreed, all my years different servers cores what have you, the number one dps increase as caster is to never be resisted. Hit &gt; all stats even at expense of SP. When youre on your 3rd global trying to put curses up you will understand hit value lol.
---
Oh man, we used to do poor-man's LAN parties with these like 12 years ago in the college computer lab
---
Unholy cow, Khadgar.
---
Which items are they? You cant post in english with a german SS and not translate the drops to english!
---
First... WoW Tokens are the same across all servers.  Secondly, do not buy them at the end of an expansion.  Buy them at the beginning if you are converting them to Blizzard bucks.  Basic supply and demand.  At the end of Legion they were around 240,000 gold, and shortly after BfA they hit near 100,000 gold.
---
Imagine having a bunch of mages aoe the mobs down for you like grunts...
---
**Then they pay you for it.** That's Warriors in Classic.
---
Dm: e you want about 480 spl dmg for the final boss, but it isn‚Äôt required.  
---
MC gear not required, close to preBis is good. 
---
I think Mara is doable in any lvl 50+ gear, assuming sm/ ds spec.
---
Sitting down to get hit is a private server thing. It's not in Classicwow
---
Yet... it took Blizzard threatening legal action to shut down all the private servers... makes sense.  Private servers that have existed for over 10 years.
---
I did it for a few years back in the day. You definitely can.
---
I understand not taking a strangers word for it but I did it for hours on end, over and over and over again on retail. My winrate in AV as horde was absurd because every game I'd wall jump to south bunker then take north. No archers would be around when the raid showed up.
---
Issue is you can't reliably quest until 52 or 53.  Mara and Sunken Temple groups are hard to come by and to the OP's point - you basically have to log on and sit there trying to form a group for an hour, then fly to wherever the instance is... run there and get killed a few times, rez and run some more.  By the time you start the instance you killed 90 minutes.
---
Now think about how that works for an actual adult with a full time job that comes home, grabs dinner and has 3 hours top to play in a night.  They most likely won't even be able to run an instance.  On my server I went on an LBRS run (all level 60s) the other night and it took us an hour to get everyone inside the instance from the time we start leaving IF to fly to Thorium.  It's honestly ridiculous.
---
Aftermath soo useless (in raids)
---
the real alchemists buy herbs earlier in the week when the prices dropped at points and are making profit. You're likely just looking at the wrong times. Buying on weekends and selling on tuesdays is the typical play.
---
I haven't played retail in years....
---
If there isn‚Äôt enough data yes. If anything, at least I‚Äôll develop some sort of expectation of how many more weeks of grinding I likely have ahead of me based on other people with 100+ runs.
---
What about ret paladins. Are they hard to gear?
---
SM/Ruin has the advantage that it's also a decent PvE spec and I think in PvP it's a bit more resilient. For the conflag build you need decent spell power equipment (which can also be harder to get than shadow dmg) to really have the burst.
---
For leveling it's generally advised to drain tank and spec affliction for dark ritual and afterwards whatever you want.
---
It's been copied and memed, no doubt. But Austin Powers is the original source.
---
"We havent heard of this problem before"
---
Dude just outed himself as a fucking liar lmao
---
I haven‚Äôt left IF for over a week now, only for raids. 
---
It‚Äôs getting ridiculous at this point. We had 3 players leave the server this week because you can‚Äôt even enter any high level zones anymore without corps camped!
---
I will leave Firemaw when paid-transfers is here as well!
---
Is killing higher level player some kind of free-pass to be an immature asshole?
---
Very.
---
All physical DPS use it, in addition to tanks for threat and extra dodge.
---
I don't think there's a more used elixir.
---
I worded it poorly, but there were a handful of people defending this garbage play-style by simply telling people to reroll. So this was my global retort.
---
Show me on this doll where the ganker hurt you
---
He is s pretty warrior. And I bet deadly too;)
---
How did you attach the heatsink? Did you just use regular glue or what?
---
Being a warlock will speed things up a bit, but the phase 2 pvp will slow things down a fair bit too. Maybe bg‚Äôs will be out before you hit lvl 50 tho.
---
Calm down, you‚Äôve got 10 more weeks of this at minimum.  And you aren‚Äôt getting bracket 1 so it‚Äôs closer to 14-16 more weeks for you.
---
Nothing puts out more dps like a warrior with life support. It feels absolutely amazing. Problem is to find someone that can stomach the mentality of actually being a slave to the warrior.
---
Yeah...love people who say that the RNG isn‚Äôt really random, just a simulation. A common RNG function can create a period with a length of (2^19937)-1 before the values repeat.  For all logical intents and purposes, that is random.  
---
But don‚Äôt worry, you will figure out the pattern using anecdotal evidence from Reddit posters.
---
I played in vanilla and while there was honor trading between major guilds on the server there was very rarely anything as degenerate as 24/7 camping BRM &amp; flightmasters from memory...
---
Tons of people. Have you not been on this subreddit or game?
---
Every time I've been there the entire place is spawn camped, with more players than the respawns can realistically keep up with.
---
This is some Steiner Math^TM out in the wild. amazing
---

Except your population is half that of stalagg, so
---
Sulfuron-FR has these issues too...
---
it seems highly unbalanced based on data but alliance there might be more organized and better, no idea
---
Tell your guild to go super saiyan and aoe domo down. That‚Äôs probably the easiest way to get a high parse.
---
No lifers pvp all night long and some of that period doesnt count for honor for some odd reason.
---

---
Alchemy transmutes is my bankroll plan late-classic.
---
thanks ?
---
Oh man... you take a while, eh?  Two products bringing in two subscriptions, if successful... would make more money.  A failed product tagged to a successful product makes less money.
---
So... just keep laughing in your response because that really shows how smart you are.
---
Some people have fun sitting at a flightpath for a few hours attacking folks as they come on in, perhaps the real reward was the friends they made along the way.
---
I play alliance now. I‚Äôve played horde before. I got ganked way more at lower level as alliance. 
---
I‚Äôve said before on this subreddit, there‚Äôs a huge difference between ganking and pvp. 
---
For example...today I was running through Ashenvale and ran across a lv 20 something horde. I dotted him up, and he died, and I kept moving. I didn‚Äôt camp him for 2 hours making his game time miserable. 
---
I know all about ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no fair fight in battle‚Äù or whatever but when I see someone questing and I want to fight them, I don‚Äôt wait until they pull a mob and then kill them. I fight them fairly. There‚Äôs no pride in killing a weakened enemy for me. I‚Äôd much rather say ‚Äúhey I got this mage earlier it was a solid fight‚Äù over ‚Äúhaha dumb ass I killed him while he was fighting a whole mob haha‚Äù. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just me. I value the little time I have to play and I respect other people‚Äôs time playing if they don‚Äôt seem interested in pvp at that exact moment.
---
Noone knows for sure, but most likely no.
---
Never trust someone who uses ‚Äúfolks‚Äù
---
That's okay, it was definitely worth the wait.
---
Can we at least get a confirmation on that though... =\\
---
It ‚Äúusually‚Äù does. The healing will only generate threat if you are below 100% hp.  
---
Technically I know this is how siphon life works, but I assume the same.
---
Actually, I'm willing to bet there's just as many strong PvPers in Horde who went there for the better racials. Not everybody feels the need to prove something by stacking the deck against them.
---
mad? ganked?
---
I used to run a german client way back but I stopped using it when they started translating literally everything.  
---
I just didn't get it why names and cities had to get translated too.
---
It caused some confusion with my guildmates who were still running the german one though.
---
Is there a minimum Crit % I should strive for as a 60 Hunter in addition to the 9% Hit rating?
---
That is true, I don't trust me either.
---
that aint cheap
---
Eh, 99% of players have a bankalt?
---
Definitely a mad retail player
---
With 5/5 spiritual focus and standard concentration aura I thought I was basically immune to spells pushback, am I wrong? I thought that talent was useless.
---
Seems like the Alliance deserve it tbh
---
&gt;Alliance would spend less time corpse running
---
#Nochanges!
---
&gt;horde can farm us more efficiently.
---
...#somechanges
---
According to blizzard it's a visual bug u shitter. Should still all count on tuesday
---
I'm so surprised that just 40-60 of us Alliance spread across 3-20 man groups make that much of an impact on the server. Meanwhile there's more than 500-600 horde spread across every inch of every zone of Herod during 2pm-10pm with the sole mission of ganking, camping and optimizing honor gains.
---
We have about 10-12 rogues camping key spots and farming honor for alliance. **Horde have more than forty doing this.**
---
There's no equivalency here.
---
&gt;I didn't say that.
---
Except you did. Pay attention to context, please.
---
Wowhead drop rate calculations are anecdotal based on people‚Äôs submissions. The only difference is I‚Äôm trying to actually collect more in depth data aside from, how many kills did it take.
---
What do you mean by "That makes world pvp completely terrible and worthless for most people", where is this "most" coming from?
---
Amazing how you jump to insults when you weren't even part of this conversation.
---
&gt;You know attacking me doesn‚Äôt validate anything you‚Äôve said right?
---
and then 
---
&gt;you‚Äôre literally behaving like a child with ADHD.
---
Hmm, interesting.
---
I guess I have to throw your own words back at you, because this is essentially what you're doing. You can't actually refute my points so you just say yell and say I'm biased. Your entire comment didn't actually bring up any new points, it just attacked me and called me biased based on your own failure to properly read the discussion.
---
Which is precisely why I focused on pointed out your impressive misreading of my previous comment. Your entire point is that I'm so terribly biased, going so far as to say I "literally admitted it" when I simply and clearly did not. If that's your argument, then my best course of action in the discussion is to point out erroneously you came by the idea.
---
I don't know where you get the idea that I'm angry, but I suppose it's a convenient way to dismiss my points. Although with your issues in readying regular text, I suppose I can't be too surprised by your reading whatever you like in subtext.
---
The reality is that this idea of AV being so unfair and biased just isn't based on credible evidence. It's based on folk knowledge passed around in an echo chamber by people invested in it being true. It's based on correlation of convenient statistics that don't have a credible causal link and can be explained in other ways.
---
I understand that this seems to a dearly held belief for some people--for some reason--and that having something they've for so long accepted as true to be questioned can be uncomfortable. Especially if they derive some amount of self-esteem from being good at classic WoW. Please lets not get in to how silly that is, though.
---
&gt;Drakestone of shadow wrath is also less than 1% drop
---
Just get linken's, lol. And in 2 weeks replace with AV offhand. And archivist's cape... What's the difference between it and Spritecaster's?
---
&gt; Those two alone are harder to get than full warrior pre-bis.  
---
SGC - 0.8% drop. HoJ - 4% drop, highly contested (all melee classes). Dal'rend mainhand - 4% drop, highly contested (warriors, rogues, occasional hunter)
---
Yes.
---
You have two different levels of situation here. Tanks and healees are the easiest to gear, but they don't do as hot in PvP due to lack of crossover with builds between raiding and PVP. You could go healer and really gear into support in PVP. Tanks are decent for just soaking up damage. You'd be playing a Warrior most likely at that point. DPS/PVP minded Druids and Hunters are the easiest to gear after healers and tanks. This is true for both pre-raid and during MC. Next comes Rogues, Mages, and Warlocks. The first two are slightly harder for their pre-raid stuff is typically harder to get than a Warlock. Mages and Warlocks are going up against each other and the random elemental shaman and Shadow Priest, Rogues are going up against Hunters, Warriors and other Rogues. Next hardest are the hybrid spellcasters and Shadow Priests  for reasons I've already outlined. Then you have Enhancement Shamans, fury warriors (who need to respec into arms for PvP) and Retribution Paladins. Retribution Paladins are really mediocre DPS wise. No guild will take more than 1-2.
---
What's the point? Everywhere I go I get ganked and camped by at least 4-6 hordes.
---
Every FP I go I die instantly whether I'm landing or flying.
---
And when I teleport into IF or SW I'll die instantly because I'm still flagged.
---
Safest spot is either hiding in a dungeon or in front of the IF bank.
---
Everyone in the warlock classic discord would disagree with you. Sim yourself before you wreck yourself.
---
There's honorless target = 30 seconds after you land you can be killed, but no honor.
---
Also after 5 kills, you get 0 honor for killing a target.
---
Beyond that, yeah it should count, even if calculation screws up.
---
Focus gives you 70% to not have your bar setback when taking damage but doesn't do anything against interrupts/silences whereas aura does. Plus if your focus is battlegrounds the aura is going to help out your allied casters.
---
If you want to raid as a Rogue, your odds are better on a PvE server - they're among the least played classes there.
---
That is quality meme template content
---
Both warriors and mages sit at 80-95 percentile. Warriors beat mages at golemagg (by like 50 dps) and cleave fights, mages beat warriors at ragnaros, geddon, shazzrah, ony (by a mile).
---
Can't do it on most pvp servers as alliance since P2 started.
---
actually its just a visual bug as confirmed by a blue post.
---
Well... if the product was on a separate subscription... they would be better able to tell whether or not their product is meeting the expectation of the customers.  Most players I come across in Classic are not playing Retail.  A going concern is the ability of a business to be profitable indefinitely.  I am claiming that the current management of Classic WoW will not produce something indefinite in terms of profitability.  Any game needs new players to maintain their profit.  My point here is that there is ZERO attempt to maintain a stable population.  The plan here is squish the player-base into just enough servers and then let Classic die off.  That is what it appears if they are not at least attempting to accommodate new players and players that do not want to be in a server with 6,000+ concurrent players.
---
Mages probably hard counters multiboxers more than anything else.
---
The hit cap in your situation is 9% with swords, I‚Äôd say edge master would be over kill and you should keep the devilsaur set bonus.
---
Ok I see, may I ask you if you could provide me a good build template? I was trying to do what you said but to go further down to holy tree, I had to use at least 1 talent point for improved LoH.
---
What's the difference between 14 spellpower and 21 spellpower + 4mp5? 
---
What's the difference between 20 and 28 spellpower?
---
Just get green chest of tiger and use blackhands + mark of guard captain instead of SGC and Hoj then?
---
SGC and HoJ are both way easier to farm than either of these items even without considering that you can tank and get groups way easier. They come from early farm able bosses while archivist cape drops from second last boss in strat living and drakestone drops from sunken temple.
---
It's not that their time is more important, it's either that or wait for hours. In essence you're paying him for your own time, not the warrior's.
---
I have no idea how people can even motivate themself to do PvP before BGs. Its no fun at all.

Horde:Alliance is 60:40 on Lucifron - Alliance mass transfers off to Heartseeker because reasons.
---
Now both Heartseeker and Lucifron are badly imbalanced with 75:25 on Lucifron and something similar on Heartseeker. Both Servers are now bleeding players because they just keep getting farmed by an overwhelming amount of players.
---
Congrats Blizzard, allowing the lower population side to free transfer of Lucifron might not only have completely fucked one server, but two. 
---
Also good job A V I D - Crying about Faction imbalance, transfering off and then doing the exact same thing you cried about. Toppest of keks.
---
i like farming the nagas in aszhara for golden pearls with a full raid geared rogue. on average i get one golden pearl every 80 minutes. there is almost no competitiors (firemaw, one of the most populated servers) and i rarely get ganked. they also drop silver, greys and actually have the chance for lottery epics. it's a great spot if you can kill 200+ per hour.
---
WoW was never intended to be an asshole simulator
---
There has been.
---
it used to be a dps check, but now every raid has 8+ warriors.
---
Whoops lol
---
5 man group?
---
I watched one drop within first five passed to tank then watched one drop roughly 25 runs after went to friend, same run Savage gladiator chain dropped and he got that too. The next run after that I got HoJ all of this was about a week before P2
---
Where did you find this?
---
Sounds cool. Doesn't help me much unfortunately I play Enhance and my guild asked me to roll Resto for raiding
---
In a full group and it dropped on the 120th?
---
You are right. I tried to make a ballpark easy to follow guide. Raids like ubrs are bad for xp so should not be used if leveling is your goal. DM:E can also be run at much nuch lower level than 58, but it's again not friendly for leveling.
---
Transfers were open for way too long on Stalagg. Need to merge it and Heartseeker.
---
&gt; the thing is that only one or maybe two servers total are as unbalanced in our favor compared to the however many (a lot) others that are the other way around.
---
7 servers are 70/30 or more in favor of Horde. 7 servers are 70/30 or more in favor of Alliance. So no, it's pretty much the exact same, Alliance are just whining more in general, as they're typically worse in PvP in general. Why? PvPers are more likely to pick horde. This is how it was on live servers too, Horde had a far higher win rate in every BG except for AV.
---
The next time anyone says, "your ui is trash"  I'm just gonna remember You as the example and just laugh it off.
---
Ten, ten in total. rest were either 40s-50s
---
"Either you have some problems to use logic or your trolling."  Just re-read that for a second.
---
Here is what I think you meant:  Either you have some problems using logic or you're trolling.
---
If you are going to insult me, at least don't make yourself look bad in the process.
---
Using McDonald's as a business model you would like to be part of, is not the best example of fair customer treatment.  Their fries are shit and take years off of your life.  The burger does, too.  But, not as much as the fries.  I often order just a burger, because that is all I want.  You can scarf down whatever crap you want... but some of us like to choose what shit we eat.  Rather than just taking it.
---
Nothing wrong with playing defensive but as a pally you can be a bit more offensive, lorewise and skillwise that's what you're built for. Fighting up front lets you drop your hammer on a horde healer to shut them down and is a bit of a passive taunt against inexperienced horde murder hobos to focus on the closer guy wearing plate/shield than going for your teams clothies in the back.
---
Just curious, were you rested?
---
In 10 days AV xbow is a top contender too!
---
Beeing alliance on most pvp servers makes questing past the starting zone impossible
---
everyone?
---
Why don't they update the texture resolution
---
Its unbelievable how many people like you don't actually understand what you are talking about in terms of this issue. Not everybody who lost honor farms lowbies at TP, some of us actually have to have all of our points count since we play on PVE servers.
---
Does anyone have a discord link ?
---
The tl;dr is focus on getting consumable items, there will always be demand for herbs, food, fish and alchemy ingredients, farming BoE items will hit a ceiling eventually.
---
* High value alchemy products like Greater Fire Protection Potion, Elixir of Mongoose etc
---
* Getting high value herbs (Dreamfoil and Mountain Silversage on my server) and sell them directly
---
* Farming Elemental Fire for GFPs (Arathi, Un'goro or Felwood)
---
* Fishing high value fish like Nightfin Snapper or Winter Squid
---
* Farming Satyr's in Felwood for drops (mostly contested)
---
* Even farming random 50+ humanoids for Runecloth &amp; random scraps isn't too bad
---
Obviously what you can do depends on the server and time, try to figure out at what time your server is the most dead.  
---
Dedication to the grind is also important in my opinion, sometimes I don't get anything decent for 30min+ but just keep at it. I've seen plenty of people trying to contest me at farming only to see them leave after 10min of not getting anything.
---
With BGs coming soon world pvp might die a bit down so it might get easier.
---
And the second live
---
Obviously i meant those 500dps with 0% crit. Crit will always add the same damage, regardless of how much crit you have.
---
If you make 500dps WITH crits, lets assume 19% crit, guess what. Your base dps is then 420,17 and every point of crit gives you exactly 4.2017dps. 19*4.2017+420.17=500. Magic.
---
There are 4 servers on NA where Horde are 70/30, and 4 servers on NA where Alliance are 70/30. Statistically, Alliance are just babies (in classic).
---
*responds in magical arcane arts*
---
it's so funny how this story pops up.
---
none of you actually have friends lmao
---
Anyway still not sure how you could use 2 points on concentration aura, only way to do it is not picking holy shock it seems, is holy shock that bad?
---
Never got to play vanilla but WSG, AV, and in WotLK wintergrasp were dominated by horde. Wintergrasp was so bad for my server they really only ever won once every 5 or so matches. 
---
The other BG's I can't really recall well. Want to say AB was dominated by ally then I hardly ever played EotS or SoA.
---
It‚Äôs actually shocking all the alliance transferred en masse at the drop of a hat from reasonably balanced servers so they could camp flight paths for one kill every 10 minutes
---
Oh wait no it‚Äôs not
---
fuck auctioneer, and tsm can go burn in hell.  Use aux.
---
Isn't it smaller?
---
This is completely inaccurate information. 
---
*WoR knockback resets threat across the board to ALL players, every time it happens.
---
*WoR knockback has absolutely nothing to do with your tank's threat level, it's based on the 3 lowest GUID numbers of people within melee range of Rag.  You could leave your entire melee group in range and if your MT still gets knocked back then that just means he has an unfortunate GUID number, nothing to do with threat at all.
---
Then I don't know what they meant!
---
9 NA servers have 60/40 in favor of Horde. 10 NA servers have 60/40 in favor of Alliance. So by your own standards, more servers are problematic in favor of Alliance, like he said.
---
No the, banned the ban and the players could play normally again. They canceled each other out.

Lmao you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. Heartseeker horde is a shit show. 4-5 alliance commonly take over the entire FP and bank area outside of Tuesday/Wednesday. You can‚Äôt go anywhere without getting ganked by alliance. I logged into Org tonight flagged from the day before and got ganked. After body jumping 4 times I finally hearted to Mojache to farm lashers. Went to get water came back dead. Tried to res and run 3 times before logging for the night. Every sever is like this for the less dominate faction. It‚Äôs not PvP, it‚Äôs unintentional griefing caused by the overpopulation.

Hmm idk, i may just have that rush of this is my first wow toon and dont want the xp journey to end lol. Like seeing that golden glow, ooof. I am excited to hit 60 and raid and before hand spend countless hours to get preraid bis for my toon but knowing no more xp at 60 kinda annoys me. Bc at that point ill only be playing for bis gear and gold farming, no more dings :/
---
Why is it so hard to understand that im talking about the base damage. If those 500dps include crit like in this example, obviously adding 2% crit won't make it 510dps, only ~508&gt;. 
---
The calculation gets hard if you change the base damage via attack power or a better weapon. That's when you have to decide between a bit more agi or a bit more ap for example. But since crit procs flurry it's pretty straight forward for warriors.
---
You‚Äôre kinda insufferable
---
If its any consolation, I cant be in Undercity on ZT without getting ganked.
---
Honestly itd be hilarious if they just merge Stalagg and Heartseeker.
---
Thanks all, I cant believe basically every comment was a different realm hahaha
---
Any insights on being a moonkin? Is there such thing as a great moonkin or are they mediocre at best?
---
I get so much spam from these fuckers i swear to god ive set so much theramore members on ignore but they just keep coming like some unstoppable plague do not join that cult
---
Ironically these all apply to alliance on my server. I spent 50 minutes getting to BRM on ZT EU. Good times ^^
---
Only BAD GUILDS care this much about whether mages or palas get it at the moment. It only matters during difficult progression and for all we know bwl is going to be a pushover just as MC was.

Gandling-EU as well. Experienced it yesterday.

Warrior tank in my guild farmed Uldaman for his epic mount but he‚Äôs geared to his tits.
---
I had a hard time finding groups only a month or so after launch
---
Just tryna get my honor so I can get my gear for pve stuff :(
---
I wonder why thay hadn't thought of that. 
---
Seems so simple when you put it that way.
---
Then its a good thing he never claimed to be. He is a paying customer expecting a basic service, which is functional in many mmos nowadays, to to actually work.
---
Im not a car mechanic, but I know damn well that changing the tire is not that difficult, because every shop I had it do can do it in an hour.
---
Yeah but they won‚Äôt be flying or porting in flagged, so it would make a difference
---
Great, let bots pay a subscription and fuck up the economy for half a year, then ban them once in the name of "we dont want the bot makers to know that we know", and then have the revised bot out a day later, and wait another 6 months.
---
Like i'm here reporting the most obvious fucking bots in the world farming in Azshara or whatever, but we have to let them keep going another 4 months, right? 
---
I cant even wrap my brain around how stupid that is.
---
Just go the warrior like your friend is asking you to. They're going to resent you for ignoring their advice to begin with. The sort of Rogue you're envisioning doesn't really work in a classic game environment for what you're planning on using it for.
---
I dont understand how you say 15 minutes, since after a few deaths, the res timer takes 2 minutes to expire.
---
Alliance Rogues can take upwards of 22 minutes to get to brs or mc, so I don't see how a non-stealth class is going to make it there in 15 minutes.
---
should have made him sell it. hes not gonna twink and hes gonna get a better upgrade later on
---
If you ban bots right away, you are giving them instant feedback on what behavior gets a bot banned. By waiting and banning in waves, you reduce the odds of botters figuring out how to circumvent your detection. If a bot is instantly banned, the owner can look through their own logs and possibly get a good sense of what tipped blizzards detection. 
---
Additionally, if you can identify what behaviors are common in currently used bots, you can use that data to identify a much larger number of bot accounts at once.
---
Think of it as something close to doctors not wanting someone to be always on antibiotics due to the risk of developing antibiotic resistant bacteria.
---
Met a mage from chapo this morning in the gourge, nice guy. Named started with an E
---
Damn, I wonder why they haven't thought about that....
---
They should hire you.
---
The walk back to brm from GY is like 2 minutes which is enough for the rest timer.
---
But there are broken mechanics in the game right now.
---
Seems like an easier solution would be to buy a new flash drive that isn‚Äôt a toaster.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of flash drives overheating, and I‚Äôve been pretty rough on them.
---
...wait, you can't change your own tire?
---
Then I think it's self-evident that it's going to take more than 15 minutes, no?
---
Didn't he bouble HS
---
Walls and buildings present good line of sight mechanics which is basically PvP 101. You see that tower in stormwind and you‚Äôre a druid? Well guess what that shit is now a metaphorical pillar in nagrand for you to endlessly hug and run in circles around.
---
From the gates of BRM to MC or UbRs is like 6 or 7 deaths. Give or take 12 to 15 minutes. I've been farming URBS all week and only a few times have I not had to corpse run it from the gates to BRM.
---
To be a real pro you have to blame the rest of the group for your failure.
---
If you only press 1 button and much else you're doing something wrong, my man.
---
This post is locked, and you all know why. Take the politics elsewhere people. You've got literally almost every other sub at your disposal to talk about it. It isn't going to happen here.
---
You don't seem like the brightest fellow.
---
Westlawl is the new Skylawl
---
So that's 14 minutes from the gates.
---
What about the 8+ deaths from thorium point?
---
Yeah but he's experiencing the game for the very first time, like rp killing every single mob and feeling immersed in the world. So I bet he'll have a ton of fun using this for the next 15 lvls. :)
---
And I'm a mage, so Gold won't be that big of an issue anyways. :D
---
Quality world PvP
---
if you ever wondered how some people take almost two hours for mc, youll find it in the comments here.
---
What about it? This whole discussion was about BRM, not getting to BRM.
---
I leveled a troll warrior to to 25. Only to remake a tauren warrior a few days later cause of aesthetics + I named him Heffakles. Leveled him 1-18 in a day and don't regret a thing.
---
Though my levelling partner isn't as happy...
---
Blizzard already begged me to switch to Gehennas I won't switch again
---
&gt; improved Weapon Totems
---
That's  crap.  It equates to maybe 3-4 ddps.
---
This reminds me of the old posts about Elitist Jerks. People hated that forum, but for learning you could do no better. You can try the other warrior discord, but it's not used often at all and I've found most information there is either from Fight Club anyways or it's just bad.
---
No warriors can't remove succubus.
---
Do you use tsm? If your not regularly checking the ah prices and using something like tsm to craft then you can‚Äôt conveniently make every potion with a profitable margin. If your only looking at a couple of the most common potions at specific times then of course you won‚Äôt have very much profit.
---
Haha I did coke with those guys before. From Stockholm Sweden.
---
This is funny, coming from someone who seems to have convinced his guild to transfer. So just accept that you made the whole thing worse for your original server and your new server.

Hahaha, you for real?

Because Dps one-handers are so spare the freaking Hypnotic Blade from SCARLET MONASTERY is a contender for BiS.

It depends. Black lotuses are fucking expensive on my server. Selling for like 70g per. I ain‚Äôt spending that for a Mc run.

Anastari is slightly better than Star of mystaria for PvE dps
---
Yes, I use the addon. And you could do the exact same thing you are doing with just mats without professions.
---
You sound triggered that you are one of those that wait 8 hours a day like it's a job desperately waiting for an ally to land at an fp so you can maybe get a tag on them. All that and you're still probably not even rank 4 yet lmao. But please, keep "getting your honor". How you waste your time is your business. Notice how all the horde in the pic are grunts? You don't even realize that you won't make it past rank 8 or 9 because there is so much competition within your own faction unless you pvp for 16 hours a day, but you will eventually. And you are going to be "sitting around" a lot more come dec 10.
---
Yikes.
---
Except I explained 2 reasons why it‚Äôs better already.
---
On my rogue they lasted until devilsaur legs at lvl 55
---
Yeah, very funny.
---
Yeah, and now I need to remove this Reddit account thanks to all awkward shit that can be tracked back to me!

hey cunt fart no its not it doesn't even make sense like my insult ye fookin cock waffle
---
i googled ‚Äúwow classic rogue discord‚Äù and found this https://classic.wowhead.com/discord-servers
---
I would've shared the sentiment if you're playing any other class since Warriors on endgame are about the most broken shit the game has to offer in Classic WoW. Literally the best single target DPS in the game, the best Tank, one of the better class at BGs (providing pocket healers are available). The only glaring downside I can think of from a Warrior is how much of a gold sink they are later on, but that's it.
---
Had a 19 twink visit me in Duskwood when I was around level 28, he absolutely ripped me!
---
ye i think theyre just trying to be edgy.

And both are basically worthless. The margin is either a pipe dream or you being on a shit server. The diversifying of the portfolio is a meme.

The most frustrating thing about this response to me is the "Thank you for taking the time to read my response".

Seriously, fuck that guy. That sentence annoys me so much after he did nothing to help you. Just apologise and end it.
---
damn man ive never used weakauras before and everytime i try idk wtf im doing need to watch some videos or something . anyways im mad jealous of your setup

You can do something , but not solo, multiple class abilities can counter it . group up or die

I didn't even start noticing the Rag threat reset until after the Onyxia fix.

If you go near the civilians yeah.

A few days ago I was getting camped INSIDE the kargath inn. If I went deep enough in guards would start spawning but they‚Äôre pretty easy for the mages to kill. Warrior that charged me a bunch kept dying though.
---
Check out HotW/MS build. Let‚Äôs you fill any of the roles easily, but from what you describe it‚Äôll just make all of that so much better. Gives you an instant heal on 3min CD, heals are a bit better and you don‚Äôt lose much for feral. The only thing I don‚Äôt have is the 3% crit for melee, but that‚Äôs meh anyway. Usually you‚Äôll have casters wrecking dps charts anyway. 
---
The build is pretty fun, I‚Äôm 0/30/21. It‚Äôs also useful for pvp.
---
lol herod isn't even bad 
---
join blood legion, tempest, or lost chapter. travel in packs. these guys constantly have control of the mountain and do a really good job. 
---
it's funny because on the thorium point side of searing gorge it's all horde ganking and on the kargath path it's all alliance ganking. 
---
add coolmatt to your friends. that guy always is putting up a nice fight and always has a goon squad with him, see where he is and try and do what you can to help him.

No, can't wait to read hord players cry because of bg queues.The salt will be real.

Surprisingly Golemagg-EU seems to be completely fine.
---
They can afford it.
---
It's satisfying.
---
okay dont believe me then lol
---
My hunter was over 5 days, like 5 days 14ish hours and my warrior was 11 days.
---
Keep in mind I leveled my warrior first, during the initial surge when it was really hard to complete any quests, also being one of the few tanks in my guild i did alot of circling back to help people run instances and help with stuff like farming ww axe etc.
---
If I sat down and leveled a warrior right now with the same mindset i've leveled my hunter I could see myself shaving off a couple days forsure. Either way, a hunter is drastically easier and faster than leveling a warrior
---
Yes, good warriors are better than good mages indeed. Best warriors do more dps than best mages. This point is good to me.
---
Will you attempt to move your goalposts even further or that's your only complaint?
---
you know i play an orc warlock and guess what id way rather have escape artist. being a gnome is reliable its a short cd and youre in charge of it whereas stun resist is dumb luck. id even rather have wotf than my stun resist because a good rogue will kill me even if a stun resists and ill kill a bad rogue if i dont resist any. but you know why i roll orc over gnome or undead? because i like the way it fucking looks. first of all gnomes look like dog shit and i couldnt roll a race for a racial and every other lock is undead. i rolled an orc lock to ride around on a wolf and look like a tank in my pvp gear and take damage like one too. making generalizations about the other faction can be light hearted fun but to actually think those generalizations about that other faction is fucking dumb. youre trying to fit thousands of people into a small box. it dont work like that mane.
---
And what is the goal? Why even ban bots if you let them bot freely for several months? Why is "detecting bots" important if you do nothing after detecting them? Again, what is the point of "identification" if you aren't going to do anything with this information?
---
Retail ruined swords for me. Since legion only assassination can use poison which really ruined it for me.

He did a lot of farming when layers were a thing. He clearly focused on black lotus.

300 is rating. Hit % doesnt add to weapon rating. You need 9% hit to not miss yellow dmg (skills). Hit % from gear and rating both contribuit to it. So with 305 rating you need another 6% hit on gear. You will need more if you ever get massive amounts of crit.
---
&gt; Warrior complaining about anything ever
---
&gt; And there really isn't much Blizzard can do to solve this problem.
---
Rolling out BG's at the same time as the honor system would have done much to keep this problem in check. There still would be everything we see today, but much less of it. I suspect it would be much closer to what Vanilla was.
---
because they are bad and thin kyou need to minmax pvp, ur literally losing 10% pve dmg by going sm/ruin over deep destro its extremely insignificant and improved immolate + conflag is so insane theres no reason to play without them unless you are full solo then you should try SL. Conflag locks are just insane in small group pvp the spec has comparable if not higher burst than MM hunters
---
What scum. Make sure this circulates around on Gehennas and  alert guild leaders about it.
---
It's OK to be annoyed as fuck by a bad situation.
---
It's total weapon damage, which includes the contribution from attack power.

"If you want balances go to retail. Everyone knows what they are getting into when coming to classic it's no surprise." - The most upvoted comment on a downvoted thread about how P2 will be terrible.
---
Retail pvpers were pretty much 90% Aliiance before Legion due to broken Human racial.
---
It's almost like a collection of many anecdotes can lead to in depth data :O
---
The SL build you're using is either a duelling build (designed for structured 1v1) or a bg build.
---
Open world isn't the same sort of pvp since there's a lot more unpredictable factors and a greater penalty for failure.
---
Personally, when I'm grinding I use the succubus because of the damage so I kill mobs better. If I get jumped? I death coil, fear and dot up and hope it's 1v1 and the fear doesn't break.
---
Or, what is actually the case: Threat is dropped even without the knockback landing.
---
Basically the difference between an Arcanine Reaper (264 high end damage) and Spinal Reaper (305) for a mortal strike or whirlwind should be less than 41 damage on a non crit even on a target with zero armor (AR has more AP than SR so it should be closer to 38. The weapon speed normalisation means AR no longer has the slow speed advantage of 3.8 &gt; 3.4 of SR). 
---
TLDR: weapon damage matters more than speed which is why slow weapons are better, but dps will increase weapon damage anyway so high dps &gt; slow speed if the weapon damage is close.
---
My group had 2 back to back HoJ drop and I never had to farm it again.
---
Normally I laugh these off. Confirmation bias is a huge thing.
---
There is no way I am buying pseudo rng does a good job in the game. With the GUID bugs and many more bugs, Blizz no longer gets my benefit of a doubt.
---
It seems to be consistently the case that groups see the same loot. It is so often that people get something quickly or that you do many tens of runs never to see it. Then when you do change up the players it drops.
---
Yes, I know. Normally the effects of pseudo RNG. Not buying it here tho. Bindings seem super scuffed as well.
---
Because making a website that doesn't make them money isn't a priority.
---
I know a guy with 71k that was a couple weeks ago
---
I was farming in a 3rogue group did 3 full reset runs and got it on the forth, adding to that 2 'normal' runs got it after 19killls.
---
Important to mention that the 19th kill was also the first time I saw it drop (lucky me)
---
Your addons are horrifingly bad. Cant even tell whats happening LOL, no wonder you cant defend your self.
---
Mage is not gear dependant, if you have good weapons rogue isn't too. Don't pick warriors or some other time consuming class. It takes 2 hours to clear MC in alt run, 30 mins for ony. Get gear in first few weeks of 60 and then respec fully into PvP and enjoy yourself.
---
Totally agreed, but think it may be somewhat countered by how many rolled warriors for pve godhood and relentlessly pursued those fucking irritating bis lists like the holy grail
---
Warriors in leather in pvp are going to get a shock, even with healers backing them up
---
"FFS healer heal me"
---
"I am, but their warrior hits you for twice as much damage"
---
You're saying the bots play WoW within virtual machines to prevent Warden from seeing other processes?
---
As an exile from Skeram, I‚Äôd say almost ANY situation is better than that 4v1, so obviously you‚Äôd take the opportunity to leave even if it means you‚Äôre now on the stacked side of the 4v1. When you‚Äôre on the minority faction of the server by such an extreme margin, you practically can‚Äôt play the game, logging into a server where you can still play, but don‚Äôt get tons of PvP is a small price to pay.
---
Any secrets spots you want to share?
---
English is not my native language, like a lot of people on the internet, did i really have to break this down for you?
---
(I know this is the clssic sub, but) pure white fur tauren dk looks awesome :P

It really is though. While 1% crit is very good for paladins, it's not nearly good enough to the point where aurastone is "not even a decent secondary option".
---
OmniCC
---
Appearance is pretty easy but I've already deleted three hunter alts at levels 15-17 because I wasn't satisfied with their character names. Naming is the hardest part for me.
---
Not yet. Because you can't get hit cap.
---
Get a bag for yourself and a bag in your bank. Keep both filled.
---
You'll burn through a ton of shards if you raid or PvP.
---
I'd hang on to star of mystaria if only to switch to it on banish duty. Same story for the T1 chest.
---
That‚Äôs not what anecdotal means. Wowhead‚Äôs calculations are *the polar opposite* of ‚Äòanecdotal‚Äô. In this case, this here is the very essence of what an anecdote means or doesn‚Äôt.
---
You have statistics. You have a sample. The sample has a size. The sample represents the collective minus bias. The sample *is independent*.
---
You're right, I don't know which servers are PvE/PvP, as I don't play on NA. Going through them in alphabetical order, this is about how far I got:
---
Anathema: 55/45 in favor of Alliance.
---
ArcaniteReaper: 68/32 in favor of Alliance.
---
&gt;The reverse is happening on **every other pvp server**
---
Whoops, turns out you were lying. ‚ô•
---
So i whine once about people whining 50+ times a week, seems logical to me, is this somehow uncomprehendable by you? Its not really rocket science
---
OmniCC.  Old favorite that I've been using for as long as I can remember.  Unfortunately it doesn't play nice with perl, xperl, zperl, and the others I've tried.  It should my cooldowns but not others.  There's probably just some button I don't have mashed.
---
Hey I have this green sword "of the bear"..... and this other green sword "of the falcon" I was just wondering which one I should be using?  
---
Holy shit read a sentence before you ask a discord full of minmaxers about a useless leveling weapon lol all the info you need is already pinned  
---
Anyone I see complaining about "abuse" from fight club is asking something I can find in pins, so I dont feel bad
---
I don't have time to reroll, game is sometimes broken, like disconnecting from the game client, lags with bigger pvp. I quit. Maybe I will come back in middle of January, but if the game will be still like that I will just say goodbye to blizzard
---
It's not a visual bug, it has been confirmed by blizz that there is an issue and you are legit losing honor. They said there is no way to refund said honor, "so go do some more PVP to gain more honor" is basically what they said.. even though the bug will lose most of that honor too.
---
1st
---
na just Fett
---
Exactly.
---
I rolled Mining-Engineering on my Shaman and I miss tailoring so much from my other server.
---
I used to make bags and whatnot for everyone (and myself), and life was so convinient.
---
Now I feel lucky because i got 12 slots for real cheap, relatively early, but before that, inventory management was a nightmare because of mining-engineering taking a lot of spaces.
---
Oh you can scroll down on other posts and find more info.
---
S c r u b
---
I just explained why pallys are weak and you still say i underestimate them. Yes they are hardy, nobody is saying otherwise, i dont know why you feel the need to repeat it, but, again, while bubble is amazing, its not good enough to be considered the best pvp healer. Their lack of mobility hurts. Having 1 spell school is a huge detriment. Bop and freedom can both be dispelled and without them why not use a priest instead?  
---
Like its cool that they can self peel and stay alive but that simply means the focus target becomes someone else. MS means your heals cant keep up and good luck healing someone who gets hit by windfury especially when warriors are dealing 900 dmg on a regular melee swing crit.
---
Your entire approach here is non-sensical. You are not getting an independent sample. Not everyone is as likely to comment in a post like this. Not everyone is as accurate and truthful here.
---
Those two ‚Äúnot‚Äùs are what we call a bias and they are the reason why your approach can never yield the answers you are seeking. They can only lead to you adding a bias by trying to confirm a suspicion of yours.
---
This comment is actually true aside from one small correction: everyone SHOULD know what they are getting into. Retail players facing a reality check is a pure joy though.
---
Meanwhile im here enjoying the shit out of the game, enjoying the PVP and the dangerous world. I got ass raped like 17 times yesterday  trying to get to my priest quest because there was a raid wiping EPL still enjoying the shit out of it. Love the world beeing dangerous.
---
Yup. Used my old school ipod before it got stolen
---
All your questions depend on anecdotal experiences. So no reliable objective answer can be given.
---
In general, warlocks are great in PvP and PvE. And will always be sought after. But thankfully, you won't be competing against 12 of the same class every raid.
---
You're absolutely right. But you can bet that I will use the "YOU KNEW WHAT YOU SIGN UP FOR!" line.
---
Lol are you serious? Its the fuckin alliance crying their eyes out on the forums, the horde is having a blast my man, not sure how you thought you made sense with this comment
---
An amazing achievement. Hopefully you‚Äôll be able to get to 60 once world PvP quietens down a bit, due to BGs arriving.
---
this makes u happy? its like 2-3g worth lol
---
I agree. Im just trying to find the damage difference and i think i found it. Ill update the post with a google Doc.
---
I mean open your fuckin eyes, its all about alliances crying like little babies, this is what this subreddit is for.
---
My current warlocks name is popsumpills
---
I did. Ill update the original post with the damage google doc i made. Its a pretty rough outline
---
I don't want to hear it. GRIZZLY camps BRM, Feralas, and WPL/EPL non-stop.

Thank you. I made a google docs ill update the OP with it. I appreciate you pointing these factors out for me.

It‚Äôs definitely gonna make a difference for the people who can pop supreme power. If you got enough casters the entire raid using it will probably significantly improve the clear time. But it just comes down to whether it‚Äôs worth the effort. Naxx will eventually come out and require people to grind their face into the wall for consumables. 
---
Will be cool to see the spread sheet.
---
haha i agree

very true

The more you guys whine, the more im gonna go out of my way to kill alliances, this crybaby mentality is starting to get annoying.

A few hundred gold comes easy.

The joy of an upgrade when you're that new to wow is something you can't ever buy later, or in 15 years.

We've always know, crybabies tend to play Alliances, the proof is in the pudding
---
I hope you are still having fun :)
---
Or group up and fight. But hey, I guess bitching on reddit will surely help.

True for world quests but irrelevant for dungeons.

Yeah im currently trying to find some new mobs to grind after grinding Nagas in remote Isle of dread in feralas but so far death, so much death everywhere..

---
Level all to 35 then you‚Äôve got no choice
---
Lol
---
There are plenty of people rolling alts, slow levellers and even some new people. Just dive in. The experience is a lot more balanced than it was at launch where every single quest mob was camped.
---
"Their gear" is offspec gear though. Stuff they won't be using for their main role. It would be like if a decent Mage PVP piece dropped and nobody wanted to spend points so they vendor it. It benefits nobody to vendor it if somebody is going to use it in some context.  
---
Rogues and hunters get a ton of tier gear already, and you think they should get rings/neck over fury warriors who don't get tier? Just because something is purple doesn't mean it should count towards loot. Yeah, let's jsut vendor Might and Cenarion to gimp our raid options. What's that? A tank or healer didn't show up today? If only somebody had offspec gear to help out...
---
The answer is pretty simple, pick a char and stick with it.
---
Like I said, good warriors are only good when they can attack. Which they can't in many fights. You because you argue for warrior, doesn't mean you have to roleplay one int wise.
---
The cougar‚Äôs fangs sealed my fate. The world of the cows... can no longer comfort meee

When you roll a new alt on a new server you have zero gold so
---
4so you just need 1 friend to make an alt with the name?  Impossible
---
I stopped playing retail, because of massive lags. Let's say you are in New zone Nazjatar and there is pvp event on - game was lagging badly. I wanted play with warmode on, but I needed to turn it off so less lags.
---
I love old content, getting mounts, pets, transmo. Usually had someone to farm old raids together.
---
I had a lot of fun in Legion.
---
BFA? I played since launch. I don't like the idea of titan forge. Like you doing some instances or raids with luck you can have better gear than mythic raiders. You're loot is a lottery. I had enough when on one day I got the same item from instance and then from weekly chest (after finishing 10 plus key). Then I went for raid, I got a bis chest, roll a dice for extra loot and get the same chest. For some reason you can't giveaway one to someone else after you use dice. It was my loot. Another hunter got like 6 items in the same run. I was playing hard for 1 month from patch to be geared and I had less than a person who didn't even try play hard.
---
People are toxic. Not many says hi when you grab a group on LFG. If you make mistakes they are aggressive. I had few nice runs, but mostly people are bad. Everyone wants to have the highest ilvl and doing big dps, even if they die because they don't care about mechanics...
---
I love that world, but I feel I'm wasting time now and money.
---
Well now you can roll to a PVE server and do it all again : D
---
I approve this message and will do my part
---
It's not bullshit. We already knew that this was the meta on private servers and has been for many years. Anyone who even cared to look in to it would expect phase 2 to be a fuckfest. People just thought that we were still in 2006 and rolled on a PvP server. Literally everyone who took some time out of their day to think how bad phase 2 could be already knew it was going to be a fuckfest.
---
Good man
---
No more facts, please. I‚Äôve run out of post-its and I‚Äôm already on thin ice with my boss.
---
Now thats a good one!! Nah, just trying to shake things up and make some drama for the future!
---
Wow. That's almost double the amount of horde than alliance...
---
If you're competetive, it's not going to be fun at all to do some non-meta shit and not be able to compete.
---
For Starter, clean it and change the thermal paste. That should make a huge difference.
---
Then maybe buy one of these "cooler mats" with fans, you can put your laptop on top off, so it can draw more air from the bottom.
---
&gt;Also, how do you even effectively control so many characters?
---
They don't, as you can see.
---
Hey man thanks for the indepth answer. I apreciate it
---
It may show up on a report anyway, depending on the infrastructure. I‚Äôd catch engineers trying to use pirated software from USB‚Äôs all the time, certain file types will probably be flagged.
---
Pvp in a pvp server, staggering !
---
Benediction 4 Life!
---
Someone posts exact thing every time
---
Same thing with working keyrings.  Those are hard to implement as well.
---
With enough read write they can get pretty toasty, never heard of one requiring a heat sink tho.
---
That's exactly what blizzard has, it's called warden and it checks your computer for running processes.
---
mages have it the easiest in this game  
---
Wariors have it the worst  
---
and for some reason mages ride around looking for warriors to wand down while they laugh at them crawl around from slows
---
We wouldn‚Äôt need to fight off Alliance camping Orgrimmar 24/7 anymore!
---
Try a horde character, you might find the horde zones hold your interest better
---
Unless you want to, then go for it.
---
&gt;If you don't know them yourself, I won't bother. 
---
Of course I don't know bosses like this because they exist only in your brain deep drown in denial. Feel free to prove me wrong but oh wait: you can't.
---
Giving Ragnaros, Shazzrah or Geddon as an example of fights where warrior can happily sit on them all fight is beyond pathetic. Even on Ony an average warrior ranks above average mage as down as a 99%-60% from all logs taken at this percentiles. I wonder how does it feel to have your next goalpost burned, huh?
---
You‚Äôve never had to repeat yourself thousands of times to thousands of people asking the same thing and demanding you do something just for them, and made a mistake? 
---
Oh no everyone else is perfect.
---
&gt;when in reality the issue is that the alliance is largely comprised of people that don‚Äôt want to play on pvp servers. We can‚Äôt help that your faction doesn‚Äôt want to pvp. 
---
Lmao low quality b8
---
noone's too young for austin powers. you go watch that shit and then come back and be a better person for it
---
How a paladin fares depends entirely on the competency of the team collective. A Paladin is a supporter (if they're healing). No matter how good the Paladin is, if the teammates cannot make the most of the opportunities they're presented the Paladin is not going to seem like anything special. The Paladin is there to 'facilitate' whatever actions their teammates are trying to perform, that's why you (as an opponent) take notice when a target gets Freedom, gets BoP, gets Cleansed.
---
***
---
Holy Shock is a 30 second cooldown (and needs 31 deep)
---
+ 30 second holy shock (heal or damage nuke) vs 35 second stun (for 6 seconds)
---
+ Which one will you notice more?
---
+ Note: I'm assuming that you'd agree that it's very unlikely that either ability would be used 100% of the time off cooldown due to the nature of combat, and in that respect the 5 second difference is negligible and thus this is a meaningful choice.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
5% Crit Chance (5/5 Holy Power)
---
+ The value of this depends on how much crit you had without it
---
+ This comes down to probability theory, but the more crit you have (total) the more valuable the additional crit becomes as far as reliability is concerned.
---
Divine Favor
---
+ 1 guaranteed crit every 2 minutes.
---
All of the deep holy talents (as far as healing is concerned) grant you is the opportunity to get slightly higher burst healing (with the by-product of this burst being slightly more mana due to mana return on crits). If it is a given that I'm not going to go oom before I die then the mana longevity is of little value. I might get slightly more burst healing if I land some crits but if I don't crit at all then I get nothing.
---
How long do you expect an engagement in a battleground to last, whether it be 10 man WSG zergs, or mini-squads fighting around flags in AB/AV? It isn't like retail where anyone and everyone can self heal and live forever and a day. [Dartol's Rod of Transformation](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5462/dartols-rod-of-transformation) looks (gives) the same glow effect as casting a Holy Spell and with the limitations on cast-bars in Classic it is insanely easy to 'fake-cast' to bait out interrupts and then safely heal with concentration aura preventing all knockback. Rogues cannot trinket out of stuns (as an example) which makes them extremely susceptible to getting sniped by your friendly neighborhood Warrior.
---
[Another slight variation](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05-0532510003315-0520530102) which is less anti-melee and more generic damage output lets you pick up Seal of Command to capitilise on your lower stun time in addition to reckoning procs. You just ditch the shield (if there's no melee around) and swing around a 2hander. You give up Spiritual Focus though (so your ability to shrug off cast knockback is decreased if a Hunter has Broken Tooth on you or something) but your potential burst damage output more than makes up for that.
---
loser
---
this is the RP i'd join. not for "I, ANZIMAG THE NIGHT ELF HERO, CASTS 5 MAGIC MISSILES"
---
I've seen them too. Certain that the buyouts are automated, it's too fast for a human.
---
good pt
---
I was helped by a horde rogue on Herod in hour 4 of trying to complete In Dreams on my hunter. I won't make them in case they don't want the label Alliance helper but to many thanks to the rogue who saw through Snapshot's FD and didn't take the easy gank.
---
sigh, another one of these pathetic troll posts.
---
Benediction is roughly 40/60 in favour of Horde. I wouldn' call it "evenly balanced", just hasn't gone past the point of no return with Alliance transferring off en masse. A solo player from either faction is still going to have a very rough time in questing areas or neutral towns, and Menethil Harbor is still being harassed by Horde rogues nearly 24/7. Horde campers are just a lot more persistent at staying in the same area where as Ally deathsquads tend to move around very quickly.
---
the point of cities that they are SAFE zones, even on a PVP server.
---
they cannot attack you in a city unless you attack first or did attack in the past 10 minutes. (in that case just pause for 10 minutes)
---
2-3 golds on a new character help more than 100 golds on a lvl 60
---
Lmao like blizzard doesnt know. They're completely okay with letting bots pay for subs. It's a neural net bot or a script with varied rng mixed in. That's it. There's nothing else aside from paying a Venezuelan 10 cents an hour.
---
This has been their excuse for about a decade now. Like every other company that have bots pay for subs. You have to manually go after bots hard but every damn company is cheating out on player support, and QA. Fucking Econ majors ruined games.
---
what did you expect when doing that rofl.
---
It should be noted however that the forms for that community or both notorious for functioning like that and made it openly known through their rules that they function like that.
---
sorry to spoil it for you, but 16 hours a day doesn't mean the SAME players are doing it 16 hours, they take shifts
---
Not when I typed this, 2 months ago lol :P
---
there is nothing honorable about stealthing around, nothing. 
---
it's like 1 step up from camping flight points
---
Healing with a Paladin is super fun! You can level ret and heal dungeons up to 50 with just some healing gear to swap into 
---
Be proud you have a bunch of lvl 35 toons they can be profession alts
---
Dont think mage is that gear dependant
---
On kurinaxx awhile ago, there was 15 hunter bots on for like 36 hours straight. They were camping the hyppos in feralas.
---
 Tanaris ogres were popping with em too. Me and this random guy were finding ways to break the bots. If you kill their pet, they just sit on the ground for like 20 minutes. 
---
We killed one while it was hearthing and it never came back. We had alot of fun messing with and breaking the bots lol.
---
&gt;People are so obsessed with what is meta, what is best, they just don't do what they want.
---
Part of the issue is you either adopt it or fall behind. It's not like you have clashing styles now, the best way has been figured out.
---
I want to add in a few more things before i send the spreadsheet. Im doing just raw DPS so its assuming no resist and no resistances. Id like to add in things like +% damage too as a warlock. Ill try to make it nice.
---
&gt; But you will be running around in almost full plate **in no time**. If you choose 2 farm **rank 13**.
---
That's a good one.
---
Very helpful, thanks. Do the eight points in SS and redoubt make sense for Paladins in BGs who find themselves drawing a ton of attention and kiting that attention around?
---
He.., seems like you never played at RP or PR PVP servers, they are full with this stuffs
---
Are you ok?
---
If you're a mage or a priest then it is
---
lol they brought Dire maul earlier too. Besides it dont matter so many quit already.
---
except that we start with a 16 slot bag, so it would be from 16 to 40
---
Getting to BRM is horrible, 10 corpse runs to get in is not uncommon. Has nothing to do with PvP, pure gankery
---
That hat tho
---
Same problem on every server. I play horde on a german server where we‚Äòre the dominant faction (surprisingly, right?) and the honor grind is an actual chore (sunk cost fallacy). There‚Äòs a rogue bot in the burning steppes farming ogres 24/7. People literally queue in line for their 4 kills and 500 daily honor. Been that way for weeks now. Blizz doesn‚Äòt care as long as they cash in another $13.
---
It seems EU is way more balanced for...reasons
---
jeez, what kind of magic is this?  I have to roll gnome lolitas as alts to get this much in freebies  (although I once got a trash epic weapon at lvl 9 because they had already tried to sell it unsuccessfully 3 times, I could sell it for 20g so that was a nice boost)
---
Even then, they wasted less time than you did being dead
---
I also hit unbalanced pvp server levelcap on 2 of my alts yesterday. After leveling up i instantly had a 5 man group of lvl 60's farming me.
---
Don't overthink it. Pick one you like playing and stick to it.
---
At least on noggenfogger there aren't many hunters and therefore easy to gear through pugs. They are also the least gear dependent
---
Classic has become a total shitshow for most players at this point, the player base is extremely toxic these days sadly!
---
In world PvP, SL locks can usually destroy with 3 items. 
---
Limited Invunl. Potion
---
Restorative Potion
---
Free Action Potion
---
Use these potions (if you can afford them) until you have multiple pieces of felheart and T2 helm. The Stam from this gear will carry you. +Shadow dmg gear is nice and great for PvE but will leave you lacking in health
---
I don't think that's how RDRAND works bud
---
&gt; Unfortunately, shaman tanks tend to fall off fast post 40. You don't have nearly the health or damage reduction compared to full plate.
---
Shaman tanks can very much tank past 40 without any issues, managing to also tank raids if the right amount of effort is applied.
---
How‚Äôs leveling a rogue?
---
Only on grob &lt;3
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/U4KhAuM](https://imgur.com/gallery/U4KhAuM)  OH NO, THERE'S A COUGAR. 
---
Sorry for shoddy camerawork
---
First question - are you playing Alliance? Locks are unfavoured against undead, no matter the spec. 
---
Regardless:
---
Succubus is the offensive pet. When jumped on, your only chance is to charm the attacker, but it requires him to misplay. 
---
Of course, Voidwalker is the "trihard" pet. Its the tankiest so opponent cant easily nuke it. The sacrifice can be used even when YOU are cc-ed, which means unless opponent is able to cc you, cc pet, and nuke pet without either cc dropping (practically impossible) then you will able to get full shield value anyway. However, I say "trihard", because the pet in itself is completely useless, especially in group PvP. 
---
For PvP, Felhunter should be to-go choice. Its obviously superior against all casters. However, its also superior agaisnt rogues, as it grants improved stealth detection and allows you to see them before they jump on you. Its a game changer against rogues. 
---
Specifically with Felhunter, losing against mage is impossible. Just don't cast Shadow Bolts or drain life so he can't shadow lock you. Dot him. Keep pet on him. Silence his frostbolt with felhunter. You can even dispell his barrier. If you need more dmg spam searing pain.
---
You've got to be horde? Benediction is definitely not balanced but us alliance are putting up a good fight.
---
I'm gonna say the same as Horde to be honest. Feels like Alliance are way more involved in WPvP. But maybe it feels like that on both sides.
---
That's a good honor farm
---
Yeh pally damage is so bad that a ret ain‚Äôt gonna be an issue without some hardcore insane gear and huge rng. But a group with pally healers? You‚Äôre fucked.
---
The key talents for flag running are:  
---
- Nature‚Äôs grasp, obviously a good root
---
- Natural Shapeshifter, spam a form for removing slows and roots
---
- Feral Charge, spell interrupt and propel yourself forward
---
- Furor, for Feral Charge
---
- Nature‚Äôs swiftness, big insta heal
---
- Swiftmend, low cd insta heal
---
Others you can kinda choose how you like but flag running is all about staying alive and moving fast so talents like improved rejuvenation are good to pick.  
---
Gear wise, you need to get either rare pvp 4 set or epic pvp 3 set for the movement speed and also enchant your boots.  
---
If you are hardcore, you also have engineering (grenades) and blacksmithing (30 sec fear immune trinket) as your professions and stock up on those free action potions from AH or a friend.
---
Just reroll to a PVE like myself and countless others did. Haven't looked back. I can choose when I PVP now
---
hit does have an effect on feign death

Truth:

25% stun resist passively + BF, or WotF and Cannibalize.

You know what makes depression worse? Playing WoW.

You need real life interactions with people and you need a lot of sun light and exercise assuming you want to stop being depressed.

That's not the life most people dream of, in fact most people laugh at it.

Please tell me you're not a paramedic or work in A&amp;E / ER
---
Firemaw is one of the more balanced servers, lol
---
Oh no
---
unskilled horde spotted
---
I have the exact same problem! It's ruining the game for me as I'm also stuck between  a full server (mograine) alliance and medium server (earthshaker) horde.
---
I have a 39humanrouge, 33dwarfwarrior and 22gnome mage.
---
Then 38undead warlock and 23orc rouge.
---
I'm just constantly re rolling but now stressing that when bg arrive, dungeons and raids will become harder to find at 60 and I'm going to miss endgame content as well as finding a space on a nice guild roster.
---
Amost giving up!
---
Yeah someone beat you to it by 5 hours lol
---
Oh no, spy circlejerk is gone and now faction based queues circlejerk has started. Good luck every one.
---
Before early BGs were announced we used to joke "every lowbie ganked is a potential angry reddit post, and every angry reddit post gets us closer to an early release of BGs". Now we're just killing your alts for shits and giggles. Your tears really are delicious.
---
I spend some time farming honor inside capital cities. I tell the randoms to leave alone anyone under 48 but they don‚Äôt always listen
---
Yeah turns out not being able to play the game makes people quit
---
Dont tell me what to do thx.
---
Because you can‚Äôt get icecap inside a dungeon - while u can get dreamfoil inside dm completely safely.
---
I'll tell you how my experience goes on a balanced server. 
---
I log out after some pvp on my corpse where a 10 man raid is on. 8 hours later I log on again and see the same raid still standing on my corpse. 3 hours later same shit. I'm just raid logging at the moment since this is not fun and quite stupid. There's no real reward from pvp either since the good rewards require an excessive amount of playtime, and they feel bad to pursue due to decay. The exalted rewards from WSG / AV are more worth it to pursue since no decay (and the rewards are quite good in p3/p4).
---
The game literally rewards this type of behaviour. If you want to be angry, he angry at blizz for dictating this kind of gameplay.
---
It's your job as a Druid to fill the hole in whatever group you're in.  Especially while leveling when you're able to play all rolls with no investment.
---
You should be embracing this.  Best perk of the class honestly.
---
If you want the group to wait around for 20 minutes looking for a healer your level, they're going to start considering replacing you with a better DPS that's easier to find.
---
This just isn't true. I've been playing horde on firemaw since day one and alliance are far more coordinated in their group pvp. Whenever I approach BRM/onyxia, alliance are far more often in control than horde. Silithus/EPL/Winterspring can be a bit of a mixed bag and it can be either way there though.
---
True. I levels a druid as my main and today I‚Äôm a healer. If they ask me to do dungeons as a tank I‚Äôll simply reply that I don‚Äôt have good gear (it‚Äôs outdated since ZF) and I‚Äôm at a full resto spec. So I wo t be a good tank for dungeons in my lvl range. I then proceed to tell them that I‚Äôll do my best to help find a tank and we always do find one. Back when I leveled I ranked dungeons since I was a feral tank for the leveling process. I would tank or be a dps and if they asked me, if they where nice about it or it would take too long to find a heal (which never happened, since I would tank and heals are easier to find than tanks) then I would heal. If they don‚Äôt ask me and assume that I‚Äôm a healer in those moments, I‚Äôll run through the dungeon as a cat and let everyone die. Sorry guys, you invited me as a dps and didn‚Äôt even ask me your problem.
---
ehhhh mages in theory will scale better with full naxx gear (T3) and atiesh 
---
the number of guilds and mages who will be rocking that is low.
---
What movie is this from again?
---
Woosh
---
Oh thanks sherlock. It‚Äòs not that he‚Äòs implying they are not worth by much and that there isn‚Äòt a need of screening this but ok.
---
Oh no, I'm a monster D:
---
Its funny seeing both sides of the same server complain its "completely unbalanced". 
---
What's probably happening is certain level brackets are weighted in one factions favour and people on the receiving end of the ganking are deciding the entire server must be like this.
---
I'm currently 46, went from enh to ele at 42 and have been really enjoying it. I still have a few pieces of +heal gear that I only use in dungeons, like the mace from sm cath.
---
Nope.Basic stats are more important. You need stamina and intelligence for sustainability.
---
And this sub would have thrown a tamper tantrum, because "Blizzard killed world pvp, which is the best thing since sliced bread reeeee"
---
Why is it that I get ganked over and over and over in gadgetzan without bruisers doing fuck all after blizz had "improved their range etc"? Are all allies on my server suddenly exalted with all goblins?
---
"Uh oh its the weekend so all the kids on alliance are online". Having played on both factions now I can tell you, no fucking kids are playing this game. also both factions are just as bad as eachother and make all the same stupid excuses.
---
BGs will only make it worse for alliance. Unlike before, the horde will outnumber you even more in the world since they will have BG queues and alliance won't.
---
This post has so much misguided information on it , I don't know where to start.
---
Gehennas as a server is not balanced at all. At 60, there are an insane amount of horde players compared to alliance, with the majority of streamers and people believing it to be 70:30 ratio at level 60.
---
Secondly, Gehennas is well known to be the private server players server with the majority of players from Northdale coming to play on Gehennas. There are a lot of guilds who are actively pvping and ranking , it's not just the two guilds that you've stated.
---
Finally, there are multiple reasons why someone would roll on a pvp server compared to a pve server. You dont need to be a hardcore ranker to actually want to play on these servers.
---
No that is not a yeesh. People are still recruiting heavily, and there will always be pug runs if you aren't able to join a guild quickly.
---
you are prize to life another day
---
I‚Äôve never once been rezzed by space bar
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Dolphins live in schools or pods of up to 12 individuals.
---
It's not for everybody for sure but this is the "Fight Club spirit" that was here long before Classic and it's not going to change to pander to a broader audience. Sorry you don't like it, hopefully you can look past it and still benefit from the discord.
---
Your hatred makes us stronger. Let it flow through you.
---
My screen's basically emitting salt at this point.
---
You probably have never seen 1-2 man ganking people in major cities. Stormwind is decently defended, but Ironforge guards are a joke.
---
Anywhere near blackrock mountain os under horde lockdown 80% of the day, EPL lights hope usually hardcamped. Feralis near DM 5 deaths from dm enterance to any dungeon not concidering the deaths at flightpath and roaming mages and rogues ccing you down. Menthil harbour?? Ususlly rogues ganking on the dock and 20 hordes spamming aoe on wetlands boat.
---
Sub level 20 spells have very low "spell coefficient", so +20 spell power won't increase your Rank 1 Shadow Bolt by 20 damage.  
---
IIRC Shadow Bolt have 87%, but low ranks have half of that - so you will only get ~40% from +20, and your damage would be increased by +8.  
---
Still good, but not "drastically good". Anyway, it's much better than other options at low levels, like int/stam/spirit.
---
Honor too early, BGs too late, pick 1
---
Newsflash: it won't. Horde will have long queues in BGs and there will be even less alliance in the world. Horde will be forced to wPvP in queue and with all of alliance having instant queues, sitting at battlemasters, flightmasters will be the only spot where horde can actually farm honor whilst waiting for queue to pop.
---
In a raid environment, is it more time/dmg efficient to lifetap in between my regular rotation, or to perform multiple lifetaps in a row and then bandage/pot/hs etc back up in one go?
---
Nevermind that WTF is Drejan doing trying to get into the squad! Fuck off Drejan!!!
---
&gt;OP has been talking about being benched because they'd forget their Onyxia necklace. So much so that they are fucking afraid of making a mistake in the game, talk about entertainment.
---
I know, i am that OP.
---
I was not making that point, i was saying i felt bad enough that I let a bunch of people down (RL included) that I doubt i'll ever forget it again even if i am messing with inventory. 
---
&gt;Where did you understand that OP's guild was hard-core and trying their damnedest to clear fucking Onyxia (as 40 people...)
---
We do it as 20 man split raiding. I was saying it generally if you forget a necklace as a 20 man, you waste 20 to 40 peoples time x 4 mins with summon, 10 or so minutes x 20 to 40 peoples time without a summon.
---
I get reading comprehension isn't your strong suit, but i'm fairly sure what i said was reasonably easy to understand.
---
pve server omegalul
---
If you read the long user agreement when making your WOW account you'll see that you sign away all your rights to blizzard upon creation. They can literally scan your entire PC at will whenever the game is running. It's always been this way and there's nothing illegal about it. You signed your rights away.
---
I joined a PUG UBRS yesterday and the tank went afk as we were on the ledge above the Rookery. 
---
Everyone was just messing around and after about 2 minutes the hunter/raid leader said, ‚Äúok I‚Äôm just gonna pull. I can solo these guys so we‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù 
---
He pulled a group from the bottom of the steps and immediately got punted into the Rookery. Like 10 dragons hatched and he feigned death. We cleared the orcs he pulled and then watched him die as he proceeded to pull more hatchlings and two of the Handlers. 
---
We were able to clean up his mess (I think only one other person died) and the dude left the group before we could rez him. 
---
We proceeded to clear the raid with nine of us. 
---
I like to think that was his ‚Äúpro gamer move‚Äù.
---
Not really 2-3 gold even for a level 1 is pretty much nothing, maybe a few health pots that would be useful but that's about it
---
I am from Pyrewood, so talking about it, I do not have much knowledge of other servers.
---
Hey look, another thread where a horde player is saying how ok phase 2 is. I‚Äôm shocked!
---
Benediction by the way is almost 60:40 horde: alliance. So there‚Äôs literally 50% more of your faction. If you had that imbalance in literally any other game people would riot. Imagine playing CS:GO where the game is 8v5!
---
Those numbers are extremely rough.  Reason being it‚Äôs just based on people seen in raids that were logged by someone in the raid.  I‚Äôd wager there‚Äôs plenty of level 60s puggin raids that have no one logging them and uploading it.
---
They're imbalanced but that site is crap. Awfully cooincidental how close to the wowhead census those numbers are lol...
---

---
That's from 9/14 before either set of transfers. Am I to believe transfers affected Fairbanks less than 1%? Spoiler it was affected far more.
---
That was pretty awesome dude, Shame your not in razorgore or I would be coming for that booty
---
No, that's not true anymore. First week after p2 launched horde were dominating everywhere, but now it's more balanced. I play horde and I have to corpse walk in to the bed every day now.
---
That too. Stupid spell.
---
having 4 random guys on party of 20 guilds doesnt make that guilds on a big thing, there are only 2 good guilds doing PVP on gehennas
---
&gt;You must be a gold farming god, huh? To say that 2-3 gold is nothing on a  fresh character on a fresh server really displays your intellect and  godlike knowledge of the game.
---
I don't gold farm at all and 1-2g is still absolutely nothing, for that to be a lot you either need to be spending like 30 minutes a day on the game or intentionally avoiding profit for some reason.
---
Especially with the fresh shield too! Classic
---
No there is not 50+ post of people whining about others whining, thats a blatant lie. 
---
If peoples only experience with the game are negative like this subreddit makes it seem, why even play it. Why deliberatly play a game that you seemingly have no fun in?
---
Yeah I guess. I've been questing on Blaumeux no problem and I hear we are terribly unbalanced as well. Just lucky I guess, plus not quite as high pop as some other servers.
---
Horde will have LONG bg queues. With less alliance in the world after BGs are out, anyone they find WILL be corpse-camped. It's downhill from here, but people failed to see it and cried for BGs since day 1 of phase 2 and think it's some sort of solution to the state of world PvP.
---
I do not think 1.12 AV has herbs.
---
Heartseeker was relatively balanced until the transfers opened. Then a ton of alliance from stalagg and other servers come to heartseeker not knowing it would skew the balance so hard
---
Modern m.2 nvme ssd's can hit very high temps like the 105¬∞ cap in "normal" operation. So its not uncommon for a cheap usb stick with basically no cooling inside some plastic casing to overheat after long usage. It wont overhead when you copy some files to it, but using it as hard deive is smth different.
---
This subreddit:  
---
Someone is having fun? Downvoted.
---
Chat not working, honor system not updating, garr mechanics doesn't work(doesn't blow up at 50%), surgers up until recent patch didn't charge properly, and so on. There are constantly being made updates and fixes to classic don't think it's some fucking finished product.
---
Anyway I said blizzlike earlier, what I meant obviously was "if it was like this in vanilla". It's just terminology.
---
What does PVP wise mean LOL, either its balanced in every aspect or not
---
That's pretty damn good.
---
Yeah but you don't really need money until about level 20 at which point you've probably already have like at least 20 gold from 100% passive income.
---
Or Gandling.
---
If you‚Äôve stopped having fun.... stop playing the game. That‚Äôs what I did
---
Selective memory.
---
Holy shit are you still running your propaganda spam on here lmao. Every single fucking thread.
---
Who cares? Hybrids do everything and adapt on the fly, just do it instead of being annoying for petty bullshit.
---
You posted 3 posts on the forum the past 2 days about people whining too much..
---
Yeah, why say anything about a negative experience you have. Such a mystery why people do that.
---
I was wondering if you were leveling all classes at the same time. Met most of your alts at the Naga beach. I killed you once, but after that we became friends.  
---
Best of luck from Brador, the undead Roge
---
Must be nice being able to go to BRM without corpse walkin literally 15 times, screw you and your horde privilege  &gt;:( (im a gnome on bene)
---
which is extra special since troll is the better race for sp**
---
I'm a physician at a department of internal medicine :P
---
Thats why i said my activity is limited, can't do instances for ex. - if an ambulance comes i can't tell them "guys wait a bit, last boss, 10mins at most" :)
---
But usually i'm too busy to play anyway,  lucky if get 3-4 hours of sleep during 24 hours...
---
Heartseeker horde here...it‚Äôs not that bad.
---
Yea this is not true. I absolutly refuse to believe without proof that people still standing on your corpse 8 hours later, same raid too. Holy shit people are dramaqueens.
---
Actually no. Sitting down to get crit is completely blizzlike and was in both vanilla AND classic.
---
The difference is that in classic(and vanilla) you don't get the proc from reckoning/enrage etc. if you are sitting down. However with batching you can trick the game by standing up in the same batch as the attack, and you will still get the proc. There's literally videos of this being done on classic... [https://youtu.be/cT4V6ASj8oE?t=85](https://youtu.be/cT4V6ASj8oE?t=85)
---
Generally speaking, lifetapping while you move is most efficient, because you cant cast shadowbolts during that time
---
If you think this is a bad situation you are a spoiled bitch
---
You wont really be able to farm solo, but we're better in wpvp. Not sure how you'll level outside of instances though
---
This is authentic vanilla. They broke vanish in the AB patch, I remember it clearly.
---
So you get ganked 5 minutes, HOW HORRIFYING
---
https://classicwow.live has a good guide
---
Is googling too hard?
---
If i have too lifetap, i make sure to do it while moving, whenever you cant cast and not throwing curse/corr I lifetap
---
If you stand still, i tend to do it one at a time
---
However key to sick logs is kinda using demonic rune/mana pot since they are off global cooldown, many seem to forget that
---
The server has alot of good alliance guilds when it comes to pve, but not an active pvp community.
---
There are very few balanced servers though. 
---
For EU it's probably Mograine (slightly shifting towards Horde lately however), Ashbringer, Zandalar Tribe.
---
The more time passes the less likely it is servers remain balanced, it kinda works like a snowball.
---
Should?
---
I'd say "have the ability to". Just because the info is out there if you study up on it, doesn't mean you need to actually have all that information..
---
I played actually 3 different specs in this, i enjoy the premeditation one the most currently, because it has a more reliable stunlock for daggers and more burst with the 10% attack power, but against mages u absolutely want to be improved sprint so either is great
---
this is the imp sprint,   pretty standard like you said   
---

---
And the other is ur standard hemo cold blood used in the duel at the end
---
So you want your problem to be someone else‚Äôs problem. Got it, and fuck you.
---
stalagg was not reasonably balanced at launch. at all
---
ns is still the better spell anyway, so i guess its not on their priority since most players don't even skill it.
---
I suppose if my goal for work was a Rolex and fancy coat, might have a point.  Fortunately rl has some other goals and desires for me not directly related to ‚Äúend game‚Äù executive life lol.
---
It was just kind of surreal how I went from enjoying the nostalgia to, meh I‚Äôm just going to be wearing blues and low grade purps forever at end game, constantly at a pvp disadvantage, bleh.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just old and crotchety now.
---
Go back to retail?
---
That's fake news.
---
Firemaw is not balanced at all. Atm it's like 9 to 1 ratio of horde to alliance at level 60 according to census addon. Also it's getting worse every day as more and more allies stop playing wow classic after being corpse camped, flypath ganked and screwed over by horde zerg.
---
There is probably like 1 alliance pvp raid formed in the evening to get some honor, but any small groups or solo folks are getting stomped 24/7 by horde zerg. Also that 1 ally raid needs to constantly change locations as there are like 10 full horde raids chasing it.
---
Won't that just make the world empty? Alliance will just sit on the BG npc in the capital lol. Horde can suck it up outside.
---
Wow he made a typo...
---
You on the other hand don't have the comprehension skills to differentiate his PvP faction balance argument and you going off about Alliance dominated PvE servers. 
---
What a tool you are for going there and derailing just because he didn't specify, while it's implied in the thread
---
Life to fight another day
---
THE SPELL HAS BEEN BROKEN
---
I started an alt on a Normal server. I wish I would have better understood what PvP would become. I wish Blizzard would allow us to transfer to a Normal server. There are tons of people out there like myself: grown adults with real lives that can only play casually. The current PvP situation is not enjoyable to a casual. I don't have the time or desire to play like this. Please Blizz allow transfers to Normal servers.
---
Thats only 320k players (wich is an awfully even number). How does it work tho?
---
aLly dO tHe SaME thINg
---
It's called you're full of shit bro
---
Same dude..many servers are balanced with constant back and forth but this Reddit is full of whiners and ppl who played retail then didn't know how P2 will go..
---
One of my fav things. 
---
Best part is when ur mages sheep the guards and you just just keep killing.
---
If you were alliance I would be more inclined to believe you. 
---
Horde keeps lying about the balance and the numbers on my server for example (it's Firemaw).
---
They keep ganking 10 to 1 and claim that server is perfectly balanced.
---
You know what, you're right. This game rewards players to be assholes. It ain't worth playing.
---
Peasants built it presumably so that's a pretty good in universe explanation.
---
Yea, im trolling the crybabies, i have a few thread i deleted too
---
Nah some of them are having fun. It gives them a false sense of proness.
---
You have 1% chance to miss regardless of gear.
---
..what can i say
---
Since phase 2 hit, my favorite aspect of the game is dead.....questing.
---
Pretty much no. It‚Äôs hard to find a mid level dungeon group on Grobbulus which is one of the more popular servers. Outside of peak times it just feels like a ghost town.
---
You need 2 tanks with one running out with melee then running in
---
You can pull the warmasters out one by one.
---
Hunter will be easier to gear and do decent damage. 
---
Mage does have damage but it is more a control class above all else.
---
It basically just counts the amount of people that are logging raids. It acts like an armoury, you can search for players if they have ever been in a logged raid.
---
So the numbers are compete, but it is assumed that if 40% of horde are logging fights then it‚Äôs going to be around 40% of alliance. Not perfect but it would be petty close.
---
Going to have to give the deep sub build a try, wasn‚Äôt too keen on hemo cold blood, not sure if it is because I have been using it wrong maybe. Have kinda thought I need improved sprint for the cc as it is so prevalent and something like a mate is super difficult if you don‚Äôt have it. But maybe FAP would work just as well.
---
People here are uninformed.
---
Yes, there is a way.
---
Delete your toon you want to rename, have a friend create a lvl 1 with your name and have him log on, then you restore it.
---
Voila, free name change.
---
Your own comment didnt have an argument to counter but I guess you're too dumb to realise that. Unsurprisingly.
---
Now that's a pro gamer move.
---
REROLL LOL
---
ironforge.pro
---
What's wrong with being a tad behind? I make a point to absolutely invite any class in my dungeons group, since I've seen so many be hyper picky. Even ret pallies. Everything is being ran smoothly. Maybe it took 5 more minutes to complete the instance, but so what? Everyone had a blast and that's what counts.
---
&gt;the dude left the group before we could rez him.
---
The old shame log off
---
And saying that I'm useless is not a personal attack?
---
Your original post still doesn't have an argument btw. Do I need to spell it out for you?
---
You just expecting blizzard to take all Classic players, force them to stop Retail, and hope they would leave classic
---
that make no sense.
---
The meta is faction selection not the actual process of acquiring gear.
---
Don't worry, they'll make sure you don't get honor from BGs either
---
That's the joke m8
---
If you weren‚Äôt worth any honor I wouldn‚Äôt have to kill you.
---
Maybe not on an individual case but imagine trying to do it to a 1000 bots?  
---
Its always easier to create bots  than it is to find them and ban them, as a gamemaster.
---
A. We run the dungeon if you fill the roll
---
B. We don't run because the one person with healing spells won't cast them
---
No needs to ask me anything.  If I want to run the dungeon I put my Int gear on so we can start clearing.  I think he's taking it too personally and I think he's trying to play a spec and not his class.
---
No I don‚Äôt think you will see full AQ and Naxx pugs like with ony and MC
---
Yeah, get fucked for chosing the wrong faction idiots amirite
---
No. Its rude to assume they're fine with it without asking and just invite another DPS. Just like OP said.
---
How do you know about queues before they exist?  Can you predict people lining up?  Do you know how cross realm bgs work?
---
&gt;hey won't but they need to buff the guards and make em pwn
---
They should do the changes they would have done if this had happened 15 years ago:
---
* Significantly reduced honor from players who are lower level than you.
---
* More &amp; stronger guards in towns, at flight masters and on transportation.
---
Blizzard literally designed it so that people are being rewarded for this behaviour. Not only that but it's a competitive rank system.
---
I hate p2 just as much as you but you can't blame people for playing the game optimally. This is a design issue.
---
Thing is, from what we know, there was more than 2.5M people resubbing for classic and BfA 8.2 and 8.2.5 worldwide (because of the quarterly earnings call reporting record numbers), assuming that 1 million of them resubbed for classic and play on EU, the site shows about 10% (100000) of the total EU population. If there was 1M players on EU the first month of classic, It's honestly not a far stretch to assume that only 10% has hit 60 and are actually raiding. All it takes for your raid to be logged is that 1 out of 40 players in your raid at one point logged into Warcraftlogs with their battle.net account, even if they did it back in retail it should still be logging their raids in classic if they have advanced combat logging enabled. Many add-ons enables advanced combat logging by default to be able to work. Because of this i absolutely believe that the mass majority of raids are being logged.
---
Basically every Alliance on this subreddit.
---
It's normal to assume Druids carry around int gear.
---
5
---
I thought it could be one of those automatically generated battlenet name that I personally never changed. All blizzard emails coming to me start with "SwankyOrc", even though I never chose that name.
---
&gt;I think its fine on Mograine if you dont go to obviously contested areas at peak hours.
---
Oh gee, I wonder why people would go to contested areas. I will just use my LFG tool to get to any instance.
---
Oh and Mograinne WAS balanced but since P2 most alliance straight up quit. Horde holds every FP, instance + 50.
---
Wpvp doesn‚Äôt work like cs lol. 60-40 is fine.
---
If that can give you some hope, 15 year in to the past, people would have seen you as a fucking tryharder D:
---
You seem so upset.
---
&gt;hours a day stomping
---
Sounds more fun than playing Shadowlands.
---
Kurinaxx is very balanced. Highly recommended
---
Rekt
---
Thats awesome :)
---
Ya, if they write down that they can rape u if they want and u agree, it's OK I guess?
---
Not enough rogues.
---
you mean to say you DON'T like being spammed with invites to "wwwMYGOLDcom261t13r112fa" every 2 minutes?
---
What do you mean isnt retail? Classic requires subscription... you pay for it, therefor it is retail. :)
---
That's not how this works at all. 1% crit is worth roughly 7-9 sp at current gear levels for a mage, while 1% crit is worth roughly 11-12 sp at current gear levels for a warlock.
---
If you signed consent it wouldn't be rape would it?
---
Yep, going well too :) Feel free to jump in if you're on the server
---
It's all about tempering your expectations.  If you started classic thinking that you would eventually be in full T3 with a legendary weapon - your expectations were unrealistic and you only have yourself to blame.  If you started with a different goal of getting your pre-raid BiS or your whole blue PvP set - those are doable.
---
I'm not trying to convince you to stay - it sounds like this game isnt for you.  I'm just saying that your expectations must have been off and you only have yourself to blame.
---
There‚Äôs an unbelievable amount of players who have been playing constantly since launch. I‚Äôm not sure why. It was fun for a while but raiding endgame content is beyond dull, world ‚ÄúPvP‚Äù is a mindless spamfest, and I can‚Äôt imagine why anyone would spend hour after hour farming gold.
---
I do have fond memories of battlegrounds, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs going to be horrible this time around. Because literally everyone is going to be tryharding with engineering and 10+ trinket set, when before, I never saw a single person with a reflector.
---
The ones in the wetlands all have a bear pet with a chinese character. It‚Äôs very obvious these are chinese gold farmers.
---
Bear tanks are a pserver thing. That's where they were actually made to work.
---
Ya know I quickly checked your post history and saw how you've done nothing but cry about getting PvP'd on a PvP server you willingly rolled on for weeks. I see you're just upset that you cant win with the best class in the game and are taking your frustrations out on reddit. I'll be the bigger man and just let you wallow and complain.
---
Also my argument was that Alliance would find something to bitch about even if they won, which your post history proves spectacularly, thank you.
---
i didnt even think bots worked in classic anymore
---
Now see, I‚Äôd be the guy who isn‚Äôt in the guild that can actually raid in the first place.  I‚Äôd be the pick up bro relegated to stuff everyone already had 8 months ago.
---
Which was fine my first time through all those years before.  But this time a switch just flipped.
---
You are doing the blessed work.
---
Think of PvE servers tho... they cant do anything about them. :(
---
Ah, so we can camp ally at the battlemasters. What a great idea
---
Full Lawbringer, Mageblade and shield from rag, awesome! Big grats, I reay want my paladin to look like this
---
Twinking in redridge.. 
---
guess you cant win a fair fight
---
Aaand now I feelbold at 26.
---
My bf and I started at a pve server and when we refilled on a pvp server we expected an experience like in vanilla wow (it was long before phase 2). Now we leveled our mains up and phase 2 started and it wasn‚Äôt at all like vanilla wow. It was hell. I hate it. We moved to a smaller server, it‚Äôs better but not like back in 2004. We love our characters, we already rerolled once we don‚Äôt want to do all of this again. But if we had the choice to move to pve, we would. Immediately.
---
You've got your binds set up wrong. Space bar jumps in ghost mode too.
---
People will learn eventually, on my warrior I crush rogues, on my rogue I have a decent chance at winning as long as I'm very careful with the 5-8 yard rule and keep getting the stuns in, but one mistake as a rogue most likely means your life against a warrior who knows what's up.
---
While I don't doubt this is one of the main reasons for this change, I still will argue that if we had normal server sizes instead of these megaservers it wouldn't be an issue. There would be somewhere for the players to escape to for farming, reputation, etc.
---
on my server the 60s come help you
---
Fine. How about you post images of said census otherwise this report is meaningless.
---
This attitude is why so many people rolled PvP that shouldn‚Äôt have done.
---
A PvP server has very little to do with being casual, hardcore, or anything else. It‚Äôs for people who enjoy a specific kind of PvP, that‚Äôs it.
---
I love world PvP. Most people do not, and should never go near PvP servers. But idiots for some reason can‚Äôt handle some people not liking what they like and thus declare those people ‚Äúcasual‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù or whatever else. They just don‚Äôt like world PvP, that‚Äôs all... and that‚Äôs fine.
---
Bro you should check out Nvidia Shadowplay Instant replay feature
---
No it doesn't. You don't get honor for targets who are too low level. There's no incentive except sadistic satisfaction.
---
you're
---
Ah theres that good ol snide response, always gotta have one. 
---
Why would I need to provide numbers when nobody else can provide exactly what I criticized? Actual queue numbers. 
---
The only salty ones here are you and the other jackasses trying to sell this idea that those mean ol hordies are going to pay for all the ganking with the 3 day long queues! thatll show em! As if I care. 
---
Take your snide, crappy personality and kick rocks.
---
The balance on heartseeker is heavily exagerated on reddit, there's plenty of horde groups for alliance to fight out in the world. 
---
That group "controlling" the horde flight tower got wiped like every 20 minutes.
---
WoW Classic isn't about the end-game BiS gear grind in my mind, but the ride to get yourself to that point.
---
Its not the type of game where you can reasonably expect to be at the top of the power curve, someone will *always* be better than you, or higher geared than you. Honestly, just enjoy it for what it is - don't go into it with the mindset that you need to be the best, or have the best stuff.
---
If the thing that you get enjoyment out of this game is the gear grind, there are better games out there for it.
---
A rogues role in wsg is to defend your teams flag, and also to go after the efc. If you just wanna roam mid and kill people with a pocket healer you wont be playing your class to its best abilities. Your desired playstyle is that of a warrior.
---
Been 2 manning it with a healer. On 52 runs right now. I‚Äôll probably get savage glad chest before hoj at this rate.
---
Because it's FREAKING POLITE.
---
Well it does dep on the class but off the top of my head- bags, a decent weap if mellee to speed leveling, port reagents for faster travel from mages, drinks/food for quicker downtime, or even the start of an ah gold mine investment.  
---
Yes it's a small amount of gold, but for a brand new char this cld allow them to either maximise efficiency early or use it as seed money for ah play.  
---
Not a fortune, but far from nothing for a lvl 1 fresh to server
---
Based on what. You running solo in PL then dying and running to reddit to cry.
---
The two things that I would invest this fortune on:
---
Bags, the benefits of bags early on can not be under estimated not only as a time saver but a way to earn more early on as you don't need to be selective about loot.
---
Wands, early wands are such a big help for caster classes. Less down time can really make the game more fun.
---
dude i cant make that jump... any tips?
---
You realize people meta game alliance in classic too? There's PVP racials on alliance too and there's way fewer active rankers there which means a lot of PVPers actually choose to play on alliance. Instead of doing a perpetual honor grind like you do on horde you can stay bracket 1 on alliance doing less than a full week. Usually 4-6 days is enough to guarantee bracket 1.
---
If you look at the list of all the top speed clear guilds right now actually all of the alliance guilds in the top 50 are PVP guilds.
---

Yo that is not how math works lol. Here is a spreadsheet I made a week or so ago

My guild transferred off of stalagg because of the queue times. Heartseeker doesnt have a queue at all, please dont force that back on us.
---
I am in &lt;Art of War&gt; and can confirm we do not have ‚Äúmultiple‚Äù hands of rag. We have 1 warrior with HoR.
---
Yup! What realm are you on?
---
The total population has always been pretty close to 50% iirc, the problem is how many Horde skew into PvP servers and how many Alliance skew into PvE. Its the big reason you see such huge imbalances with most PvP servers, because the large majority of Alliance players are just chillin on the PvE side of the fence.
---
tldr we need more Alliance to grab their swords and fight the Horde
---
You are certainly defending the poor state of the game quite a lot eh?
---
So tell me, what can i do when the rogue sap me, kill my pet in 2s then full CC me so i can't play ? I think he was outgearing me really bad.
---
Good video dude, keep up the good work!
---
how would i provide proof? i got banned from the server.
---
that doesnt mean it was its best state. Cata had a higher number at the start. There are more factors than saying it has had the highest subs
---
Would be interesting if the only gear that replaced naxx gear was from TBC raids but the cap was still 60, something along those lines. That way you need to potentially do naxx to progress.
---
Well that's useless then
---
Commission a 3D modeler to do the file for you, then print it.
---
.... If you miss a crit then what? Those Sp weights are all wrong and the logs reflect it.
---
I idle on WoW in IF while playing switch or xbox. Or watching tv. Can't be the only one
---
Do you have tier gear?  The 2nd set bonus helps a lot with pet survivability.
---
Aren't BGs gonna be cross realm so wait times shouldn't be a big problem?
---
If you can‚Äôt deal with 60-40 then you don‚Äôt like vanilla. Go back to retail. I‚Äôm not saying it as an insult. Server balance was always an issue because it‚Äôs impossible to fix without blizzard just punishing players for being on a certain faction. Anyone who wasn‚Äôt delusional knew 60-40 would be how the servers ended up and it‚Äôs totally playable. 
---
What you are probably upset about and balance wouldn‚Äôt fix this is wpvp happening in all zones constantly because servers are overfull.
---
Just downloaded the twitch app and now it works great, thanks for your help!
---
How many people would that put in the server then? Wouldn't the population be insanely high?
---
Hitting 56 in about 30 min, and getting closer to max lvl. I've been wondering about getting Lionheart helm (I'm playing warrior). How should I approach aquiring it? Does it basically come down to farming thorium veins until I get all mats required? Am I missing sth? My goal is to get epic mount asap so I'd rather spend my gold on that, not on mats for helm.
---
Btw I got near max lvl mining and low lvl engineering (I've been stockpiling mats to lvl it up).
---
You're right, Druids can fill the hole in the group. What I'm saying is that I'd rather they just ask me flat out. A simple "Hey, can you tank/heal this one?" or something would suffice. Literally saying nothing about it and just moving on is what was getting to me, not doing the roles themselves.   
---
If they just asked me flat out instead of accepting me into the group as role X, then just expecting me to do role Y, I wouldn't have a problem with it. It just seems rude to me.
---
Bro, you know you aren‚Äôt the asshole here you don‚Äôt need to post this to justify your feelings or whatever reason you decided.

if he didnt bring a healer he would be killed by a single mage using rank 1 frostbolt
---
You've been hit by a troll curse for doing too much ZF. If you keep running it, someday your character will fall asleep in Gadgetzan inn and never wake up. To lift the curse you must leave this haunted place and purge your body with Searing Gorge fire.
---
Be careful tho, later you will eventually travel near ZF to access Un'goro crater. You must resist the bad voodoo at all costs and just jump off the cliff.
---
Uldaman sucks because the dungeon has such a wide level range in it, it starts at what, 37? 38? but the last part is 46. Unless you go in with full group of 44+, the dungeon can easily take plenty of time.
---
" You think Horde WANTS 4vs1 advantage? "  
---
Yes, always.
---
Ideally, for a situation like that, you would spend your talents as a mix between the two trees, some in DPS, some in tank, so you can do both decently.
---
"You're mad and thus your argument is invalid! Gotcha!"
---
I played on Tich in Vanilla, and it was nothing like this.  The extent of the griefing is entirely by choice, and the community is just worse than it was in the past.
---
...find the spirit healer
---
Depends.  Very strong and easy 1v1 vs any mob, tough to fight multiple mobs until you get blade flurry.
---
How is it fair to assume anything when all the ways we have gathered data were broken by blizz and are now unreliable?  And how does a 60-40 faction balance equate to 50% more horde players?  That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me at all.  I appreciate your response I‚Äôm not trying to argue I am just confused by your logic.
---
I‚Äôm not dead, I‚Äôm just very badly burned!
---
If you really wanted to you could host your own pugs and res the eye of sulfuras and the ingots. You could totally get it by just raid logging, coming up with the gold to craft it is another story though lol
---
The strength of the druid is that they can do any role.  You have the least amount of trouble finding a grp than any other class.  
---
Take advantage of that.  Dont throw it away.
---
Improved range was to prevent safespotting (people standing on buildings to prevent guards from hitting them). With that said a geared 60 can literally tank guards for a while then run outside of the city to escape the guards.
---
As an ot? Maybe.  As MT? Stop with the herbs bud.  Lack of crushing talents, you get a Druid tank with less health and armor, less threat generation, and requires the raid to hold your hand to be a snowflake raid spec.
---
More please.
---
Wish my server was any similar, im at the point where i only log in for raids and consider to let my sub run out
---
Take a shower pls
---
Everyone listen to this spoiled, whiny, brat. Worst type of consumer behaves like an 8 year old.
---
There's likely 4-5 well distributed bots spread across 1000s of players. With malware infection (volunteering at HPs Zero Day Initiative (RIP)) we were dealing with millions of clients running different variations of the malware due to modularity. 
---
Their instrumentation with warden is vast, and the badware they're dealing with is limited to functions in one application. There's no way it takes that long. Their threat landscape just isn't very big.
---
1%
---
FD is spell hit%. The talent that reduces its chance to resist basically gives you 4% spell hit%.
---
However, from everyone who does DM solo runs, it seems that distance and LoS contribute somehow to the FD resist chance. Maybe that's true or just a feeling.
---
DM tribute solo runs do NOT have a 100% success chance. But they still are the best GPH in the entire game. So they're worth it.
---
It‚Äôs clear you have like 10 accounts. Most people have 1. So no they don‚Äôt want to heal if they aren‚Äôt spec‚Äôd for it. When you are willing to do any  role, I assume you log into your Druid or similar class. When you want to dps I assume you log into your mage/rogue. So when you are looking for a dungeon healer or tank, how come you don‚Äôt just log off your dps and log on your dps? Oh is it because you want to play dps? And you want to roll on dps gear? Yes, it is. It‚Äôs the same scenario.
---
I used to solo farm scholo as a 60 warrior.
---
I'm not gonna sit here and take this kinda talk... \*BLINK\*
---
 It's OK to be annoyed as fuck by a bad situation.
---
Comparing yourself to others is always a losing mentality.  Be a winner and compete against yesterdays shadow
---
Imagine losing with 15k health combined
---
keep playing ur faction only for racials and to be 2:1 kid
---
I'm alliance. And I've quested (plus a couple dungeon runs but only to complete the dungeon quests) all the way to 46.
---
I‚Äôve been an advocate for Faction Que for years. This is why. A lot of private servers do this hence why they have better communities and playing experience. I enjoy playing Alliance. I could never play on a server where it‚Äôs basically 100/1.
---
Remember we need the tears of the living fore we don‚Äôt produce enough! FOR THE FORSAKEN!
---
Epic mount &gt; Lionheart.
---
While it is incredibly powerful, the epic mount will increase your farming speed, thus make it easier to get it in the future.
---
I've been doing it. I've also been killing horde while doing it.
---
It would be, because it's very very unlikely someone would actually read the TOS and actually agree to something like this.
---
People simply click accept so they can play the game. It's unreasonable to assume anyone would read the whole thing.
---
I asked 2 people for a loan and now I have 15g and full bags at level 12.
---
Inb4 he‚Äôa ret lmao
---
Yes, when you open the second instance of Wow one of them is disconnected, you just log in with the username and password in the game window and you can alt tab between the two
---
Rogue buffs
---
 &gt;And how does a 60-40 faction balance equate to 50% more horde players? 
---
Err ... that ratio means there are 60 players on one side for every 40 players on the other which is 50% more. So its basic math that shows it.
---
"Not so unbalanced"
---
*on faction with 50% more players*
---
üëÜüèªthis is indeed how math works.
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Scientists believe that puffer fish developed their puffing tactic as a method of self defense because they are poor swimmers that cannot escape from danger quickly.
---
They ban in waves so they can gather more information about behavior and how they function, specifically so bot developers don't know exactly what it was that ticked off the alarm system. They hit several birds with one stone and it's standard practice in gaming.
---
I am utterly...hopelessly addicted to leveling alts its like pure heroine.
---
Rogues do have to wait longer in average then fucking warriora because they cant tank dungeons dumbo
---
&gt;polished pserver is bad.
---
Could you show me the quote where I said that. If not your responding to the wrong post. Pservers were based on false information and very unpolished. They got debunked as very badly designed during the classic wow beta testing.
---
AT&amp;T proves my point. You are just under the false assumption that America has a free market. Capitalism is a system of voluntary exchange. We do not have capitalism in America.
---
I wouldn't say they are worse they just understand the system better and take advantage.
---
Also your name is gankman100 and you're talking about wpvp lol
---
Forreal.. PVE realm and you'll never have these issues. People on PVP realms need to stop bitching about getting ganked! Including me!
---
Holy
---
How is the data inaccurate?
---
This
---
So much salt.
---
Sure thing nerd. Get rekt. You don‚Äôt decide what role others play fuck off
---
It's mainly confirmation bias. It's easy to not notice when you run through an area unimpeded, or when there are friendlies around, but every time you die to gankers it builds up frustration and a feeling of unfairness.
---
Go bloodfang, that one is actually balanced.
---
It actually came out in TBC in the pre patch
---
I see you fail at reading comprehension too.
---
Would‚Äôve rather died fighting then died like a coward
---
PvP servers:
---
&gt;"Don't put your hand in that toaster, you'll get burned"  
---
&gt;*\[puts hand in toaster\]*  
---
&gt;THIS SUCKS! WHY DID I GET BURNED?!
---
Did you unironically just call him "kid"?
---
Everyone did not know the extent of the overpopulation of the servers. This amount of people ganking were not in vanilla and are not in retail.
---
So tell me again how people were supposed to expect the game to be unplayable?
---
Try applying logic. You just don't notice when there are friendlies around. 10:1 is absurd.
---
spell hit, not hit.
---
Committing hari Kari
---
The endless treadmill eventually gets old. I‚Äôd rather have an achievable goal that can be reached, and then it‚Äôs quit when I do. 
---
I understand why they do the endless treadmill, have to keep those subs, but it‚Äôs an inelegant solution.
---
Rattlegore has been fun too. Ya the occasional massive waste of time leveling due to being ganked over and over but that‚Äôs what I signed up for.
---
Maybe it works on females and not on males.
---
Just mailed myself this!
---
I've seen videos of shaman tanks doing DM just fine so your probably just not running a shaman tank very effectively. They do fine for dungeons just that's the top end.
---
I think the auto buy feature is for retail. Arent poisons on retail like a consumable that you buy or whatever? Never played past cataclysm and before starting classic i hadnt played any WoW in 10 years so idk but yeah everything but auto buy works great. Pretty useful addon even without the autobuy feature.
---
because the spells they get are vastly superior to the ones undead get. ud still has wotf, but thats not enough to close the gap.
---
*Stay away from da voodoo.*
---
You still dont get it
---
But what's the point when you could just have several accounts on the same bnet account?
---
Find some friends and work together. A 6:4 server imbalance is hardly meaningful at all in terms of small engagements.
---
you mean vanilla, and no leeway wasn't part of the game at the beginning.
---
&gt; more animal facts!
---
That's called Stockholm syndrome. You say you are having fun corpse running for 30 minutes, but I doubt it.
---
&gt;Wow he made a typo...
---
He hasn't "made a typo", he just boasts 0 reading comprehension.
---
I countered his own argument of "literally 1 server" especially since it's not the 1 anyway.
---
protip: if you pull something out of your ass, don't throw a tantrum when proven wrong.
---
&gt; As an ot? Maybe. As MT? Stop with the herbs bud. Lack of crushing talents, you get a Druid tank with less health and armor, less threat generation, and requires the raid to hold your hand to be a snowflake raid spec.
---
No herbs, crushing blows are diminished with armor (similar to druid tanks). A bunch of MT'ing shaman tanks on my server as we speak, their clear time is nearly identical to druids. this talks [about it](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150).
---
Congratulations! Now the massive arcanite farm begins.
---
Or play on a PVE server? I don‚Äôt understand why people get so mad about PVP, on a PVP server..
---
Probably a cave under you
---
Blizz broke the way the data is taken from addons.  The /who function is broken for searching for thousands of players.  The only data given is from raid log addons from only level 60s with the addon...
---
It would show up in the network traffic if they checked that.
---
Wel depends, I heavily outgear everyone that didnt get gear funneled (I got funneled since I am going for r14). Everyone that I crit with AA+MS+HoJ or Sword is one shot currently. Everything else is dead in the second global when whirlwind lands.
---
Last night I was spending all my gold making mageweave bags for low lvl 10s and giving1g each, feels good to do and probably keeps people on that server more
---
No OP knows that almost all alli quit when P2 came out. And he knows everything, because he knows each alli player personally.
---
curious about ally experience on rattlegore, is it as traumatizing leveling in the 50s as it is for horde? Im not exactly sure about the ratio on this server
---
I‚Äôd say there is a constant raid or several death squads patrolling each of the zones at almost every hour. its actually quite impressive, its a very similar feeling to the whole ‚Äúred means dead‚Äù attitude back in vanilla except now people are a lot more efficient about it
---
They all get fucked up solo. They're not suicidal. Of course they play in a group you baboon.
---
Holy shit you still aren't taking your reading lessons, my strikerseeker boy.
---
Please re read the comment above dip shit. ‚ÄòPeople didn‚Äôt know other people were going to be playing the game!‚Äô Stfu dood.
---
If there‚Äôs 4 70/30 alliance dominated servers, 3 of them are pve so it doesn‚Äôt matter nearly as much.
---
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by [60-70% horde domination](https://imgur.com/a/BpMseFG).
---
I killed 24 people while waiting for groups to form for dungeons. Thats 24 unique people, not just 24 murders. This was a few days ago, and my current "this week" is showing 9 kills.
---
Not for PvP...
---
Is this the ret paladin in raids argument?  Because that doesn't work with strangers.  This wasn't a guild run or a group of friens.
---
If you're going to walk around expecting random people to appreciate your uniqueness then you're self centered.  He's not playing a Druid how they were designed, as a hybrid.
---
I didn‚Äôt play private servers; classic is my first time playing vanilla. There‚Äôs literally nothing else to do but quit or reroll. 
---
Allowing blanket pvp to pve transfers is not a good idea imo; that 30:70 ratio is gonna become 20:80 or worse. 
---
On a 30:70 server, the majority faction will camp corpses, camp flight points, camp boats etc because that‚Äôs the only way to get honour.
---
I specifically said Alliance 2H fury, I know horde 2H fury is great. Alliance on the other hand is terrible.
---
What I don‚Äôt understand is that Blizzard probably has the ability to balance servers by capping each faction to a max amount of players. For example once horde reach 2000 players no more Horde can xfer or create characters until alliance reach a 40-50% balance. (Alt chars do not count, speaking brand new characters).
---
This section of the spreadsheet was removed shortly after this comment.
---
Summarising the avoidance chance like that is a bit misleading tho. 50% dodge + 50% parry doesn't mean you have 100% chance to avoid an attack.
---
Nope. It's a private player created channel. Only global channel is LFG
---
But then you know in 2 years the amount of money you have is very valuable, and would allow you to make even more money easily and buy anything you want. Including that you'll know there are certain fees/prices you'll have to pay
---
yea the honor gain for level 48+ at 60 is whats enabling this. blaming blizzard isn't really valid either, they're just sticking to the 'no changes' mentality
---
I had a shaman solo tank a full UBRS run, he did just fine, even solo on Drak. Weak minded individuals like you are why people don't bother trying new things.
---
This is the right answer.  The massive crit bonuses available skew the value of spellpower a ton...though if you die and lose your ony buff, be ready to throw the eye back on XD
---
Ill be honest and say that grind for drakestone is not even worth it. HoJ, Lionheart helm and SGC are 3 items you will use through aq and even naxx. Drakestone you will replace in a pretty easy AV rep grind. And drakestone is about +7 more spelldamage compared to an easy to get quest reward, I'd rather spend gold for spellpower enchant on pre bis wep before considering drakestone farm.
---
You're right, Blizzard does.  I can send you a PDF copy of the game manual if you'd like.
---
and the hatred continues to breed more hatred, causing a vicious cycle...
---
Are you still on about the mistake of server name? Holy moly that's 'cringe' as you so eloquently put it. People can't make mistakes now?
---
Wut, you can jump as a ghost.. you on rez when you click the button..
---
Pretty funny! But pro tip, maybe avoid ferralas when it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre out numbered.
---
If you have an alt on the server you got banned from, then you could just take a screenshot of when Skarp called you the n-word like you claimed he did.
---
However a search shows that Skarp didn't use the n-word (at least not in the last 3 months). As predicted, you are full of shit. Provide proof or stfu. No more lame excuses.
---
Those are all paying accounts to activision.
---
Got it at the 251 runs and the chest at 300+ (DBM don't keep track of arena runs )
---
I would imagine because DHK's are significant and not being able to attack a lowbie in certain aituationa would be silly. Especially if they're griefimg others or an although or something.
---
Really they should have just made it give no honor and put a debuff on you that made you receive no honor from any kills for X minutes.
---
Wrong, That is a separate issue. DO NOT, confuse the two please.
---
They'd just delete that specific comment. Linking to your own post from before doesn't call someone out specifically
---
Where are you going?
---
And why do you suck? I'm sure you play the game just fine.
---
right but you cant pull all time data because it did not reset before after the transfers, you have to use the last week or 2. which now i guess shows 60/40 for krom, it was 70/30 last week when pulling it
---
kurinaxx is 62/38
---
netherwind is 70/30
---
rgore is 65/35
---
smoulder is 70/30
---
tfury is 75/25
---
white mane is 70/30
---
the others are actually pretty close when pulling 2 week data, which makes a huge assumption that people on both sides are actually running the addon. as for Ironforge it is also flawed as it only counts guilds that log their raids. there are a lot of guilds that do not log. the guilds that got the first world boss kills on krom and some of the largest PVP ones do not log at all. 
---
and it has nothing to do with "my" narrative, all the big pvpers on this server agree its far from even close to balanced
---
Alliance have been conditioned to not fight back.
---
They have more than 1000x the money to spend on it though.
---
&gt;What‚Äôs a tribute run?
---
A tribute run is when you do dire maul north without killing any bosses and get a tribute chest at the end with special loot in it.
---
&gt;What is multiboxing, and is it ban-able?
---
It's when you are simultaneously playing multiple accounts and synching their movements and abilities to one keyboard. No it's not because you pay an extra $15 a month to do so and blizz likes money
---
&gt;What is safespotting?
---
It's when you put yourself in an area gaurds can't hit you (like on a roof usually) and blast nearby players.
---
&gt;What are the biggest ‚Äúmeme specs‚Äù?
---
Pretty much any dps spec for a class that can heal, or like shaman tanks. Boomkins are probably the biggest meme spec
---
Focus on other pieces first, and if you can get Crown of Destruction off of Ragnaros then you can skip buying Lionheart
---
Since it's pretty unconventionnal, I suggest only doing it in a group that agreed to it beforehand.
---
based on the fact that the addone was broken for months and the data was not reset after the made it work again to acount for all the people who transferred off
---
2 week data is the only thing that is close to accurate
---
Hi, can you help me with a MACRO?
---
I want it to cast sw:p on mouseover or enemy target (if no mouseover) and do the same with sw:p rank 1 with modifier.
---
If it‚Äôs a friendly target, I want it to cast Renew on mouseover, or on target if no mouseover. 
---
This is what I have so far:
---
#showtooltip
---
/use [@mouseover,harm,nodead,mod][harm,nodead,mod] Shadow Word: Pain(rank1); [@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Shadow Word: Pain
---
/use [@mouseover,help,nodead][help,nodead][] Renew
---
Why doesn‚Äôt it work?
---
Thank you in advance
---
Hey I'm late to the party, can you do 2 handers? Thank you!
---
It's not
---
Congrats, you‚Äôre a tank‚Äôs main heal slut.  Doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt have a fat book of backups but you‚Äôre something special.
---
The stupid people do, the smart farms that are actually making money off botting don't. Which group do you think actually affects the server?
---
You are awesome! Thank you! What about the Ony head drop?
---
Ony head is a buff. Item drops from killing Onyxia
---
DM run that skips certian bosses. Extra loot at the end. Much of it good
---
Running multiple accounts. So long as 1 keystroke does 1 thing on each account, it's not bannable. Keyclone programs send the command to each account.
---
Fighting from a place where guards cannot reach you (generally this means players as well due to the requirements to get to such spots)
---
Balance. Shadow priest. Ret and feral dps for raids
---
Gotta be more specific than just etc because there is a metric shitton of stuff
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
well it is a holiday weekend so many people are prob not around to play . but even that is fewer people that im used to seeing. a lot have stopped playing or only raid log
---
Interestingly enough, I have not had vanish fail out in the world even once - I've even had caster mobs get off spells without it breaking it. 
---
However, as soon as I started doing pick pocket runs in BRD I noticed it started failing constantly - seems to be a dungeon thing. 
---
Even if you run away immediately and vanish away from the mobs they keep coming for you. The only way to get it to work most of the time is to let the mobs hit you a few times, then jump away from them to get some distance before vanishing - even then it sometimes fails.
---
Do. Not. Roll. On. A .PvP. Server.
---
You could have anticipated this month's before launch.
---
I was working a bunch of mobs, pulling one at a time, doing fine. All of a sudden they all went nuts and I was surrounded by AOE. They were all aggroed and I got smashed by a bunch of clubs... died. He just killed them and ran off, leaving me dead. He was Horde and I'm a pally, so it may have been intentional, don't know but I know it pissed me off.
---
Onyxia drops a head, which is a quest item you can turn in in Orgrimmar that buffs everyone in Orgrimmar with 10% Critchance and alot of Attack Power.
---
It however has a 6 hour cd i believe, so thats why people get mad
---
Thank you!! I‚Äôm trying to think of other ones I‚Äôve seen off the top of my head and am blanking... if you think of any helpful ones, please share! It‚Äôs mainly the abbreviations/lingo/memes that go over my head.
---
I am wondering the same thing. As a note to the post that considered los and proximity of the mobs, I would like to add another hypothesis: those 2 mobs before the stairs in the area that Slip Kik patrols have a higher resist chance. The thing is, they are, almost necessarily, in los when you fd so the 2 might be correlative. 
---
Does spell hit work on abilities like taunt? Im actually thinking of farming the star of mystaria and turfing the amount of resists.
---
Well, you did want to be noticed...
---
There's no honor in wasted energy. This ain't the trenches, Churchill. You don't get a purple heart for mashing hotkeys for 12 seconds.
---
That makes so much sense now. THANK YOU.
---
Prot paly makes a better tank in BGs and most instances anyway.  People go on and on about warrior tanks, and they have the highest highs but they‚Äôre nothing without heals except honor in a tin can.  Paly tanks are much more self sufficient.

---
It's bop tho, so you'd have to grind it yourself.
---
It's not so much about stupidity, when it comes to tracking processes and ram usage really. 
---
It's about masking the bot, whether or not blizzard can spot the bot and how the bot operates.
---
Saying that only stupid people get caught, isn't really true. There's also the difference of public and private bots. Public ones are much easier to optain, to view the code. Privates, not so much.

Unfortunately the rolled horde cuz my friends did part hots home. For me it was the real thing, I really wanted to be yet another gnome mage out if the thousands, farming gold like the rest of my half man brethren. But I started the game late and all my friends went horde. My warrior reps a aegis of stormguard shield though.
---
I rolled PVE from Herod.  I am now 53, and playing 100% different game than you.
---
Excuses tbh. It's easy to sit on reddit and claim you know how to fix botting in wow, when you have absolutely no idea of what blizzard actually does.
---
You might have a hunch, but its guessing at best, because you haven't seen the source code for the anti cheat.
---
So basically we only have what blizzard tells us, to go from.

Incendius is pretty similar, probably 60-40 for Horde. I sympathize with the less balanced servers, but on Incendius, im just not seeing this gank squads roaming every questing area making it impossible for them.
---
1-48 zones seem completely normal for a PvP server, people fighting, people questing, people ignoring eachother.
---
48+ the only place see gank squads is in SG, Felwood, FPs and choke points. Otherwise, if youre leveling in ungoro, silithus, Winterspring, Blasted Lands, Burning Steppes, WPL, EPL, you can level relatively undisturbed until you have go near a FP.
---
I will say the actual 60 PvP right now is ass though. I havent found a real fight at 60 this last week. Its either a horde or ally gank squad dominating an area, and if 2 gank squads meet, one just leaves and never fight.
---
Life finds a way
---
Just...switch
---
See that is the problem.  2 groups could fight, but don't.  They want easy uncontested kills.  "PvP" in this game is a fucking joke.
---
ok? who forced him to roll on a pvp server?
---
Same here fam. I still can‚Äôt believe it actually works
---
I have a level 39 Warlock. I did SM Cath a lot last night trying to get the head piece from Whitemane but no luck. Would kind of like to get back to questing/move on to other dungeons. Are there any other decent headpieces available for me?
---
I dont know why blizzard doesnt just make it so that instead of getting no honor you get a dishonorable kill. What EXACTLY is a player supposed to do to combat getting corpse camped? You're already spawning into an enemy that has all of their active buffs AND you spawn at half hp and mana. 
---
I got corpse camped by a rogue last night inside the part of dire maul leading to the instances. My only choices were to spirit rez or log. Fortunately someone else eventually wandered along and he jumped that person. I rez'd and helped that person and the proceeded to corpse camp as retribution.
---
Fuck rogues, paranoia barely does a damn thing to combat them.
---
That staff is literally best in slot for preraid at 60 for so.e classes.
---
Reddit is an interesting place. It only sees what it wants to see. Herod for example is 60-40 horde dominated by population but alliance controls the server at most hours of the day because majority of horde players on the server are social players. I've seen full raids of horde turn around at the sight of 5 alliance.
---
The stone guards were on the chains outside.
---
Preach it
---
shamans will have trouble holding aggro since the main threat ability: earth shock has 6s cooldown
---
If possible,use some (1 or 2 are enough) t1 pieces like the shoulders to boost your health a bit. I think i have 3,4k health and if I get unlucky and get sacrificed by zevrim it's usually no problem.
---
For hydrospawn and zevrim its important to know how they will behave if you juggle them at the hydro pillar. If they are in the water they can go up this small step near the pillar and hit you.
---
They can't go down this step tho and will run to the back to get back in the water.
---
I do it like this: 
---
-&gt; start the fight on the stone floor-&gt;when they are close to the pillar (AND stand on the stone floor), jump down in the water
---
-&gt; when they reach the spot where they can freely change between water and stone floor, jump up to the stone floor again
---
-&gt;when they are near the pillar again and stand on the stone floor, jump down in the water
---
-&gt; repeat this and you're good to go
---
some notes:
---
* when you fucked up and hydro can hit you try to LOS hi behind the pillar and jump around until he runs back again
---
*   always try to the stand right next to the pillar, so that you can react to the casts from both bosses (especially the sacrifice), I made myself a weakaura that plops a a big castbar in the middle of my screen when zevrim casts sacrifice, this makes it way easier to react
---
* use bandages after, if you messed up and he sacrificed you, they heal for more than 2k 
---
* to make the hydro fight easier you can enslave the hellcaller close to him (just try to keep him alive when he is killing the imps with you), the fireball from the hellcaller can crit for about 1k i think
---
I'm playing on a 40/60 server and I can tell you it's ok if you wanna do world pvp in groups but if you're a lowie trying to level it's a nightmare. I'm currently leveling a an alt and it took me around 2.5 days to get level 45 before the patch. Now I'm 56 at around 6 days played. I just managed to enter BRD after around an hour and I'm still waiting for my mates

12 man 2 hour pvp ogrimar mograine
---
You've already proven you don't know what you're talking about with that simple fact, you obviously don't even know what the Ally on your server are doing let alone all of them
---
"At least not in the last 3 months" because that's how far my bot logs back. And it doesn't matter if a mod deletes a message, the bot logs it. If skarp had called you the n-word, then the bot would have logged it no matter if he deleted his message afterwards.
---
But like I said initially, you provided zero proof. Just lame excuses.
---
You have zero credibility.
---
They're just gonna camp a flightmasters that's close to one of their own, it might be a hassle, but for the hardcore players it pays off.
---
There is no WPVP on pve, I have a just hitting 60 alt and have only seen 1 instance of WPVP.
---
The irony is definitely lost on him.
---
Blizzard doesn't allow PVE --&gt; PVP server transfers. Once you transfer to a PVE server you can never go back. Transferring to an alliance-dominated servers is *like* transferring to a PVE server, except you retain the option to transfer to a balanced PVP server down the road if Blizzard introduces paid transfers.
---

Stupid stuff like an epic mount
---
Thanks, I will check out the EU RP realm
---
I'm not a mod. You're really just firing blindly, trying to divert attention away from the fact that you can't back up your accusations.
---
I get it, it's bad for you. But it's even worse for Alliance I can assure you. You just don't see it. My realm has more Alliance than Herod and most high level areas are not realistic to inhabit unless I bring a raid. Anything less than 10 people is going to have to get lucky not to get stomped by a Horde raid and camped.
---
Me neither. Hence naming them \[Icecrap\]
---
If you want this "once in a lifetime pvp" then just go to world bosses.. 2-4 bosses per week and it's actually fun.
---
How do you prove it wasn't you that used the n-word?
---
where do you get that balance information from?
---
tyrs hand or ogres in deadwind pass
---
This needs more upvates! Nail, meet head.
---
yeaaaah, what a bunch of losers
---
Would you recommend the server?
---
what? especially for pvp. race is not nearly as important in pve and there ud takes the cake.
---
Damn you, second breakfast, damn youuuu^uuu^^uuu
---
Well done, now I want more of this
---
Why should anyone care about meters in a 40 man raid that lasts 90 minutes a week and the boss fights are less than 1 minute long?
---
I think your retail is showing.
---
Shazzrah EU is a shit show. About 35/65 A/H that's 3000 more horde if you say 10000 online and the server is full.
---
Getting to BlackRock Spire in the evening takes at least half an hour of corpse running. 
---
The Gadgetzan guards are non existent as the horde are so numerous as to not bother them.
---
God forbid you still need to level in the plague lands, winter spring or fell wood.
---
I started on Stalagg as alliance. Took the free transfer and haven‚Äôt been happier.
---
Like people have said its possibly but not ideal, most groups will laugh in your face and turn you away. Enh is not really good for anything as ele does better dmg and resto is Op as fuk. If u got ur heart set on it its going to be a pain to gear and u have to drink every pull so u have enough management to hold a bit of threat. Also very few resources are available to help out since its not a real thing. That said we have a baller ele shaman who pulled threat on onyxia and tanked her for most of phase 1 no problem (epic geared with malistars defender and this vuy has been shaman since 2005)
---
Ratchet to Booty Bay?
---
&gt;And I'm sure you and your 40 hunter know better lmfao. 
---
You're the one who thinks all boats are ally controlled yet I'm the low level noob... sure mate whatever makes you feel better about yourself.
---
&gt;Super solid logic though
---
You're one to talk, Mr. "No Allies EVER gank lower level Horde!!". You're the paragon of logic
---
Stop playing and get education.
---
Have you ever taken control of any area of interest in the game? Probably not because you'd realize if you bring a lot of Alliance to any place Horde will be there in 5 minutes and take the control back.
---
Because you obviously skipped math class since day one

---
Your comment history reveals you to be a dime a dozen hyper liberal polititard with a tendency to start an argument everywhere you post. What are you 16? Gtfo here lol
---
they have fixed spawn locations and a fixed spawn timer. not exactly hard to farm them
---
guildie of mine has over 100
---
Sulfuras aswell!!
---
If you have a character sufficiently leveled and geared to survive the first few seconds of stunlock it‚Äôs a different experience.
---
It kind of boggles my mind that they people who enjoy the game right now don‚Äôt understand why some players don‚Äôt like being constantly swatted by 60s and groups of 60s at level 51.
---
That‚Äôs like there are two entirely different games going on, but one game is to play a mook for someone else to kill. Only one of the games is fun.
---
6% hit is the general standard for DW classes such as orcs/humans. 
---
For non-orcs/humans it's 9% OR edgemaster's and 6%.
---
Benediction - Alliance here. Yes, there are some alliance pvp groups that fight back in certain zones but for every 5-man alliance group there are 4-5 groups on horde side. 
---
My favorite are the horde who get caught 1v1, lose, come back with 2 or 3 buddies and spam their ‚Äúgo to retail‚Äù macro. Yeah I‚Äôm talking about you ‚ÄúChikfila‚Äù clan... Your level 60s in raid gear are losing 1v1s to a level 53 consistently. I don‚Äôt emote or camp btw
---
Use it! You will NEVER see another one. Just about everyone gets a mount eventually.
---
It is the reverse on Pagle, there are alliance in Orgrimmar 24 hours a day 7 days a week
---
 If you will have fun using it, then use it. If you do, you will have to spend a day farming gold when you get to 60 to make back what you could have had.
---
 I think I'd use it, it helps level you up faster and its nice to have for PvP fun as you go. Put spell power on it and you can just use that till a raid weapon drops for you (only really viable if playing alt or you got a high level friend who can lend you)
---
 Depends how much you hate farming gold I guess, and how much you would enjoy equipping it.
---
As a horde on benediction I think ally have it rough at flight paths, but outside of that it seems like there is fairly balanced pvp
---
Completely untrue, Alliance controls the big zones on Mograine just as often.
---
The most disgusting thing about this post is that someone rolled undead warrior.
---
It just shows an unhealthy addiction claiming you boycotted a company yet you spend time in the Classic WoW forums..
---
If your here to shit on Blizzard, fuck off - we have plenty of that crap already.
---
When i got around to leveling my tailoring on my mage after spending weeks of sending it cloth from my alts i basically ended up making like 120 6 slotters, i thought I'd go do what I'd seen on this subreddit so many times and to go hand them out in goldshire, nobody gave a shit and i had to vendor them, it was odd.
---
I went to download the add-on last week and there was a message that it was broken. Is there somewhere else I should be looking?
---
"your retail"
---
- all top players of the list are from pserver lmao. good reply dude.
---
because skarp has a history of saying that word want more proof? here is someone who did a search on skarp about a month ago before they deleted all the n-word he said look how many he said https://imgur.com/a/mEDy8kE
---
But if they fixed bugs then people wouldn‚Äôt get frustrated and go play retail now that they have an active subscription.
---
Can confirm. I'm an ally mage on Benediction and the server has been great so far.
---
Why would they want RAM usage? Are they looking for massive usage? Cause if so.... Between Lightroom and Chrome I'm fucked.
---
You're the one that started the argument by stating something just plainly false in order to continue pushing your "Horde bad Ally good" narrative you dumbass. And now you're ignoring my points schooling  you in order to ad hom about my post history... you're either a good troll or a really dumb person
---
But without a system to vouch for crafters how do we know we won't end up like that dude 4 days ago that got scammed? That's my concern.
---
You're missing a K in your name bud
---
Aim for head from ZF
---
No faction lock system, game is foooooked
---
Get camped 24/7 then let me "joke" about it. After I will ask you why triggered...
---
Play a druid, spend Respec gold instead of rerolling
---
Night boots +1 stealt level +3 stealth levels via talents and +1 via Nigh Elf passive bonus to stealth and prowl. Horde can't kill me if I do not crawl on top of em, even stealthed Horde rogues see me for half of a second, before I dissappear from sight. That do not affect my party members as they are being killed 5-8 times before entering the instance.
---
Haha, I had no idea someone in the guild was doing this. Awesome!
---
Look to play a DPS class that offers a little bit more flavor than just spam this button until you get this proc. I‚Äôve only ever played rogue but I like the aspect of positioning for backstab as well as all the stuns. Just adds another dynamic to the combat. Any suggestions?

It's kind of a blessing that honor is being lost, it will slow down people's acquisition of Naxx level loot. Thanks, Blizzard!
---
Horrible add-on
---
If I have no buffs and didn't fight recently, will this addon list me?
---
What do you mean? Valentine and company spend 14 hours a day killing people in ironforge, between mystic quarter and the great forge.
---
Sort of. They kept the disclosure program, but cut the division of volunteers analyzing and disbursing analytical data of malware samples. They also used to identify probable command-and-control systems, map botnets, and submit that data to LE. 
---
Zero day initiative was at one point a small organization in HP essentially . Now it's just a process more or less. 
---
There were issues with researchers presenting data as their own at conferences, infighting over credit, and people trying to use it to pad their credentials.
---
There‚Äôs a pretty glaring difference between fights you might possibly win and fights where you get stunned and one-bursted by a much higher level player or team.
---
People who enjoy what‚Äôs happening are doing something they might win. People complaining aren‚Äôt.
---
It is kind of extra aggravating to hear people talk about how it‚Äôs fun to camp 50s with your 60 therefore the 50s should enjoy getting camped.
---
The whole game would be more fun if 60s only got honor from 55+, or even 57+ in the world, but here we are.
---
No reason they cant all hit 60 eventually, level the mage first cuz its a quick aoe grind to 60 and u can farm hundreds of gold in an hour or 2 in DM:e also mages are high demand for dungeons and raids for their aoe power. Then level the warrior and buy good gear along the way so its not quite as painful
---
sell
---
Not unless they hover over you, no - I don't think so.
---
Netherwind is perfectly balanced. I hear ya op.
---
You swapping gear (like ur helmet) is the in-game mechanic. The timer doesn‚Äôt start until it‚Äôs equipped. That timer has 0 to do with item rack.
---
Dire Maul XP is super good too
---
Yep we've thrown away 2 now. Lots of leaves not so many eyes.
---
I do it because it's easier to level multiple classes, and it makes farming some items more convenient.  Like the spell hit belt in arena.  Now there is no competition, and I can farm all day without looking for a group.  Then I can bring one of three classes to a raid depending on composition needs.
---
It is not bad, there are good and chill guilds. But I think of rerolling to RP for even slackier experience :)
---
Yea ik, but the 6% hitcap is for lvl 63s right?
---
How much hit% would it be for equal or lower level mobs
---
If multi boxers don‚Äôt get off their insta kill then they are trash. Its also super easy to camp 5 shaman at the same time when they are controlled by one person.
---
You name all your characters senpai - you deserve it.
---
In almost all situations warriors can do better dps than rogues, but unless your tank is a total g-unit warriors will often find themselves threat capped whereas rogues can vanish and wipe their threat
---
I rolled an orc on Earthfury, lvld to 8, got to Orgrimmar, and was promptly ganked next to the cooking trainer.
---
Called him out, the response? 
---
Who cares.
---
At 6pm, on Tuesday. I promptly rolled Incendius and never looked back
---
use a tool like pugger or group bulliten to sort lfg for you. i havnt had to look at the actual lfg channel ever
---
I‚Äôm a better lock than you
---
You can also just be a helpful person that's good to bring. Help farm mats for pots, bring food, be prepared with bandages, etc. I'd rather raid with people like that then someone that's trying to top meters every time.
---
It was taken - had to improvise!
---
&gt;Are you still on about the mistake of server name? 
---
That's not a mistake of server name. Both servers are PVP and alliance-dominated (actually, there are more), so his initial statement and argument about "literally one server" is a lie. He still clueless about it after being proven wrong with "but I told you that's literally one" is indeed cringe.
---
According to census shazzrah is 48-52
---
What's even more unfair about what this app can do is allow a pet to pursue a target acquired by the addon.
---
Not going to lie, when i played my lock and id leveling and find a lone player i couldn't see id send my pet and it would easily let me find them.
---
Definitely OP
---
There's more Alliance players on PvE realms and more Horde on PvP.  
---
IIRC there will be no cross PvP vs PvE BG groups, so queues problem would still exist.
---
Homeboy just got AOE farmed
---
Only buffs with regular effects, like troll blood.
---
Spy users will downvote!
---
Your point makes complete sense. However im only lvl 40 and just got my normal mount. I still got 20 lvl to go for my epic, which will be some time. So id rather invest the cash and get more later. The break for 2 months was just put into my lap 2 days ago, i wasn't planing on it. But now that its happening id rather put the cash into something for later.
---
coordinated av takes 6-12min
---
Because at 48 you start to give honour to level 60's, he's  basically saying he can't level because he's being honour farmed.
---
Nope.  It used to be a thing to pass around/sell skinning knifes with enchants.  People would just sell them to the next person when it's usefulness ended.
---
Yeah same lol. And now engi is valuable due to pvp but im too fucking stubborn since i literally put so much into bsmithing. Sunken cost fallacy but i dont care enough to level up a profession again
---
Spy addon is literally a cheat and you deserve punishment for using it
---
But all the allies Will be in the BG's, so no honor to be had from wPvP.
---
Praying for that nova to actually hit, so you have time to blink, get out of combat, mount up and live your life.
---
This was patched :)
---
What about the dock leading down from the flight path at from darnasus? That bumpy ass road could have been fixed
---
Dps
---
Lol.
---
Not wanting to make 100k less a year is just a bunch of excuses.
---
Go back to playing video games, kid. The adults are talking.
---
Lmao
---
Ask friends who have them who crafted it for them and get crafters from reputable guilds who have satisfied customers from before. Or you could try to make them give you a sum of money that is about worth has the mats as a guarantee of sorts, but I dont know if crafters would be willing to do that.
---
Zero horde and about 4 alliance yeah
---
The assumption being any one of the other randos could make an MC with that ID and clear the rest of it.
---
yes exactly the dmg on the actual meter is not why the warlock is there in the first place
---
Except that on high level characters, the name is reserved to your account for like 30 days.. so it doesn't work
---
 [https://github.com/christophrus/CensusPlusClassic/releases](https://github.com/christophrus/CensusPlusClassic/releases)
---
Many dungeons runs has a warrior tanking that actually wants some rogue dps gear in the instance and decides it's better to invite cloth dps.
---
I'm totally with you. Pisses me off every time I see it lol.
---
Didn't know all Goblins were Alliance, oh wow!
---
Thanks :p
---
Shadow priest takes some more skill. Mage is just about finding a warrior and casting Frost bolt till he dies, with nova and blink to keep the distance...
---
On high level characters, the name is reserved to your account for like 30 days. The other account won't be able to use that name
---
Warlock? Think about the time you habe spent trying to get cyclopean and compare it to how much gold/sellables/etc u could get in tjat time and buy underworld band wich is almost 2x better than cyclopean?
---
Cue topless volleyball montage.
---
If I was on a lopsided server I'd camp a dungeon entrance.  Tons of people to kill, easy escape from large groups, etc
---
Don't listen to this guy.
---
For a mage you have talents neck piece belt and head piece. That's 6 + 3 = 9%. You loose out on like 20-30 spellpower because crimson felt and dread mist have close to 15 extra sp each but the set bonus helps lessen the difference. Also at this point youre hit capped so this is not correct.
---
You should be expecting a little more of that.
---
You can right click it to deactivate the auto cast. Besides, you can create a macro so that you can keybind it.
---
Dunno, ask the engineers how they'd fix it. Maybe you could get a faster answer than Beefybits.
---
yes, do shit ton of damage so boss dies.
---
The other night I had a lot of fun doing Hillsbrad PvP on my PvE server.
---
It's almost like people had options right from the start, but they're too stupid and stubborn and would rather blame someone else for it.
---
Is alpha mage just like the last panel in those "Expanding Mind" memes
---
This is art.
---
Shaman can still do that in both damage specs. Ele crits or WF procs both kill really fast.
---
NoChAnGeS. Unless it‚Äôs an add on I don‚Äôt like, then it needs to get removed.
---
I got killed half a dozen times by alliance deathsquads trying to do Tirion's kill quests at 2am last night, on Skeram, one of the heavier horde skewed servers.
---
rapid fire does so thats probably where the confusion comes from. i checked classicdb to look at the underlying spell aura and quivers say "ammo only" and rapid fire does not
---
I understand its not a stock market.
---
Whenever i have a bigger break in a game, i usually buy something that will go up in price later.
---
I know inflation will happen, i just don't know too much about the game to know what will increase.
---
You're prize
---
I agree and there will definitely be people pvping on PVE servers. I'm just saying all these sudden claims that alliance PVP gods are all hiding out on PVE servers waiting to take BGs by storm is just silly.
---
Oh you mean like the ?? Alliance that kept killing me in Hillsbrad? In a guild called &lt;WE CAMP CAN CUZ WE CAN&gt;? We dont have to pretend about that, because they are.
---
Just another holier-than-thou Alliance.
---
I don‚Äôt have spy, but does it actually allow you to target them just by clicking their name on that menu?
---
In the giant cave next to Nethergarde Keep in the Blasted Lands. It's gigantic and goes deep under the Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Show me on this doll where the rogue touched you
---
As you mage you don't get to complain about balance at all.
---
Ironforge works only for people who log raids. Private/unlisted logs are off the radar, guilds/people who don't raid are off the radar, guilds who don't use wclogs are off the radar, people who still level are off the radar (unless you are still taken to the MC/Ony while being below 60). 
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/)  is way more accurate source.
---
Most are alts with their own 12 slots already
---
It‚Äôs kind of weird actually. They took the time to model the tusks making bumps in bandit masks and hood/masks like Shadowcraft Cap without having the tusks clip, but the tusks clip through the front of Nightslayer Cover. Whatchagonnado.
---
10/10 fierce cougar
---
But most of us knew that.
---
Only the super "AHHHHH FUCK THE TRY-HARD HORDE" and "ALLY'S ARE PUSSIES COME OUT OF THE CITY" thought it was due to wpvp / lack of BG's
---
Because 99.9% of mage players in classic are objective trash
---
I'm rolling on Benediction as well and I really haven't felt the oppressive nature of Phase 2 like people on Reddit seem to have.
---
Last weekend I was questing in Tanaris, and Ally had the Southsea compound locked down. Horde assembled a group of like 7 level 45-50's to roll out and take the compound and we succeeded in pushing them out. But then 30 minutes later they came back with some new friends and took it back from us.
---
It was a blast, and it felt like it really could have gone either way on both skirmishs.
---
It‚Äôs the joy of doing a run and hoping an item drops. Once you have everything what do you do then? Start an alt and repeat. You are having more fun than that guy you saw but don‚Äôt realize it.
---
pve spec in WSG? lmao
---
Yup.
---
If you're close enough yes
---
It reads the combat log to detect the existence of players.
---
You'd end up killing Details, BigWigs etc. if you tried to break Spy.
---
Thats what it does, it scans the combat log and adds a button that you can click that targets them. Saves you from having to look in the log and type out /tar bilbo
---
Or early DM, or early BGs, or do those not count?
---
The trade off between hit and crit and spellpower is relative. It varies based on you spec, gear, buffs, and spell rotation. It isn't constant, so don't bother memorizing the values given here. If you want to dig into this more, visit the mage discord and learn how to sim your gear.
---
That said, Mana Igniting Cord is MUCH better than Ban'thok Sash.
---
I think 5 whooshes are enough already so I will post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3hm5n/speaking\_as\_a\_warrior\_mages\_are\_bullshit\_and\_i](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3hm5n/speaking_as_a_warrior_mages_are_bullshit_and_i)
---
That's a lot of ad hominem assumption to try to counter logic.
---
I re-rolled before P2 and am still in the 20s. But please keep throwing out accusations like an ignorant dumbass.
---
I never asked for those early. :)
---
For groups, is it just the leader needs to be at the portal?
---
I'm actually not sure if this is a joke or not given the constant whining from Alliance players about *everything.*
---
Not anymore, they bricked how buffs show up on the combat log in addition to the range reduction.
---
ST is actually not too bad, just the difficulty ramp-up for the last Boss is horrible.
---
it still exists
---
I'm sure that's a real guild with real people in it. Anywho, you guys keep sending that potato sulfuras warrior Joho at my low level alts and I'll keep killing him with them.
---
Fury Warrior pretty much always have buttons to press
---
Just because Jesus Christ cheated doesn't mean you get to.
---
I would literally never pay to play on a pve server.
---
It's really exceptional all-around. You can show up to raids, solo farm, PVP, do 5 mans, etc.  
---
If you have raid gear you do enough damage to nuke people down already.  
---
Personally I love having CoEx also
---
I don't disagree with the guy that says deep destro does more damage.
---

---
Ture, although there are a lot of passive actions that caused you to pop into the log.  Running through the zone with Blessing of Wisdom on?  Congrats, you're on the log.
---
They are looking at what processes are using ram. To detect cheat software.
---
Rogues usually play a defensive role i.e. defending flag room in WSG or solo defending farm/stables in AB. If you want to play offense, warriors are the anchors of the frontline.
---
Yes, content being "released early" is totally the same as making API changes to disable functionality that existed in Vanilla and still exists in Retail. Yes, totally the same.
---
Ill look i to naxx consumables.
---
I doubt ill get to naxx myself, im too casual.
---
where did you get the statistics?
---
Thanks ill check out bwl consumables. :)
---
Yeh exactly, fits you nicely.
---
With the recent nerf it‚Äôs way less useless at least
---
That's literally a lie.
---
I'm literally living in SM from 33 to probably 40. Fuck questing in that range
---
Get there and keep attempting it before pulling boss, took me a few tries but now i can reach it no problem. Practice makes perfect
---
The easiest class attracts the dumbest players, no surprise.
---
Goblin rocket helm + sheep + CS made so many of these "warrior+healer" a cakewalk.
---
Is that why succubuses keep popping me out of stealth?
---
You literally just whined about getting killed in \*one of the most noteworthy pvp zones in the game.\*  Hello?
---
No Felhunter:  
---
Roll up on us. drop grounding/tremor and immediately start your burst to 2 shot us.  
---
Felhunter:  
---
The above but fake your first cast to get spell lock wasted.  
---
Both: shock our shadow spells. Do not frost shock ever. The warlock wants to be close to you (Fear has a 24 yard range)
---
What exactly do you mean by viable?
---
For me there's 3 ways to play BGs. 1) you are solo and have to influence / have fun in the game as much as possible. For that rogues are great. You can flagcarry / help the flagcarrier, and defend flags very well in WSG. You can steal bases in AB. You can take towers in AV. Overall great in solo play. Warriors are probably the worst class to queue up to a BG alone.
---
2) You are with a small group of friends. This is like 3-5 people. Warrior is nice here, but not amazing since there will probably be plenty of pugged warriors. Rogues do great here as well, you can group with a flag carrier and win every WSG especially if you have a healer for mid. You can still steal bases or tower in AB and do good.
---
3) Premades. Most comps go for 1 rogue and 1-3 warriors in WSG/AB, I think rogues have it hardest here since it's rare to have more than 1 rogue, and there's a LOT of rogues.
---
It was insanely broken when the combat log would show any player within range regardless of line of sight. All it took was an existing buff
---
The true problem is inflated population numbers. Population imbalance sucks, but it won‚Äôt be as noticeable on a Vanilla server with a population of 2k players. You can see that it is a clear problem with 4-5k players in Classic.
---
Go SM/Ruin if you want the true all-around spec
---
This. 
---
The same thing happens with trade chat and it has always been this way. People who get needlessly bent out of shape when people chat in those channels are wasting their time.
---
you can stop justifying your cheating.
---
This is very good advice
---
this
---
Alliance is the best faction for pvp in phase 2 as well. Just get a PvP group and roam any high level zone and you'll have a never ending stream of honour while on Horde you'll spend more time looking for players to kill than actually killing anyone.
---
600g at level 40? That‚Äôs impressive. I don‚Äôt think you need to worry about gold. If you continue like that you‚Äôll have enough and more at 60 for your epic mount.
---
you aint playin classic
---
This addon shouldn't be allowed imo, it ruins the suspense and that's the entire point of pvp or at least half the point is not knowing as you roll through that valley or cave.
---
Take ironforge.pro with a giant pile of salt. It just shows the ratio of uploaded raidlogs. Horde always uploads more raidlogs because horde players tend to be more competitive-minded and have better melee DPS scores. A server could be 55/45 but ironforge will show it as 70/30 just because of the difference in how many guilds upload their logs.
---
Yeah man, fuck Spy. I was doing some quests in hinterlands and these two hunters kept showing up to kill me and then they'd just leave after I died. They were just hunting me down for honor. Spy is a game-brealing addon and should definitely be removed from the game if they allow you to target players.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e3y50x/can_twinks_get_high_ranks_like_grand_marshall/). 
---
This is a bad strategy because if the melee is out and the tank gets knocked back then nobody will be in melee range of rag which means he will instantly 1 shot a ranged dps or healer.
---
It brings me joy to read them all. The schadenfreude is real with this. Knowing that the annoying assholes who I see killing me repeatedly on a daily basis for 15 honor as I leveled my second character into his 50‚Äôs potentially wasted their time like they wasted mine is great to hear.
---
That are warrior but yes.. rogues are fine too
---
I find that when you pickpocket and cheap shot the  window does pop up but no loot,you have to loot twice once the mob is dead
---
Sounds like a fun game playing bgs and never leaving your city
---
They are not overrated and are VERY useful
---
Sprich Deutsch du Hurensohn
---
Start with spamming dungeons to acquire pre raid bis pieces and you'll earn gold from that. I had my epic mount b4 I was done with dungeons.
---
Dungeons give decent gold and if ur lucky you could get some rare stuff thats worth alot.
---
I used to contribute, answer questions, and review logs on fight club. Then i literally got retroactively banned by babyhood with reason "no reason" in log review after I participated in some light trolling which he initiated against someone who didn't read FAQ. Checking discord on an alt after I got banned he said " as of now no more trolling in this channel"
---
Would stealth or poisons on your weapons count as as buff to throw you on the list?
---
Nah, they should disable it, but it's fucked to punish people for doing stuff that's apparently totally fine as of now
---
Blizzard controls what add-ons can and can't do
---
Not that you support this idea, but why should blizzard get in the way?
---
 You are allowed to attack someone in game, you should be able to steal or scam people within the game trading system. It's what makes guilds important. It's what encourages you to be kind and make friends. Without this, the game becomes easy-arcade-mode imho. 
---
We need a new add-on like spy. A reputation add-on where you can track your faction and add notes :0.
---
I know that many guilds have a master table with reputation about players.
---
Nah, I'm just saying Alliance do this same shit too, its not some special Horde exclusive behavior. I'm not mad about it though, and I'm not making posts about Blizzard needing to fix it. 
---
Theres a difference between "complaining" and "informing".
---
So man mad people lol
---
I definitely get camped a ton as horde on Herod, like others have said it's just the state of the game unfortunately. I get that it's probably worse for the lower population faction so I take it in stride, honestly I'm pretty happy that there seems to be a lot of contest from the alliance and it's not entirely one sided on this server.
---
Great
---
For reference; 8/8 Felheart puts me at just over 4k hp
---
I‚Äôll just wipe my bum with your opinion.
---
I always chuckle when a warrior charges my mage. Honor delivery
---
Being a hunter, I'm sure you love it. Being a rogue, it is most definitly game breaking.
---
My guild went from having 20-30 people online at any given time to raidlogging within a week of p2 hitting lmao.
---
 Shadowbolt is 80-100% of our dps. 1% crit = 1% chance for double dmg. (Via ruin) So if u shadowbolt for 900, 1% crit is roughly 10 shadow dmg (10 dmg \*.85 coefficient =8.5)  Almost always you can pick up 10-12 dmg on an item instead of crit.  This isn't a perfect calculation but it's generally correct
---
What's the point of this post?
---
As a friendly holy priest I can say with certainty both rogues and mages are op.
---
Herod has some really good alliance pvpers but it is horde weighted enough that only horde can transfer out. It's weird because alli usually has brm but literally every neutral or lightly defended flight path is camped by horde.
---
Ye there isnt a single tier1 piece that is an upgrade in dps for pve in the entire set lol
---
yep, 1 guy having a good experience is proof that it's a faction balance balance problem
---
Man, I've fallen off the hype train of Classic but it's so fun to stick around this sub and watch the fireworks of nerd rage everyday lol.
---
It's pretty bad. I went that spec for leveling in 5 mans and it was disappointing w/ hellfire.
---
I mean macros kind of remove a lot of what little skill there is in the game. I have a macro I spam to target the nearest enemy player and sap. Any rogue who doesn't have it is fucked. If 2 rogues are looking for each other they just mash that macro over and over. 
---
I have one to stealth if I'm not in stealth+ambush for neutral zones. One that does vanish ambush on a chain for midcombat. 
---
I have a bunch more and they all just feel kinda cheesy.
---
Why not just play retail at this point?
---
Thanks ill definitely buy a few. :)
---
The difference in damage between a clipped rotation and a non-clipped one for Rhok is like 2%. Do whatever you feel more comfortable with.
---
They seem to avoid fights without it
---
They‚Äôre #1 at corpse camping.

WoW

I've been playing since launch üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Typical cry babies.
---
Living in Germany, playing in a German Server...using the German Client. 
---
Don't know what's wrong with that.
---
Many of us speak English but the only time I'll have to speak it , is when I'm on vacation or playing other online games with people who are not from Germany.
---
This addon should simply be Alliance-only, might help the faction balance a bit.
---
take first aid and use cannibalize on cooldown.  
---
it's so much faster than eating/drinking.
---
not really.  the only good things are HotW, devilsaur set, and cured rugged hide cooldown.
---
Ignoring all context to ridicule someone. Glad the community hasn't changed.
---
You can literally just fucking blink out of our stuns. 
---
You hace so many tools in your kit to counter us it's ridiculous.
---
If the bot is a warlock you can just wand anything they out a curse on and steal all its kills
---
Thank goodness this addons got nerfed before battlegrounds. Still I don't think it should be allowed, but at least it's not as bad as before. Having warlock/hunter pets chase you down for over 100 yards while you're stealthed is still busted.
---
That‚Äôs my secret cap. I‚Äôm always upset.
---
I've never had a problem. Must not be actually all day.
---
combined pet macro  
---
/cast spell lock  
---
/cast sacrifice  
---
/cast seduction
---
This way w/e pet you have out, it'll fire off their signature move
---
No, not even close. The worst type of consumer is the one blindly buys everything big corporations shove the way and never question their business decisions, which has led us to current retail WoW and modern gaming in general being a hellscape of microtransactions, day 1 DLC, lootboxes, and a million other anti-consumer practices.
---
SM/Ruin is kinda the all around spec
---
It's not opinion, it's math. Don't be spreading wrong information.
---
In the middle of a city, with everyone else just watching.
---
Yea, just another poor player blaming everyone else for being pvp'd on a pvp realm.  As is tradition.
---
Yeah, this is big brain time
---
But as he said you‚Äôre competing against your own faction not the opposite faction so horde having to look for players to kill makes literally no difference.
---
How did you get 600 gold by lvl 40?
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 31 and have 71g Lol
---
Or just tell them and leave. You don't have to be an asshole just because someone else was.
---
If it was based entirely on reports, anyone who even considered botting would do it
---
This IS exactly how it was 15 years ago. There are just more players now.   
---
Any oldschool players could point out the problems and the need of a lil QoL before rerelease.
---
Blizz did ya guys raw and literally put 0 effort into caring. The way they locked server numbers for name registration was a nice lil cherry on top.
---
60/40 is 150%, which is pretty bad on these massive servers.
---
They are overrated and not that useful but people still chug 'em up like candy, so just make your gold with it.
---
What do you do for a living? Do you wanna volunteer to do it for free any time you see a business doing a poor job at your position/department? No? I didn't think so. Stfu.
---
as expected when shown proof you are silent, keep being the obedient dog for those pos mods.
---
Pick a mage, warlock, any healer or spriest. And kill people while in blues easy life.
---
On Grobbulus the horde has been camping all high level areas and preventing alliance from getting world boss kills. I have no idea what these "alliance gank squads" are but I've never seen them as an alliance player.
---
No mage should be flasking in MC. PREbis for everyone typically is all you need damage wise. A good chunk of the first fights you are going to be decursing as well.
---
I'm curious, do people who defend Spy also defend the now banned LFG addon? Even if you don't consider Spy to be cheating (which is definitely arguable), it still goes against the spirit of the game.
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
It‚Äôs honestly worse since the patch. Things don‚Äôt come into my radar zone as fast and before I know it I‚Äôm already dead. I‚Äôm a priest so I really only used it to be aware when a shit ton of ally is coming for me.
---
Really not game breaking imo. It hasn‚Äôt negatively effected my gameplay. Sure I‚Äôll get ganked every once in a while but it‚Äôs not like insane. I rolled a PvP server knowing there would be PvP
---
Mine was balanced. Than refugees came. Now it's alliance controlled.
---
I honestly can't tell if you're just playing dumb or if you're actually spare parts but trying to help you comprehend this is harder than stapling jello to a tree so, I'm out. You win.

---
literally was trying to decide on a server a couple days from launch, as we were deciding benediction literally got made and popped up in front of us.  
---
Honestly so lucky, benediction is a great server. Good population, good balance, nothing to shitty has happened. Plus we have a news youtube channel (the mediocre moment) which is pretty funny
---
This might get me to roll an alt, well said.
---
Seconded, sell Jordan and get ZF staff or use library dagger with a spellpower offhand.
---
That one brings me back. Still just as funny.
---
Aight then uninstall Spy and just read the combat log instead, it's the same!
---
Again you are comparing the 2 sides when they aren‚Äôt competing vs each other. It doesn‚Äôt matter if horde have to solo farm somewhere to attain higher ranks because it‚Äôs the same with all of the rest of the horde players.
---
How fucking bad do you have to be to complain about anything as mage? I cannot fathom what disability it requires to not dominate every aspect of the game..
---
Flasks go for nearly 160g on my server. I am much better off saving it for later raids that actually need it.
---
Just at this moment a group of 20 ally controls the Badlands pass
---
Blizzard wont look at third party sources when it comes to stuff like this, so they wont be looking at any videos. Also looking at earlier examples at best they'll delete the items from him but there will be no banning. They dont ban for ninja looting anymore.
---
Has Blizz said anything about the add on yet? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs not going to be allowed, it‚Äôs comparable to the LFG add on at launch that, in their words, ruined the authentic Classic experience.
---
The cheap ones i'd do, gives a better impression when searching for guild.
---
Nah I'd have to not look at my health bars. Or my enemies, or my cooldowns or buff. Because reading is cheating.
---
They can‚Äôt get away at all, so for example mages have polymorphs that stop more than 1 enemies going after them but warriors don‚Äôt. Warriors always have to take on all the enemies and sometime when you‚Äôre solo questions you need to get through 3-4 which is very difficult.
---
Just look at the one button hunter macro for BC I think it was. Maximum dps for pressing one button that would automate everything. Minimum effort, maximum value.
---
When i have skinning on a char i make sure i level or grind in an area with mostly beast or only beast. And sell the leather to npc, if its not worth anything on the AH.
---
With herb, depends on your skill level, try and farm swift thistle. They go for quite a bit. Rogues love the tea.
---
Or go for lower herbe that are worth something, as the areas are less contested.
---
I get around 80-100 lower level ore in 30mins. I use them to craft but i could potentially sell and make a quick buck.
---
Hahah calling me mad now that I made you. Look stupid. Classic fuck boi w/ no friends. Just log onto your healer class if you wants heals.
---
Huh? I think your hotkeys need rethinking or something. Spacebar doesn't revive or do anything other than jump, by default.
---
I agree with "more" but 4-5x is clearly bullshit for current day servers.
---
I already understand Alliance are a bunch of cry babies. You literally tried to deny facts because they dont fit your narrative, you're already out ü§£ü§£
---
Still OP
---
&gt;In retail wow I'm playing outlaw rogue with a pocket healer rarely using stealth I run around like a warrior
---
This comment highlights so much that is wrong with retail. Class homogenization. Lack of class identity.
---
The whole reason i play a Rogue in Classic is to be that stealthy fuck, only picking fights when i deem it advantageous.
---
Point taken.
---
That's a good point. 
---
Just watch out for AVs if you're playing at yhour computer, that is where most remoters will be playing.
---
I have been in a guild since launch, not worried there, just wanna be the best healer I can. Any recommendations for must have healing enchants? Do they overwrite the + healing already on my gear?
---
I actually installed Spy initially for the KoS list and opponent tracking, because I knew Ally would be out ganking. I couldn't care less about the target tracking stuff.
---
that's patched
---
now you have to run through the zone and apply that buff while running through the zone
---
Just curious how you came up with 40/60 horde. Every graph I‚Äôve seen put alliance ahead.
---
Stop this tired excuse. It‚Äôs embarrassing. We know HOW it does what it does... but that‚Äôs not the point. At all.
---
Yes. Horde is worse off because the only way to get honour is solo farming whereas Allianve don't have to.
---
I'm pretty sure it's not only still online, but still getting new expansions.
---
You're... not all there are you?
---
This is game breaking in my opinion
---
Stick with it until Dec. 10, I'm horde in classic and played mostly alliance in vanilla through early stages of the game. The server pops are enormous in classic, so hopefully the bgs fill up quick and will provide some relief for the flooded world zones.
---
No, they dont.
---
&gt; This is a game about adventure, not finances.
---
Finances lead to more adventure.
---
Rez sickness it is!
---
Yea what‚Äôs the solution to getting accurate dmg readings for full raid? Everyone has to run logs?
---
Considering the toon I've been playing for P2 is level 29 right now...lol
---
But yea keep making assumptions to defend your faulty position.
---
I'd agree if not for hunter existing. Mage is easy as hell but hunters are just downright brain dead to play in solo content
---
Blizzard censors log data to limit what addons can reveal or know about enemy combatants, lets just say their current parameters disagree with the community.
---
This is not the issue of the addon, it's how much of the underlying logs that Blizzard permits to being exposed.
---
The solution is not to ban the addon, in fact if you know anything about addon development you'll realize it's not possible to "ban" addons.
---
roflmao ever heard of Glider?
---
Spoiler - there's going to be an epidemic of AFKers in Pugs
---
Will you be sharing the results?
---
MORE
---
It's not preraid bis for anyone.
---
Even the fuckin' level 34 caster dagger from Library + aquementas offhand gives more spell damage.
---
Stop using details, track threat gen manually scrub.
---
Shiny Ragnaros!
---
He posted a while back, he's been leveling them all evenly since the start
---
Was it on incendius?
---
So where then, between 2 years and fifteen years, is an acceptable length of time to wait before torpedoing the game?  
---
5 years? 10 years?
---
They changed that, didn't they? At the same time they nerfed the combat log range, they also made it so a buff only appeared in the combat log the moment it was gained.
---
Unless you are speedrunning there is no reason now imho.
---
I decided to just enchant gear that is BiS and I will use in BWL which will hopefully be at least a bit difficult so the enchants will matter a bit.
---
Only if the warlock can target you while stealthed (eg. very low level, warlock has Catseye goggles,...). If you can't be seen, there's no way to send the pet on you.
---
It's working fine. You probably just don't understand how it actually works in Classic.
---
Nice emojis and defense of a ridiculous add on. This is NOT at all with the spirit of the game similar to the LFG add on but even more game breaking. Typical retail baby
---
There were several alliance raids running around IF defending last night, we wiped and camped the horde a ton tbh. I dont remember what time it was exactly, but it lasted for quite a few hours. Also, it's an alliance city which means you do NOT have to be pvp flagged, which will help you to not be ganked. 
---
I hate being ganked by rogues in my own city, but by now everyone should be aware that there are rogues hiding literally everywhere and take necessary precautions.
---
Rogs too the meters. Fury wars can beat em but they are top tier.
---
I almost wanna roll on shaz just to kill this guy for that reason.
---
Even the state it's in now is BS. It has changed the game drastically for stealthers and not in a fun way.
---
Yeah after I rez. Stealth+vanish+sprint and I'm 30+ yards away and they catch me. It's mainly one dude on Fairbanks I run into very often.
---
there are a ton of low level troll hunter bots with nons3nse names and pets with names in chinese. i take great pleasure in camping them every time i see them
---
As others have said Valor is a good place to start.
---
Leggings from DM:west are really good.
---
Stoneskin gargoyle cloak if you can get lucky.
---
Maybe download atlas loot and just browse through the endgame instance drops.
---
You want to focus on stamina and crit while maintaining 5% hit.
---
Don't forget to enchant your gear too once you get it, can pick up a few stats there.
---
That should hold you over till the blue pvp gear.
---
They appear on the buff bar, so I‚Äôd say yes.
---
Or if he's human with perception/ has felhunter out.
---
Sell it, pls sell it. Gold farming in classic sucks so badly even if you're a mage, it's tedious and boring. Do yourself a favor and get the extra gold you'll be glad you did it in the long run.
---
On it! Will do. :D
---
I remember your post on getting all your guys to 30. This is the most depressing "where are they now" I've ever seen.
---
Imo you shouldnt be able to see those as well. 
---
Part of classic is not knowing if that mage is casting a 6sec pyroblast or a 3.5 sec fireball. Ill CS the pyro, but tank the fireball. The fact that an enemy can see which is which WITHOUT having looked at the combat log itself. Is bullshit.
---
What's succubuses, precious?
---
It is immensely true that even peoples experiences on the same server are different. As an Alliance still trying to hit 60 on Benediction I cannot say a single good thing about the server. I haven't been able to complete a single quest outside of a dungeon since phase 2 dropped and that's not for a lack of trying. Every single flight path I land at has at least 2 rogues just lying in wait and there are squads of AT LEAST 4-5 horde just trotting around every quest area. I truly have not found any of this balance that OP speaks about but I would definitely love it if it was even an ounce of my experience on this terrible server.
---
Hunters literally have one of the most punishing DPS rotations in the entire game though. Hunters might be easier to solo-level as, but they're sure as hell not easier at endgame. For PvP mages also have more favorable matchups than hunters.
---
Dot is a Knight in Tier gear. He clearly plays way more than any of us so I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to be gone anytime soon ...
---
False dichotomy. Knowing how much damage friendlies are doing against pve targets is not even in the same ballpark as an add on that scrubs the logs for enemy players and makes them instantly targetable without you even seeing them. Seriously man give it up, it‚Äôs embarrassing.
---
The other dude with the huge write up has interesting ideas, but I largely disagree with a lot of it.
---
DF-Holy Shock will save people.  Crit is usually less useful for healers since it is unpredictable.  DF removes that part of it so DF-Holy shock is an instant heal for as large as it can do and can often save lives.  The change to making holy shock heal is the thing which made me go deep holy to pvp during vanilla because the class had a big problem in that area.  Flash heals for about the same, but does have the 1.5sec cast time.  It's not super easy to kick, but getting it kicked can be a big deal.  Holy light is very hard to get off against good players.  DF can also be purged so if you try to DF-Light, good shaman can see an purge it if not just earth shock you.  Holy Shock gives you another option, and it is actually quite powerful.  I really think he is massively underselling how useful holy shock is.
---
Crit in general is less useful than for dps due to the unpredictability of it, but in pvp critting can be life and death.  Also mana regen is more useful than he makes it seem.  No you aren't going to have these prolonged battles for like 30 minutes, but if you are running with a flag carrier during WSG, you can't guarantee yourself time to stop and drink.
---
Very often your job as a holy paladin is to stay alive.  You will be a target so the longer you can keep yourself alive the better.
---
I was going to prop this one. Really nice design.
---
I was gonna put succubi but it sounds.. pretentious
---
Sulfuron
---
The first tier of protection is basically just filler, they're both pretty bad talents for group pvp. The armor is neglectable and you won't be blocking much unless you're 1v1 vs a melee.
---
Precision is a nice talent for seal hits or straight up dmg, I'd often switch to a TuF when I wasn't getting focused for some juicy 1k crits. It also helped when trying to proc Hand of Edward but that's a bit niche. 
---
My favoured build for AB/WSG/World PvP was https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031015011-0532410003-05005001
---
I also loved https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102501351-0522-05032001 when I was doing both PvE &amp; PvP. Also starts becoming very fun once spelldmg gear starts kicking in.
---
There's many specs that work for a paladin which is part of the fun. Imho the most important talents are: Guardian's favor, Imp Hammer of Justice and Divine Favor.
---
Or if undead you also have will of the forsaken, and soon pvp trinket.

Not to mention coldsnap if your blink or mage bubble is on CD.

Nah. Just salty about people like you.

Lol I mean there are horde at the Gates, in the canals, in the mystic ward, at the flight master, at the ah, in the mage tower. 
---
You want help in Red Ridge? What about the two hunters on the roof in Darkshire? What about the 69s at  the hunters camp in STV? 
---
Would you like the boat back? Or would you like to land in South Shore? 
---
Look at that picture again.
---
There are 1.5k alliance players and 3k horde players and you think those 50 people in IF are the problem?
---
G G G G G-Unitttt
---
Maybe, but if a lock sees you in the distance and sends his pet, then they'll keep tracking you even with stealth.
---
99% of people do
---
?
---
\*Presses Fear\*, \*Presses DOT, DOT\*, \*Presses Mind Flay\*, \*Auto Blackout Stun\*, \*Win\*
---
Wow, such skill, much shadow priest.
---
Very short version is you decay 20% of your RP per week. It is calculated before the amount you gain this week. There's 5k RP in each rank(except for 2 and 3 which is smaller). So at rank 3 and 8% I'd wager you are about 9k RP. This means you will decay 1.8k, however if your net RP gain is below the decay, you actually only lose 50% of the RP. So you will lose 900 RP, putting you down to rank 3 at about 62% progress if you don't get 15 HK's this week.
---
Horde has more players for sure, but ally seems to have more hardcore/active pvpers/raiders.
---
if you somehow had 50% dodge and 50% parry you would be immune to attack damage from the front. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_table
---
Useful advice. Thanks!
---
The difference is that horde players have to put in more hours to achieve the desired result. There's more active rankers on that faction and less enemies to kill, so it becomes a lot more competitive for those two reasons.
---
Faction does matter a lot in terms of time investment and horde is the least advantaged PVP faction. It's not until TBC and arenas arrive that the PVP advantage truly begins to skew in horde favor.
---
Of course, he's a hunter, without Spy how else could he send his pet after stealthed rogues?
---
Good idea. Thanks. Idk why I never thought of that
---

Probably need a ui overhaul to do this, i use elvui and i know some people like bartender
---
The population sites are to blame for a lot of this. People think these sites are the gospel truth, in reality it's just "how many people from each faction decided to install the census addon." I've seen people point to some of this data as proof, and then I look at that site and some of the servers are listed as 5k on one faction and *zero players* on the other. Don't buy into these sites, they're pretty worthless.
---
That seems super broken I feel like it should deaggro on stealth. But yeah mystery solved I guess
---
Hunter pets don't seem so adept at this
---
Yeah, how does the math work out here? I guess in your example, we can think of flipping two coins, and we're happy as long as one of them comes up heads, which is a 75% chance.
---
That correspond to multiplying the chances of *not* dodging and *not* parrying - we want the probability of not dodging AND not parrying AND not blocking, subtracted from 1 to get the probability that we do either dodge or parry or block. So something like:
---
    av = 1 - (1 - dodge) * (1 - parry) * (1 - block)
---
Sure, I appreciate that. Thanks for the reply.
---
Well they still need to get the account and double check. If it's not being pick up automatically by anti cheat software then a system needs to see a few reports and check the account. Then you let it run for a week monitored and look for odd behavior that would likely make this a bot. Then a human would need to review it, as a set of data, and assure it is a potential bot. Then it would need to be cross referenced with other potential bots to ensure it is actually a bot, and not just some weird dude who plays funny. Once they can match its behavior to several other accounts then they can confirm it's a bot and ban it. 
---
They would then be able to update the bot detection engine to catch other copies of the same bot. It's a long process.
---
By all means, keep whining
---
You should consider your other options first.
---
Enchants, spell power on weapon requires a bunch of resources of expensive.
---
Bloodvine set will require in total 10 mooncloth when available.
---
Consumes for raiding.
---
I got the felcloth bag and I'd probably manage just fine without it. Imo preparing for mats for enchants should be prioritized. But it's up to you üôÇ
---
After suppression room their usefulness disappears as they are outshined by warriors in every category
---
Wow how did I not come across this... thank you!!!
---
Not sure why, but I am intrigued, sir. Please do explain and share.
---
Nobody wants that, nobody said that is what he should do, BUT nobody wants a "know it all" either, claiming it's soooo easy to fix, when it's clearly the biggest issue in the entire gaming industry.
---
If it was easy, there wouldn't be bots...
---
You are trying to conflate a visual UI modification to receiving real-time, distilled information about your \*enemeies\* abilities used and ability to hunt them down by clicking on them and sending a pet after them?  Really?
---
Blizzard claim actual logging is accurate (somehow), I don't see how it is: running logs for everyone won't help since it's not possible to merge them iirc.
---
Feral can actually be decent dps when power shifting. Prepare for carpal tunnel though
---
I'd rather hit for 1200, 9 out of 10 times than hit for 1000, 10 out of 10 times. There's not enough good hit gear in the game to warrant downgrading with subpar gear if better gear is available. And in this case, choker, robe of the void/volatile power, and mana igniting cord or sash of whispered secrets are all better than current hit pcs like star, T1 chest, and banthok. But go ahead and enjoy the game if you're having fun being mediocre.
---
Lol oy. 
---
If a server has 6k people and 4k are horde and 2k alliance that means theoretically the horde can put 4k people anywhere the alliance have 10 or 20 or 2,000. 
---
There are not 250 people playing.
---
People shit on valor but imo it's a great starting place
---
Its moreso the lack of glancing blow
---
There is an add-on that does that, and if multiple people in the same guild have the add-on, then you can see notes that someone else input for a specific player. It basically gives a heads-up to any guild members if they're dealing with someone untrustworthy. 
---
If you want to have no oversight at all in the game world, that's fine, but that's not the game world that Blizzard has either created or advertised up until now. There are fail safes that would need to be added if you want this type of game world, and they currently don't exist in any way, shape, or form. The example that comes to mind here is place the mats in the bottom of the trade window and have the crafter create the item without actually needing to receive the items. There's other interactions that would need to be safe proofed as well, but this is just the main one that's applicable to the question. 
---
From what it sounds like, you're basically wanting an entire game universe governed by the players, such as Eve Online. They have the craziest stories about this type of behavior. I remember one where basically a guy spent over a year infiltrating a rival guild, only to betray them, and they were able to kill the GM, sell their body (because that's what the contract was for) and clean out their equivalent of the guild bank. It definitely makes the universe feel more real, but if you're going to foster that type of environment then you HAVE to have fail safes in place that prevent mistakes from happening for those players who want a trusted transaction.
---
Well, that sounds like straight up cheating unless you're a Hunter.
---
You can do every bit of the game as a tauren. Even naxx. 
---
Kind regards, a tauren warrior.
---
He just got fucking wrecked.
---
Its more efficient to cast 3 life taps in a row because you'll get your natural mana regeneration going again. 2 taps into a shadow bolt will net you a single tick during the cast
---
They've had 15 years to collect data. Its time to act.
---
this is exactly how vanish worked in Vanilla... people yhink that vanish its supposed to be instant combat drop.. never worked that way
---
Cured rugged hide cd is the only thing you got. Come phase 4 you will be able to craft NR gear for phase 5(AQ).
---
But yes the profession is shit, it's only useful for guild utility.
---
Im not going to go through the process of leveling back to 54, ive already spent a ton of time in that char.
---
Can't switch servers with my char either.
---
Kek .... that's me! Ohhh look he gave +240 honor!
---
This just isn‚Äôt fun. Try taking the boat from menthil as a lowbie and it‚Äôs straight up camping with 60s - there‚Äôs a massive discrepancy with guards at boats vs guards at zeppelins. This was done in vanilla  because the alliance were the larger population and this should be rectified to reflect today‚Äôs populations.
---
This is one of numerous issues with the server pops - eg competing w world bosses when there‚Äôs 300 Horde to Alliance 200 / Try leveling w numerous patrols just camping / Try to PvP as a small team and then get consistently zerged / etc etc etc It is not fun.
---
Go roll/transfer to Horde in Heartseaker. I don‚Äôt mean it as an insult, you might want to try experiencing this shitshow first hand.
---
BGs are close so this should alleviate some of the problem, and it will be a rude awakening for some as they won‚Äôt be able to merely Zerg ppl down.
---
Back in vanilla there was 2 major twink brackets ( 19 and 29 ) but I don't think 29 bracket is realistic today. There isn't a lot of room for speculation in Classic except specific boes like 19 bracket, leveling blue boes ( warrior weapons, mage int gear..etc ),   lvl 1 weapons with fiery enchant, rare pets...
---
Haha I know I was just joking for the most part. Warriors are a bitch to grind. Source: am warrior
---
Doubt this is real tbh. The grammar is terrible.
---
Lol man, I get people complaining about some 80/20 server but it really seems most of the time it's someone getting camped at a flight path and all of a sudden their server is 9:1 horde.
---
Sissies
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! Anglerfish typically live at the bottom of the ocean, between 400 to 2,000 metres, in complete darkness.
---
Except a rogue can hold a flag solo for a long time for help to arrive if its only one or two
---
Not neccesarily but yes often they are. But due to vanilla gearing it doesn't matter. You won't EVER find a speedrun or guild that doesn't run at least 3-4 rogues.
---
https://youtu.be/nWYAFXFqu0Q

Jesus I wish they went for 1k on incendius.. I'd be crazy rich :)
---
Somebody the other day tried to argue with me that it wasn‚Äôt cheating because all of this information is given to the user in their combat log. My response was ‚Äúwell then let him monitor their combat log manually, this is cheating regardless.‚Äù Nothing to respond to that one.
---
This adds an extra layer of fun to BG PUGs.
---
I agree with you. 
---
I‚Äôm more interested in the reasons WHY there‚Äôs more horde in the first place. How many people switched from alliance to horde over the years because of alliance lack of willingness to pvp. 
---
Sure. Horde has better racials (which is up for debate I suppose)but really as far as power and classes both factions could be viable in pvp. 
---
So alliance can not help eachother, hang out in SW and IF all day and just let rogues kill their alts at the FPs and complain about it and have all the people who WANT to pvp roll horde for their new alts and ect. 
---
So to me they are the problem. I don‚Äôt really care because I am a casual player but I‚Äôm honestly just curious as to why and how the unbalanced happen. I imagine on day 1 of vanilla release everything wasn‚Äôt automatically split 60-40 in favor of horde.
---
What about resistances? Hunters pets are very flexible in this regard, and I can always respec their skills according to what I'm farming. How do locks deal with that?
---
&gt; theoretically
---
And realistically, I keep seeing posts about Alliance sitting around in IF. Get the fuck out and defend your lowbies?
---
This is false, go try it in a duel. It just shows when someone reapplies a buff/removes it
---
Not like he cares
---
So I should have prefaced this in my post and will make an edit, I am the Main tank of my guild and have almost all the BiS tanking gear apart from the epic cape (I have stoneskin gargoyle), belt of might/onslaught, ring of accuria. I just don‚Äôt know if there are oddball pieces of gear like Lionheart helm or anything of the sort I should be getting instead or the normal might set
---
So, you don't think anything in coding has changes in the past 15 years? Nah, let's use 15 years old data, totally not outdated....
---
Combat is dick for BGs. A rogue without preparation is just so inferior to a rogue with it. Your role in BGs is to defend the flag and help kill EFC.
---
Xfers off of skeram are Horde Only atm
---
No, I wish warriors had Victory Rush. Miss that sooooooo much, lol.
---
First learn how to spell second learn how to play your class smh
---
Theramore guard is on Grob yes
---
There used to be one in retail that helped shadow priests with insanity.  I believe it was called time to death.  Have t checked if it exists now.
---
What hes saying is swapping it when there is 30 sec left so the 30 sec equip change cd and the item cd overlap and he can use it 30 sec sooner than waiting for the cd to be up amd then waiting for 30 sec.
---
So you want to ban DBM and any similar addons right?
---
That's a content release schedule not an addon you troglodytic invertebrate
---
Google "BIS &lt;class&gt; &lt;spec&gt; enchants" and it'll tell you.  As a resto druid...my T1/T2/BIS gear has the best enchants I can find, while gear that's good, but not BIS gets "pretty good" enchants.  Like "stats" vs "greater stats" on chest for example.
---
It's all about effort, even if you have a guild...if your guild is raiding, you should be putting in the effort.  Gold isn't hard to come by, the second tier enchants are never that expensive.  You don't have to min-max wastefully, but it's still worth the additional mana/regen from the enchants.
---
hmmm. spy for me dose not work nearly this well maybe in doing somthing  wrong?
---
Benediction is 60/40 in favor of the horde. Of course the guy playing a horde character on a horde dominated server is having fun doesn‚Äôt see a problem...
---
Imagine comparing something that‚Äôs bannable to something that isn‚Äôt.
---
I would recommend downloading the twitch client and then browsing the most popular addons through there. Lots to choose from!
---
Just stop with your incessant whining and find something positive in your life. Nothing's ever good enough for wow players man, they always gotta complain and bitch and moan.
---
Good tips ty
---
Hit, not crit
---
Yeah, VR definitely booped some snoots.
---
Our faction numbers may be close (around 45A/55H) but the horde side has way more fat, sweaty, nerdlords, who play 15 hours a day, have all the best shit, and show up in certain areas explicitly to kill and camp players.
---
Menethil boat Pvp, however, is pretty damn fun. There is enough traffic in that spot that it‚Äôs a great place to farm honor. Even if you die to big horde group controlling the boat, eventually enough run off from people not being able to get on the boat over runs the horde. Then you farm them like 4 to 5 times.
---
So 5% hit then u prio stam/crit if u have that mugh gear u will likely be the most geared warrior in every fight/bg. Weapon is ur most important piece, do u have an epic 2h? If not just get demonshear from strat live
---
This works except have someone on another account make that name
---
"Still OP" if you need an addon to see what is going on in a 45(?) yard radius around your character you're probably a boomer anyway
---
Look at the stones on this one.

It might not be. The honor could be derived from other factors every day, so it is more of a snapshot than a running value.

k
---
I think i missed the boat on 19 twink items.
---
One of my guildies got 10 boes he bought for 20-30g, now worth 120+ i think.

Ill still see where this goes.

There's always at least 2 bots in Desolace farming the shellfish cages.

I've played since TBC but ok bud. Also from Legacy Addons, IE addons that worked in Vanilla: A WoW AddOn which tries to detect enemies in the near vicinity. Detection is done by registering to events which are triggered by enemy players
---
I get it though. You're getting rolled and you dont like it, so it MUST be because the other side is just straight up cheating.
---
Badlands hahahahah.

My main is Quackmandan, I recruited a random guy named Quacksalot into the guild, and then a month later the two of us abducted a person named Quack to join our guild. We had to track Quack down in Arathi Highlands, and found her deep in the dry whisker gorge cave. I love these moments in classic.
---
What fucking job are you talking about? I bet someone would be willing to put up with your "should I make a human warrior for pve" question if you paid them, but I have a feeling you're not paying anyone in FC
---
If you got anymore questions post them, I‚Äôm sure people can help you with answers!
---
Go to BRD I dare you
---
They all have it BiS up to Naxx.  The guides all have P2 BiS, and its still all WS.
---
SS a pally and bribe them to DI you when you get to P3 so your aggro resets and you get a free and clear shot to just start spamming shadowbolts.
---
Outside of that, manage your threat so she descends for p3 right as you get fireballed and drop threat, then don't stand with the idiot mages who iceblock and get the raid breathed on.
---
Because we're talking about tanking.
---
Learn to meme.
---
As long as people aren‚Äôt abusing multiboxing in pvp and the like, Blizzard doesn‚Äôt care as it‚Äôs a lot of extra money from subs. People often use it to gold farm, sometimes to sell the gold after
---
Why would horde have long bg queue's? Aren't bg queues cross server?
---
&gt; without seeing them
---
You do know this was already nerfed thanks to the combat log reduction, right? Which supposedly is now (more) in line with Vanilla's behavior. 
---
Maybe spend less time bitching about things that are already resolved, and work with your guilds on a WPVP strategy.
---
looks more like mcdonalds
---
Retail literally still have more players than classic, you're talking fucking nonsense. I don't care what kind of criclejerk you belong to, but remember that classic players are still the minority of the WoW community. They less than doubled the amount of active subs last quarter when classic was released, and that was with A LOT of people resubbing for 8.2 and some for 8.2.5. retail has a lot more players than classic.
---
&gt; Now it's a problem because it can be used in a PVP situation? 
---
Uhh, **YES?**
---
There is a HUGE difference between ***anything*** that gives you an advantage in a PVE situation vs one that gives you an advantage in a PVP situation.  This is the same reason why Blizzard themselves balance abilities differently around PVP and PVE in retail?    
---
If the core of your argument is "get over yourself" then there is no point in having this discussion with you.  At the end of the day you probably are too shitty to play against rogues in a fair scenario and enjoy being able to run the hell away when you see a stealth pop up on your screen.
---
Horde dominated server = target rich environment
---
Gonna get downvoted.
---
I play as horde on stallag and BRM is mostly controlled by alliance. I have a 30 minute death walk to BRD legit every single time I go there. Not saying faction imbalance isn‚Äôt a problem, but let‚Äôs not pretend that just being horde on any server means you get to own the world.
---
People exaggerate.
---
I leveled a hunter to 60 then leveled a warrior. It was slower but not bad.
---
Just keep your weapon updated and seek to tank dungeons whenever possible. You'll get gear and easy XP.
---
I feel like I am missing some context here or there is something I'm simply missing.
---
You are the man! Thanks for these pointers!
---
Odd how that "someone" uploaded the picture 2mins before your comment.
---
I mean, if ur a mage at least lvl 40 u should have no trouble killing 60 warriors baring a sword proc crit the 1 time they get to hit u
---
Yeah it's pretty broken, but it was like that in vanilla as well. Not sure when they fixed it.
---
Incendius is like this too and it‚Äôs wonderful.
---
I really like Warlock's class quests. Which other classes deliver on their class fantasy as well as locks do?
---
The orc racial is completely op in vanilla and if I wasn‚Äôt playing with real life friends I would have been an orc rogue or lock.
---
I still don‚Äôt think you understand.
---
There are 1000 to 2000 alliance players on a server at once. There are no more layers. 
---
There are not that many people in IF. There just aren‚Äôt. Most ARE out there pvping or leveling. 
---
Count those people in IF. 
---
Where do you think the other 950 are?
---
I started a new toon on golemagg and had a priest harassing me in Barrens to a point where I deleted the character and never looked back.
---
No that is just straight cheating. Or lying. Hunters have a range on their track humanoids, what his post is saying implies it does it everywhere.
---
Remote play isn't against TOS.

If the remote technology that exited today existed in 2006, i'd be taking my Iphone 8 to work with my Dualshock 4, booting up steam ios to play BGs in highschool.

Glider is against ToS. Many people who used Glider got banned. Trust me on that lmao.

When do the sunken temple class quests come out?

Its been 6 days on EU-Gehennas. What the fuck?

I have not gotten a two hander yet, been trying to get demonshear! Also bought our axe smith arcanite reaper plans and have been doing jump runs to get the crystals for the bars. Right now I‚Äôm fury/prot and use the Dal‚ÄôRends for PvP, I know arms is far superior for PvP and will be going arms when BGs come out but for world pvp it‚Äôs been smashing people
---
A true internet classic.
---
In an analogous situation I was interested to see that the PvP trinkets were in their original form and not their streamlined "breaks any and all CC" form. That said I have no clue when the PvP trinkets were changed.
---
I dont see how anyone can NOT see how this addon provides an advantage that is antithetical to the purpose of the gameplay and its fairness.
---
you literally cant sign your rights away, thats illegal. i can sign a contract saying that its okay for blizzard to kill and eat me. completely false.
---
Complaining about horde is just an insta karma grab on this subreddit.
---
Answering the exhaustive list of addons would be hard...i'll assume you don't need basics or core things.
---
If you want to raid as resto, get vuhdo or healbot...it's a massive difference in your healing and it makes other healers more efficient too.
---
I'd also suggest looking at macros for common things.  Like all of my "form" buttons actually shift me out of one form and into the target form...reducing button presses by one if i need to shift from cat to bear or vice versa.
---
I don't know about you, but I love being outed by people with no legitimate reason to know I'm even near them. Makes getting to ubrs sooooo much fun.
---
Right, but the game resets that 30 sec on equip if I remember correctly. I don‚Äôt have my game on right now to try it.
---
I think you're really just dumb, the picture was uploaded a month and 3 days ago.
---
My favorite thing is to AFK in IF while watching a movie on my hunter. My pet is set to agro, running either stealthed or humanoids while im in shadow melded. With the help of spy my pet will rush any enemy in my sight radius in IF. I'm not big into pvp but I'm rank 4 master sergeant by just standing there. Thanks spy addon :D
---
Yeah it should be like this:
---
ChanceToAvoid=1-((1-parryChance)*(1-dodgeChance)*(1-missChance))
---
There are 2k alliance.
---
There are 50 in IF.
---
Where do you think the other 1950 are?
---
Careful kiddo, you‚Äôre headed for the Danger Zone

Lmao cheater

I stopped reading after your first sentence. That‚Äôs factually false you complete idiot.

Yes, can easily be done with linking an alternative account to your main battle.net account. On the launcher you can select which account to login, simply click the dropdown and select the 2nd account after logging on your main

I'm debating whether or not to buy staff of jordan for my warlock alt. If I buy it, it's gotta be today or I'll never be able to afford it because of the twink market explosion in two weeks.
---
Is staff of jordan really good for a warlock? A quick glance at the stats makes me think yes, but I'm not too knowledgeable about the various options for warlock weapons.

Kill the fucking add on and ban anyone who tries to replicate it. Solved

Ask everyone you can to report your name

I always figured Frodo was a rogue

Yeah

 It reads and macros targets faster than a human can. Almost to the point where it automates it, which is illegal per the TOS. 
---
Atleast reducing combat log distance helped.
---
Druids have a good amount of class quests starting out, then they just kinda stop and you train forms at the class trainer. I think lock might be the most fleshed out class for quests.
---
Playing video games at all means you have no life
---
My favorite part about levelling prot was I could always get quick dungeons and do them 3-4 times, so that I could wait on a zone until it was yellow/green quests and just plow through it fast.
---
Slightly outlevelling content as a warrior is awesome for increased rage generation which makes everything feel better.
---
It's not that you die easier, it's that you've got no self heals, and nothing can be done if you agro 1 too many mobs.  Most classes have at least 1 "out" to get away, warrior don't.
---
Have melee stand at max melee range, worked for us.
---
What do you mean "somehow"? Raid logs and the in game combat log are two different systems.
---
Hit isn't much more than a 1% DPS increase
---
Usually people solo dungeons or parts of a dungeon for gold. What I did to find interesting gold farming routines was I'd google my class + solo + name of dungeon and then watch what they did to determine how worthwhile it'd be.
---
As a Druid you can solo farm Maraudon or Dire Maul East. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ElZzjdPP1A) of a Druid doing DME.
---
Which makes sense for technical detection methods but not player reported bots. Bot makers can work around technical detection if they figure it out, but they can't work around players detecting them and reporting it.
---
It‚Äôs not always a race, but you enjoy your big epeen dos bud. :)
---
Except the other faction when you‚Äôre questing alone *
---
Think It's worth buying Executioners Cleaver as an upgrade from WW Axe?
---
My WW Axe does however have Crusader enchant on it
---
I understand what you are saying. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand what I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm curious why there is an imbalance in every server. Idc about the racials or who‚Äôs leveling and who‚Äôs not. 
---
The simple fact is over the years more and more people ended up playing horde. Why? Did a lot of people start off as alliance and switched to horde? Why? 
---
On this reddit according to many I‚Äôve seen it seems like in general, alliance is much less interested in pvp than horde players. Did this lead to the unbalance or was it other things?
---
I‚Äôm genuinely just curious about the social aspect of it. I‚Äôm not here to argue about how many people are in ironforge.
---
When BGs come out, you can (and should, for don julio's) grind AV rep the first couple days and pick up The Unstoppable Force. It's better than demonshear imo, and you don't really benefit from being arms in AV (hell, your team is going to do better with a geared MT for the bosses).
---
&gt;raiding, farming or waiting to bg
---
Oh please, like BRM hasn't been camped on every PvP server since honor release
---
Wtf is that comparison? CSGO is a competitive game, Wow is not.
---
Yeah only the leader does, but after the bg everyone gets ported to where they queued from.
---
I‚Äôm having a really good time leveling my warrior. I died more then my mage, but the trade-off is I‚Äôm always able to find a group if i tank. To make me survive a little longer I picked up alchemy to make my own healing potions and just made sure to level up first aid so that I can heal on the fly if I need to.
---
Arcanite reaper seems crazy expensive when u can get an equal or better wpn in demonshear in a few runs.
---
I didn‚Äôt know this. Thanks!
---
Really? I'm horde on Benediction and alliance controls Searing Gorge, LHC, and DM at least 60% of the time.
---
Please remove spy it actually ruins the game
---
Maybe on retail
---
Sell. I know its a good upgrade, but u can either get the offhand/dagger from SM or the the ZF staff. The only time i bought that staff was for a lv 39 twink.
---
How is it a snide response? I'm asking you honestly. It's not a throwaway account, it's literally an account created to talk about Census, but it's hopeless. Why? Because of people like you.
---
&gt;Actual queue numbers.
---
"Why don't you provide something that doesn't exist yet????". Nice one.
---
Dumb question, how do I get into the fight club discord......
---
Optimal flag room defender is a rogue no?
---
Emojis on candy. Fuck this timeline.
---
You don't really need addons until 60 but for druid macros make life so much easier. I would look for druid specific macros if I was you.
---
danke doktor
---
"Trying to justify cheating"
---
RemindMe! 11 days ‚Äúwe will see!!‚Äù
---
Yes, how dare players voice their concerns about the hilariously unbalanced state some PvP servers are in.
---
Phase 5
---
Better have a macro that spits our their wep skill and hit %
---
Since avoidance is a pretty underwhelming stat in this phase with the content we have right now
---
i dont understand economy at all :) thats why i have 7 lvl 60/7 accounts :)))))))))
---
Not correct. The highest standing player each week always gets 13,000 RP, no matter how many rankers there were.
---
What other iems are there for +herb?
---
I thought it was a Dark Crystal reference üòÇ
---
The server I"m is quite balanced, and the 60s who enjoy pvp are having fun. Even on a balanced server it is still an extremely frustrating experience to level though and you pretty much have to level via dungeons. which makes it difficult to play if you have less than 2 hours.
---
Install it. The more people who use it, the more likely it will be removed. Warning: it ruins the atmosphere and fun of the game, turning it into an automated honor farming experience.
---
"Real WoW players only use the addons I approve!"
---
Yea, the entire problem isn't the addon in and of itself, it's the combat log range. Which was severely reduced already. 
---
&gt; not good enough
---
Gatekeeping is cute.
---
Pve yes, pvp not so much.
---
True, but nature immune mobs are worse for ele.
---
I stand corrected. Well done.
---
It's cheating, just happens to be exploiting a hole in the system meant to help Add-ons and players understanding their combat.
---
You didn't need to play on them, a quick search would be enough to know this took place. Classic doesn't matters to Blizzard. Retail has more players and is WAY more profitable.
---
So much Stockades, is the drops that god?
---
Why is 29 not realistic?
---
Wow now I know how texroadhouse, the piece of shit alliance hunter, was always able to get such a jump on me in un goro. This shouldn't be allowed.
---
It's fairly close, yes, which is why I don't much like the T1.  I wear them, but only until I rank up.
---
That's not true. Get a castbar mod and you can see what the person is casting. You could do that in vanilla.
---
&gt; So we can ban Spy ok, and by your logic we have to ban all the addons. 
---
Your argument is bad and you should feel bad.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence
---
All combat with players now disables any and all addons.
---
That would be a bummer if it was only heartseeker. I saw earthfury is pretty balanced.
---
/tar playername
---
How do you know retail has more players than classic?
---
also you might look into nature resistance gear. the demand will skyrocket when AQ release but again I have no idea about the profits
---
Well, some of them are surely level, which means they arent 60.
---
We used to turn tides in W:AR with 6 man squads. Lrn2organize.
---
Why does the ultimate meme spec get no love, full melee survival hunter?
---
Folks, I'll surface this idea again. Limit opposing faction combat logs to only show enemy players you are currently in combat with, Two: put a delay on combat log reading for enemy players so it cannot funnel reliable information in real-time, but can still be post-analyzed for whatever reason a player deems necessary.
---
Hand/Blessing of freedom.
---
No it won't.  Still .1% of people will have it after 14 weeks
---
"Good" to know...
---
Add-on are supposed to give your informations that you ALREADY have easier to Rea and understand.
---
This one give you info that you shouldn't have
---
There‚Äôs a significant correlation between players who leveled early, farmed gold for epic mount and ran dungeons for pre-bis prior to P2 and those who are really enjoying P2.  I‚Äôm in that group and I‚Äôve had a blast in P2, but I‚Äôm not blind enough to think that my experience is shared by all.  I feel really bad for any player that has to do any leveling/farming/dungeoning right now.  Less so for the dominant faction, but even then it‚Äôs still got to be a huge hassle these days.
---
While it's not that hard, it's still way harder than most classes. Fuck the timing on 1 ability and you'll lose a bunch of DPS. A lot harder than clicking the same button over and over. Also need to manage pet.
---
Lots of dudes playing chicks.
---
I‚Äôd skip arcanite reaper unless you‚Äôre doing it for sentimental value- that‚Äôs a LOT of Arcanite Bars for not all that much benefit, when you could instead put those bars towards pieces you wouldn‚Äôt replace with offspec drops from MC- items such as the Lionheart Helm which is going to be one of the best threat generating items in your toolkit throughout the entire Classic content cycle.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if reserve runs are a thing on your server but I‚Äôd suggest setting up Strat Live groups for orb farming and then strategically not grabbing any DPS who use 2handers- a soft reserve, so to speak. Then just run that until Demonshear drops.
---
Other than that, I‚Äôve been rocking a mixture of Valor and Might; it works well enough, but Arms is extremely reliant on having a good enough weapon to make everything else work.
---
Hello there
---
It's not an anecdote if you've tested it 700 times farming DM N
---
Lmao people are just absolutely bent on inventing their own narrative about why things are the way they are.
---
Maybe when involuntary wpvp stops ruining the game we can start on this minor inconvenience
---
Depends on which [site](https://imgur.com/a/09i8dxX) you look at.
---
There is no way that is the optimal rotation. If your auto happens to be just about to fire when aimed comes up, you're suppose to clip it?
---
I don‚Äôt have access to WoWs servers to pull 100,000 Angerforge kills and build a sample to test with in excelq. 3rd party sites don‚Äôt appear to include any other data aside from kills.
---
So the only other approach is crowd sourced data from people who are kind enough to share, and hoping most people are honest. Unless Blizzard is going to post a spreadsheet of player scrubbed datasets of all dungeons and their drops (doubt that‚Äôll ever happen).
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics
---
Ok. All addons now disable when you enter PVP combat. 
---
Did you know the Blizzard interface used to be stored in the Addons folder? In the spirit of no changes, we're gonna go back to that too. So zero interface in PVP. 
---
&gt; run away when you see a stealth popup
---
Nah, typically that ends with a ?? Rogue or Druid murdering me. 
---
&gt; fair scenario.  
---
&gt; stealth
---
Lol ok.
---
I‚Äôve been googling stuff and found it hard to find info that is really simply stated. A lot of people operate like everyone already knows things when they post.
---
No shame. I get very little time to play and I don‚Äôt want to mess with world PvP when I do. Just want to level and run some dungeons üëçüèª
---
I believe t2 helm is better than Lionheart for PvP.
---
"I dont have an actual logical point, so I'll just say my opponent must be an idiot!"
---
This is literally a base level logical fallacy, jesus christ kid.
---
Gz and thanks for sharing!
---
Plus it‚Äôs nice to have a reference in one spot.
---
Hmm, maybe it's caused by an addon.
---
BGs are crossrealm, but horde has more players across the board, they've also had a higher percentage of participants in PvP than alliance throughout retail and other private servers.
---
Well, If I wait the 30 sec on the mind control and didn‚Äôt use it, then decided rocket helm would be better in this scenario that‚Äôs when I think it would reset.
---
Watch out boy she'll chew you up, she's a man eater!
---
OK buddy. Luckily I don't give a fuck about your opinion.
---
What about trink swapping macros for PvP? Is that something I make? Or an addon I use? I have saved all my trinkets as I level, but never know when to swap them in the open world or how.
---
What about resists?
---
Its almost like you people never heard of resists
---
If you see a fury warrior on the opposite faction they are literally free honor. 
---
source: fury warrior too poor to respec between raids
---
It released only 2 months ago so yeah it's pretty active still
---
Apparently I was unaware of the 2007 online mmo.
---
Yeah you are right. Alliance controls all the areas that are non vital.
---
Strat,Scholo, BRD, all the instances are controlled by horde. Why the fuck would anyone care about those areas you listed. LOL
---
I mean if you are trying to actually rank in this game you won't be sitting at work. This might make it a bit more annoying you are going for a casual rank 10 or something but it will have literally no impact on br1-3. I'll be getting my 4 daily kills on you while you afk on your mobile getting 4k honor per hour enjoy man.
---
It‚Äôs 80/20 on that server.
---
&gt; give you an advantage over other people that dont use the app
---
This is true of ALL addons. I dont think directly citing a statement made by someone because it is has a wide-spread negative connotation beyond what they intend isn't "a bad argument".
---
I‚Äôm losing all my honour no matter the time
---
Ironforge.pro is going to give you the most accurate faction split stats you‚Äôre gonna find right now.  It has its faults, buts it‚Äôs likely to be fairly close if you assume that players of both factions are as likely to want to log their raids.  
---
Note the total number of players will not be accurate, but the faction split % should be close.
---
Anyway, this shows Benediction at 41/59 in favor of Horde, so your experience makes sense.
---
That‚Äôs true. As a tank who‚Äôs new to a lot of end game stuff I‚Äôm so paranoid about knowing my stuff. I always ask people in the group and they don‚Äôt know shit either ha. A lot of false confidence going around
---
I already had a ?? Gnome Mage do that.
---
I would agree about that. One button to just do everything is pointless. I'm glad they put a stop to that.
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily that it‚Äôs hard, it‚Äôs just a pain. Takes a long time to get there and it‚Äôs in the middle of a horde zone, dungeon always seems to take way too long and at least one party member will get lost. 
---
Much easier to just run ZF since at that level you are still in Tanaris anyway.
---
Resists dont work like they do vs mobs there is a small chance to resists but its not at all like a lvl 60 enemy. U just nova, polymorph, run to max range, spam frostbolt till they intercept u then blink the intercept, nova again b4 they hit u and keep kiting till they are dead. If they resist u can block/coldsnap nova again, block again, if u screw up just repolly them and start from the top
---
Gz, and yeah it is. I‚Äôm around 120-130 and have seen 3 general swords but not 1 HoJ. Some people say they‚Äôve done way more without it dropping.
---
I just keep out of channels that aren't the theorycrafting ones and it's mostly fine, at least now that Yarrick is gone.
---
Some of those arcane crystals were mine. Badassadin
---
Well depends. If bwl will be out by then, might be that a bubble around nature resist consumables is already forming. So then this would not only be inflation safe, but also profitable.
---
But I this fire resist consumables are the most stable till after aq40
---
Flying to Morgans Vigil right now just to check.
---
That‚Äôs some good...and bad luck there. If you try to farm it again def try to duo it if possible or get a guild group with people who don‚Äôt need it.
---
Sure if loot didn't matter, but realistically loot is so rare that people will still be using their mageblades/rings of spellpower/chokers of the firelord going into AQ40, so loot distribution in MC does matter.
---
I mean he plays horde like 90% of the time buddy
---
I‚Äôm the only warlock in my raid group . 1 of 5 that has ANY spell hit and do the most dps of them all.
---
Is that guy joking?
---
Goddammit, yes! Everything is a reason for complaining nowadays. What happened to improvise, adapt, overcome?
---
My only reason for crying is that I wanna play wow all day, but irl won't allow me to. But that's not an in game issue.
---
 If something pisses me off, I just swear a little bit and go on, it's not that big of a deal.
---
Oh that makes sense! I haven‚Äôt started running Dire Maul yet so this is really helpful. I‚Äôm catching up with all the late game terminology because I leveled a horde character to 45 and then rerolled Alliance and am at 56. Casual player so I feel behind on the PvP / raiding scene. But I just got some pre-raid bis gear this week which was exciting! :D
---
Yeah exactly what I said before; you are literally incapable of imaging playing without someone else telling you what to do before hand, a dogshit Vanilla player for sure.
---
Isnt that a pve realm
---
Lmao dude I have two 60s (warrior and warlock) on Stalagg. chill out. I am all-in on Stalagg Ally.
---
Your improv is way better than adding an accent.
---
Aw fuck, gotta replace my extra hotbars with... macros that do the same thing but look less pretty
---
That usually works, but still. BRd will be controlled by horde.
---
An unique identifier assigned to everything in WoW, player characters included. IIRC the earlier your character was created, the lower its GUID is.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/GUID
---
There is a cool WA to check it out, also there is a script to run, I can google it for you if necessary.
---
https://wago.io/bNaV070KQ
---
Can confirm. There are more bots than I ever remembered
---
I mean sure it was hyperbole but you can't possibly argue that mage doesn't have a big advantage over other classes in their ability to level quickly.
---
What is Glider?
---
Thanks ill check out some 19 twink items and make up my mind.
---
AQ is a good one too. 
---
Druids mitigate crushing blows with a high dodge and high armor.  You also need to stack the raid properly and limit certain specs, like fury warriors to avoid threat being pulled off.
---
Lower mitigation, more specialized set ups, no taunt, lower raid dps.
---
Shaman tanks are possible but you have to really work to make them viable.  And the lack of defensive cooldowns make it riskier when trying to progress.  Serious guilds aren't using shamans as MTs because you want your MT to be constant, not benched because one boss is immune.  Otherwise why bother having the shaman tank if you have a qualified prot warrior. 
---
The post you linked has zero reasons why you want to use a shaman tank, other than its possible.  The other three classes have clear focus.  Paladin for aoe, Druid for 3 mobs or high mitigation, warriors for high threat generation.
---
Shaman tanks mean you have to limit dps, limit flexibility in raids, and maximize buffs and consumables.  The juice is not worth the squeeze.  You can tank, grats.  A rogue can tank too.  So should we have him MT raids?  The idea is not that shamans suck or aren't capable.  It's specifically that they don't bring anything that pushes them over the other options.  Gear is poor, threat generation is poor, mitigation is decent but lacks cooldowns.
---
I'm curious as to why you're switching realms, I play horde on Razorgore and the server seems pretty balanced faction wise if a little skewed towards horde but Ally seem so much more organised, the horde guilds suck
---
Isn‚Äôt that more specific to Stalagg though? I keep reading that Stalagg has top class alliance pvpers, despite the massive number advantage.
---
Most pvp servers aren‚Äôt like that.
---
Are you playing alliance on Firemaw or just looking at some fake websites?
---
If it was 45/55 it would suggest control over high level zones, ports, brm, cities would switch from time to time, while in fact it's always horde camping flypaths and sitting at your corpse for hours.
---
I play as frost mage and if war pops stun/slow imnuty pot; i cant do much against him
---
Ice baby ice
---
This is probably a stupid question but I‚Äôm still a Classic noob. Can you fall behind in PvP? If I wasn‚Äôt 60 when the first week hit for honor, can I kiss all dreams of ranking up and getting gear goodbye? Or is it something that is ongoing and I can catch up with? Are there a finite amount of weeks to grind? I get to play evenings and weekends for the most part, and not much on holidays. I enjoy PvP and want to learn and become decent at it, but am not sure if I will forever be stuck at the first couple of ranks because I‚Äôm behind.
---
oh wow and I tought I have bad luck...
---
Something you'd better avoid to discuss due to Rule 4.
---
Heroic leap
---
When I use a FAP and have frost reflector and grenades, most any mage that doesn‚Äôt iceblock will be eating an axe.
---
Without those things though, level one frostbolt alone will kill me :(
---
That's some fake data made by folks that aren't playing alliance on this server.
---
It's super bad atm and people are quitting.
---
Its because they use spy as a crutch for there inability to PVP
---
Again, this is taking advantage of a hole in the system. I am 100% sure the game designers and developers did not intend for the combat log to be scanned in real-time in order to automate and boost essential tasks for player vs. player interaction (player finding, targeting and locating).
---
Queue from a capital, Hearthstone back to Kargath and then go back to SG/BRM. Easy.
---
Are human's considered Animals?
---
Level 48 on Stonespine-EU here. I was PvPing and doing dungeons at 4-5am server time yesterday and there was still people around. At more sensible times there are plenty of people
---
Died zero times until I got to brd.
---
I don't think you understand how the rank progression works. It doesn't matter whether you made 5k or 50k honor in a week, if everyone else has less than you do, you're going to rank 14 just as fast. And if everyone is losing honor from certain hours, the impact is negligible for most players
---
You forgot "You think you do but don't".
---
Can‚Äôt stand it
---
At what level should I start tanking ZF on my warrior?
---
I have only avoided to discuss something due to rules 1&amp;2. But OK, I officially drop the subject.
---
By that metric every add-on is cheating. They're all collecting information and presenting it to you in a more manageable way.
---
Epic mount will help with adventuring. Stupid stuff is this staff. You have it backwards.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve been some lucky rogues honor farm lol
---
Can anyone recommend popular shadow priests? I'm familiar with Ooze and Kala.
---
When I've rolled a new char on a new server and have literally nothing, begging at the AH/Bank for a few silvers usually works out for me, though people in WoW are generally insanely stingey. Better way was getting mining/herb/skinning and selling the gathered mats for 5-10 silver each as well as selling low level greens for like a gold each, people really do buy them especially on busy populated servers, you'll soon have a few gold and can grab max 12 slotters and a few cheap upgrades yourself.
---
Got mine on my 3rd run to anger. Then got savage chest on like the 20th arena run. Level 57 when I had them both üòè
---
I‚Äôve been tanking on a Druid in Classic since about day 2.
---
Leading a guild now that does 2 min Rag kills and I‚Äôm parsing legendary on at least 2-3 fights per Mc run these days. So I‚Äôm somewhat qualified to discuss the matter.
---
I‚Äôm essentially going to mirror what everyone else has said, with some additional anecdotal info.
---
Teldrassils BiS list seemed to be most optimal for me, as a tank, in those early weeks when I hit 60 in the first wave of 60s on my server. E.g. when everyone was under geared, pure mitigation was the best option.
---
That also held true on my earliest forays into MC. When I was tanking for a raid with mostly fresh 60s. So healers and dps just didn‚Äôt have the throughput that would require, or allow, for me to really gear for threat. 
---
That quickly changed as the average gear level on my server increased, and I found myself increasingly losing threat. 
---
Once that happened I started shifting away from pure mitigation, and started gearing into hit/crit. Generally when I do this I go for BiS style pieces, and at least try to target slots that do not have extraordinary mitigation in them already. E.g. you would take hit bracers over a hit trinket, since there aren‚Äôt any wrists that have extraordinary mitigation. While there are two trinkets that do.
---
So, basically, I‚Äôd say your best bet is to learn and understand the philosophy behind each list (which, honestly it seems like you do.) From there just learn to tune your gear per encounter, or instance, as needed. 
---
Bad healer? Use more mitigation. Insane dps? Lean towards threat gear. Both? Use a pummeler with full mitigation gear. Etc.
---
You‚Äôll learn how to tune it with experience. And ultimately I think that‚Äôs the answer. BiS gear for situation A isn‚Äôt BiS for situation B. So you have to triangulate and experiment.
---
You have had dozens of perfectly logical and we'll thought out arguments presented to you. You have chosen to ignore them all. The conclusion that you are incapable of reasoning is the correct conclusion. Therefore yes, judgement has been passed after you have shown the inability to think, and as such you have been labeled as an idiot.
---
I leveled without grinding anything and there wasn't a lot of quests left for me to complete aside from long obvious endgame chains+linken, however I have avoided STV (lol).
---
Not op but do you have any gear recommendations? Alot of the pre-raid BiS is cloth and with all the rogues about I imagine a full mail/plate build with shield is going to out perform. Any good guides or item lists for that?
---
I mean that's classic. Some people like the freedom, some people like being told what to do.
---
I literally didn‚Äôt say those words that you put in quotations. Strawmanning is cute. 
---
Suppose there was an add on that did something like kick only when an enemy is casting but you had to at least be pressing an attack or something so it‚Äôs not automation. And you say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair‚Äù and then I respond with ‚Äúgatekeeping is cute‚Äù. See how stupid I sound?? 
---
Having an opinion on what add on isn‚Äôt fair isn‚Äôt gatekeeping but your desperation is cute.
---
World PvP favors Horde obviously while premades favor Alliance. But why arent people mentioning that? Because BGs arent out..who cares if youre the dominant BG faction when BGs are months away (speaking from whencphase 2 first dropped) because the game is unplayable _now_.
---
Pretty sure this is herod pvp server, frens and reported are guild names I recognize
---
I wish warriors could use Thunderclap in Defensive Stance.
---
You sound like a scrub
---
Seems so. This sub likes to find any negative to complain about even if it doesnt exist yet.
---
That makes a lot more sense.
---
Some very general addons I'm using:
---
Leatrix+ has a bunch of convenience amd UI improvements which are very handy. E.g. faster autoloot, auto dismount when trying to cast, vendor prices in item tooltips and many more things I'm probably not even aware of.
---
Auctioneer is a basic AH addon that provides some neat things like AH price in item tooltips (just based on listings though) or item prices in the AH sorted by price per item, making it easier to identify the cheapest choices regardless of stack size.
---
Spy is a controversial PvP addon that lists enemies nearby based on their appearance in WoWs combatlog. It is kinda unfair, but at least was a bit nerfed recently, and I personally like that it keeps a "kill on sight" list that you can add people to who griefed you or pissed you off otherwise.
---
Neatplates improves enemy threatplates by adding debuffs and a cast-bar, if they cast something. Very handy for PvP.
---
OmniCC puts a number on cooldowns and durations of any kind so you can exactly see how many seconds something lasts.
---
I would just slowly pickup addons one at a time and see which ones you like. There are also a bunch of youtube videos on this topic.
---
Suddenly it all makes sense why mages Ice Block 1v10
---
It isnt really worth it to worry about sticking to a particular weapon until you get to 60.  Just use the best weapons you have regardless of what they are.
---
As long as he sends the pet before you stealth you're fucked.
---
Imagine thinking Payo, the guy that literally farmed gold/mats for 12 hours a day on stream during the beta and had the highest /played, bought gold.
---
He's been getting wrecked all over this thread it's kind of great, and he keeps going at it like he's the one same man.
---
leveling herb/alch is a lot easier than leveling tailoring or mining. Robe of the Void is BiS, but at this point it wouldn't be super hard to get something ALMOST as good
---
"I installed spy for kos and opponent tracking."
---
Isnt that the only reasons to use spy?
---
Right!
---
Steam link
---
Being "behind" is only really relevant if you were planning on being among the first to hit a certain rank. Ranking up is an ongoing thing.
---
A different matter is that you will have to step up your efficiency and play time the highesr you get. The top ranks are only available if you are able to no-life for at least a few weeks.

Sell

Having unit frames that present the real health of a mob isn't cheating. Seeing how much damage I do per second is not cheating.
---
Having the ability to be alerted who's nearby even if you can't see them excluding rogues and druids? Maybe they are hiding behind a mountain or in a building, but your addon alerts you and you don't have to pay attention or anything, you just know the opposition is nearby? That's cheating. Maybe it's hard to argue because the information is compiled in a manageable way, but it's cheating.
---
A fresh guild not geared yet will benefit, don‚Äôt be such an elitist ass.  It‚Äôs just a matter of deciding if it‚Äôs worth the mats
---
I never claimed to be intelligent. 
---
Thought this was lotr memes or something
---
If it's just one player... sheep. I don't think you can perma sheep like early vanilla but you can still effectively sheep someone way above your level.
---
&gt;You don't really need addons until 60
---
wut
---
This is true for all addons? Ah yes, my Shadowed Unit Frames addon gives me such a huge advantage over those who don't use it by... making my unit frames look nicer? 
---
Of course it's not true of all addons! And for those that it is true for you have to consider how much of an advantage it actually gives, especially in PvP. Spy gives too much of an advantage. I also personally think enemy cast bar addons are a bit OP considering you can't see them by default in classic.
---
I think you mean playing horde is hello kitty and playing Allience is dark souls difficulty. It's okay I understand you want an easier game. And I'm not just talking about PvP and racials here
---
UwU wats dis?
---
I really do think SpyClassic is towing the line between what should be allowed and what shouldn't.
---
It's not only interesting, if you're looking to be a decent warrior or rogue you NEED a swingtimer.
---
What's happening is that the Rogue is seeing the Warlock (and thus the Warlock sees him on Spy) and then tries to stealth to hide. But by the time he does that the Warlock has already targeted the Rogue and sent his pet after him.
---
Now it doesn't matter if the Rogue is stealthed or not. The pet will still hit him and pop him out apparently.
---
But go alliance tho. Making benedictino More popular Will make Horde reroll here and lose balance
---
&gt;You do you
---
DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO
---
One of the latest patches Blizzard did were to ensure mobs that are intended to be pulled together as a group, are, and that they don‚Äôt leash off until they are all ready to do so. So I assume that bug will be a non-issue on the Classic client.
---
I current play on a PVE RP realm but I‚Äôm thinking of rerolling on one of the rppvp realms. I know Grobbulous is really popular here but I‚Äôm wondering how deviate delight is? I like how DD has a slight ally bias as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to play. I‚Äôm just worried the low pop will hurt it I‚Äôm the long run. Anyone know how either of these are?
---
I can only guess, but I don't think they engage with the user interface or the picture much. They'll just use the raw data that's accessible in the client and maybe do some tricks to get more data (e.g. tab through nearby enemies).
---
Shaman single target threat is suprisingly decent.
---
1 max rank sunder in def stance with defiance is 374 points of threat.  
---
1 max rank earth shock is 1062 points of threat.
---
Frontloading one of those and autoswinging with rockbiter works out quite fine.
---
Issues is mana management and multi targets. There are tools to deal with those things, but it's a hassle. Did a bit of tanking on my shaman - works out better than expected, assuming the group is ok with actually hitting the skull first.
---
Obviously inferior to other tanks, but hey if you've been spamming LFG for 90 mins with no luck...
---
 Never heard of him so how would I know LUL
---
Alot of people saying "use it, being stronger is more fun" are missing that you can sell it, use some of the gold to improve your gear with cheap upgrades (Dreamweave Circlet/Vest/Gloves for example, just to name something) and save the rest towards your epic mount or something else that you'll actually feel making a difference when you play the game. 30 extra damage per frostbolt and 5 extra damage on your AoE abilities won't be nearly as noticable as having to spend several hours farming all the gold you could've made just selling the item.
---
Consider this: at 60 with farming talents you can make about 60g/hr. Even if you undercut the other sellers immensely, let's say you sell for 180-240g, that's still 3-4 hours you'll spend actively gold farming at 60.
---
TL;DR: Sell for 200-300G, buy some cheaper blue/green gear for 20-40g, have same fun and more gold.
---
Poly?
---
Both games are good, I personally love dungeons and the different levels of them on retail. But classic has good qualities like class design that feel more alive :)
---
56/7 go LBRS
---
Good for you, you got lucky. But most servers are 60/40 at best, with many being much worse. There are about 10 servers out of 38 that are actually well-balanced.
---
I hope you are more reasonable than him: which fights in question do you mean? I have pointed it out for most fights warrior can sit on its target for all the duration. I am willing to review any example how any current fight is favored for ranged so much a good warrior loses to good mage in a good guild. Please? If anything IS in a mages favor, it's fights with a lot of targets where it's possible to AE spam like Sulfuron or Majordomo. It has nothing to do with being ranged though.
---
The range was nerfed to 50yds, but you can still target people without seeing them. The main issue is the targeting, and it's not resolved. Dude you have hundreds of people telling you you're wrong throughout this whole thread, and you just keep burying your head more and more.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that someone submitting a form based on their experience isn‚Äôt an anecdotal account?
---
e.g. Someone guesses it took them 60 kills before an item dropped, but wasn‚Äôt using an add on to track kills.
---
I built a form to address the latter half of your point, though someone leaving a reddit comment is still the same thing as someone submitting a item confirmation on a 3rd party site.
---
EU has 3 good that I know off Ashbringer, razorgore and ZT all have healthy populations and are all close to 50/50
---
I‚Äôve run BRD easily 100 times including short arena anger spam and I‚Äôve never seen it. I don‚Äôt want it but commonly try to help guildees. Maybe I‚Äôm the bad luck charm :)
---
Not everyone is wants to be social and the game is still fun by yourself.
---
Yeah because everyone that plays classic wow uses reddit. ./s
---
It's a pretty good upgrade for now and I think it'd outdamage those swords even with sword spec. However, I'd recommend going to Maraudon - there's a quest for the [Thrash Blade] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade) which you can get as early as 45 (with friends/guildies). 
---
I wouldn't bother respeccing or anything for that mace but it's fine in the meantime.
---
You understand at the moment of this statement servers had for up to 5 layers each roughly equal to 1 high pop vanilla server (3000 or so), right? Of course it was around 15000 players per server, spreaded out to 5 layers. Now it's only 1 layer per each server, and while its capacity was enlarged to (6k per my estimation), most (full) servers still have around 4-5k concurrent online with several exceptions of 5.5-6k.
---
I mean the reality is, whether you want to join us or not, that it isn't cheating and hence why it's allowed and users aren't being banned for using it.
---
I won't argue that it sucks and has made world PvP shit however.
---
It's not fun for one class to be able to do double to 5x the damage of some other classes while also being the best tank class in the game, yet here we are.
---
If it is almost about to fire you let it finish.
---
If you level engineering (and leveled it fast) you could get a green lens at lvl45, which is pre-bis (the +36shadowdmg one)
---
Hehe sorry was the opposite, now edited
---
Wpvp is dumb anyway, in a couple weeks everyone has bg‚Äôs and the only real world pvp will be for world bosses
---
here are explanations for some of the sub-parts of dungeons that people start using near 60
---
**Maraudon (Mara)**
---
 * Orange &amp; Purple run = The first half of the dungeon. People usually only do this run once so that they can complete the quest for the Scepter of Celebras.
---
 * Inner / Princess run = The second half of the dungeon which you can teleport the group to through the previously mentioned Scepter. This kind of run skips the first half and only goes for the last few bosses (notably the final boss Princess Theradas) as they have some good loot. 
---
**Stratholme (Strat)**
---
 * UD/Undead = The eastern part of the dungeon controlled by the undead/lich forces.
---
 * Live/Living = The western part of the dungeon controlled by the Scarlet Crusade. 
---
**Dire Maul (DM:)**
---
 * East = The eastern wing controlled by demons &amp; plant-life
---
 * West = The western wing controlled by elves &amp; ghosts
---
 * North = The northern wing controlled by ogres
---
 * Tribute = Same as the northern wing but you only kill the final boss King Gordok so that the remaining living ogre bosses grant you "tribute" by giving you extra loot / buffs. 
---
**Lower Blackrock Spire (LBRS)**
---
 * 3-boss farm = Where you constantly kill only the first 3 bosses of the dungeon which are Highlord Omokk - War Master Voone and Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin over and over again for their specific loot
---
**Upper Blackrock Spire (UBRS)**
---
* Jed/Rend run = Where you only farm the first half of the dungeon which notably have Warchief Rend Blackhand and the additional rare elite Jed Runewatcher
---
**Blackrock Depths (BRD)** - This is the largest dungeon in the game and takes over 3 hours to clear if you decide to do everything in the dungeon (4-5 hours if you wipe a few times) so naturally this is the most split dungeon with a ton of different variants. 
---
 * Prison Cell / Jailbreak = The first part of the dungeon with a ton of trash mobs and few bosses. Most people do this part for only for quests. 
---
* Arena/Anger/Golem farm = Where you only farm the first 3 bosses of the dungeon (Arena Event - General Angerforge - Golem Lord Argelmach) 
---
* Vault = Where you go to the vault for quests &amp; some notable bosses including Fineous Darkvire - Watchman Doomgrip - Lord Incendius &amp; Warder Stilgiss. 
---
* Bar = Where you clear to the dark iron bar tavern in the central part of BRD which includes quests &amp; some bosses like Hurley Blackbreath - Ribbly Screwspigot &amp; Phalanx.
---
* Seven Dwarves / 7D = The part after the Bar where you fight against seven dwarven spirits. 
---
* Emperor / Emp = The final boss of the dungeon. 
---
* Lava Run = A run where you jump through lava to skip the majority of the dungeon just to the final boss.
---
Before someone rudely answers ‚Äúno changes, either re roll or shut it‚Äù yes they have but no indication on when. I myself am hoping soon because i have a 60 on a pvp server but re rolled to a pve server as i should have in the beginning. Hope this helps.
---
oh nice ty
---
Or your log only records actions if you're in combat with the target. Easy change as the log can still exist but simply doesn't display until the conditions are correct.
---
Dude people had no idea stalagg would be so bad. We left Herod because it was gonna be a shit show and we re rolled on a server that was super imbalanced. How could people have known. I xfered to arcanite reaper now, where horde are outnumbered it‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm not crying everyday and we are getting farmed in org lots of the timeb
---
Now it's very obvious you don't even PVP
---
@OP if you get spell hit from talents, then yes - replace banthok with MIC.
---
Just transferred from Grobbulus, grobb is a fantastic server but it's unplayable and the alliance are lazy in terms of PvP. Dd has been great to me longest it's taken to get a group so far is like 10 minutes.
---
funny how the population isnt split 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/BpMseFG
---
turns our allies are the crybabies who want an easier game
---
Sell it and buy different, cheaper upgrades to your most-needed gear
---
And good thing there's a potion that makes you immune to all of that
---
I wonder why that is
---
I feel personally attacked rn
---
No.
---
This is simply not correct - please stream yourself killing level 60 warriors on a level 40 mage so we can see you do it.
---
Purble
---
In Blizzard's defense, Warlocks have all kinds of trouble with Rogues and need this to become even remotely competitive...
---
/s
---
No character transfers as of yet.. but chances are you can find or even found a guild that has an earlier raid time.
---
Once you get to 60 and get some pre BIS, just find a raid guild that raids once a week. That‚Äôs all you need to clear the current content. That may go up to two nights once BWL comes out, but that won‚Äôt be for awhile. By then, hopefully you are rocking atleast half tier 1, at which point, that + a few solid pvp blues will make you competitive in BGs. 
---
Keep in mind - the skill level of classic is way way lower. There are no arenas. Pvp ‚Äúranking‚Äù has nothing to do with skill at all - it‚Äôs just a time sink. Sure, you will meet plenty of skilled players coming from retail who have played high level arena over the years, but I would say 90% of the people you‚Äôll find in BGs (even premades) are PVE tryhards who are currently spending their days jizzing all over themselves 10v1ing the opposite faction and thinking that‚Äôs skill. 
---
If you‚Äôre at all talented in pvp, an average amount of gear will see you thru against the majority of classic opponents.
---
Except a lot of other classes roll on hunter gear
---
Omg.. dotbot.. everytime i go to dm he kills me a few times
---
43 or 44
---
Ill look into it, thank you!
---
So macros are cheating?
---
Not at all
---
What is this couple counseling?
---
Definitely not. Especially since you have crusader on it. Grab the mace from princess in Mara.
---
Retail is garbage.  And why would you get shadowlands and bfa?  When shadowlands comes out it's going to include bfa.  Seems like a waste of 50 dollars.
---
Hey man, benediction alliance here. Even if it is 60/40, I've noticed the alliance here with a different philosophy towards pvp then other alliance servers. The overall attitude of our guys seems to be much more aggressive and organized. Certainly times  where you get camped or  BRM is a nightmare, but as long as  it isn't all the time, then that's world pvp. I've had a blast with pvp on this server.
---
It's almost as if I'm not spinning my camera 360 all the time while fighting mobs.
---
Them &lt;Enigma&gt; boys ain't got much else to do during the week, since their guild one night clears MC/Ony. PvP is about the only thing you can do, besides farm gold, to fill the void.
---
Rogue vs Mage is actually one of the most equal matchups.
---
At R3 youll decay very little, id wager if you got 0 honor youll probably still be about 40% into R3 next week. It starts getting a lot worse after R6
---
Bruh it's harder to get that many 48 than it is one 60
---
Out of all the arguments that gets thrown around often in reddit and other medias, the sort of "this isn't true vanilla" is the one I hated the most. No one gives a shit about your "true classic" experience, literally, no one. This isn't 2006, I hated a lot of things about vanilla WoW, despite how much I loved the game back then, and I'm totally glad that a lot of the things are being improved with the current Classic WoW despite people like you talking a bunch of bullshit complaining about the "real" experience and actually have zero idea of what made the original WoW great.
---
&gt;when classic players are paying $15 a month for ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
---
? Explain this, I was under the impression they were paying 15 dollars a month for classic.
---
World PvP is fun when it's an even fight.
---
Often times, it's just squads of ganking groups picking off players and that's boring
---
Hunter pets will do it too. Only choice if you don't want to be seen is vanish. The pets are basically just like mobs.
---
You mean you weren't informed of that? Well, okay, happy to help.

How do you get the buffs from a dm:n tribute run?

The average person is stupid af, i‚Äôll leave it at that!

i got 22x 120s myself on retail but it really aint over till it over, one way or another ill ding 60 on them. i got 2.2k gold so i can pay for some boosts if i dont find anything else.

Nope, high-full every time I've seen it.
---
I have a buddy trying to get into his guilds Raiding team.  He‚Äôs about half pre-raid BIS now and getting better.  The other day he was on his alt and got a whisper from an officer that said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm assuming since you‚Äôre playing your alt you‚Äôre head to toe pre-raid BIS on your main don‚Äôt need to work on him anymore?  Also got all your needed consumables for the next raid?‚Äù
---
Benediction 4ever
---
&gt;I‚Äôll personally pay you per kill on him.
---
That's a pretty toxic attitude, my guy
---
Maybe you're dogshit at the game and 2g is actually a lot for you, but for people who aren't braindead that's pretty much nothing, i make 2g passive pre-40 every 30 minutes without even focusing on profit at all.
---
Like i don't know what you could possibly be doing to actually be poor enough to say 2g is anything, are you using the keyboard with your tongue when you play the game?
---
BiS 39 twink item for a bunch of classes, including warriors
---
You really don't think your PvP capability would be downgraded if you had to keep an eye on the combat log all the time and then type in a player's name (correctly) in order to target them?
---
Or maybe content being released doesn't affect you in any way, so why not release it for the people who want it (since it's not just a few people at that level, it's a significant number)? I say this as someone who isn't level 60 yet.
---
I'm a 60 HotW/NS spec druid. Been trying to gather my prebis gear for both tanking and healing since level 56 or so.
---
What's the best way to get items for both sets? It's way easier to make groups as a tank, but then I can't roll on healer prebis items unless I ask and its OK with the healer. 
---
I'll be primarily healing when raiding so I'm more focused on getting my healing gear. 
---
Should I still tank and announce beforehand I'll be rolling on healing gear? Or should I tank and put an item I need on reserve? Or should I just heal dungeons despite it being harder to make groups? 
---
It's tough being a hybrid and needing to roll on both tank and healing gear, so I'm looking for advice on the best way to do this while still being fair to the other players in my groups.
---
If that frost mage has those things too, you only waste resources to delay the inevitable.
---
How is Razorgore EU? Good realm? Faction balance?
---
Bgs came two months after honor was added.They gonna release them now with under a month...
---
Can't reflect nova tho :(
---
Its amazing how the pro spy crowd hasnt come up with a new argument in 3 months. "Its the same as the combat log" and "it will break every other addon" spouts out of their cheating mouths like vomit. Its all bull and we know it.
---
For the cheap enchants, definitely. For expensive ones like healing to weapon, probably not.
---
I think most PVP servers suck for solo players, even if they are plalying in the dominant faction. Nothing you can do with constantly moving 5 men gank squads, unless you literally have 90%+ horde on the realm. According to warcraftlogs golemagg have quite a few hardcore pve guilds. I guess they like to honor farm as well.
---
which class should i exclude if I want ALL OF THE ORBS? \* We wants it, we needs it. Must have the precious. \*
---
Theramore Guard - Grobbulus represent!
---
Such a great game.
---
I have never seen Top Gun either.
---
Actually time flies, been out over 3 months!
---
Don't shadowbolt. Send VW in first and let him hit a couple times. Make sure Torment is on auto cast. Dot and wand til you eventually do pull aggro then Drain Life
---
Saame bro. I also carry a knife with me to the club. Cause you know, defensive measure...
---
Anyone have A dummies guide to the tsm add-on? I'm doing well with 50+ gold at 29 but need to get more automated
---
Castbar mods are essentially cheating too.
---
That‚Äôs some stupidly hardcore raiding for such an easy and casual version of the game.
---
Frost reflector is the only item there that makes any difference to the engagement. If they eat a reflected Frostbolt they will have to block or FAP.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH SO GODDAMN STUPID
---
There aren't many big deal enchants for Priests yet. You should funnel gold first into getting an epic mount, and second into getting Truefaith Vestments (you will quite likely be wearing these into AQ40, depending on your luck with Tier 2 gear from BWL).
---
Big deal enchants for Priests:
---
Minor Speed on Boots - the best enchant in the game, a flat 8% increase to your run speed, less than 5g material cost. You should put this on every pair of boots you use.
---
+55 healing on weapon - you should get this on Benediction (every raiding Priest will get an Eye eventually), do not waste gold putting a 200g enchant on your preraid staff.
---
Smaller deal enchants:
---
Intellect on Bracers +7 int for around 5g material cost
---
Spirit on Bracers +9 spirit for around 10g material cost
---
Mana on Chest, +100 mana for around 16g
---
Stats on Chest, +3 all stats for around 12g
---
Greater Stats on Chest, +4 stats for around 65g
---
You can't do anything as a lock against rogues/warriors without grenades and trinkets.
---
Where is that from?
---
I'm lvl 50 and a lvl 60 came out of a bush to kill me, hopefully I had my gobelin rocket helmet and stuned him, 5 minutes later the same guy found me with his 4 others lvl 60 buddies.
---
I get this streamer
---
you're an idiot
---
Limiting range had bad downsides to all other addons too which isn‚Äôt fair for them. Stuff like damage meters, threat meters and others can‚Äôt track anyone over the 50yd limit. Fights like Rag, you can‚Äôt track half the raid because of the nerf. Just because of one PvP addon.
---
Are you an alliance guild?
---
No shit
---
It isn't the same problem. The new honor problem started wednesday afternoon it reset mid day and hasn't reset since.
---
 [https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters)
---
Get the Viking helmet from uldaman.  It‚Äôs a plate version of goblin rocket helm.  Critical for taking a healer out amid a fight.
---
And this here my friends is an example of why I support abortion and why you should too. Here we have an example of someone complaining about heartseeker ally, a heartseeker ally responding that it goes both ways, and an absolute poster child for extra chromosomes with very clearly limited comprehension of anything that isn't "chickn nugit" attempting to add his two cents to an already dead post by misconstruing the conversation that actually took place.
---
You mean you've never noticed getting killed and camped by your own faction? That's crazy
---
The problem with it is it will make pvp realms even more horde dominated. It is good for someone who transfers but not for everyone left behind. On big realms there are usually transfer for smaller pop realms, maybe you can try that and hope there are less players ganking there.
---
At this point being able to use roots indoors will suffice
---
The fact that it‚Äôs so rare right now is what makes items with +spell hit so valuable atm. T1 Chest shares BiS status with Robes of Volatile Power for that reason.
---
Pretty sure it will happen. They‚Äôll need more monetization other than subs.
---
If that was the case it would say we are increasing the number of layers. It does not say that. It says we are increasing the number if players that can be online, you want it to say layers but it doesn't.
---
I'd have to disagree.
---
1% spell hit, as in 1% chance to hit with spells.
---
The most that's going to add to damage is about 1%.
---
Whereas volatile power adds way more than that via spell damage and crit
---
You‚Äôre making assumptions. Raiding requires commitment. Bg queueing does not
---
They can leave, and it was their choice to join.
---
2-5 aren't using star they're using the UD Strath shadow damage neck or choker. 
---
You have no idea how many chokers have dropped for number 1. He has mageblade so maybe he didn't have dkp for choker when it dropped. Or maybe it's officer loot and someone else was awarded it.
---
Hmm... because banthok and star are prebis. Who knew? MiC should be mage prio so they pass since T2 belt is better. And those top 5 that you're saying, not a single one is wearing T1 chest. Out of those five, they either have choker, mageblade, toep, or rovp blowing either their prio spot or dkp. Hmm... but you rest your case.
---
Saw it, refuted it. But hey if you wanna pass on Choker in favor of Star I'm sure your other casters will be stoked.
---
This is what I said for my last exam! Brought in my phone and books, they said it was cheating though! But I just said reading is cheating? Jesus Christ.
---
Someone gave me some 10 slot bags on my level 10 when I was asking to buy bags. I was expecting get some 6 slotters and be very happy but was instead surprised. 
---
Point being, some people greatly appreciate kind gestures like that. Sorry no one was as thrilled as I would have been.
---
Tis true, even tho the meta has changed considerably
---
I tanked and asked to roll on healing items. Take note that you can get most of the items from DM and it‚Äôs a quick dungeon
---
wow thank you, this is exactly the info I was looking for! Ill get in touch with my guild's enchanter this weekend
---
I think people (me included) didnt realize the server populations are like 3 or 4 times as big. So easy to get killed in a 1 v 4 when theres 5k people on a map made for 2k
---
Bull crap!  I have rouges hitting me for 1/2 my HP in 1 hit.  I have the best gear you can get pre-raid, and 2 pieces of raid gear.  A lot of good that does when Rouges are hitting me for 1500-2000 hp in 1 hit.  
---
Skill my ass!
---
&gt; Remake pre-NGE SWG
---
I don't think people these days would like it, It has no real aim or objective, no real clear-cut set goal on anything.
---
...On that note, Yes. Give. TKM here i come~
---
Good to know! Thank you! How much honor are we talking to rank up each level? Is it all relative to other players? Is there an average rank goal for a casual player?
---
Devastate would be a hell of a lot better than Victory Rush. 
---
No cooldown, rage-free damaging Sunder stacker that can reset Shield Slam?  Yes fucking *please*.
---
Fuck, I love this game
---
Are you all living under a rock?
---
The add-on barely functions after the nerf. It doesn't even detect people who are standing right in front of you.
---
Mages benefit from it more, so yes I will pass on it. If it drops and I‚Äôm the only one without then cool. Ever heard if teamwork?
---
No, you can‚Äôt target stealthed opponents with the add on but you do get a notification there is a stealthed opponent nearby.
---
3 x 3 = 9, rounded up is 10.  Math checks out because all I see are 10 man raid groups ganking .
---
Sure TBC will likely be during the Shadowlands mid expansion slump
---
That's why they nerfed it, it's practically useless now.
---
Seriously? Ok.
---
If that was the case it would say we are increasing the size of layers. It does not say that. It says we are increasing the number if players that can be online, you want it to say size of layers but it doesn't.
---
What does it do now?
---
Perception is absolute garbage lol
---
They already nerfed it, I'm guessing nobody on this thread used the add-on otherwise they'd know it doesn't even work anymore.
---
I would recommend:  
---
Bagnon for inventory management  
---
Questie - (optional) to find this pesky quests that hide behind corners  
---
LeatrixPlus for numerous small improvement  
---
Auctionator to understand item costs, and decide what to sell on AH and what to vendor  
---
OmniCC for cooldowns  
---
ItemRack - to create item sets (healing / tanking / cat) and switch between them  
---
And as you are tank - TidyPlates_ThreatPlates, to see your aggro on mobs. Very helpful for tanking.
---
AtlasLootClassic and Atlas_ClassicWoW - to see maps of dungeons and check what drop from bosses. Also allow you to inspect people and show from what boss that item drops.  
---
SexyMap - my favorite. Just load SquareMap preset, to get rid of all this fancy runes and effects.  
---
P.S. For raid healing you need either Healbot, Vuhdu or Shadow Unit Frames with mouse-over macros.
---
If you can't find anything else, black lotus will always be a safe bet.
---
Yep, and thats why Blizz should gut more addons.
---
DBM, the auctioneering addons, the spell-casting addons (not a feature in vanila), addons that show buffs etc.
---
This is INCREDIBLY helpful. Thank you SO MUCH.
---
At least in WoD when I was playing, the stupid game felt like a job. Every time I had to go to my mine and mine out some nodes and do some roleplay stuff with the village so I could get some easy loot which I had to do because everyone else was doing it and if I didn't do it I would be lacking behind... After idk how long of playing, I was FINALLY able to go to the open world and actually play the darn game.
---
Cringy.
---
Yeah this thread is bizarre, the add-on is basically useless now and people are still saying things like "Spy is cheating".
---
Pics of me afk in IF sitting safely in a crowd while my pet runs down a rogue with 4-5 other alliance, the rogue dies and I get honor? Okay, prob tonight.
---
Greedy fucking warlocks over here my goodness. 
---
Mages don‚Äôt need spell hit, warlocks do.
---
Ha. Agree to disagree then.
---
We can both agree that this is garbage and these are all virtual servers which means they can control size any time they want and can add resources whenever they want. Or easily implement faction based queues.
---
Unless you got a good set up you can usually wipe them out by just taking out the leader
---
Do you really get 3% extra hit chance for guns/bows if you're dwarf/troll? Seems a lot.
---
meh i can see myself hitting rank 11 if i queue at work and play a ton at home and on weekends. lots of peple on my server are getting burnt out.
---
They need to remove spy in a bad way.
---
Whoever made the character first gets to keep it I guess?
---
&gt;You'd end up killing Details, BigWigs etc. if you tried to break Spy.
---
That would be a good thing.
---
Alliance complaining? Nah, couldn't be
---
Got them finals to prepare for
---
Victory Rush heals and that is the single biggest gap in the warrior toolkit. Victory Rush is one of the best quality of life changes ever made to warriors. 
---
Of course, opinions may vary, but this is mine.
---
If you guys run 0% spell hit, that‚Äôs a big oof.
---
nicely done, truly a work of art!
---
That‚Äôs a terrible idea lol
---
If servers were capped at 2k players then reddit would be filled with complaint posts about not being able to find people to raid with and the world feeling empty and dead and bitching about the auction house sucking so 2k people or 5k people it don't matter cause complaining will happen.
---
Bitchibg and moaning is what we do best here on reddit!
---
Imagine what you are going through  and multiply it 10x for the alliance. I play alliance on Kirtonos so I know. I also play a Holy Paladin wearing PreBiS cloth so I have no chance of killing anyone, even if it is 1v1.
---
Do you know that your faction was camping most majors flight paths today (and last night)? I landed in Morgan‚Äôs Vigil and was instantly killed. I landed in LHC and was killed 3 times before I could get back on the flight path (by 8 horde, no less).
---
I tried to get on a boat in menethil last night. There were horde so I retreated to the inn. I was the skull fucked by 2 rogues. Our level 40 guards did nothing to them.
---
All of this was within the last 12 hours.
---
Feels so good to be part of the grob mob finally.
---
Thanks. So do you feel DD is ally heavy? I really don‚Äôt want to be on a horde dominated faction but don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm not planning on running gank squads
---
hahahahahahahhahahahahha
---
Spy is still too overpowered. It 10,000% needs to be banned/removed
---
Yeah, they should leave. Classic raiding is easy. You don‚Äôt need to force your raid to be optimized and suck the fun out of the game.
---
Intimidating shout is your friend
---
Yep, the addon is fair, but I would still compare it with wallhack in a PvP environment.
---
But as far as I am concerned, addons like DBM, castbars, the addons that show buffs are all "cheating".
---
I feel a bit bad for him. He's probably gonna get called out for that by other players all the time.
---
Why library? Is it better gold than cathedral?
---
There are only about 3500 horde ranking according to Honor Spy, but I guess that could be way off. I'd guess alliance is even smaller. That would imply there were 13000+ players on Herod that didn't PVP enough to get into the ranking (eg 15 kills for example). That doesn't seem right, but maybe I'm missing something.
---
Feels good man.
---
There's no "image recognition" bots. It would require for each bot to run on Google Alpha servers )))  
---
They use API calls.  
---
getBodyCoordinates() - and they know where to run.  
---
getNearestMonster() will give you coordinates and target it.  
---
It's the same way as all addons working right now. And for example this is why bots could not catch a fish. There's no clickBobber() function.
---

Stop deleting characters.  Eventually you'll make it with one of them when you hit the char limit for the server. 
---
 Seriously though just pick one and the rest make profession junkies, have 8 tailor/alchs for the cd's and your warrior tank will be rolling in 18 slot bags and plenty of arcanite for them gears.  I would suggest getting a mage/lock/hunter leveled with the warrior to be your farmer.
---
Agree. Some corpse runs are just too long. Problem of course is you have rez time too but at least you can afk
---
Depends, if they open on you and they are geared it can be hard to get the poly off
---
Role an alliance player on an unbalanced server and show them how to do it.
---
Ark: Survival Evolved. Can‚Äôt say that I remember bots being much of an issue in that game.
---
Those goals will be highly personal, and depends on your class and interests in the game.
---
Ranking up happens in a system that is relative to what other players are doing. I suggest you find a guide on the honor system (pre-TBC / pre 2.0), rather than me explaining parts of it.
---
God damn
---
Ah right, darn bloodvine
---
Probably.
---
yeah like cmon its 2019..
---
I can guarantee you never played vanilla. You sound like a private server kid.
---
BGs release in 10 days and all towns will be empty after that.  problem solved
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right, I should have said 380
---
First learn to look at flair seeding learn to read the post im mocking
---
Literally been jumped the second I got a port to IF. Rogue just sitting in there waiting for people, guards nowhere to be seen.
---
Motherfuckin noob noob.
---
¬´Need¬ª is a very strong word
---
And then you get children who attack enemy‚Äôs and then run into town to get protected.
---
Exactly. This made all the difference for level 10 me, but didn't cost them much of anything. I plan on passing it on when I get leveled.
---
It goes against the spirit of the game. It's anti-immersion as we don't have to be tuned into our surroundings now until we get a ping. I don't think it's cheating, but it's absolutely gamebreaking.
---
Because on retail you play the patch, while in Vanilla all content will always be viable.
---
People will still clear MC when nax is out, while on retail the next patch everyone just gets pushed ahead with comeback gear, and there is nothing valuable left behind in the older raids (no consumables, no valuable resources, no patterns for professions, no legendaries).Just complete dogshit.
---
So if you don't clear the content in that patch, you probably won't play it at all besides in LFR I guess, which is not really playing the game either.
---
Darkshore is where I went if I remeber right
---
Thanks if you haven‚Äôt noticed it‚Äôs a copy pasta of that with slight changes.
---
Correct! Nicest people ever. I should have rolled Grob earlier!
---
I‚Äôve loved the server since I started, I think I‚Äôll be staying
---
Already know what you gonna roll this time? And do you have a name for your char?
---
Literally any addon is cheating then xD
---
I suppose, i try to be generous when i can, i remember way back in original classic i missed the launch by a fair bit of time, when i eventually got around to playing it blew my mind, i was derping about on my level 5 warrior in goldshire mining copper and all of a sudden a full valor, arcanite reaper warrior on an epic mount showed up, he was mining too, we got talking and he asked if i was new and how long i was playing for, he told me to wait a bit and he rode off
---
Little while later he said come to the blacksmith, he made me a full set of copper armor and weapons and gave me a snowshoe rabbit crate as well as bags, my mind was blown, i didnt even know pets and bags were a thing, i wanted to pay him and he said just do the same for somebody and that's it he rode off into the sunset.
---
And now 15 years later I've still got the armor, bags and crate in my bank as I'm a sentimental son of a bitch, I've done similar a few times over the years but it seems as time had gone on there's been less and less new players just alts, helping a random new player is also how i met my best friend, so i guess it all worked out in the end.
---
This!
---
It's literally doing what addons in retail do. The same game people complain about because of how easy and unfun it is. This addon makes PvP, wait for it... Easy and unfun.
---
4v1 isnt good enough for me. I prefer 10v1.
---
You also dont need all pre-bis, just some. Then join MC and get all the drops as usually there are few druids and all are 8/8 already :)
---
the only reason there are 200 single stacks of items on the AH is because of AH addons being used to upload auctions.  this is so fucking annoying to me.
---
Windfury and Grounding totem would like to have a word.
---
Buhuuu poor mages... they r helpless victims so unfair
---
This is the way.
---
Not sure of how many Anger kills I‚Äôve had, maybe like 35-40. I have seen HOJ drop 5 times and have lost the roll on everyone one. Had it drop 2 times in 4 runs with a pug.
---
Yeah can confirm, in over 300 runs I have never gotten resisted LOSing Gordok but there is a chance to be resisted when in direct sight and he is close by. Anecdotal or not, for any hunters looking to farm DMT LOS Gordok at a safe distance when you feign and your runs will go much smoother.
---
its still 60:40 and on my server its the opposite for me and I have no problem.
---
You can't instantly create /t macros for every enemy player that appears within 50yds? Get Gud scrub /s
---
I had to install just to quest on my rogue and not get jumped by 60s every minute.
---
now start of by exluding the bankalts by exluding level ones, then move it to around lvl 30 to 60 and u get a different number.
---
It still works at a larger range than any attacks in the game, and still lets you pet attack stealthed targets instantly.  It's completely broken.
---
Email the print screen copy and paste? Use paint if you need to. Pro Tip...
---
Then why wouldn‚Äôt it apply to like every other buff?
---
‚ÄúA full group of high levels will do poorly if they don‚Äôt do a good job‚Äù
---
Fucking lol ...too accurate.
---
Email? You literally just copy and paste it.
---
You can use a playerframe move macro to tweak the co-ordinates of your unitframes. Once you log out, it will save said co-ordinates under WTF/Account/[Account ID]/[Realm name]/[Character name]/layout-local.txt. You can further tweak these co-ordinates in said file whilst the game is open. Just save the file and do /reload for the changes to take effect.
---
If I got off my computer i wouldn't of been able to take the picture haha still on wow and on reddit AT THE SAME TIME!..... I know seems pretty crazy man
---
Nice. Keep us updated on the senpai squad! Remember when you were like 30 and was curious about the progression.
---
Let me get off my computer so I can pick up my smaller computer to take a picture of my big computer that i was originally on.
---
This is not true, you can just as well play aggresive. Current WSG "meta" revovles around an aggresive rogue helping flag carry pick, and then bursts the enemy flag carrier when he attempts to cross mid. It does not have you sitting in flag room all day, and I don't know who the fuck uses rogues for anchor that's wasted potential.
---
He‚Äôs on my server Kurinaxx, I‚Äôll update you when I get home. 
---
Did some dungeons with him and he was a cool dude. I hope he made it to 60.
---
Multiboxing is allowed not because Blizz likes money, it's allowed because as long as you allow players to have multiple accounts you can't police whether they use the accounts at the same time or not.
---
Imagine someone has 3 accounts on their CC recurring. One for themself, one for their child, and one for their wife. Logically, those players want to play at the same time.
---
You can't allow this to happen but not *also* allow the same person to use them all themselves at the same time.
---
It's a moderately gray area that would require very specific policing to investigate and stop. Thus, you're allowed to use multiple at once.
---
Don't feel bad man, I thought the same. I thought it was jabbing at LOTRO or something.
---
yes even if you don't see them
---
Is it?  You can clear dungeons with ease without consumes.  You'd rather end up with a shortage come bwl and beyond because you used them for dungeons?
---
48 to 52 horde camping 1 alliance yes
---
You or your party/raid members.  But yeah I agree.  The 50 yard fix was better but not nearly enough.
---
??? If I‚Äôm playing WoW. And I pick up my phone. I am no longer playing WoW. I am now on my phone. 
---
You do seem like the kind of person that would play WoW on his computer and pick up his phone to browse reddit. But you think that‚Äôs normal. 
---
Meanwhile everyone else here is saying the exact same thing.
---
Its almost like kids these days find PCs inferior to their iPhones. Lmao.

Ahh Ye, the response of a person with extreme iq. I cower in your presence!

I thought that's what 2 screens were for

Mmo please.
---
This is a trend amongst most if not all PvP realms. Why do Horde outnumber Alliance on PvP realms while the opposite is true on PvE realms? My guess is, Alliance players typically tend to care more about RP, lore, and aesthetics while dedicated PvPers choose Horde because they have objectively better racials. Thoughts?
---
What do you mean by parry speeds up attack?
---
The button on your keyboard that takes a screenshot
---
Raid Teams don't benefit from people who don't know how to itemize their character.
---
It‚Äôs just their attention span. OP is the type of zoomer to get on his phone to browse reddit while also on the computer. Doesn‚Äôt know how to print screen or alt tab.
---
The sad thing is that now they have to keep doing it since their honor didn't count. I doubt everyone doing that is seriously having rank 14 as their goal, so if the honor actually counted, they had maybe reached their goal already.
---
IMO its pretty lame if you run that add-on...
---
Use iMorph, noone has gotten banned for it since 2008, and those who got banned was immediately unbanned after investigation. Blizzard doesn't care about morphing, they simply say that it isn't allowed because they wouldn't want people to start morphing black lotus into Onyxia..
---
What seems more likely: alliance players are quitting in mass numbers, or alliance players haven't been uploading census addon data as much as horde lately?
---
People need to stop interpreting these sites as reality. Often there's very few people uploading data - on some of these sites, some servers show *zero players* on some of the servers/factions because there's just noone running the addon. There isn't hundreds of people uploading on every server, there might be just a handful. So if a server used to have 3 horde and 3 alliance dudes uploading census data, and two of the alliance dudes stopped doing it, the site will think two thirds of alliance players have quit playing.
---
So don't read too much into this stuff. On my server, there has been literally no visible difference in faction balance, but suddenly some of these sites showed a swing from 52/48 to 80/20 for a week. Absolutely no evidence of it in-game, no talk of people quitting, no difference in the number of players out in the world, etc. It's literally just a lapse in data being sent to these sites.
---
Yea so like 3 years, I could see tbc In 3 years.
---
I like to think of it as Arathi Basin where your side is missing 5 players.
---
I understand, he mentioned he only uses Reddit mobile... so if he wants to get a high quality screenshot pic and you use 2 monitors... such as myself. Then you NEED to use Paint to Crop your Screenshot so it isnt super wide from dual monitors! =)
---
That's sad.
---
I cant even imagine what that would be like, to not know simple tasks. But maybe it's just because I'm a simple man and live for convenience lol.

You alright? Want us to call someone? It could be a stroke.

Is herbalism/mining feasible? Not a pain with all the switching?

Had a similar experience with eleven tarnished rings dropping in 3 back to back tribute runs with guild group. Happened to be a different group than I normally ran with. Hadn‚Äôt seen a ring drop the 20ish runs before and not any after like the other 10 I ran to try and gear guildees.
---
Our late raid did manage to get a binding drop \o/ 
---
I wish I could compile more stats on group dynamics like composition, and if it was guild or PUG, but that‚Äôs a lot of complex variable data to analyze for trends.
---
Side note: I‚Äôve yet to compile data in Hearthstone, but there‚Äôs a similar repeatable pattern if you play deck A, you‚Äôre normally matched against decks b c and d. Switch decks and suddenly you‚Äôre matched against decks e f and g. Switch back to deck A and the matchups go back o decks b c and d. One day I‚Äôll get around to recording all my matchups to show this pattern, because Blizzard claims matchmaking is purely rating based...though I have a feeling matchups are actually based on deck composition in the years I‚Äôve been playing.
---
Aka. We are lazy lol.
---
It doesn't look exactly the same. It's slightly different. Looks giga fucky and I hate it.
---
&gt;dedicated PvPers choose Horde because they have objectively better racials
---
That's the reason

Join a guild that uses DKP/EPGP. Raid for awhile as 2H fury as horde or make sure as alliance that you can roll on 2H weps when they drop (not sure if 2H slam build is a thing). Either way, after a while you‚Äôll get a wep. I got my Spinal Reaper 3 weeks weeks ago and 1v1 is MUCH closer against most classes. 
---
Engineering is a must too.
---
So many idiots on this thread. Valor, rofl. You wanna focus on crit bla bla.
---
Your TANKING set is your bis set, dude. Equip your might/wrath gear, rings and ranged weapon for hit, spec arms and equip any molten core 2hander and its bis you need. You will rape all other warriors and rogues and live longer to kill clothies. Thank me later
---
Its SO broken, I can follow stealth rogues that I cant even see
---
nah lol
---
Is there a website or program that shows this data for other servers? I'd love to check the populations on mine
---
Considering I'm playing horde and actually look for 1vs1 instead of relying on gank squads somehow I very much doubt that
---
Reading a couple of guides - having trouble finding how the rewards work for each rank. Is there a vendor somewhere? Do you get auto rewards (tabard, trink, gear, etc.) as you rank up and pick it up somewhere? Or do you purchase with gold?
---
The entire reason Classic feels so fresh, so good against current WoW is because there isn‚Äôt this huge linear story going on about. Wrath of the Lich King, beloved as it was, changed in a fundamental way how ‚ÄúStory‚Äù and ‚ÄúWoW‚Äù work. Instead of being about a ‚Äúnobody doing heroic deeds‚Äù, exploring a world and dipping into adventures and clashing against fierce foes, it became about John Hero and his amazing named NPC friends doing linear questing with several CRZ instances.
---
It went from a game you explore and find people to grand adventure, to a single player experience with a storyline about ‚Äúgrand adventure‚Äù, where the theme of the plot is said adventure instead of being a game about it.
---
Just made a shaman on pvp benediction server. Thinking about going elemental route for the DPS just not sure. Also unsure about what kind of weapon I should be using? Thoughts about it please and thank you!
---
Edit: don‚Äôt necessarily have to be the best pvp, but would like to stand a chance ha.
---
Sounds about right. I also heard that paladins give the upper edge in PvE situations?
---
You may not want to, but many guilds still compete within their server on things like raid times, logs, and Ony splits.
---
Consumables and world buffs make that possible.  
---
If you don't want to be in that type of guild, don't join it.  But the excuse that you don't have to do anything because the content is easy falls on its face when everyone else in the raid is doing it.
---
Bro this was taken yesterday, reposted to r/wow and then you cross posted the post back to here
---
Horde racials are better for pvp. Therefore most people who care the most about pvp will tend to roll horde.
---
No I got them yesterday my chart is bugged I think
---
Skeram was not balances at all. None of them were. They were all heavily horde. Our guild xfered to heartseeker in 2nd wave because skeram was like 5-1 horde to ally and pre honor were being camped in cities.

I play Orc because I like playing Horde. While the stun resist is nice, I do not care whether or not I have it. I chose a PvP server because I like PvP. If there was an imbalance of 70A-30H, then I'd manage by playing different characters if one can't get anything done.

So I'm 59 to respec to sm ruin or the sacrifice spec for raiding. Are these decent for pvp? What spells should I be using in pvp...I feel like I have a ton

it was actually ‚Äúlevel to 60 get a free level 110 boost on a character for bfa‚Äù but blizz never announced or confirmed this a bunch of sites just went crazy over a rumour.
---
Doesn't zul gurub reset more often?
---
What kind of logic is that? A pally isn‚Äôt so great when he has a lot of magic debuffs on him? What does that even mean? A rogue isn‚Äôt so good when he has faerie fire on him. A hunter isn‚Äôt so good when he‚Äôs getting dead zone. A warrior isn‚Äôt so good when he‚Äôs dead. 
---
Pally can bubble them all off or remove 2 per global. No other class can do all that.  I‚Äôm not so sure you even know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
The nemesis crown kills me it looks so bad
---
Yessir thought it would change the tone of the conversation and it worked! Got my question answerd and I'm so happy I made this choice :) anyways have a good day sorry you had to see my post again!
---
I see. It was unclear by just looking at the picture. No idea then. I know lots of people have been losing thousands of kills and Blizzard doesn't care.
---
Tanaris, Feralas, and Azshara is where I find the majority 48+ bots
---
If you pick a class that does everything sub-par, you should be willing to do everything. A druid is expected to do this, exactly like how a warrior is expected to be able to tank if asked. 
---
Might be because I never pug, but I‚Äôve never seen a case where this is the problem. Our druids are up for whatever, whenever. It‚Äôs the entire point of their class. Otherwise you could just play a rogue/warrior/druid.
---
You have good intentions, but unfortunately this sub, same as subs of others games with bot problems, are full of bot users who downvote and ridicule all posts and comments and pose a danger to their "money making scheme". So prepare for this to get downvoted too.

Heartseeker isnt 80/20 its closer to 60/40 now and at level 60 is about the same during normal hours.

Is asking for pre-raid BiS and consumables really that hardcore? I‚Äôm warrior class lead for a pretty casual raiding guild and if one of my warriors isn‚Äôt putting effort into pre-raid gearing and bringing DPS/tanking consumables, they will be low priority for loot until they come better prepared. 
---
I don‚Äôt go all passive aggressive on them for anything, just lay out my expectations and let them know how it impacts their performance and my loot distribution decisions.
---
I play alliance dawg. Lolol world bosses
---
Soo anyone trying to level an alt with me (EST)? Friends keeping me on my server quit and looking for a new home. Pretty casual player, can play most nights of the week.
---
The fuck you mean? In that we load the game and then load a server? Hmmm sounds pretty fucking similar. Only difference is yes there are private servers beside the official ones, usually the private has better cheat and bot detection but still the official servers aren't filled with bots and fly hacks..
---
Not sure how many runs I‚Äôve done.. including before I actually started grinding for it, probably 40-60 or so. Seen it twice, lost it to a hunter once who said he didn‚Äôt realize it was a melee proc and then once to a warrior was trolling and only auto attacking the whole run but the lead didn‚Äôt kick him. Now I only make groups where I‚Äôm the only one who needs it. Ex: 1tank/dps who needs SGC, and 1or2 heals/casters who need Banthok and/or Cyclopean
---
Wow I really hope thats not the case here
---
&gt; exaggerating how bad the faction imbalance is in order to make themselves feel better
---
Botting only makes gold. Having tonnes of gold means nothing to botters if they can‚Äôt sell the gold. The problem is people who buy gold, and all they get is in game currency which gets them a mount etc. 
---
I‚Äôm surprised people farm arena runs, given you‚Äôre not only fighting drop chance, but 6 possible boss spawns. But I understand some pieces of gear are def worth grinding for.
---
Best of luck getting the trink!
---
It isn't illegal just breaks the ToS.
---
Depends on the server. Since a ton of alliance players are quitting and looking for servers more balanced, the Grobbulus low level scene is currently huge
---
Ha... no.
---
The add-on can't help you target stealthed players (it usually can't even detect them after the nerf) and it's limited to 50 yards.
---
I think the term cheap is relative here, ive enchanted 6 weapons so far on my.rogue every 10 lvls or so (lvl 33 atm) 70g or so in total is about 1h farm on my main :p if u have money do it, or buy boost in dungeons. If its an alt i mean ofc
---
If WS dropped I would take it because I still have 2% - while you guys have 0. 
---
Once all my mages have choker I‚Äôll roll on it, and I‚Äôll still have 1% spell hit while you probably still have 0%.
---
I would literally give my other warlocks those items first and still do more dps.
---
Great, now that you've effectively advertised our server as being balanced it's going to create a mass influx of butthurt alliance players and ruin the balance! Great job! Ya dingus!
---
Attention: No one listen to OP. Benediction is a terrible server! Stay on your own servers!
---
It could've been great if they gave a shit about faction balance, population size and didn't nerf render distance.
---
Sell. Always sell unless it's true bis until harder to get raid drops.
---
Why are you trying to compete against bots? Why is that ruining your game?
---
Anyone tryna level an alt on Benediction\[A\]? Have a few between 10-25 but also open to starting another. Friends quit and leveling alone is a bore.
---
Well, they are. They're just outside. It's just that nobody pays enough attention.
---
Yikes, this leveling strategy has met a tragic road block.
---
Not true. It's even more risky and in a lot of reported cases triggers a ban more quickly.
---
Your last sentence addresses the problem. I have no idea if any given data on WCP is accurate because I do not know if someone bothered to take a census recently. It currently says that Faerlina is 50/50 level 60s. It says that Whitemane's ratio of 60s is 57% A to 43% H!!! Polling raidlogs is also flawed but at least there aren't any ridiculous glitches in the data.
---
To dare to dream
---
&gt; Alliance players are not that aggressive and don't camp same place for hours.
---
They're just as aggressive lmao. Just because they don't always have the numbers to back up their aggression doesn't mean they won't camp you just for shits and giggles.
---
You‚Äôre happy not taking advice? 
---
Okkkk
---
Paladins are incredibly better than shamans in both PvE and PvP. Alliance will dominate arranged BG groups easily. Racials aren‚Äôt even particularly lopsided, do you know how amazing escape artist is? Dwarf form? Fear ward?
---
People always blame racials or whatever and faction imbalance but it means nothing. Horde have been the larger PvP faction throughout all of WoWs life, even when alliance had WAY better racials. PvPers just like Horde.
---
Doesn't bother me at all üíÅ
---
It‚Äôs not about him not being up for it. It‚Äôs about common courtesy of asking.
---
I leveled a Druid to 60 never had a problem doing any role, also never had anyone just assume shit and not ask me. That‚Äôs rude.
---
Hybrids aren‚Äôt there for people to just bring along for whatever without talking to them.
---
Edit: going to point out you said if asked. He was never asked to heal. They just assumed that‚Äôs the problem.
---
Doesn‚Äôt bother you but you made a whole new post because you didn‚Äôt like the tone. Okkkk
---
Imagine 20k people in the starting zones without layering. It would never work.
---
1. Not important at lower levels. Even at 60, you can do without the 15% threat until you start getting geared dps that do 250-300+ dps single target. You can respec into 15% threat once you're closer to 60+ content. I didn't need it until 2-3 weeks of being 60 and grinding out pre-bis gear for the guild, so I don't think you would need it if you're leveling through tanking dungeons with similarly geared partymembers. 
---
2. Level to 60 committing to deep feral, then respec once you start maintanking dungeons more than questing. I started this transition around lvl 55 for BRD/Strat/Scholo. 
---
Most Druid leveling talent progression starts with b-lining to Feline Swiftness for the 30% movespeed for questing QOL. I'd go 5/5 Ferocity &gt; 5/5 Thick Hide &gt; 2/2 Feline Swiftness.
---
From here, there's mainly two options:
---
a. Continue to invest in the Feral Talent Tree and make a b-line for Faerie Fire (Feral), which frankly is both a DPS increase and a QOL in one.
---
To do this, I'd go 3/3 Sharpened Claws &gt; 2/2 Blood Frenzy &gt; 1/1 Feral Charge &gt; 3/3 Predatory Strikes &gt; 1/1 Faerie Fire (Feral)
---
b. Switch over to the Restoration Talent Tree and go 5/5 Furor
---
I chose to go with option a, and kick the 5/5 Furor can down the road.
---
If you chose option a as well, then you have to ask the same 5/5 Furor question after reaching Faerie Fire (Feral). It becomes another two options scenario:
---
a. Continue through the Feral Talent Tree to make a b-line to Leader of the Pack.
---
To do this, go 2/2 Savage Fury &gt; 2/2 Primal Fury &gt; 5/5 Heart of the Wild &gt; 1/1 Leader of the Pack
---
b. Switch over to the Resto Tree and do the 5/5 Furor first, then go to b-line to Leader of the Pack.
---
I chose to go with option a, again. It was cumbersome not having the 5/5 Furor for the starting energy/rage, but it was something I was able to work into my gameplay style so that I can reap the earlier rewards of the increase damage output from investing in the Feral tree to reach Leader of the Pack.
---
At this point, you can switch over to the Balance Talent Tree to make a b-line for Omen of Clarity:
---
To do this, go 1/1 Nature's Grasp &gt; 4/4 Improved Nature's Grasp &gt; 5/5 Natural Weapons &gt; 1/1 Omen of Clarity
---
By now, your talent tree should look something like this: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5000521303222151-05](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005001-5000521303222151-05), leaving you 3 points.
---
I chose to invest the 3 points into the Balance Talent Tree's 3/3 Natural Shapeshifter. I think the manacost to shapeshift even as a druid tank is invaluable for my playstyle, since I macro shapeshift pots, innervate, holy water throws, after pulls I heal/hot my partymembers (especially life tapping warlocks), etc. 
---
At this point, you're pretty much full bear-tank mode. After about 1-2 weeks of dungeoning for prebis gear with lvl 60 guildies, I opted for a talent reset for main tanking. 
---
I took 2/2 out of Blood Frenzy, since I don't cat dps, and put it into Feral Instinct to get 2/5. I also took out 2 points from Feline Swiftness as I didn't need the cat movement speed anymore and put it into Feral Instinct to get 4/5. To fill up the remaining 1 point of Feral Instinct for the 15% threat, I did a lot of research/calculating, and ultimately pulled 1 point out of Thick Hide and transferred it over to get 5/5 Feral Instinct.
---
I actually took another 1 point out of Thick Hide and put it in the Restoration Talent Tree's Improved Enrage to get 1/2. I like the extra +5 rage you get when popping Enraged, which I use on CD every fight.
---
My end build that tanks ALL MC bosses and also solo-tanks Ragnoras is:

---
How is this wow related?
---
But hypnotic flame has fire damage...
---
IMO lock is by far the best at delivering class fantasy, none of the others really compare
---
Ironforge.pro can give you a very rough estimation, but it's only that, an estimation
---
I‚Äôd disagree - if he doesn‚Äôt play often then not having to farm gold would be a huge bonus.
---
Because they never used it or understood how it worked in the first  place. I used it to help me stay away from the death squads but now it's not even good for that. They can be standing on top of you and spy won't detect them.
---
I would love to see some parses.
---
its like nuclear proliferation, sure nobody "wants" nukes, but you need them.
---
Plus i just let my sub lapse, started off strong but i just don't have the time anymore
---
More than likely it will be then or any time before that they need that hot sub injection
---
When you multi box and get camped*****
---
Maybe at that level, you would definitely need consumables and decent gear. I would either go for it at 60 or "carry" a lower level group through.
---
Saw 3 in 10 runs. Same group: pally, 3 mages, and druid. Trick to get HoJ to drop? Don't bring anyone that benefits from it.
---
This is how the attack table has always worked.  This is how shield block makes players uncrittable/uncrushable.
---
Meh I think classic is just too easy. I wish they released TBC/WotLK tbh.
---
The only thing to do for casual pve people is to like buy more lotuses for later.
---
Heres a copypasta I found of some insecure loser bragging about all the money he makes (30 dollars an hour?!?!). I think this guy is the real idiot. At least you arent this guy. Imagine making fun of poor people and being serious about it. The lack of self awareness. What a sad guy. 
---
"First of all dickweed, I work as a Data Engineer and make enough money to buy that shit and more myself. Sorry I have a job making over $30 an hour where I can buy things I want. 
---
Second off, you have no idea what VR can do because you haven't tried it, you're just talking out your ass about it. Also, your proving my point that it's mostly poor people against it because they are butthurt they can't afford it, so they have to bash it."
---
I thought we were talking about dropping pvp bombs but for sure that‚Äôs why In MC. But the MC frost spec is super garbage for pvp since it‚Äôs like frost/arcane
---
Topic is a better word whoops!
---
Sorry if my mobile picture angers you though?
---
You seem kinda TRIGGERED
---
If that is what you choose to believe, then it is true to you.
---
I get a kick out of the hunter bots. The other classes you don't notice it as fast but with hunters you have a randomly generated name (say, Zangeenie the troll) and their pet name will be entirely Chinese characters because the toon was made by somebody else, but the gold farmer named the pet themselves since hunters must reach level 10 to get a pet. Some see it as annoying, but these "real person" bots are sometimes nice enough, albeit bad at speaking english.
---
Okkk
---
&gt; It always required them to cast a spell or you mouseover them.
---
Wrong again.
---
Buffs and auras used to appear as though they were being recast every time a player moved with range of the combat log. That meant every player with any sort of buff or aura would instantly appear on Spy regardless of whether or not they had actually cast any spells.
---
I couldn't even contribute to that on my rogue leveling last week. Only saw 13 allies all week üò≠
---
It has a 3day reset. 20 runs = 60 days = 2 months :)
---
It would work after a week when people start spreading out.
---
Don't believe me? Well, thats literally how its done on private  servers.
---
Its just a crash fiesta and complete aids for the first 1-2 weeks, and then it sorts itself out. No need with 2+ months of layering, and no honor while lvling.
---
Just imagine doing STV with layers and no honor, its just sad.
---
That...is seriously aesthetically pleasing. Man I'm jealous.
---
I mean but couldn't alliance do the same thing by running around the wall and up the frozen waterfall.
---
You can open a ticket but they will say that vanilla was bugged and that they dont have the ability to help. I think they just have one guy in a room typing deflection replies to ticket requests.
---
dont do it. even if you like pvp, there is no pvp going on here. its honor farming only.
---
u will be foced to level only in instances, you wouldnt be able to grind of farmn anything and even getting to the instance is rly bad (30-40 min to BRD) and im not even talking about somebody leaving mid dungeon and u have to find another and then wait for them....
---
seriously.... even if u like pvp, go to pve server and pvp later in BG
---
I used Thrash for several raids on my Fury warrior, it‚Äôs definitely serviceable beyond your first couple raids. I put a Crusader on as soon as I got it and have had no regrets whatsoever, although I don‚Äôt use it much now that a 2hander dropped for me.
---
Fury does benefit more from extra attacks though, so your mileage may vary.
---
You charge I death coil then you charge again+fear immunity and hit me in the face until I die.
---
If I have the suc out then it‚Äôs more balance but you‚Äôll kill her in two hits, the other option is to have a vw and get an early sac so you don‚Äôt generate any rage but it‚Äôs not enough. This is my experience as a SM/Ruin lock, as a SL I‚Äôve a lot more Survavility and because of that options but unless you‚Äôre spending 50g a week reespecting on raid days then you can‚Äôt beat a warrior without engineering.
---
Yes, aesthetics matter to me. You spend a very long amount of time leveling to 60 and if you're committed you'll be playing way more after that as well.
---
If that's the case, I want my character to be worth looking at if I'm investing a lot of time into the exp, gear, and so on.
---
I'm currently leveling a Human Mage alt mostly for farming but also some PvP. I know that Gnomes objectively make better Mages due to racials, but I'll be damned if I'm going to spend several hundred hours staring at a Gnome that I hate. I'd rather sacrifice "optimal" racials for having a character that I actually enjoy playing for an extended period of time.
---
As far as character appearance settings go, I feel like it takes a minimal amount of effort to pick the options you like best, especially if they can't be changed later. Having options for hair styles, faces, and so on is nice and makes your character feel more personalized or more "you" when adventuring through Azeroth.
---
I must be landing at Light's Hope during those 40% of the time then. I've been taking an alternate route instead of landing at Light's Hope for my Strat runs because I always encounter 5-10 Horde camping there. Searing Gorge was really bad for the first week of phase 2 but now I often see no one from either faction after landing, or only encounter 2-3 Horde who can be quickly disposed of (5-10 more show up soon after but I usually just die once and can get away by rezzing off the cliff).
---
I use the Bagnon addon and use the clear bags button.
---
I'm just speculating here, but I think that a lot more people are fishing than used to.  For the same reasons that so many people rolled horde, and took engineering as a profession.  There's either actual working fishing bots that blizzard has not been able to detect yet, or there are a lot more people fishing and flooding the markets.
---
I was telling a fellow horde how messed up everything is and they said "isn't the ratio just 2:1?".  Then you go to BRM and it's 50 horde and 4 ally corpse walking in.  Snowball effect is rough.
---
It's information made available to the player but not intended for use in this manner. Commonly referred to as exploiting at times.
---
Definitely get bagnon, autosort changed my life
---
Would be helpful to know what class before making recommendations lol, for agi based the baron cape is the best, for warrs the cape from DM is better for pure ap
---
Bagnon. A bag addon, you will never go back to regular bags. Plus it has a button that auto sorts your items.
---
How rushed the content feels which is a valid complaint I want classic to last a while not be burnt through and abandoned in less than a year, which is what I fear considering how fast we are burning through content releases.
---
I'm on Grobbulus as well and I think it's -mostly- well balanced, but I do tend to see a bit more horde zergs just slaughtering everyone than alliance. It's not as bad as most servers, but it's definitely still an issue
---
Why do I want to reroll when I just got shit. ,60, epic mount, 300 professions.   I would faction change though.
---
Cant really say cheaper since Ark is like 60 bucks and two expansions i think, also 53k people playings as of 5 mins ago on Steam charts. 
---
So yes, i get the whole its smaller but at the same time you have people botting dino taming n shit and they get banned. It doesnt take much to look at the logs from cheater 1 2 and 3 and then compare it to everyone else and see whats different. The whole "we need to keep letting them bot to better understand them" is laughable at best, if they really wanted theyd buy the bot themselves and then reverse engineer it? I know plenty of game creators do that for cheats... but no lets let them destroy the economy slowly and see what happens. Its a bot, theyll be back with tweaked code in a week anyways might as well let them go through a dozen accounts.
---
ST lowkey one of the best dungeons.  So much trash mobs.  If you have a good group that can chain pulls, you will make absurd XP/hour.
---
A lot of blue potential drops too, easy gold.
---
Easy to pick up another 2-3gold from dragon skinning too.
---
they dont. they never have and they never will. one side always outnumbers and overpowers the other. its just the flaw of the server design.
---
After leveling a Warrior and dedicating it to Prot spec, I started leveling a second Warrior to be my DPS/PvP toon. 
---
At this point its not even an alt - just a split of my main imo. At least this time round I lvled with a Shaman friend!
---
You might be able to solo it using invis potions to get around tricky trash pulls.   The only way I can imagine it working though is to sneak around trash and only pull the boss - if that's possible.
---
If the strategy requires killing stuff, it's probably impossible for a warrior.
---
I stopped reading once you tried to compare wow to a job.  Try again.
---
Stop killing ppl more than 4 time maybe you get more
---
Exactly. There are folks on Alliance side, that are def worse cus of wee man syndrome. Think they're gid for ganging up on a54 war that it's just trying to level and hasn't ganked anyone
---
He made it 60 and our guild is gearing up for its first raid on Wednesday
---
2nd is first loser.
---
I only login once a Week to Raid. We gather in SW, someone pops a Ony-Buff and then we move with 2 Raids to the Blackrock and kill everything that moves on our way.
---
That‚Äôs the problem I think is that there is such a difference I have noticed that alliance have a big Presence early in the day in the open world but that changes as it gets later I see more horde and less alliance so if you log in at the right time your faction is likely controlling major areas log at at the wrong time and it‚Äôs the opposite that being said I have just kept just going with what ever works at the time, quest when I can, mon grind in a corner if I can, then dungeon run whenever else if I can find groups. I think the only way to deal with the world PvP situation is to just do you best to play around it whilst you can.
---
Get the PVP tabard for your faction?  Or get the Scarlet Crusade Tabard from SM.
---
Sick copy and paste answer, you bot. Shut the fuck up and kick rocks if you want to preach and not discuss.
---
Absolutely. 40 stam is *huge*. Great armor and Strength on top of that.
---
Wear your threat/Mitigation gear mixed, stay at 5% hitcap and go ham. Your role as warrior in WPVP is to be a wall and MortalStrike/Hamstring high priority targets, occasionally cleave a bit with Sweeping Strikes/Whirlwind. Defense isn't all to great either in PVE or PVP, and is mostly a nice-to-have bonus on otherwise great gear.
---
In BGs, this is still similar, but in WPVP you get targeted first if you initiate so Stam/mitigation stats are even more important for sure.
---
Ok yeah then leave on principal and sit there for another hour or two hoping for someone to invite you. RATHER THAN suck up your feelings and get a level or two.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm an orc. Just finished lionheart! Basically raid logging now
---
F R E S H 20k without layering lmao I have no idea how aids this is because I was always ahead of the pack
---
well yes, its not really news or a secret
---
I did something similar in Goldshire. Was advertising free bags and help with Hogger in general chat. There were some takers, but then there was one guy who posted literally the longest message possible in general that the gist of was basically this:
---
"Hey Doomly, you're not gonna win any good guy awards today. I just went to Stormwind to ask for a couple 6 slot bags, and a guy gave me 10 slot bags AND 10 gold!"
---
I replied with something along the lines of, "Thanks, that makes me feel really good."
---
To which he said, "Anytime."
---
Pretty much ruined my day and made me think twice about doing anything nice for anyone since. I honestly don't get why people act that way. I was about to quit the game, so I wanted to do something nice for others. I had even already given away a good chunk of gold so it didn't just sit on my account. All I could think is how the person who apparently gave that guy 10g would feel, if he knew he gave it to such a shithead.
---
Someone‚Äôs lucky day
---
It was a rumor that originated in the South American community that never came to pass.
---
I have a quest item bag, a consumables/permaitems bag (hearthstone, bullets, keys), a gear bag, and a professions bag. I sort from the backpack into those bags. I move vendor trash to the bottom of the backpack. If something fills up it may spill into the bottom slots of another bag, but I try to keep the top slots as consistently organized as possible.
---
love my grob guild
---
I think the dumbest people on earth are the people that think nothing can EVER get better. EVER. There are solutions to problems and people like you try their absolute hardest to make a revolutionary change NOT happen.
---
How would I do that? HMM lets see. Actually review each zone that has high spawn rates? Monitor people that accounts are active 24/7? Pay attention to pets with chinese character names? Implement a much better way to report bots in order to review them. Actively download and buy the latest botting software in order to actively understand how they work? There are about 20 other things I can list too. But you will have some shit excuse on how I'm an idiot and Blizzard is already doing this.
---
Ban waves are dumb as fuck since they have already extracted the gold they needed. They have accomplished their mission, therefore botters will remain. If they couldn't make money they wouldn't exist. AND THAT IS WHY BLIZZARD WANTS TO NOT STOP BOTTERS. They provide subscriptions you stuipd fucking idiot.
---
A sacrifice I‚Äôd be willing to make
---
The ammount of players doesnt matter tho, a 75% alliance dominant server is still a 75% dominant server with 1000 players only, and the fact that another servers Horde dominance is 75% on a 10.000 player server doesnt affect the 250 players on the 75% alliance dominated server.
---
My addition shows that alliance is percentually dominating their servers more than the horde.
---
I hear you guys. As a leveling Warrior, I had to...
---
Aw.
---
Many addons do exactly the same as what you just described..
---
Also look at concurrent player count. That is much more telling of the populations. Just because you see characters, doesn't always tell the whole story.
---
WEIRD i asumed with context clues you would have figured out that pvp server players specifically are the auidence im referencing.
---
&gt; This is to show you crybabies that it happens to everyone.
---
&gt;everyone.

A single alliance favored realm on US servers means everyone ü§î
---
Use your print screen ffs
---
The boss literally can't be soloed as a warrior, guy hits fucker hard. Trash is not the issue.
---
If you are ahead of the pack type of player, its not that bad, because 95% of the playerbase will take 2 days to reach lvl 10. But if you get ahead all the content is available, except people can't cheat the game by layer jumping to respawn everything for infinite AoE farm.
---
Hmm idk about this, he‚Äôd be tanky but have really low crit and damage. I‚Äôd probably swap out a few tanking pieces for crit personally.
---
The classic census addon has been updated to include a feature that executes manual /who commands when the player clicks things, making the addon virutally automatic again and increasing the reliability of the data.  Need more people running the updated addon.
---
Sorry, but racials are very lopsided. As a 2k+ exp alliance warrior, I struggle against lesser skilled players without abusing consumables. Dueling another warrior and he gets his intercept stun off while yours gets resisted? That‚Äôs probably a loss. Fighting an undead player so you can‚Äôt fear and bandage? Often a loss. Dueling a troll and he‚Äôs regenerating more health than your damage can keep up with? Okay, just kidding on that one. 
---
But there‚Äôs a reason the racials got reworked once competitive pvp came out after classic.
---
Yeah i generally vet people a little bit to see if they get help, it would ruin my day to know I'd helped such a shit head :(
---
Sell all those boe except they are bis for a long time.
---
Where is your source that alliance is mostly the minority faction, here is my source that proves you are wrong, 10 servers are alliance dominated and 10 are horde, but alliance dominate their server percentually harder than the Horde does. 
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers/
---
ITT: People who've never used Spy, claiming it has supernatural powers.
---
yeah my warrior will be staying at lvl 35 for quite some time, no thank you. 
---
at least you can tank dungeons
---
also I can‚Äôt sympathize with the horde after what I‚Äôve experienced
---
will of the forsaken
---
devouring plague
---
not even close
---
I don't really like playing games that has a lot of cheating going on. It takes away from cool ideas to make gold to.. oh just cheat and make 10x more gold than anything a person can do.
---
I am very against cheating, and when people have HUGE advantages of buying extremely cheap gold FOR pvping (unlimited pots, elixir, consumes, gear, enchants, engineering, sappers), it start to directly affect me.
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE
---
This is why I left Herod.
---
Yup, killer against those damn hunters and warlocks  on their epic mounts too.
---
Nope, this is ridiclously simple i dont understand why i have to explain this.
---
ARK is not an mmorpg. 
---
We got a little off topic. Im not defending actiblizzrd, they do what makes them the most money. Costs to investigate and cancel subs so they do just enough to shut up the masses and nothing more.
---
Nope, the math is 100% correct, learn to comprehend what is beeing calculated..
---
Uhh
---
You dont know what u talking about, this is realllllly simple to understand lol.
---
honor is on DR after 4 kills u get none.
---
Yeah but it depends from server to server. I expect the ratio to get worse with time just like it happened with retail eventually.
---
Only matters if you care what it looks like.
---
70g each... Here on Skeram Horde that were going for 88g last night and I was excited. They'd been 100g+ the last week or two. ;_;
---
Aye we are lol
---
Do I use healing gear or tank gear for this build? I can see the benefits in both but what Is optimal?
---
Whats an analogy? My god, no talking to idiots apparently.
---
You know these gold sellers and botters, that IS their job right?
---
Eh fuck edge masters, you are already the master of the axe edge. If you get the sword that‚Äôs great and you‚Äôll crush the damage meters. I think there are 2 good axes that drop in bwl plus ony so there is always a chance you get one of those. Not to mention if you pvp at all there are gloves with immunity to disarm which I think are super dope, but I doubt they are as good in pve. Lots of expensive BoE items for warrior, basically gotta make a list of best bang for buck and decide where edge masters fall in that spectrum
---
It's funny when they start jumping around and spinning after they notice the mind vision.
---
No im not, facts hurt huh? Alliance dominate the servers and still crying, l2p issue.
---
Hyperbole
---
lmfao you're literally crying about an add-on that does nothing.
---
Basically when a player or an NPC parries an attack, the defender has their swing timer shortened.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Parry
---
"After a successful parry, the defender's "swing timer" is reduced by 40% of your weapon speed (or even reset), unless this would result in a reduction to less than 20% of your swing time remaining. This results in an average of .24 extra swings per parry."
---
I see a lot of people complaining about bots - enough now to change my mind that it is a big problem.  There must not be many bots on PvE servers, I've only run across 2 or 3 in all of my time in classic.
---
Why do you feel the need to insult me? It‚Äôs only a video game. And you are showing that it means a lot more than a game to you.
---
Carried by magmadar douse!
---
Not at all. Mats are limited by spawns at the same rate as low pop realms. There aren't nearly enough mats to go around, which is why they're so expensive.
---
I wonder if there is a subreddit to discuss pservers. 
---
You might start your own and see how many likeminded people are there?
---
This subreddit are 90% alliances crying even tho they dominate the server more than the Horde. Imagine crying so much about the Horde, yet you are the dominant faction, yikes :D 
---
Yes, it sucks. And I report all the botters (or at least the people I expect botting).
---
I don't like people cheating either, but so far I don't think its a big enough issue for me to quit the game over it. I hope Blizzard takes out the bots (which I am pretty confident they are doing) because I haven't seen that many bots personally. Obviously some scripts might be more advanced and harder to see.
---
This post is hilarious.
---
Horde player on a server where there are thousands more horde characters online thinks his server is balanced and the game is fine.

Just stand up for yourself. You qued as healer? Heal or leave. Good luck
---
Why wouldn't you just quit Wow, classic or retail, and play another game without bots?
---
Yup. Definitely the huge cave full of alliance friendly mobs.
---
Actually it's a pretty fantastic grinding spot around 49 or so.
---
&gt; But right from my experience, I haven't seen that many bots.
---
Go to the Barrens and wander around, you'll find a dozen or so. Was following a few earlier today, tossin out reports and all that.
---
They'll get banned, but it happens in large waves not individually. I understand the OP is frustrated with botting because it SEEMS like Blizzard does nothing for quite awhile, but then suddenly they'll all be gone and have to start from scratch again.
---
Yeah.. it is known
---
Considering the insane amount of bitching over butched server ratios, I would actually assume that if Blizz were to open new servers with faction ratio enforced that these servers would be a hit.
---
I log in at 7 50 for 8 pm raid and done by 10 I don't understand your issue
---
Why won't you just get Puissant cape, I am sure that's better back + not even agi/str based?
---
I assumed someone asking if an enchant while leveling is worth it does not have a 60 main. Obviously if you have money then go crazy and buy everything you can/want.
---
Should have rolled PvE. You knew exactly what you were getting into when you picked the inferior faction.
---
Yeah. I keep waiting for something better to come along. The version of Outfitter that worked on the 1.12 client servers was basically perfect.
---
No one should care, but it can still get to you. Also if he's not aware of the value. That sword is halfway to epic mount for example:) but his choice
---
I don't think this should be a shock to anyone. When you can't actually play the game, why should you log in? Faction ques need to happen, and I think they are reaching a point where they will have no other choice.
---
Ruined the fun of having a NE druid. Any stealth I would use I always had people stand on me even when they shouldn‚Äôt know where I was. Classes with stealth abilities are pointless...
---
It's bis for some classes.
---
I've actually seen a lot of real world bots, my bigger fear is how there must be an unreal amount of bots in dungeons. Go level a character or read some of the other botting threads. This is why I quit WoW way back when. Every zone I went to had several botters. 15 years later and nothing has improved? Again, I just can't even image how many botters are in dungeons.
---
Bots don't get banned individually because Blizzard wants to get information on said bot. If they banned immediately the bot maker would simply change whatever got detected, push a patch out and the bot users would continue on like nothing. Just wait a few weeks and you'll see their numbers drop.
---
Of course, they'll come back and try to start over but that's just the nature of a popular MMO; they attract people looking to make an unscrupulous buck. Bots have always existed in WoW, since day 1, and there's always the same cycle.
---
Don't quit a game you enjoy cause some fuckwad out there has more money than sense.
---
On Grob horde here. Our boys have been very aggressive in wpvp but so have alliance. Seems alliance are running guild-heavy raid groups for wpvp, while horde are doing smaller 5-10 groups. It feels like the advantage leans horde but there have been a few times where Hurricane or OC came through and just smoked us with like 80 people and sappers so who knows.
---
The modern gaming surely has evolved, after all, Wow Classic is an attempt to revive a 15 years old game.
---
I am sure retail wow doesn't have issues like that though I haven't been playing it for a while: why won't you try it?
---
It wont be. Instant queues for ally will leave the bored horde in queue finding some open world pvp wherever they can.
---
Ok i misunderstood then cuz to me it sounded like OP was leveling an alt since no lvl 7 could ever afford to enchant anything :p
---
Druid here, I never get to dps :( but I do expect to be filled in on whatever role I‚Äôm playing or at least have that established prior to dungeon start. Reason being is carrying around 15-17 pieces of armor in my bags hinders how much stuff I can carry. I actually like switching it up from tanking to healing and even without healing talents we can do just fine. Just let me know what gear to bring to the dungeon that‚Äôs all I ask.
---
Warriors aren't meant to duel, they're supposed to have a bubbled pallie casting freedom behind them. You want an Spriest or an SL lock for dueling.
---
This is why i quit wow 10 years ago. I'm guess I'm not surprised they still don't care. I can't imagine how many bots are in dungeons though they would be impossible to see
---
WHAT
---
Except it is nothing like a map hack in CS. In CS there is no way to see through walls or smokes without actually cheating. Spy just filters your combat log, info freely given to you in the base game. Also this addon existed back in the day under a different name(paranoia).
---
Download an addon, make an alt on your (and some others) servers, login for at least couple of minutes a day then upload. I do it myself on 6 servers.
---
With you, it will be better.
---
Is there an add-on similar to the one with trinketmenu (I believe that's what it's called) where you can select different consumables, and have it bound. E.g. if I want to use arcane protection potions for one fight but fire protection for another, have them on the same keybind but not have to drag from my bag or drag around on my actionbars?
---
Nah. It's just too skewed.
---
I'm in a guild that doesnt pvp unless we are attacked.
---
Many horde on the server feel the same way. We dont want no allies.
---
I try to warn then when they're running into  a death squad. Usually they just sigh and keep running.
---
TBF the alliance that are left on stalagg are all pretty ruthless and good at the game from what I can tell.
---
I am the best gnome rogue healer this game has ever seen.
---
I really fail to see the difference between the two games in terms of MMO and MMORPG. The only difference is Ark can be played solo/offline. I can still roleplay a girl, a tribes slave, fisherman, whatever. Both have 50k+ active players. Only difference i see is one actually has a visible working anticheat/bot detection. 
---
Spin it however you want its more similar than you make it seem lol, only difference is one has hundred player servers while other has a biiit more. Tf does player count matter in terms of banning cheaters? Tf does MMO or MMORPG matter? Its online and they are ruining our experience, get them the fuck outta here.
---
Maveriic
---
Oh it surely will, I am looking forward to feedback about ok alliance premades on BGs. Find your own premade and enjoy your revenge.
---
They're crossrealm. Wont be any worse for stalagg thanany other horde dominated realm.
---
I kill every botter I see and I report them too. Doesn‚Äôt mean I let to bother me.
---
Its the same 4 ppl complaining over and over again
---
Yup, same here my fellow rogue. I try to stay the the high road almost all of life, but it‚Äôs an eye for an eye out there for all those undead fuckers on sulfuras out there.
---
This is not how things are supposed to be working.  Blizzard fucked up the servers and broke the game.  They're hilariously incompetent.
---
Right? Alliance always outnumbering me.
---
Hahahaha
---
Well that is not what I thought that icon was.
---
you play on herod? ill beat you :)
---
They won't because #nochanges.
---
Also, to be realistic, they won't because people still give them money.
---
Lets simplify:
---
There is 10 horde dominated server and 10 alliance dominated servers.
---
Lets pretend that all the alliance dominated servers are dominated by the alliance ina 70:30 ratio, if you count their domination percentage together from all the 10 servers, that would be 10x70 = 700.
---
Then lets pretend the Horde dominate their servers by a ratio of 65:35 and you count their domination percentage together from all servers you have 10x65 = 650
---
That number literally tells you that on average, Alliances dominated their servers percentually more than the Horde. The raw number of players dont matter because this is a not mega server. The 10.000 player server in your example, will also have more alliance respectfully, thats why % is used.
---
Dunno, im on a server that it says there's like 30% allies.. and it doesnt feel like it. Allies everywhere in the world and gank us levellers. I think its more balanced than that.
---
Would you be complaining if you were a dwarf war with stoneform to be tankier and remove dots(which they would be salty about), maybe even getting a few ticks of bandage from it?
---
A gnome to actually have a chance vs a mage?
---
Or a paladin to give you BoF and buffs while shamans give you. Nothing comparable??
---
Or is it that you are playing human with no good pvp racials?
---
Have fun playing when there aren't any Alliance left on your server lol.
---
Yeah those Whitemane numbers feel very off. I don‚Äôt have any data and it certainly isn‚Äôt as bad as a lot of other servers, but I‚Äôd believe 50/50 at 60 before I‚Äôd buy Ally advantage.
---
No. 
---
What they're writing about is you can technically see, /target them or they're just standing behind things, but since the SpyClassic shows everything near you which you can see/target, then you can easily just send your pet after them and let it lead you to them.
---
It doesn't do anything that regular macros couldn't do, it just makes it easy for you by spamming these macros and showing the results on the screen.
---
Pets popping you out of stealth is because they're too close to the enemy and they got a macro to spam /petattack on nearby targets or they got faster reactions than you.
---
that's just 1v1s and worse case scenario won't always happen. Also warrior's aren't even great 1v1 in classic so your perspective is biased.
---
In large scale grp pvp and BGs Alliance have solid advantages. Escape Artist is legit the best warrior pvp racial in classic. Couple that with BoF...shit isn't fair.
---
Nephew
---
Idiot. Ready to jump on someone. Print screen wouldn't catch what was coming down the side of the screen.
---
If they open server transfers, the guy with 1k lotus will take the cake.
---
Just cancelled my sub at level 56. Even after transferring to lowest pop server, game is still fucking unplayable as ally. If I go into the world, I get camped by tons of level 60 horde nolifes, it is literally impossible to progress. Fuck this bullshit
---
Are you aware of the distinction between PvE and PvP servers? Perhaps you've done this study in a bubble and are not aware of the PvP server controversy / discussion that is going on. If that's the case then I'll explain it another way:
---
Right now shit is absolutely fucked on PvP servers and people are constantly complaining and counter-complaining about the complaints. There's a ton of anger and people are quitting the game due to faction imbalances. Your post kind of comes off as "I'm here to prove that there isn't a problem" which might just be unfortunate timing on your part.
---
In any case, I'm not sure why you're mixing PvE and PvP data together. Completely different server types.
---
Maybe. Pick whatever you want to play though. Rogues and warriors are a necessity in raid content. Do you want to be melee dps that sometimes off tanks? Or do you want to be melee dps that interrupts spells and stuns? Both are needed. When you pick sometime you have fun at, you‚Äôre going to last a lot longer than someone who rolled x class because they had a better chance at getting into a raid. 
---
I‚Äôve done this many times and found out the hard way how BORING some classes were to me in raid content. Try both and stick with your favorite.
---
Well addons have been a huge part of MMOs and WoW since the beginning. In vanilla there where addons wayyyy more stupidly game breaking then this. Everyone wanted #nochanges, and of course everyone knows everything about the game now because it's been out for 15+ years.
---
&gt; Buddy half the server would get it if that's how it worked.
---
And at that point, gob cities would just be an active PvEvP FFA arena, May as well just slap down aggro-dumping every few second goblin gladiators in the gurubashi.
---
Your account:
---
Someone disagrees with me? Downvoted and flamed.
---
found the forsaken rogue
---
I think it depends on how stringent you are.  
---
If it's questing greens and some randomly itemized non-BIS blues that's one thing.   If it's partial BIS and other items that are close to the value of BIS items then I think it's a little much.   
---
For example do you get on people for not having savage glad chain?  Instead having something like deathdealer? Ogre forged?  Etc?
---
It's cheating and defending it only shows how bad at the game you are
---
Regardless of you removing the post:
---
Just use woven ivy necklace or something similar until you get the Ony Necklace. BiS for a good while. Don't buy the Def neck.
---
Longshot, but does anyone happen to have characters on Pagle and Benediction and would be willing to help me transfer gold? (I give you gold on Bene, you give me gold on Pagle, would even do 1.5:1 or something)
---
I rerolled on Pagle cuz I got tired of wpvp, but having no gold or bags sucks
---
It's kind of weird how I'm overreacting to bots if I'm just going off the bots we know of. There could be way more per server in dungeons that we have no idea of. So if anything I'm underestimating how many botters there are since I would never be able to see people in dungeons.
---
What? That doesn't seem right at all. What if video games are a hobby of yours?
---
30 ap is roughly 1% crit for warriors but askhander has 7 more stam and 1% dodge.
---
But I'd 100% get onyxia tooth pendant, it like almost made for threat tanks.
---
Oh I agree.  It'd be pointlessly difficult to do it without them, but I was just saying it would be possible without raid gear.  I know greater fire protection potions on Ragnaros, at least for melee, absolutely made our first kill possible.  Even without getting hit by wrath the lava splashes absolutely drain the healers trying to keep us alive.
---
Some, sure. But if I were in their shoes, I'd just quit until BGs come out and see if that helps, if not - move on. There isn't much to do right now but rush MC/Ony, farm the same dungeons, and roam in gank squads anyways. 
---
Video games are supposed to be fun. And corpse running for 40min ain't it, my man. And if it ain't fun, why play?
---
But since the server ratios are not public, you will probably end up on a dogshit server again, either H or A favored.
---
If only Blizzard could take their thumbs out of their asses and showcase the fucking server ratios (in percentiles would be okay since they are scared of showing player numbers) the community could help to self-balance the servers.
---
I fucking love wpvp, and I will never ever play on a shitty PvE server. But I think wpvp has to be a fair game for it to be fun, where both factions have about the same access to raw manpower.
---
The add-on single handedly ruined world PvP in classic. Fuck these devs
---
I already got the trinket for rag :(
---
Imagine defending Spy beause you are that bad at the game
---
Do you think that botters don't exist or do you not think they pose a problem? https://www.twitch.tv/videos/515350157 these guys have been on for days just farming. But who cares if people cheat right
---
Be full smart like me on my rogue, get The thrash blade quest at lvl 45, search for someone selling blsckstone ring with pay on drop, tag along for that Princess kill and get ur quest completed for free. And u got thrash at l l 45 which u Will use until 60, ur welcome.
---
Watched 30s saw a warrior keyboard turning.
---
Trully high-level play.
---
The buff/class stacking is absolutely ridiculous though
---
shitty server for 2 weeks vs shitty server for 3 months
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJeP1BT2JA
---
That's what I'm going to eventually do.
---
Unless it takes 10-15 deaths to go to BRD,i dont want to hear it lol
---
Id go sm/ruin as it is decent in pvp and pve. Good utility for sologrinding as well. DS/ruin gives a Little more sb damage but lacks the perks of affli.
---
/r/whoosh
---
I can just smell the gay
---
Honestly real good. Vanish has saved my ass more times than I can count. I like rogue mostly because it's good at pvp and pve
---
Exactly, if u dont know dont give advice or theorycraft. There is only one bis option right now, which is be mostly in epic tank gear with arms spec. Top upvoted comment says exact opposite, fucking reddit hahaha. I mean if u have flameguard gauntlets sure equip them instead of might but that goes without saying.
---
That's very true!
---
I like how I preface my comment by saying I‚Äôm saying it separately from the entire cheating discussion get a reply commenting on the cheating discussion.
---
Let's start a guild, Senpai Killers. Or if someone with more weeb knowledge can come up with something more appropriate let me know.
---
They could have just more appropriately scoped the combat log range nerf. That is, don't limit the range inside instanced content like dungeons and raids.
---
It is a philosophical component of "Hardcore Guilds" and if you knowingly join one, you are applying to that philosophy even if they are more "hardcore" than successful.
---
My issue with it is that there are bots because they are profitable. They are profitable because of how long it takes for Blizzard to ban them, which is on purpose since they want the subs.
---
And there ya go, immediately into personal attacks over a video game instead of actually arguing. Typical childish behavior by a horde player.
---
In pre raid bis 1% crit is about 20ap.  It only scales upward at that point.  Sacking the 7 stam/1% dodge and 1% crit seems outlandish for 10 more ap at the moment dont you think?
---
Fantastic, maybe we'll get less posts bitching about PVP now.
---
Link to source
---
Except that census is obviously wrong.
---
Lol, I don‚Äôt even play WoW anymore and it‚Äôs just so childish and biased to think that only one side is full of 12-year olds when in reality both consist mainly of whining losers. That‚Äôs my main point really, you kinda digressed from that. You‚Äôre talking about self-esteem when you have to write pages of pedantic argumentation and lie about not being angry just to protect your ego. At first I was irked by how narcissistic you were now it‚Äôs just pity and I‚Äôm sorry that you have to live with this anger that controls you. Like I said it‚Äôs like living with an abuser in your head. Just take it it, I don‚Äôt even want it anymore.
---
Blizzard is China's bitch.  Not recommended.
---
You sir, are an extremist
---
well yeah wotf is very good, but dp is shit compared to shadowguard. does less damage, costs waaay more mana, doesn't proc blackout stun all the time and is not cleansed that easily. on top of that troll has a spammable mini ms for literally no mana.
---
so yeah, wotf helps the undead but in the end its not really close.
---
Really? Everybody I talk to that uses it uploads full stacks at market price or a ~5% undercut. Why would anybody upload single stacks other than for crashing the market? Same with buying. Seems more like the people who use the addon keep snagging the stacks and just leaving the single units behind.
---
You need to kite with earthbind, shock, and bait pummel to heal yourself. Obviously with full consumables and engineering it gets more complicated, but in general you should be able to 1v1 them unless there's a massive gear difference or he gets a bunch of good crits
---
Literally every private server launches with BGs in from day 1.  Nostalrius delayed AV's release for later in the cycle.
---
I wonder how many guilds could go this fast but just choose to not care about it because there's no reason to...
---
After 15 years, I think they are done collecting info and there are still bots. The real reason is they want the sub money.
---
Retail goes back and forth depending which racial is stronger, since it's competitive and fair pvp, racials matter.
---
I can see tanks physically needing BiS to do certain things, its just when a majority of players are DPS, it really doesn‚Äôt matter as much as they put it out to be. I know I could be wrong in so many places, but it is better to enjoy yourself playing the game than to haw playing the game
---
The chat being unusable for hours at a time is how it was in vanilla wow and blizzard is just mimicking that, is that what you are saying then?
---
No Phase 2 killed it
---
You should def. look for a +15 agi or close to green from AH until you get baron cape.
---
If you are the treath tank you will get the onyxia neck that will last untill AQ.  (Edit) i see you ready have the trinket... Then i suggest eshkandars collar.
---
No, not mad. ENRAGED!!!
---
Unreal. Looks like there is no talking sense into you. Good luck.
---
And you are crying about your cheating add on not working anymore because you're a scrub.
---
60 pally in herod. I basically quit and so did all my friends after p2. Sucks but I‚Äôm not wasting 3 hours running back to dead bodies over and over again.

Don‚Äôt blame them. I have No time to level a new character to 60 and it‚Äôs no longer a fun game between work and real life. Can‚Äôt get a single 1v1 regardless of zone. 
---
Alliance on Stalaag is dead. No one runs dungeons anymore because they know they‚Äôll spend more time corpse running than in the actual dungeon.
---
horde outnumber almost 4-1 and people are just rerolling horde. That free transfer shit killed the realm. 
---
PvP goes from a 1v1 to 1v5 almost instantly. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait for 10v10 in WSG as opposed to 10v60 every time you go out into any zone 48+.
---
Idk how it‚Äôs fun to 10v1 constantly. 
---
Shoutout to the only horde rogue, Kevinas, who actually fights me 1 up. GG bud
---
The highest population servers are PvP and Horde heavy.
---
There's also twice as many PvP servers. 
---
You're screwed bud.
---
SM ruin. Good for PvE, but also good at group pvp. Not gonna be amazing for 1v1 situations against things like rogues, but it's nice in group pvp. SL is absolute garbage in PvE, and doesn't really shine in group pvp either. Its more of a 1v1/duel spec.
---
so what? whispered secrets is shadow damage and has no int? most of our dmg in pvp is fire
---
I just train mobs onto them and vanish. They die and I laugh.
---
This makes me wish there was an option to kill your own faction.
---
Uh yeah. I just wanted to complete a quest for gloves in Wintersprings at 3am, but alas a group of 4 horde kept ganking me. F*** you, horde.
---
Bots are good for the economy. Does the shit nobody would ever want to do like grinding certain resources or grinding out 60s. If anything it helps dilute resources making it easier to catch up to no lifers
---
Ooo look at me I‚Äôm on a PvP server being used as target practice. If you got that alliance mindset might as well play on a pve server
---
Just wanna point out a potential bias. I play female orc and obviously I'm a dude. I don't play female because I want to roleplay a female, I just prefer the animations and aesthetic  of female orc compared to male. I would go male gnome, dwarf, troll or undead if I were to play that race.
---
Sweet. Good luck and may your drops be legendary you filthy savages. I'm popping all my cd's on him if I see him in the gulch.
---
A normal reaction to botting is "oh well, kinda shitty that people are cheating, let me report them and go about my day" compared to your "botting is going to make me quit the game!! let me write you an essay why!"
---
If a minority of shitty players botting is enough to make you quit the game, you weren't going to stick around for long anyways. I hate bots as much as the next person, but unlike you I'm not going to let some random person behind a botting program dictate the fun I have in a video game.
---
Also get either fire resist or all resist to your cape. It is also quite cheap and can make a difference in raids.
---
I feel pressured into leveling my alts and spamming dungeons on my main to try and get 12% drop items that won't drop in 10 runs.
---
True, its stupid.
---
If i see a pug with regular MS &gt; OS im joining that one for sure
---
It's probably hunters or mages like you said. Mages can get very good gold with AoE farming. It's generally considered easy so maybe I'm just an idiot, but I found that you need some specific gear (I was stupid enough to throw away my int+stam gear when I got my spellpower gear when farming pre-bis, even though int+stam is perfect for AoE farming) to make it work, and even then it can be hard executing the pulls correctly and with having mobs resist your slows and getting destroyed. But provided you are good at it I think it's probably the highest gold per hour. 
---
Hunters are probably most efficient at 'regular' gold farming by killing mobs 1-by-1. Their pet and kiting ability gives them insane survivability against mobs and their damage isn't lacking either. I've heard they can do tribute runs for money or something but I haven't enough experience on a hunter to comment on that.
---
3500 people trying to rank in like 6 viable zones is insane
---
People cheat at literally every aspect of life and video games. Do you just quit life too because of other people's actions?
---
Yes, bottling detection needs to be done mostly manually.
---
Spy is the dumbest addon to ever exist and Blizzard should have already shut it down
---
I don't know how wars work, can they not charge if i DMG them first? Problem is frost shock is only 20yrds but if I just throw lighting at 36yrds then they can just walk away since there's no cc
---
Good ol' Herod
---
ninjas
---
The worst are the people who like to pretend it's a non-issue.  Imagine the embarrassment felt by the guild of a bot when I reported it to them.  Just one of multiple hunters all synced up together to farm elites in Tyr's Hand.
---
Waited for someone to come out and see it first hand, mind visioned them to guide them to the spot, and sure enough it was plain to them as well.
---
Perception is one of the top 3 race skills. Very situational but effective.
---
Ew fam, why?
---
That's a leap in logic. Would have stayed back then, would have stayed now. I'm not OK with games with an unreal amount of cheating.
---
Many people chose their faction because they prefer their lore, asthetic, etc. Can't reroll Alliance when you wanna play an orc.
---
He's one of my fav guildies
---
Where do I fill in a # of runs with no drop yet??
---
Well, yeah. Can't get the fiance to play as we have limited play time. When half your playtime is sucked up by being corpse camped for an hour or more when trying to get to an instance? It's not fun. Being killed by 5+ Horde solo or in a duo when trying to quest is not fun. Being CCed as soon as you land at a FP until the honorless debuff goes away and then a group of Horde kill you is not fun.
---
Pretty sure 5 swp is instant death to anyone without a dispel.
---
Boneslicing and 2x15agi enchants are better damage wise.
---
If you really want to tryhard, consider using mana pots and demonic runes. Theyll add a significant chunk of DPS and you'll rarely lifetap except on longer fights like Rag and Ony.
---
This is not how things should be 19,000 people shouldn‚Äôt be on a single server. This is the result of blizzard completely not taking classic seriously.
---
That makes sense. Didn't realize it, thanks!
---
If I ice block with more than 5 on me and I'm alone there it definitely not anyone coming and imma make em wait 10 seconds then hit cold snap so I can make em wait another 10 seconds for their honor points.
---
It‚Äôs a shame as that was the make up of me and my 3 irl mates group but we just lost our frost mage (he didn‚Äôt die, just quit)
---
I know you're blind since you didn't see the countless other explanations, but here. I'll answer. 
---
Very, very few people anticipated Blizzard deciding to exponentially increase population on servers.
---
People rolled on PvP servers with PvP in mind, not 3:1 Horde odds equating to literally thousands of people at all hours of the day roaming the world camping you.
---
I've never understood this mentality.
---
You like PVP, but fuck with the opposing faction so much that they don't want to play, and then it will eventually get to a point where there's no one left to kill. Then what would be the point of a PVP server when there's no one to kill?
---
That's not PVP. That's just sad.
---
Ill just parrot what everyone else said.  SM/Ruin is great PVE, I was leading meters in my raid with it.  Great in group PvP, but pretty weak when youre on your own.  I currently swap between the two so I can farm during the week.  SL/Nightfall is a nasty powerful spec that essentially allows you take 30-40% less damage depending on pet out.  I've won a few 1v2s with this spec.  Keep dots up, fear, and drain you win.
---
Nah [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luuUE0x7-TY) is why I picked Horde.
---
Ah yes the classic "I'd totally be able to deal with this problem" from the person totally untouched by said problem.
---
&gt;They'll be back in 10 days.
---
Some of them will
---

---
Wrong, Horde have not always been the larger faction-- Alliance way outnumbered Horde in Vanilla.  Only in TBC did that change.
---
Are you doing that for fun or do you think you'll need it? Because people are already meeting naxx dps checks in MC gear, I think you can relax a bit lol.
---
do they not have thanksgiving in orgrimmar?
---
Umm... #nochanges....? No? Ok.
---
Threat tank getting the trinket.... F
---
Fair enough, it‚Äôs still annoying but I understand it‚Äôs more YouTube‚Äôs fault
---
You do realize with how little damage you do at 40 that just blinking and just spamming frostbolt will absolutely run you out of mana way before he dies, right?
---
Most likely yes.
---
They have 2 charges, one that they can use in combat and one that they can't use in combat.
---
So if you can rush up close to them to get them into combat with frostshock, they will only have 1 charge. And that way if you manage to get them off you, they have will have a downtime of like 20 seconds where you can just kite them.
---
That sounds like a gear issue. I'm mostly raid gear now, which for shaman, even resto or ele, means mail or leather. In my experience it goes: charge into me, slow me. I pop either earthbind or tremor, usually bind. I pop searing totem and Frost shock. At this point if I have the health I go for a ns combo with lightnings, ch and earthshock highest rank. If I am low I NS a heal and kite him with Frost and bind, but if not just overpower him with damage using NS to quicken the damage burst.
---
I dont care, i have a beautiful life
---
If it‚Äôs your first time playing warlock don‚Äôt forget grimoires! But but only ones you‚Äôll use
---
Hell yeah
---
Visual bug
---
That‚Äôs literally the opposite of what I said. I literally just said I‚Äôm not suggesting you do it in quest greens with no consumables. I said I‚Äôm suggesting you can do it in level appropriate gear with proper stats and best in slot isn‚Äôt necessary.
---
Learn to read.
---
If MC takes you 4 hours that‚Äôs a problem.
---
Thats fair enough. Thanks for letting me know!
---
how does one multibox on the same account?
---
*A week later*
---
Why is my server dead????!??!?! Blizzard plz merge why did you kill Classic?
---
Or just be horde
---
Yes but you don't necesarily want to open with burst, you leave yourself with no rage for slow, kick or intercept etc. Also a warrior is deadly when he has the enrage proc giving 25% damage, so saving some rage getting crit hten intercept auto ms maybe a WW after or even execute, and that's how you do burst
---
Google works well.
---
Not too sure on the tbc class balance when horde paladins are about 10 times stronger than alliance paladins
---
Is this English?
---
That's not the exact point im looking for, its a small bit! Depending on how the paper goes I can share it in the coming months,
---
which is why it's common for pug raiders to 'accidentally' dc or leaving for emergencies after winning an item. they're not even going to be able to roll on another item unless the group gets to domo. this is especially true for popular classes in the specific raid.
---
there is no incentive to continue.
---
Yeah everyone has nostalgia goggles on. I used to play on a PvP server in actual Vanilla, and I got corpse camped all the time. At flight paths, questing areas, instance entrances, etc. People are assholes, that hasn‚Äôt changed in the last 15 years.
---
Hordelets are indeed gonna be struggling with queues and an empty WPvP scene, yeah.
---
As a horde warlock at level 36, where should I be questing at this point? I have Badlands, Stv, and a few other places with quests.
---
Does earthbound stack with FR? If not how do you kite when there's also a slow on you?
---
Edit: wait are you telling me that spell batching let's you NS a bolt and chain together??
---
Spell hit isn't worth anywhere near the amount of spell damage it'd need to offset the low damage on the felheart robe unfortunately. Robe of winter night is better than the felheart chest.
---
&gt; Firemaw is an EU server.
---
It's .70 cents cheaper for US to play EU.
---
sure is, have em both on retail and classic, after jumping server every expac because of new friend groups, i got tired of trying to even make a name i like, and it's neat my guildies can actually see wich alts are mine when checking guild chat.
---
"just" 2:1 are insurmountable odds for any PvP encounter.
---
r/wowservers
---
I‚Äôm Horde and I think I‚Äôm the only one who reads all the quest text. I‚Äôm on PvE.
---
Over discord: "guys I lost internet sorry. I wont be able to log back on til next Tues, good luck wit the raid "
---
Yep. Anyone who blames Blizzard are still dreaming of a 50/50 split server when that's clearly never going to happen when Horde have a considerable racial imbalance for PvP. 
---
No, it has to be Blizzard's fault, rather than the playerbase knowing how to abuse a 15+ year old system that only existed in this form for about 6 weeks originally.
---
Idk if your pug is not hosted by complete strangers it's already incentive enough. I guess some pugs must be that horrible tho.
---
Where did I say I was unhappy with Classic?
---
There is a big chance Blizzard will introduce TBC after Classic (I hope with an option to stay in classic). I am looking forward to it.
---
I wanted orc male warlock named Obscurantist (my school nickname from times of counter strike and lineage 2) but it was taken so i created female undead named Obscura. Not the logic and dependency your survey results can show.
---
Ranking has nothing to do with the situation in question.
---
Spyclassic and a quest addons. Yup, typical horde noob xD
---
Just in case, what do you mean by mega server?
---
Having rank qualifies you to buy it, for gold. There is a vendor.
---
So I‚Äôm not entirely sure how vanilla world pvp once was since I was only 51 when BC came out.  Do you think it‚Äôs a lot worse this time around since people knew that horde had the better racials for pvp?  Why is there such a constant imbalance of more horde than alliance on most servers.   
---
Coming into classic, I assumed alliance would be the more popular faction.
---
Ally camp BRD pretty often as well.
---
Improved Shred is purely for cat form in dungeons, so I would ditch.
---
Natural weapons is good for dps / threat.
---
Omen of Clarity is good for dps in cat form and helps a bit with threat. 
---
Priority 1 - get to Feline Swiftness at level 20.
---
Priority 2 - get to FFF asap
---
Priority 3 - get your 31 point talent
---
Then you have a choice - Furor first or OoC first.  If you are focusing on tanking, then OoC first is probably better, but ymmv.
---
You seem to be struggling with the fact that it was not, in fact, this bad on vanilla. The reason everything is being camped now is because there are 10,000 players in a world designed for 2000
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem. I‚Äôm getting quite different numbers from the person who uploads our combatlog.
---
Just FYI I'm not reading your reply because you either lied or exposed your massive ignorance out of the gate.
---
No. PvP was not always like this because *there were literally never this many people on a realm in Vanilla*.
---
Try again when you can be honest and/or realistic. Tired of reading this fallacious bullshit.
---
They‚Äôre making Horde toons lol
---
Not at this rate. You cant compare getting camped occasionally in Vanilla to what is happening now. Its mechanical. It's not fun. Roaming around Feralas looking for Lvl 50s to kill 5v1 isn't even fun for the Horde. Its simply farming.
---
Horde or Ally?
---
I feel the opposite as a 53 horde priest...
---
I mean, I would at least partly blame all the people who shouted endlessly about how private servers could handle higher pops and Blizz should be able to, too.
---
Yet a majority of horse players will rationalize their griefing(this isn't wpvp it's griefing) any way they can.
---
In short, yes.
---
Long version: warriors have a distinct disadvanrage when it comes to mobility. Both your movement skills are offensive only, so if you get into a difficult situation you are going to have to corpserun. The Flipside of the medal is that you can tank, which makes finding a group rather easy.
---
The incentive is maybe being asked back for the next week? Reputation matters in the long term. If someone "disconnects" after winning an item in a PUG I'm running, they're not getting into the next one for sure.
---
Yeah, Blizzard is a small indie company after all, they got a lot to learn.
---
Wrong again? When was I wrong the first time? What I said stands correct. What you said was wrong lol
---
He said the b word! XD
---
Wow! I didn't know cave structures could be so extensive that they went into other zones. I looked around Stonard looking for a possible entrance.
---
And it's up to the devs to decide what's healthy for the game and what isn't just like they did with the looking for group addon.
---
 has come :)
---
I've played on both. Alliance have reason to be butthurt. If they don't fix the imbalance somehow, there won't be any more Alliance for Horde to camp.
---
No, lightning bolt has a travel time, chain lightning doesnt, if you CL NS LB ES all 3 hit at once
---
Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough.
---
It's easier if you can support with funds from a level 60. If it we're the other way around you'd have found the hunter a walk in the park
---
That‚Äôs fair. All I was saying was there was a ton of this happening in Vanilla too, a lot of people are acting like Vanilla was some grand utopia, where this shit barely happened.
---
Whats a matter?  You afraid of a 50/50 fight?
---
Except people are unsubbing? And if Classic begins to fail at drawing new players or even maintaining its current player base, Blizz will just tell the community "see - we told you" and that'll be it.
---
Servers that support the highest concurrent pop possible.
---
I don't know what the cap is on the current "full" servers, but fuck it. Bring even more people.
---
I know Nost capped at like 20k + concurrent, and I've seen comments about classic being 5k, but I have no idea if thats true or not.
---
I just want to see a shitton of peopl everywhere all the time.
---
MC takes me less than an hour. Your entire point was the current raids are possible in less than optimal gear. You also mentioned its "toxic" to ask someone who happens to be requesting a raid spot to come prepared... lmao
---
Oh, you aren't the person who I was talking to! Sorry, I haven't paid attention.
---
3 is possible when retaliation is off CD.
---
Mages have detect magic and frost/fire ward. Reflectors shouldnt be that big of an issue, even if you aren't paying attention.
---
&gt; It's actually sickening how obvious of a solution it is given that Blizzard won't even acknowledge a problem exists.
---
Yeah. A solution to make a whole bunch of Horde quit. Not reroll. 
---
1-60 is just a huge fucking deal, not to mention people who spent days worth of playtime farming single items like HoJ, SGC, Dal Rends, etc etc. 
---
It's not a solution if Blizzard thinks more would quit than move over, and if your answer is that's okay.. Why did we even go with larger server caps in the first place? Which is the root of the problem.
---
Ask yourself if this would be something that you would invest hundreds of gold in and buy yourself, before you buy your epic mount. If not? Then sell it.
---
Wrong, he had find minerals up. Thats an obvious sign you missed!
---
That's the proper attitude! However, the alliance which stayed is much more screwed now.
---
If they are run shittily...
---
I mean this is what game design is about, people like to be assholes, people like to be lazy.
---
Add in that it is a game, so people care less than IRL.
---
This is why game design is about making sure bad habits don't form by not rewarding bad habits, to promote "fair" play as much as possible when there is PvP, and to reward "good" play in PvE (IE no exploits).
---
Either way, soon there will just be Horde PvE servers and Alliance PvE servers once paid transfers open up. Or if it does not open up quickly enough, just from people quitting.
---
Carry some Limited invulnerability pots and just sheep warriors who fap. Wait out the duration and then just do what you would normally do.
---
There were &gt;4500 Alliance last week on honorspy.  For some reason I‚Äôm seeing way fewer this week, so either it‚Äôs bugged or the interest in pvp has died way down.  That said, anecdotally, I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference in pvp activity out in the world; it‚Äôs still as constant as ever.
---
I played a priest, but I was doing LBRS pretty easily and now you could do DME. I would wait a couple of levels for the rest.
---
Maybe once a week, not every time you res, and you can't even fly out of town because the FP is dead and town is camped and the GY has campers waiting for you to res. It was NEVER like this in real Vanilla.
---
Double the work, half the pay.
---
1. What are important/useful addons for Warlocks? PvE and Raiding
---
2. I saw lvl 60 Warlocks sacrificing Succubus for dungeons/raids, at which level should I do this too?
---
I have been destro lock for 15 years and still is in classic. Lv 49 lock is a lot of fun in pvp. You need to be 5/31/3. The best race to be is undead because of cannibalize, so you can life tap and just eat bodies.
---
Thanks.  Worried I made a bad choice due to all the gear dropping isn‚Äôt with int/stam/spirit.
---
That might depend on Leveling style. If you mix solo and group content, the time lost during solo is caught up with due to the ease of finding a group if you tank.
---
Aside from the idea of farming 2 items vs 1, 2x BSH is 26agi vs BB being 60AP 1crit.
---
For Hunters that is 60AP 1crit on the BB and BSH being 52AP (Potentially 57 with Kings) vs about .5 crit.
---
Even once the agi enchants are in the game BB is 110AP and about 1.5crit vs 112 (123 with kinggs) and about 1.1 crit.  Once the agi enchants are in dual BSH are slightly better, but the difference then will still be minimal.
---
Uh, or roll on a PvE server?
---
It's almost like the CFO mandating to cut costs wherever possible had a negative impact on the services they would provide.
---
Lol yeah. Level 40 mobs have just over 2k hp usually. A PVP geared warrior could easily push over 6k and if they have buffs like Mark+Fort+Kings+Well Fed, well over 7k hp.
---
if anything, paid transfers and/or free transfers to PvE servers should have been opened now to help this situation. Coupled with early release of BGs (IE not just 2 weeks from now)
---
But nope, won't happen.
---
Well, I‚Äôm not American (though I due currently live there) and you inability to argue without taking an aggressive stance towards an assumed nationality is even more pathetic than what you are attempting to accuse me of. A simple ‚Äúyou are wrong‚Äù should be enough for you to figure out how you are wrong, and others have also pointed out your flaws. I don‚Äôt need to argue with out, you are wrong, plain and simple. Pretending you don‚Äôt get how you are wrong and demanding that I explain it is a common internet technique used by those without intellectual prowess or wit. Someday perhaps you‚Äôll get there, or you won‚Äôt, in which case we‚Äôll keep laughing at you while we downvote and move on. 
---
Good luck out there, you‚Äôll need it!
---
There's a certain sense of community that is missed in a PvE server from my experience. Also, it allows for a certain level of accountability for your actions too.
---
However, with the player count, the issues with leveling that are much worse than I expected, and the sheer amount of people farming Honor, well if I'm being honest, I'm having second thoughts about rolling on PvP. I'm level 60, it's just the server is teeming with tryhards. It's not like 1 or 2 guilds on each faction, it's like everyone is holding everyone else to the highest standard.
---
I dont know. I do blame Blizzard for the severity of the farm because they didnt do progressive itemization, and that the battlegrounds haven't been introduced sooner. However, I know I signed up for the danger. It's just way worse than I thought, and as a prot warrior main, even at 60, holy shit is it rough out here.
---
Im not doing brd arena 100 times just to see the boss i want 5 times with maybe seeing the item im after once and loosing the roll, fuck that shit and fuck everyone who tries to tell me that i absolutely should farm it (especially if he isnt willing to help with it). ill get one of the easier to get alternatives or crafts.
---
Classic servers absolutely should have 19000 people. Or even more. I want a massive community. But there needs to be forced realm balance.
---
Holy cow, I never said it was exactly like this. I said ganking happened all the time. Some people act like it didn‚Äôt. Why are you just throwing words into my mouth?
---
Everyone I know who botted eventually got banned and lost hundreds or even thousands of hours of character progression and have all immensely regretted their decision to even try botting.
---
People that aren't obsessed with going as fast as possible and want to actually have some fun? You know, most people.
---
BC will be 90% horde, and most of those will be Blelves.
---
Cancel before they interrupt
---
Warstrike cape is best green melee cape by a long shot. Agi str and Stam and a lot of it
---
Well to be fair, the hobbits didn't take any actions so they would not have popped up on the nazghul's player list if they continued to do nothing.
---
Speedrunning is the lamest shit ever. Better jump in the comments!

RFC isn‚Äôt a significant dungeon at all..
---
He should‚Äôve moved on 100 kills ago lmao.
---
I read that instance lockouts are shared across battle net.
---
If you log into Two different ones you avoid that.
---
Oh you‚Äôre not wrong to a point, when it comes to things like Rag you kinda want your dps to be putting out as much as they can and have decent preBiS or BiS but yeah definitely better to enjoy playing than hate it because of a massive grind on a small upgrade etc, I‚Äôve just not got much else to do between raids besides level an alt and go for the few BiS pieces I can get outside of raids
---
Nah I'll raidlog til paid transfers. 
---
Enjoy your de facto PvE server and longass BG queues, toots.
---
Mana pots and demonic runes saves you some GCDs = best damage gain
---
68% Alliance
---
It's okay to be bad. Just don't lie to yourself about it. Only makes you look more sad
---
I had a lot of fun online. I don't even play wow anymore but I got a good laugh out of this
---
It is what it is. But I‚Äôve stopped questing so I‚Äôve taken a hit on leveling
---
Because you're comparing Classic to Vanilla corpse camping?
---
This kills me everytime I read it lmao
---
He doesn‚Äôt get it. Hey everyone, he doesn‚Äôt even know üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Resilience gear made me quit TBC.  I spent a lot of time farming high level dungeons and heroics to gear up only to get my face smashed in by a fully geared hunter in his gladiator set.  The fight wasn‚Äôt even close and I was killed as if I was 10 levels below him when we were both max level.  Not only that, but he camped my corpse for about 40 min.  I then went into town and watched a duel between a fully gladiator geared pally and a rouge in raid epics.  I watched as the Pally stood there and healed every few seconds through all the damage the rouge was doing.  It then dawned on me how busted resilience gear was.  I logged off and never logged back in.
---
I love the argument people make of ‚Äúbut this info is already available to you in the log!‚Äù Like anyone is reading the combat log and scanning for the names of enemy players that used stealth nearby. It‚Äôs like saying aimbot it‚Äôs not cheating in an FPS because the ability to click on the opponent is already in the game. Yeah sure it‚Äôs in the game but it makes it so easily accessible that it‚Äôs crossing the line.
---
Although tbf stealth is also kinda broken in classic, I don‚Äôt love that the class that can stunlock can also get a free uncontested opener in most cases.
---
LBRS is definitely doable at your level. I'd wait till at least like 58 before trying Strat or Scholo though.
---
PAOK
---
The absolute state of this subreddit
---
Orcs are really only important vs rogues. After that it varies by class.
---
If you have a stun trinket for your class then orcs become a lot less important as most classes only have one, or two with engineering (which is a whole other can of worms) stuns. 
---
A LOT of classes have slows. Lock (sometimes), rogue, mage, warriors, hunters, and all of those classes are matchups that, for example, warriors suddenly become even with if they aren‚Äôt perma kited with slows. 
---
Hardiness is great but this subreddit overrates it hard as fuck. Like, nobody ever talks about priests being difficult to stun but orcs are made of rock or some shit, definitely just feels like a circlejerk.
---
If only games were about having fun, in whichever way anyone deems fit. Or is your grind for BiS gear helping you work your way through college?
---
Like I said, it is the same exact thing but up to scale and I was on moonguard in the beginning, its just something were gonna have to get used to.
---
I didn't say that, and I don't believe in classic most people are choosing based on looks. They probably did in 2004, but even in 06 when I started it was all this racial, that racial, should have went horde, should have went gnome, etc. The way you phrase it, yes that sounds fairly cringey. But since I didn't say that, I'll leave that opinion on your shoulders. What I said was, the two sides have different cultures that can be observed and certain tendencies extrapolated.
---
Im right there right ya buddy, I was pumped for LOTR
---
I‚Äôd think on the most hardcore guilds you would want everyone with an alt so you can gear mains twice as fast.  20 mains and 20 alts then go with the roles switched next raid and the mains get two raids worth of loot while the alts only get left overs.
---
Factually incorrect. It could detect people on their mount travelling past you or players on flight paths going over you.

---
If only someone had tried to create attention to this issue earlier, then maybe Blizz would have done something about it.
---
Oh, wait.
---
The game is fucked now, there is no fix, they will never be able to sort the issue. Maybe faction transfer can alleviate the issue somewhat, but faction queue is an absolute no-go.
---
Probably not. The less time they spend playing, the more time they'll spend crying on forums.
---
cross realm doesn't mean all servers will cross, they will be doing battle groups just like they did in vanilla, and even if they didn't having the majority of servers leaning horde means there is always going to be more horde then alliance queuing, so hordes queuing will be out hunting, the alliance numbers of people in the open world will fall because they will stay in the capital cities insta joining BG's and the WPVP situation will get worse.
---
Yo your name is fire, french metal band? But yeah I don‚Äôt know why people are acting like this wasn‚Äôt happening just because there were less players... Kinda shows you who knows what going on actually.
---
I played vanilla on Gorefiend, a PvP server.  It was nowhere near as bad, for a number of reasons.
---
Foremost, the server total population was generally substantially lower (I believe they have said 5000 in vanilla, 4x higher in Classic?).
---
There was much less organized PvP in Classic, you didn't have nonstop camping of flight paths- it happened, but it was infrequent enough, and usually only be one or two players, that it wasn't a considerable risk to take a flight path unless you had been told the FP was being camped.  Getting to BRM was not a concern, it wasn't uncommon to not see a single opposing faction member until inside, and they were likely just there to go to one of the instances themselves.  Some rogues would gank, but again, it was infrequent.
---
The population imbalance was not this severe, it was closer to 60/40 horde/alliance.  Now, with some servers being 80/20 or 90/10, instead of it being along the lines of 3000 horde to 2000 alliance, it's now closer to \~ 16000 horde to 4000 alliance.
---
Combine all of those, and it was nowhere near this bad.
---
Games arnt about having fun. There‚Äôs a goal and you accomplish it. Walking around looking at things is not a goal in this game.
---
Yesss :D Hadn't even thought of it in this way ahaha. Glooorious.
---
Zug zug
---
It is. I'm just dead.
---
&gt; By that metric every add-on is cheating. 
---
Well yeah
---
I post a thread like that, you should read the comments, these people feel personally attacked if you tell them that.
---
Dude I don‚Äôt know why everyone on reddit has to feel like they either need the last word or correct eachother when I played dude alliance would camp the SHIT out of the crossroads flight master and quest givers and all, its literally NO different just a new generation complaining about being camped.
---
oh yeah for real. I had no idea they were even a thing till I started browsing this sub and saw just a few of the crap you could do. It's insane what they allow you do it.
---
Slower, higher top end weapon will give more rage on the opening hit.  Generally want to favor weapons with high top end because most classes will kite you and every hit must count.  For melee classes like warriors or rogues who have fast attacks you want to joust them with hamstring or switch to the best sustained dps.
---
I would be like 99% certain the limited initial list wasn't a cost decision. I think somehow their data actually led them to underestimate demand that badly.
---
Vorosh vs Jamalz never forget
---
realm balance doesn't solve the issues caused by putting 19,000 players on a map designed for 5,000. They tried to put 20 gallons of shit in a 5 gallon bucket, it was a bad idea from the start and they did it anyway because it was cheaper and they didn't believe classic would be successful.
---
&gt;This is not how things are supposed to be working.
---
They looked at private servers and saw how successful they were with the much higher population (which Is something I 100% agree with).
---
The difference was that private servers always tried to promote faction balance AND they always had the server stats publicized so everyone could see the ratio.
---
So if people saw the serve was 45/55 A/H, they would pick alliance. Or the server would simply not allow  people to pick the majority faction until another player joined the alliance to maintain equilibrium.
---
Blizz has done absolutely nothing, and even worse they have tried to break census addons to hide the infomation even further.
---
They should publicize the fucking stats, and if they are too scared to show playernumbers they could at least show percentiles.
---
What spec are you? Elemental and enhance play very differently but either way you should be able to sustain yourself decently. Are you using a shield vs warriors? Are you just wearing PvE gear with no stamina? Need more info before giving real advice
---
&gt;  Anyone who blames Blizzard
---
ye, blizz didnt fuck up several times at all nor they didnt make the situation worse with their actions. holy shit, some blizzard apologists are next level delusional. 
---
is your brain even capable of thinking that the current situation is the result of multiple factors with fuck ups from the multiple parties involved? guess what, if we made a flow chart of fuck ups, the first 3 boxes would all be blizzards fuckup. is the community helping now? no, did they try at before release? yes. did blizz listen? no.
---
Why is it you don't see Alliance 10 man ganking BRM every day, yet they collectively have more honour than the horde?
---
Maybe you wouldn't be a grunt if you got out of BRM and actually went for proper world pvp where you get more than the 5 honour you get split between your 10 man group corpse camping.
---
RIP
---
Well you still haven't been killed as many times as an alliance trying to make it to BRM
---
It absolutely lets you do that.  In vanilla the #2 rogue complaint was that pets would consistently be impossible to stealth against if they had an attack command on you.  If the enemy issued the attack command before you were fully stealthed, then it would come and hit you no matter what and no stealth or vanish could stop it.  
---
This addon lets you do the exact same thing still.  It shows you when someone uses stealth within 50 yards and all you have to do is issue a pet command during that window and the person will be unable to utilize stealth at all because the pet will come find them.  
---
You're playing a shaman.  Perhaps they should make totem stomp macros a thing again.
---
this guy plays SL lock and only counts 1v1s, not all the times he gets rolled and does 0 damage

Ya it‚Äôs really just about balancing your HP, armor and crit. You really can‚Äôt go too far in one direction without gimping your damage or survivability 
---
Currently I use savage glad chain, eldritch leggings, omokk‚Äôs or Brigam girdle for hit/crit, and stronghold gaunts/flame guard in place of tier gear. I like the extra crit i get with this setup.
---
I love the value you get out of might bracers, and helm of might/wrath in those slots. You get like 500-600 hp just from those slots, in exchange for 2-3% crit that you get back with the other pieces I mentioned above. Seems like a good trade off to me.
---
&gt;Many people chose their faction because they prefer their lore, asthetic, etc.
---
And by "lore" you mean the stun resistance buff orcs get. Lets be honest this has nothing to do with lore and everything to do with the WPVP tryhards rolling the race with the best racial perks.
---
And that's why I think Classic+ could be a good idea for the future of Classic
---
They already nerfed it to the point that it's almost useless, everyone in this thread apparently missed the memo.
---
I'm on Pagle.  What is this Gnomerthon, of which you speak?? üò±
---
Lbrs and Dm east, maybe west will be fine. Scholo can be pretty hard and I‚Äôd suggest 58, same for strat although I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs easier.
---
Lol, the problems are not because of player skill and were in the game 15 years ago just more apparent now.
---
Compounded by Blizzard treating this game like they haven't had 15 years to refine their launch.

---
let me guess, female undead spriest?
---
Well the inballance reason is not a social aspect. In that regard it would be very equal. But looking at retail for instance. EVERY pve guild for many expansions rolled horde because of the racials, mainly the troll racial, and mythic+ groups for the blood elf racial. And for a very long time pvpers mainly rolled human because of their trinket racial so they could use double damage trinket. This applies to classic aswell Orc racial is just nuts for the time beeing. Now for how p2 and honor system has worked out, alliance has rolled horde on pvp servers so they can actually play the game, or they started on a pve server, where alliance is totally dominating.
---
I can confirm that me and my friends really are considering dropping our alliance 60s to play horde, most of us raid and are getting pretty well geared. Reason is that Horde is camping every zone, fp, boat etc. The only safe place is IF/SW. And it might seem like we are chickening out, but we find it boring to do pvp in raid groups, and doing it in groups of five is suicide. We get mowed over by 40 hordes and camped even if the deminishing return is in full motion.
---
Some of us alliance specifically went ally for shorter BGs queues and greater dominance in group settings with Paladins. Fail to see how that‚Äôs dumb as most of the PvP in this game will be in a group setting in BGs.... 
---
Also, you should be thankful people actually rolled alliance so you can fight people with your OP Orc racial
---
People aren't going to "get used to it". It's either going to get better or people are going to leave. It's just that simple dude.
---
there is a window you can earn. The casuals who play in the mornings are having their honor count. And the neckbeards who play all night are not having it count.
---
thats.... why Im not not in a pretending-to-be-hardcore guild (thats actually just no-life guild) and dont have to stress about some make-believe BiS lists from icy-veins or wherever that seemingly everyone follows like Quran. life is sweet.
---
Yeah they really fucked up in the start when they gave EU 3 PVP (english servers, not including german, french, russian) at launch. Even a small country like my own (Norway) had enough people waiting to fill a entire server...
---
Blood elves will absolutely fuck faction balance. Also most daily quest fucking suck.
---
" Yeah. A solution to make a whole bunch of Horde quit. Not reroll. "  
---
And the current situation has alliance quitting, so you can either fix it now and lose some horde who might quit or might re-roll, and get the alliance back, or we can keep going the server pops will get to be more and more one sided until horde start quitting anyway because "the servers dead why can't I find any alliance to kill and the BG queues are too long"
---
Dense Dynamite works on the stun-immune targets. Doesn't work on Fire Elementals.
---
Goblin Sapper Charge is what you use on most AOE fights.
---
I agree here. I use it to know when I'm in danger of getting ganked. I know if someone pops up on my addon, I'm on theirs. If they out-level the area or if it is a group of horde, I'm out. Although with the range change it probably won't help much with that anymore.
---
.
---
I literally explicitly said I‚Äôm not suggesting anyone take people in quest greens. This is a straw man. Learn to read.
---
What happens if an orc/human war uses edgemasters? Is that over excessive or do you only need like 3% hit to be capped?
---
Puissant is insanely better but it‚Äôs so hard to get a world boss kill I‚Äôd just grind out the baron cape it also looks amazing btw:)
---
I‚Äôm on Grob as well, and it‚Äôs not any better for horde, I can‚Äôt do quests in EPL because ally have a raid group at Lights Hope 24/7, it takes me 1/2 hour to get to UBRS or MC from the PvP.  Last night all I wanted to do was a DM run and a bunch of ally in epics some with legendaries came and killed my group then proceeded to corpse camp us for an hour.
---
alot of Private servers did release BGs at the same time as they released the honor system though, wich was more okay.
---
Classic concurrent online cap is around 6k.
---
Nobody is saying you should pop flasks in dungeons, and using them in dungeons doesn't magically mean you're going to not have them in BWL.
---
Because honestly fuck starting over just because Blizzard screwed up the game.
---
At 36 I was doing Desolace, STV, and getting involved in SM runs. Library and Cathedral have some good drops for us, basically the last blues before you start getting +spell damage gear in your mid-40s with ZF and Shadoweave Set
---
In my experience this simply is not true.  I've been out with Alliance groups and we're doing well.  We get steamrolled here and there of course, but we also hold our own.  I don't see any marked difference from last week.
---
I recently started seeing a guy, who unfortunately is the definition of the this. To snobby proportions.  I was really excited when I found out that we both played classic, but then once I watched him play during a raid, sadly I lost 100% of my interest of ever joining a raid with him.  He might be one of the most judgmental players I've ever met.
---
It's 57% horde 43% alliance.
---
I know it seems implausible. But if every alliance character logged off for 3 days. There would not be any mass pvp anymore. Very few people are willing to sit around and do nothing for hours. Currently though, there‚Äôs still enough of a trickle of alliance to warrant the horde presence in BRD.
---
They are never going to show this data. Retail has been long time denying faction imbalance and this affected classic wow as well.
---
I'm not gonna listen to a rich person offer bootstrap solutions to the poor and I'm not gonna listen to a Horde player offer solutions on dealing with server shutdowns.
---
This reinforces the theory that Boomerism knows no age.
---
Except you can literally see that all 3 accounts are on the exact same computer and have the exact same inputs. Multiboxing has been banned on most private servers. Blizzard has the technology to prevent multi boxing they just choose not to
---
You sound like the biggest god dam baby ever. Are you 12 cause they that would make sense. Here's an idea little bud, if you stop sucking then YOU can be the one to kill the other players. Crazy I know wow mind blown right.
---
Ironforge.pro yeah
---
Automating actions for the player are illegal per TOS. Stop whining because your cheating addon is that. For cheating. Get over it and whine more
---
Just merge Heartseeker with every server, so it can be 70% horde like God intended.
---
But it‚Äôs safer to believe that 15% of a faction would up and quit in a week? And just because it‚Äôs a expectation doesn‚Äôt make it a reality.
---
The amount of people who can raid lead makes that number even smaller.
---
Thats not bad, but I wouldn't mind if they trippled it.
---
The Horde on Herod have been making playing outside of raid night / large groups nearly impossible without dying a hundred times to get anywhere. It's really bad. There's always at least 10-15 Horde for every 1 Alliance.
---
Ya I'm sure I just need to hit the dojo to learn how to win those 15v1s at the flight path. 
---
You sound demented.
---
&gt; which is why it's common for pug raiders to 'accidentally' dc or leaving for emergencies after winning an item
---
thats why most raid reset +1 at majordomo
---
Don't tell me not to do what I can't not do when I don't wanna!
---
Oh man if only there was a server type where people from other factions couldn't block you from accessing content by killing you.
---
I have a 60 druid main and a 25 mage alt, however I kinda dislike mage mechanics and I reaaaally want to play a pure DPS class in endgame. So i thought about trying a warlock.
---
My questions are:
---
- How hard/slow leveling is?
---
- Is prebis gearing easy or a grind?
---
- Is pet management a chore?
---
- Are there good solo gold farming methods for warlocks in endgame?
---
- Am i gonna be relevant throughout entire classic as dmg dealer?
---
gfy
---
Res was fucking amazing.
---
It meant you could actually just pvp and wouldn't be at too much of a disadvantage if you didn't do pve.
---
Salty cheaters in this thread. 
---
There always are.
---
Grenades no. A good mage keeps you more than a 3 sec slowed walk away. Grenades plus fap maybe. If mage doesn‚Äôt have their own fap to break the hamstring.
---
Goblin rocket helm is a different thing. It‚Äôs outrageously strong and will definitely force a block but it‚Äôs a 20 min cd and you‚Äôre still going to lose the duel after the block so save it for a lock that you might actually kill üëç
---
Being on ally I‚Äôve noticed alliance players tend to be on very late/early whichever way you wanna look at it. Prime time has more horde but a lot more alliance in off hours
---
i doubt it'll be as bad as people say on here, but it'll be substantial if retail is anything to go off of then expect a 20-25 minute queue as horde with a less than 5 minute or instant one as alliance
---
the queues could go up or down depending on the total classic population, but it's just a fact that alliance queues will 99% be shorter
---
Why did they make the world then? They should just make a big hallway with the error texture from Gmod and then you press 100 buttons in the correct order and the error texture boss has a 12% chance to drop bis gear for you. Then you rinse and repeat every week.
---
Ok.
---
dont argue with these idiots, they have this specific scenario in their mind where they are correct and that doesnt allow to process any outside information nor reasoning.
---
that's my issue with big guilds. they talk all this shit about preparation and then don't lift a finger to help people get raid ready. i'm not talking about carrying people, but there should be someone in leadership who is at least scheduling dungeon runs for people and having at least a couple high ranks helping lead people through that content. one, it helps them get to know players and how well they listen. two, it helps build teams of people who then go and help each other out. so many guilds have the same problem as so many corporations and other institutions, i got mine, so fuck you.
---
Are you actually implying majority of ally plays without spy and/or any quest addon? Funny guy.
---
Fuck me it's been a long time since I played. I think Helm's Deep was a new thing when I quit.
---
Eveyone is favoured against warriors.
---
This Reddit is just swarmed with butt hurt alliance players that need to cry at every turn. Even though Alliance dominated PVP servers aren't as common as horde it's the same shit on every dominant server, this type of "WPvP" crap isn't faction exclusive by any stretch lol
---
Classic has an amusing amount of people who consider themselves hardcore and consider classic as hardcore when it's actually the easiest the game ever was.
---
I can only play overnight, sadly horde never sleeps.
---
Lmaooooooo
---
As someone with a 60 in both PvP and PvE I highly recommend it. I get the best of both worlds and I never dislike when I get ganked because of it because then I just switch over. If I want to PvP I go back. I‚Äôm on a horde dominated server on my PvP so it‚Äôs really nice to have both. This way I don‚Äôt hate the game ever
---
&gt;Retail has been long time denying faction imbalance
---
Yeah, but it doesn't matter at all on retail. Like nobody gives a fuck about the other faction, wpvp is non existent and its disconnected layering mess.
---
Its only in vanilla people care about factions, that shit will go straight out of the window as soon as TBC is launched and will never become an issue again (because alliance stops being a faction in TBC, lol), and then recover somewhat in wrath with the massive racial buffs. But it doesn't really impact the gameplay in the same way because there is no wpvp (again, alliance will get exterminated when flying is added, and there will only be faction servers).
---
If they go with TBC that is, which I don't want personally.
---
ITT undead spriests: salty XD
---
This is my first time properly playing wow, I tried free trial retial at multiple points - it ultimately felt like a chore of ticking boxes. While I think classic is horribley  balanced and some gameplay aspects have aged like meth addicts, at it's core it has a unrivalled experience in exploration mixed with natural community interaction.
---
No one said that classic was dying.
---
The alliance server on many PvP servers is, though.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dx9x97/really_good_tool_for_determining_the_most/
---
Almost every pug I know has a reset at domo and roll out BoE pieces at the end which gives lots of incentive to stay. 
---
\+1 just evens out loot more, it makes freshly dinged players able to get a decent item like sorc blade easily, and gives geared players a good chance on that one item they need. Eventually people will start doing soft reserve runs, which kinda sucks for fresh players but gives huge help to get that last piece or two.
---
Oh I used to do the insane farming in vanilla. 50 runs each for t0 helmet, legs and chest just so i could comlete the t0,5 and let me tell you, getting people to run 50 fucking full UBRS runs was annoying, noone was interested in drakkisath when t0,5 was released. I also farmed argend dawn rep through cauldrons and was solo farming cenarion rep so I could craft nr gear for the guild (only for ungrateful guildies bitching I dont provide the items with my mats for free, because its "for the guild" ...)
---
But Im not 19, living at campus anymore. I dont have time for it and neither enjoy this kind of gaming anymore.
---
Also its funny, people bitch about retail how it feels like chore to run those m+ and do world quests, but seemingly dont have a problem with running 100s of dungeon runs for that one item...
---
Plenty of addons automate actions which isn't banned yet. It's not as simple as "herp derp I don't like it and it automates x part of the game, therefore it's going against the ToS"
---
None of you were crying when NPCScan did the same thing.
---
I mean I get pretty dickhard about PvP and got my shit pushed in for hours last week by 5 separate groups of horde (6-12 players per group) camping my group of 4. It was honestly like they had a truce and just rotated who would kill us until we were all worth no honor to them. 
---
Kinda said fuck it after we finally escaped and found a different zone only for pretty much the same thing to happen again. 
---
The risk/reward simply isn‚Äôt there for me and my friends, at least. Not everyone is like us, but I would consider us to trend towards more hardcore players but we aren‚Äôt absolute sweats
---
Nah only two of our warriors have savage glad chain, myself and another. I‚Äôm more concerned with making sure they are hit capped, spec for raid, and bring consumes. All of those are far more important than the upgrade to SGC.
---
do you think you are entitled to more than 1 loot per raid ?
---
I found that was the case when I played private servers a couple years back. To get into any mc raid you were expected to have full bis and enchants. The content is so easy it‚Äôs ridiculous to expect people to put that much effort into getting geared. I‚Äôve not encountered the issue since classic came out but I may just be lucky to have found a guild that isn‚Äôt full of spergs.
---
Aq and naxx won't be hard.
---
They'll be probably on the level of normal raids in retail in a vacuum, but since we'll probably be going into them in all bis from previous raids, they'll both be a cakewalk.
---
These people are crazy. Someone in the comments literally said games aren‚Äôt about having fun, they‚Äôre about accomplishing goals and that you aren‚Äôt supposed to explore the huge open world they made.
---
You aren‚Äôt accomplishing anything playing this game. You‚Äôre just wasting your life on entertainment. If you want to accomplish goals, work on getting an advanced degree.
---
Maybe, but I'll still get hit harder at evening than at 3am.  60 allies complain endlessly about horde but have no qualms delving deep into the farthest corners of EPL to dogpile levelling chars.
---
I‚Äôll show myself out
---
You don't generally theorycraft PvP in the same way you would PvE, the encounters/thresholds for success and fail are very different. As a general rule of thumb you're just going for Plate gear (due to the associated armor value) with as much Stamina and Intel as you can find, with Stamina having a higher value than Intel. Spell power still gives you the same benefit you'd otherwise get from PvE (for Spell Power stacking) but the rarity of Plate gear with Spellpower is why you're in non-plate to begin with (for PvE). If you're doing your role well though a bulk of your mana is going to be spent casting Cleanse and various Blessings (and not just pure healing) which does reduce the value of Spell Power.
---
You want a Thorium Shield Spike on your shield and (ideally) you have a shield with +% block chance (not block value, block chance). That'd generally mean a [Barrier Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18499/barrier-shield) from Dire Maul. If you have Engineering and can afford a [Force Reactive Disk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18168/force-reactive-disk) then you grab one of those (though technically someone would have needed to do MC to get the recipe) because of how the shield works. By the time AQ rolls around (in the distant future) you'll be using a [Jagged Obsidian Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22198/jagged-obsidian-shield). You don't need to (and will very likely swap during combat) have a shield out at all times, you will have the equivalent of stance-dancing between a sword_&amp;_board and a 2Hander, especially if you've taken Reckoning talents in Prot. You just transition between them as the situation dictates.
---
The blue and epic pvp sets have different (set pieces required) to get the bonuses (4 vs 3) but you can still get your -10 seconds on HoJ at any rate. Whilst your gear does matter (as far as keeping you alive is concerned) getting the PvP set items is just a question of time/perseverance due to the ranking system.
---
I got it:
---
Make Heartseeker a PvP realm.
---
Merge it with Stalagg.
---
Tell the Alliance players they are roleplaying the First War as thousands of Horde swarm into Stormwind.
---
Instant legend. Followed by massive unsubbing.
---
That‚Äôs a huge red flag. If he‚Äôs shitty to people in a casual entertainment setting, run.
---
Incendius here. Kill some orcs for me while you‚Äôre at it.
---
It's probably satisfying deleting a target.
---
Like how this comment will be deleted later. Not going to have a downvoted achieved comment for answering a question.
---
The problem is... what exactly? That there's Alliance on a PVP server?
---
Are you wanting a PVP server with 0 Alliance and only Horde then?
---
Did you even watch the clip? The shaman didn't use a single ability.
---
Him saying a lvling priest want +heal while lvling so he can downrank... My oh my.
---
i actually find a decent amount of non zerg wpvp on herod. lots of 1v1s and group fights. it's still a clown fiesta though, but nobody should be surprised.
---
unless of course you're an idiot like yourself.
---
but go ahead and tell me again how populations are tripled on classic compared to vanilla like it's some recent discovery.
---
&gt; how amazing escape artist is? Dwarf form? Fear ward?
---
To be fair, those racials are really good. But kind of niche in comparison.
---
Fear ward for instance, being amazing in PvE, it can be dispelled in PvP (unlike WotF that you just use when you are already feared). Stone form, again its great. But very niche vs rogues only. Escape artist also might not be enough for gnomes rogues/warriors to beat mages as they have multiple frost novas/slows etc.
---
However, paladins + warriors is a win combo in most situation, that is unstoppable. And paladins are by far the best PvP healers due to bubble, and being to wear plate to be tanky as fuck. Their auras are also great since they can just switch for every situation.
---
But thats only in vanilla, it goes to fucking shit in TBC.
---
A lot of those things also apply to classic.  Except classic content requires less mechanics and classes are 1 button bots. 
---
The thing that makes classic fun is no Sharding, no cross server, which creates community.
---
I opened my comment addressing my perspective without any mention of the cheating discussion until after I made my point. How could you possibly take issue with that?
---
Second best *
---
Furor is insane
---
How is announcing you have a balanced server going to make it unbalanced?
---
Sell it and buy DM tribute staff at 58 for 30g
---
It wasn‚Äôt changed for instances iirc.
---
I would wait for Shadowlands to release, then look up some reviews and decide based on that. There will be comparisons between retail and classic for sure as they try to draw some features inspired by classic (like focusing back on class not spec identity).  
---
90 is quite a lot to bet on a chance of you liking it. Why not wait for the reviews and pay 50 after you know if it something you would like?  
---
The extra stuff they are offering are there to lure you into buying it now when you are not sure if you like it or not and the extras are really worth nothing in terms of enjoying the game.
---
I noticed this as well while watching a streamer yesterday on faerlina as well, although I'm yet to experience it on my own server.  
---
Either way, this is absolutely unacceptable in a game so community focused.   
---
Blizz' silence on a lot of these issues is scary. I understand not giving into demands for change, but gameplay issues and bugs like this being ignored is unacceptable.
---
&gt; You know, maybe the game design, content quantity and release cycles weren't calibrated to satisfy the apparently enormous amount of neckbeards who blast through the content at ludicrous speed because they treat this game like a full time (or more) job and as their One True Source of Fulfillment.
---
These people are such a small minority of people, though. I can't speak for all the players on Faerlina, but I'm in a raiding guild and we have a lot of people nearing 2 level 60 characters at this point, who all have full-time jobs and some of them are even married. 
---
Maybe you just don't play the game very efficiently. There's really not a whole lot to be doing in the game. Like level to 60, farm pre-bis for raid, and then raid every week. PvP is like the only thing between all that to do.
---
this happens sometimes when you submit a ticket and it gets closed out, they ask you if your problem was solved etc.
---
its like when you go grocery shopping and they ask you to fill out a survey at the bottom of the receipt
---
i've been leveling a rogue on Fairbanks and I saw at least 4 in Stonetalon, 3 in Hillsbrad and a few more on Arathi and Barrens, it's insane
---
While your opinion may be valid on a fresh player, there are people with 2+ 60s on this server. Alt gear is in high demand. That aside, why initiate discussion and then put the person on ignore. 
---
The people who send tells like this seem to have the thinnest skin.
---
no u
---
even if tbc was as bad as you say it is, I would still prefer it just because they actually made hybrid dps and non-war tanks NOT SUCK and freed the options for pure dps aswell.
---
classic+ that would include the revapmed talent trees (probably cut off at 31pointer) would be maybe the best solution, but I will never support classic+ going forward without massive changes to hybrids, it was a disgrace 15 years ago how most classes were pigeonholed into one spec for the entirety of vanilla and it shouldnt be the case going forward.
---
Funny thing is... Ppl from retail were talking about how wpvp got messed up and had to add extra guards on Marshall's refuge and stuff.  Much of what's going on in classic was actually predicted by retail players and not retail players alike.  History seems to be repeating itself.  Classic needs to break off of #nochanges and take the good elements from both vanilla and retail and... Maybe even new ideas.
---
I mean I‚Äôve been in a mythic raiding guild before in retail where we also pushed high level keystones for m+. I‚Äôve definitely been in a position before where I‚Äôve had to tell people they need to work on x y or z of they won‚Äôt be able to kill the bosses or push the key levels they say they want to do. I mean you know it‚Äôs bad when you have someone in the top 2% of the item levels for their spec and they‚Äôre performing in the bottom 40%.
---
And I don‚Äôt enjoy having to tell people that, so I usually just don‚Äôt play with people that need to be told that they need to improve unless they are willing to actually listen and improve.
---
But with classic wow the skill ceiling just isn‚Äôt there. Just tell the frost mage to cast frost bolt. Just tell the rogue to hit the enemy and keep up slice and dice. There‚Äôs no reason to hassle players unless their performance is shit and in classic that‚Äôs a super easy fix. Using the right spell and right level spell, and item stats. Congrats, your performance is now less shit.
---
If everyone has the same tools, is it OP?
---
Earthshaker. Same roots, but way more advanced now.
---
Then uninstall yours. If it doesn't give an absurd advantage in PVP, then you wont mind playing without it.
---
This website is extremely unreliable, I'm actually embarrassed so many people think those stats are true
---
My server is 35/65 in Horde favor. When someone of them manages to kill my resto druid they corpse camp with 5 rogues at entrance and 5-8 other Horde hiding inside at max res distance from either side of BRD entrance tunnel from burning steppes. I died 9 times while guild killed 2 bosses in MC leaving only Ragnaros for me to participate.
---
Recently our guild merged with other moving RT from 20:00 PM up to 18:00 PM. Me and couple of guys are getting late now and theese raids of gankers make this lagging behind even worse.
---
I will level new main on PvE server instead of looking for new static on slowly dying server.
---
Just farm SM then. Should be at least 40g/h.
---
Any healing is ok to go disc, many say 500 though
---
It‚Äôs entirely tru on an optimized group. However when pugging you need to take into account the idiot debuff and it‚Äôs negative effects on mana.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm saying. You just no life random shit that takes forever for the sake of taking forever.
---
\*dead human
---
Final Boss eats those nerds for breakfast
---
I didn't know NA has it too up until now it's been EU complaints only, so I assumed it has something to do with their europeans servers. Perhaps it's just a very very shitty bottleneck on the chat system on high pop servers, so only the big eu servers and faerlina has experienced it. Hard to say.
---
Blizzard should have forced faction balance when people created characters.
---
thats exactly what im using aswell, chain and strongholds, omokk etc.But thats because im not a mt and dont want to spend dkp on tank gear. But its total garbage compared to tier tank gear.Its not even comparable.
---
How do you not see the irony of commenting this
---
Ok let you calculate dps charts manually. Dps charts are cheating.
---
Yeah I can tell things are goin great on Herod since you're here trying to convince people everything is swell.
---
Cope harder, bunky.
---
ITT: 4,000+ people who don't realize Blizzard already nerfed the spy addon.
---
BG's cant come sooner...
---
People like to bitch.
---
On the contrary, there's been some tremendous work in the way of making shaman tanks compete with threat/survival, check out Caperfin's guide on shaman tanking. If you put all things on the table the difference of a warrior vs a shaman is minimal.
---
Yeah I thought it was an EU thing as well, but was watching a stream yesterday of someone running a dungeon and it taking a full 5 minutes before their party chat would show up. I figured it was a population size issue as well, but even if that's the case, it's an awful excuse, especially for them to be silent so long.
---
Does anyone know whats the fastest /played to level 40, or 50 is?
---
You're right about that faction balance.
---
But the wpvp who cares honestly, like it's going so well in classic wow huh?
---
Wrong. DPS chart addons do not give me an advantage economically or in combat against other players. Try again.
---
Also if you have buffs on, when you enter range of the combat log, the buffs are "applied" to you from our perspective and thus you are visible.
---
Resilience should only have affected gameplay in arenas and battlegrounds though.  If you're in the open-world in pvp you should get decimated by someone in full raid epics.
---
An extra 2k mana to your healers is pretty useful, also not that hard to farm if you have a team.  It is precisely for lesser geared ppl that flasks are meant for.   The village called...
---
"Sorry for bad english" then proceeds to use the word "imminent" and also writes in better English than half of the US population.
---
Dishonor points needs to be reintroduced to make the game more balanced. 
---
Oh you just started an attack on someone who was 6 levels below you? Dishonor!
---
Just ganked someone who had less than 20% life? Dishonor!
---
Just killed someone who was ressed 20 seconds ago? Dishonor!
---
Make the player actually use their brains  a bit they want to succeed.
---
&gt; A player isn't aggressive or not aggressive based on their faction. 
---
There's. All Horde questing is focused on killing Alliance NPC. Especially Undead quests, but in Barrens there's plenty quests that require you to kill dwarfs and Theramore guards.  
---
Thirsifal Glades, Hillsbrad, Arathi - all of them.  
---
So what do you expect from player who was taught to kill Alliance NPC all the time, will do at level 60?
---
Telling someone to re-roll isn't an answer. It puts fault on the player, rather than Blizzard addressing the underlying issue.
---
Some of us like PVP where the world feels dangerous. But extreme faction imbalance and try hard PVPers are making the game unplayable.
---
Having portals to everywhere in Dalaran huh? Lol.
---
THE JOKE 
---
oldun62
---
I'm still playing and I absolutely agree.
---
Shadow priests in raids are still pretty iffy due to the taking up debuff slots. They‚Äôre probably there to boost warlock damage if you have one.
---
This would ruin your queue
---
I understand that you don't like it. For me it's exactly what I expected from rolling on a pvp server. What were your expectations? Why didn't you roll on a pve server. Pvp server = constant warzone per definition, as alliance you are almost always outnumbered.
---
Nah, I‚Äôll be finding paladins just because they have an aura on
---
&gt; I would still prefer it just because they actually made hybrid dps and non-war tanks NOT SUCK and freed the options for pure dps aswell.
---
‚ÄãNon-war tanks still suck pretty hard. Druids can off-tank bosses, paladins are great for AoE. But you would still prefer warrior in almost any situation due to their superior threat generation. Pallys might be better in 5 mans I guess since they can pull so much shit and deal so much AoE damage (which they can also do in vanilla).
---
&gt;classic+ going forward without massive changes to hybrids
---
I wouldn't have an issue with that, anything but TBC (and the path that it leads downwards).
---
Like, even removing the debuff cap from vanilla might have a big influence on the viability of classes (for example shadow priests and locks) might instantly be more viable. And if they did some minor changes to talents (give oomkins some type of mana regen) or other small changes, I think that would have been cool.
---
And I was mildly surprised the other day when the literal first mob dropped it. Damn son.
---
what the problem then ?
---
Lol salty rogue. 
---
The only thing spy changes is one aspect of pvp - who sees who first. Beyond that is still the entire fight, gear, professions chosen etc. Spy changes like 1% of the fight. 
---
If you're on here calling people bad at PVP yet you can't win because of the existence of the combat log, I have sad news for you. 
---
Don't forget that the arena becomes the de facto PVP skill decider later in the game. What difference would spy make in the arena?
---
Played on rp servers Nd i tried to tell them that there is legit close to zero difference. Yeah from time to time youll see people doing events in places and out of respect i leave them alone. But is that really that big of a deal ? They think its cheesey and looserish. Like bro your already playing world of warcraft 15 year old game who fucking cares.  So now they rolled on one of the popup servers blizz pushed out and there not happy
---
It's only for 4 weeks. Phase 2 is over in 12 days. Take a break, get some fresh air and get back to owning then.
---
Horde or Alliance, I can't level my second char without getting constantly owned in WPL by the alliance.
---
Everything happening now was predicted and that's not something unusual given the fact the game is 15 years old and community is here open for everyone to observe.
---
Still I'd say for good elements, since that's subjective, pservers exist.
---
IMO, they should just remove all pvp combat logging that doesn't directly affect you.
---
No notifications for enemy buffs, just attacks against you.
---
You really can't imagine the refugees flooding in from unbalanced servers therefore messing up the balance of a previously balanced server? You can't imagine consequences of actions?
---
i miss nost
---
BSH are definitely going to be better than Barb Blade once +15 agi comes out. Barb Blade is the best stat stick atm though, barring brut blade/Corehound Tooth.
---
As stat weights are 2.6 AP/1 agi, and 32 AP/1% crit. This is how the weapons compare.
---
&gt; Currently
---
* BB: 92 AP `(60+32)`
---
* BSH: 67.6 AP `(13*2*2.6)`
---
&gt; With +15 agi enchants
---
* BB: 131 `(15*2.6+32+60)`
---
* BSH: 145.6 AP `(13+13+15+15)*2.6`
---
If you're alliance, add 1.1 to the agi multiplier because of kings. This makes BSH even stronger.
---
Cuz hunter. Hunters just fly to a zone, eagle eye teleport around the whole map in seconds to every possible spawn, run to gather it, record a timer for when the next spawn is.
---
Rinse and repeat for every black lotus zone.
---
i farm alliance pigs until they quit and will keep doing so.  Theres no brakes on this train.  I will happily see classic crumble into dust its what they deserve.  In the meantime I will enjoy making others miserable
---
It doesn't spam any macros at all. It just displays combat log information in a UI. You still have to click to trigger the /target macro.
---
yeye, shattrath. Its the same shit I guess
---
Yeah I unsubbed last night. (Firemaw EU)
---
I thought about it and I realised Blizz are just taking the absolute piss. I have no interest in retail, yet have to pay the same price as those players. And then they have bullshit like this? ¬£9.99/month for a 15 year old game, which at peak times is basically unplayable. No thanks.
---
World PvP will pretty much die once BGs come out because there‚Äôs so little incentive for the outnumbered faction to bother with it.
---
Might be second fastest but that doesnt change the fact that to me, its the best one ;)
---
&gt; And people say Pallys can‚Äôt tank in classic.
---
Do people really say this? As far as I've seen, it's possible to tank up t'ill AQ as a priest.
---
Does anyone know if [Phantom Blade]{https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7961/phantom-blade} stacks with Sunder Armor? I was thinking about picking it up as my tanking weapon on my warrior.
---
...why shouldnt a player who went out of his way to gain pvp gear (which i'd argue is harder to obtain than raid gear) not be able to decimate in pvp?
---
Still way harder than current MC.
---
Took me 11 deaths. 11. To get to UBRS from Thorium Point. That kind of sucks the life out of you and makes you not want to play the game.
---
It's not PvP when you are grossly outnumbered. It's a slaughter.
---
He has 8 level 48s...
---
Was gonna respond with something else but bufftart got it right. Cry more
---
You are assuming the flooding will be one sided. It's not.
---
It's just MUCH more frustrating to me for people to be entirely safe up in the air able to swoop down and nuke you whenever they see fit with absolutely zero chance of anything being done about it.
---
&gt; Happened to me a few weeks back. First few seconds were sketchy but once I had 15 healers bombing me with heals I never dropped below max hp. If I don't sit on my ass all P1, I'm tanking P3.
---
Tanking ony as a warlock is fairly easy, most locks have moved on to tank a few bosses in MC.
---
Spy tells you when a member of the opposing faction is nearby. It‚Äôs controversial because it can tell you when a stealth class is close (although not where they are specifically) it‚Äôs caused a lot of drama since phase 2 as it removes the advantage of rogues/druids.
---
The horde is just that in my experience (56 alt) they roll in a group of 15-20, and will get rolled by a group of 10 alliance as the alliance planned to go out there for pvp vs ad-hoc.                        
---
             
---
The 3-4 man rowing gank squads appear to be primary alliance because they need to be moving lest they attract the above mentioned hoard.          
---
       
---
Meanwhile the 50s of both side get shit on by raiders with nothing better to do.
---
I wish I had something better to play, like a little pserver relaunch, but vanilla wow is my game, as much as this shit sucks, it's still the best game I know..
---
Which sucks when you're a class that can't kill stuff that quickly.
---
Because I played on a PvP server 2008- 2010 and loved it. It was nothing like this. I had no idea PvP would be this hyper-competitive. I made a mistake choosing PvP. Now all I can do is hope that BG's will calm things down or start completely over an a Normal server......this game is not feeling like an escape from the stresses of life right now. Hope it can be that for me again....
---
People act like PvE servers don‚Äôt exist. The constant complaining on this sub about PvP on a PvP server just boggles the mind. You people are literally the guy riding a bike and putting a stick in his own spokes meme.
---
I can recite this better than the actual scenes, specifically Moria.
---
id discount everyone below lvl 20
---
&gt; Is there any viable warlock tank specs for either dungeons or raids? I love the idea of a warlock tank.
---
They can become full-fledged tanks for raids but it demands effort on your part. people have done a ton of work on [the subject](http://classicwow.live/guides/718/caperfin-s-advanced-warlock-raid-tank-guide).
---
Any flooding at all is going to upset the balance. Most of the complaints are that servers are Horde heavy meaning there will be a greater influx of alliance players...
---
Will Iced Barbed Spear be available?
---
Its not only that, WoW is an old game, alot of people play a lot less once they hit 60, because in 2019, ‚Äúfarming and grinding‚Äù is alot lower on adults priorities list then it used to be back in 2004.
---
Oh it's one these people.
---
Classic is also a heavily nerfed and watered down version of vanilla. Fights are nerfed, player spells and talents and items are way too strong compared to how it was. Of course everyone is rolling over everything and it's piss-easy. We are playing a version of the game that is after 2 years of QoL.
---
Seriously. My brother is leveling alchemy and sends me FAPs all the time.
---
FAPs on a warrior vs a mage is one sided in favor of the warrior.
---
The problem is rolling on a gear you need, because if you somehow win it, next boss could drop an item you need even more, which you wont even be allowed to roll on.. so you just end up passing on upgrades in hope of a bigger upgrade
---
Killed Dotbot so many times outside of DM.
---
It's not an addon, it's a 3rd party thing which Blizzard says is against the rules, but they haven't banned anyone for more than 10 years and when they did it was a genuine mistake and they reverted all of the bans.
---
That‚Äôs like 40% of your epic mount, which you will use forever once you get it. The staff is good but it will be replaced within a week or two.
---
Worked for Northdale
---
I haven't been checking out transfers because I'm personally happy with my server choice, but are PVP -&gt; PVE realm transfers available?
---
Someone else had a solid idea as well, shrink the combat logging range outside of dungeons/raids.
---
there is literally only 1 pvp spec that does mainly fire dmg wtf
---
I want to transfer to PvE, Blizzard won't let me. I made a wrong decision months ago, now that one decision is ruining the game.
---
Idk wtf your talking about. Ive corpse ran hundreds of times between Kargath and BRD enterance as a horde on Firemaw.
---
do Hunters still have a lot of bugs are have they been fixed?
---
Whitemane on NA is pretty good. Not perfect, but nowhere near as bad as some of the horror stories I see all the time.
---
Yes, and you don't have to be going for speed runs. Just understanding that it's 40 peoples time at stake. Any raiding guild should strive to complete raids as fast as possible. If you don't wanna try your best, then whats the point?
---
I might come back I don‚Äôt know. But I don‚Äôt need to game - I‚Äôve got a million things I‚Äôve been putting off for 3 months. I need to focus on them. I have a very addictive personality, so this shit really screws me up. Thankfully Blizzard have saved me from myself - several years earlier than first time around.
---
Guess what it‚Äôs like as a rogue vs a dwarf rogue who can stoneform go immune to blind entirely? You lose. Or in arranged BGs, the enemy gnome warriors just escape artisting straight out of roots/novas onto your healers? Etc
---
I won‚Äôt (and didn‚Äôt) claim alliance racials are necessarily BETTER, but they‚Äôre definitely very strong and when coupled with Paladins.. alliance are clearly the better faction in both PvE and PvP.
---
Leveling in Un‚Äôgoro with that one fucking graveyard on a pvp server was awful
---
And what you've explained is the mentality of a hardcore player. Also it's just the raid that's sub 2 hours, but the raid prep far exceeds the "scrub" guilds 4 hours. You're spending more time outside of the raid to allow you to clear a raid slightly faster vs a bad guild clearing it in more time while spending less time outside. Eventually both will be within margin of error in gear, and the only difference is a hardcore player likely spent 2-10x the amount of effort to gear that for that 5% increase in dps and reduction in time (assuming different mentalities but equally skilled [this is important as being hardcore doesn't mean you're good at the game]).
---
Zoomer speak for ‚Äúbest‚Äù or most ‚Äúdominate‚Äù of a given thing.
---
You are biased and misguided. Lots of hordes don't like being overpopped, and there are servers that ally favored. Lastly on the very horde sided servers there is a restriction for transfers to be horde only as to not further fuck up the balance.
---
uh i wasn't talking about the canned responses. those make sense. what i meant is blizzard has a low standard of quality for how they're running classic.
---
Oh i understand the grinds as well. Like i said, i enjoy grinding and many other people do as well. I just don't like when more casual players bash people who play this way. There seems to be a ton of that on this subreddit.
---
View range does seem really short. Im sure the melee classes are loving it. Idk what to tell you though. Hopefully BGs will be normal.
---
Warriors are dogshit solo and best in group.
---
lol phase 1 50% of my fights and kills were me getting jumped 2v1 and killing/camping both of them, often while I was still fighting or just killed a devilsaur....as SM/Ruin. In half pve-half bad pvp gear. 
---
nothing you say is based in reality though so /shrug
---
The point of the OP in this thread was to say if horde players truly wanted to pvp they wouldn't roll horde. They rolled horde because they knew they would have the numbers advantage.
---
[Here you go, OP](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=classic+wow+feral+leveling+guide)
---
Don‚Äôt pass ever. You won‚Äôt win the roll anyway.
---
You dont really NEED pre-BiS in classic though, that's just the playerbase imposing a requirement on people. In vanilla you could do Onyxia and MC in quest greens and be fine.
---
I play on a medium pop server. It‚Äôs awesome.
---
There‚Äôs always been dozens of changes ffs
---
cool
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;realm=4731_Earthfury
---
He's never played a game with an actual bot / RMT problem and is definitely overreacting. I'd love to see what he would have to say about Runescape or Maplestory.
---
He‚Äôs been presenting his own feelings through ‚Äúquotes‚Äù of others‚Äô (strawmen) this whole thread and it‚Äôs hilarious. I wonder if he‚Äôs like this in real life.
---
And you said minimum, which is false. Also, implying we go through it like robots is, lol.
---
Well, if you win loot from first boss, you are then ID locked for the entire week, and for the next 2ish hours you are forced to chug through MC in order to not have the chance to obtain one single item
---
If they had any bosses killed before you entered yes.  If it was fresh and you didn't kill any no.  The lockout doesn't happen until a boss is killed so you can go in trash farming all you want with different groups and not be locked.  If you enter one where any of the bosses had been killed previously, you are locked to that one the moment you zone in.
---
When WoW first released you paid a flat amount for the game, and then you were paying $15 a month for all the thing blizzard did.  Great Customer Service support, Bug fixes, Marketing, top of the line servers, and most importantly content updates.   You get none of that in classic!  So beyond the initial price of the game, what exactly are you paying for?
---
&gt;They‚Äôll ***NEED*** more monetization other than subs.
---
Yeah classic is so expensive to develop and maintain there's no way it can possibly be profitable with just a subscription.
---
Is it possible to have different keyboard/mouse inputs for the 2 games? (Ie so 2 players could play on 2 accounts at the same time)
---
The problem is that community would never self-balance the servers. People say they want a balanced server, but nobody ever wants to transfer to the minority faction and it would make the problem worse.
---
And before some smug person says that they‚Äôd be the knight in shining armor that would transfer to the minority faction, for every 1 person like you, there‚Äôs 10 that would do the opposite.
---
Yeah, one of those people who prefers advice to come from people with a remote inkling of what the situation is
---
Maaaan, always take a rogue üòÇ
---
In your defense, that IS exactly the freakin title.
---
Pre bis is useless. In a month or two we will all have the same gear anyways. You must be a special kind of stupid if you spend hundreds of hours to save a few lol.
---
Gotta say I think this is one area where the #nochanges group was wrong
---
Unsubbed as well expiring at xmas, will check and ruin few bgs once they drop on 49s and wait for some competition in 15yo game while giving money to someone who dont even care not have 80 iq for basic solutions like "more than 2-4 pvp realms without server caps or faction ques, ouh wait they come out with layering to solve that.... sure"   
---
If it is the best game you know, reroll on PVE and enjoy vanilla wow at its finest, pve grind and occasional pvp, if not, join us in TBC arenas : )
---
The myth that Classic is somehow harder, more advanced and not simple is very, very funny to me. We have people that cleared MC in the first week of the game. The only kind of difficulty you find in Classic is because it's VERY grindy and time-consuming, on top of having overtuned and badly designed dungeons and raids. No to mention the really badly designed classes, with entire specs that aren't viable for a majority of the game.
---
Thanks to no time gating, we had 20 people clearing Molten Core in the first week. Now you sit here with fuck all to do because there's really no reason to back and do anything in Classic, because you already know what there is to be had and you've probably got it already.
---
Yeah it'd be terrible if an MMO wanted to have a more constant level of players by having content for them to continually engage in.
---
I got Hecular's rod on the first yeti, no one in the zone believed me.
---
This. I don't believe this for a second.
---
&gt; pally 
---
Gross. I don't collude with Alliance scum.
---
No, you just stop playing the games that have cheats. Reason why I stopped playing starcraft, reason why I stopped playing CS. And in real life there are actual consequences called the law if you're caught. Whereas a ban, and you just get another account in a game.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it give you coordinates of the players too? The fact alone that you can target them and not even know they‚Äôre there to begin with is so ridiculous. I refuse to use this addon, it‚Äôs lame as fuck.
---
I am pretty sure any type of resource gain shows up in the combat log, so the mana gain from BoW would show up. However the nerf to the range definitely makes Spy less oppressive
---
google: move anything "classic" addon  
---
profit, thank me later, gl hf
---
Ok boomer
---
&gt;but nobody ever wants to transfer to the minority faction and it would make the problem worse.
---
Right now? Nope, there is no incentive to transfer to the shit faction on your server (if Blizz will even offer faction transfers).
---
But when people first create their first characters, I believe people take the ratio into consideration in vanilla, based on pserver experience which often manages to have very good faction balance even without any systems to enforce it.
---
Now its just too late
---
&gt;And before some smug person says that they‚Äôd be the knight in shining armor that would transfer to the minority faction, for every 1 person like you, there‚Äôs 10 that would do the opposite.
---
I actually rerolled alliance on another server, but I checked a bunch first and asked for approx server ratio, and skipped a few. Found one that I consider redeemable at about 43/57 ish A/H which is barely playable.
---
If it was lower than that, I just cba.
---
Old Bliz was cool. New Bliz is sad :(
---
The name is "The Stockade"
---
It's not plural.
---
It mostly helps people who buy/sell gold. They too are people who are nolifers trying to rank to 14 so they have unlimited amounts of pots, respec costs, etc.
---
Its 60 / 40 H A ratio on mograine.
---
It doesn't. No thanks. I like my mods. If you think it's such a huge advantage why don't you install it?
---
Where do you get this info from and also you should only count people level 30+
---
Skinning can make ok gold, especially if you farm beasts that drop other good stuff or have high value trash. One of my favourites is turtles as they drop clams which have a chance for pearls.
---
For herbalism black lotus is the go to, I‚Äôd suggest saving them for now as the price will jump soon enough. Another good one is ghost mushrooms from Maraudon, they go for about 1g each on my server. Depending on your class dm jump runs are made much more profitable by herbalism as well.
---
If you play and want to PvP, do just a bit of research to find a 'balanced' server where there's roughly the same amount of horde and alliance players.  The first one that comes to my mind is Grobbulus.  It will be very important as you level up.  Otherwise I would definitely suggest a PvE realm if you're just starting out.
---
Isn't there a Horde backdoor into DM right outside of their quest hub?
---
Hello!
---
are you talking about at 60, or leveling? If its his group, who cares who he invites and who are you to say what he should and shouldn't invite outside of having a tank and healer. If he says "i'm tank but i'm a DPS warrior, I will be rolling on melee DPS gear" and makes that clear, again, whats the issue? Don't like it, start your own group or find another.
---
You're too high level to run rfc now, so there's that.  Lol.
---
The problem is 100% antisocial behavior. It boggles my mind that so many people in this community think corpsecamping/etc is ok. ‚ÄúOh but i get honor from grieving people... I‚Äôm practically obligated to do it!‚Äù
---
Lmao ok. You know where else you can personally benefit from dicking people over? Real life. It‚Äôs not something unique to WoW. Most people figure out not to do it. ‚ÄúIt benefits me‚Äù isn‚Äôt even close to a justification. Gtfo
---
Outside of flying, TBC is outwardly better in almost every way.
---
Class balance is far better, without being to homogenized.
---
PvE content is far better, with far more of a challenge as well as far more to do.
---
PvP content is far better simply due to the honor system being fixed as well as arenas.
---
Prepare to get camped and ganked once you get to Honour Level of a level 60 you need to basicly grind all the way too 60 in dungeons ATM on high pop pvp servers
---
&gt;No, you just stop playing the games that have cheats.
---
Do you only play single player games? I don't know of a single multiplayer game that doesn't have cheats.
---
Good for you too!
---
cuz then they can't have the OP racials like UD and orcs have.
---
How does spy give you an economic advantage lol? On that note, I guess we should ban gatherer, or people looking up gather routes online üôÑ
---
Dps chart does give you an advantage - if you don't have it, top guilds won't let you raid. Same for threat meter. A good raid tank requires it. A DPS rogue needs it as well to know if they're about to pull aggro. If you don't have it, you pull aggro and get the gkick. 
---
Maybe the question you should ask yourself is why you can't win a PVP battle without getting the jump on someone? I wonder how you'll do in arenas.
---
we have 4 raid teams, I guess 1 or 2 or maybe all 3 of em do it that way. i'mm talk with my RL about it.
---
What LFG add-on?
---
Faction change avoids the reroll. 
---
Currently Alliance options are to quit the game or reroll. 
---
You're incapable of thinking beyond the end of your own nose.
---
\#NoChanges
---
Accepted that the Horde on Smolderweb just love to RP zombies on the walking dead lol. I just wish the smaller outposts had more guards. Landing a raid at one flightmaster at EPL to camp the other flightmaster is not "epic wpvp" :p
---
it is how vanilla was.
---
it's just amplified by three because there are three times the number of people on any given server compared to vanilla. that one rogue ganking in gadgetzan is now a group of 3 rogues.
---
tack on a heavily meta driven community and it led to this situation.
---
but how this is news to anybody is beyond me. layering alone should have given people enough of a clue to see just how overpopulated some servers really are.
---
You can mind vision them as well to see where they are as a priest
---
Actually if you look up some vanilla pvp videos, yes they were doing just that.
---
Yeah. I'm not looking for handouts at all. But some of the things I notice my geared up guildies doing is just a shame when u think they could spend half that time getting a full group of guildies up to their status also.
---
This is the conclusion I think I'm coming to. Phase 2 PvP is weakening the grip Classic WoW has on me. I should be reading some more books and doing more fixing up around the house.
---
Man, it's not like I'm hating my life when I'm out there gearing up and getting prepared. I'm just playing the game and enjoying it. Look, some people don't have as much time to play the game. They don't like to grind gear, farm gold or try hard on the logs. That's fine. I'm sure those people will find a nice casual guild to play with, but some people actually enjoy it. 
---
The problem comes when someone shows up to raid week after week in the same green gear, never brings their douse, never has world buffs, gets out-DPS'd by the tank, dies constantly because they can't be asked to bring a GFPP, but cries when big-dick billy gets prio on loot over them.
---
It's based off detecting enemy actions in the combat log. This means that if you're a rogue and you're riding by and see an enemy, although you'd normally get the jump and they'd be none the wiser, they're gonna see that you're nearby because entering stealth sets off the add-on. So you're telling me it's completely fair that even though you had no awareness an enemy was nearby, you're allowed to have that information simply because a rogue hit stealth? Seems pretty damn unfair to me.  
---
I love that you're clearly not a rogue so it's OK. Stop being such a disliker.
---
Or use your hearthstone, looks like a heal spell.
---
That one might be reasonable as it‚Äôs pretty cheap. But your case isn‚Äôt really what I was talking about.
---
Ye im farming strat live for the +21 bracers and the +21 back, cba to pay 2x price on ah for 1 extra spellpower between 20 to 21
---
Google "wow classic leveling guide". Have a look over a few and try the zones :-)
---
wrong but ok. did you even read what u linked? LOL
---
Yes and no. They told people not to join certain servers and if you look at a server thats 70:30 horde you know the crowd who said fuck it didn't all swarm the alliance. So this issue, which is biggest on the biggest servers is affected by the ignorance of those who all went somewhere they weren't needed. And now they are ruining it for those unlucky enough to be on the wrong side and blaming the ones leaving for making it worse when in the end few of the horde (and on a couple of servers alliance, as this is less of a faction issue than it is a mob mentality one) are taking the out because they LIKE the imbalance as it stands.
---

BRM is amazing and you get out of here talking bad about it.
---
I like it. I like it a lot
---
Being a Night Elf prot warrior, shadowmeld and hide was the best shot I had at avoiding a fight.
---
But that was 2006, and this is Classic.
---
Almost useless? What. It has a reduced range, 50 yards is still plenty of a distance man. It used to be retardedly far at 250, further than the draw distance of enemies becoming visible. If there is a stealthing enemy it announces it for you "stealthed enemy detected" gives you classes in the area, level, and coords last seen. Its absolutely fucked up. This should not exist in this game. Massive crutch which needs to be blocked.
---
Yeah I was afraid I would have to do that. I just wish I could use the same font and size of the font when i hit f1 to show my own character as an enemy mob.
---
It doesn't really. If you have your combat log open, you can just as easily /target from there. These addons have existed for a very very long time and the chances of WoW banning them now are just flat out unlikely.
---
Yeah not bad

Cross-realm battlegrounds came at the end of vanilla.
---
I farm honor in winter spring and Silithus while farming herbs and lost 40k honor lol. Being salty about losing honor doesn‚Äôt mean your camping lowbies
---
It literally does none of that since they nerfed it.
---
Only because of a solvable problem. WPvP has been great, when it happens.
---
What happens to alliance in TBC?
---
Blizzard literally owns glider. Their website redirects to battle.net. "Judge David Campbell ruled against MDY in July, and agreed with Blizzard‚Äôs infringement claims and stated the third party program tortiously interfered with World of Warcraft's sales and impacted Blizzard's relationship in a negative fashion with their customers. And now a US district court has awarded Blizzard US$6 million in damages against MDY Industries."
---
I‚Äôm a Druid and I enjoy tanking. Once I hit SM I didn‚Äôt do a single quest outside a dungeon all the way to 60.
---
Heals can definitely keep up with mortal strike for short bursts. Also, they‚Äôve got a bubble for peeling from horde warriors that they can put on whomever gets mortal striked. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, I guess we just value different things when it comes to healers.
---
Enjoy Super Mario Bros lol

---
why strat live? higher drop chance or something? Might be better to farm the gold and buy em, though idk what they go for on your server.
---
my guild is a hardcore raiding guild, 4 raid teams, clear MC under an hour, server firsts etc etc and we don't expect our warlocks to have the 'best' ones. Obv not a like 36 head when 40 is only like 50g but idt anyone has 21 back or 21 bracers. 
---
I had a 38 head but only because I literally never saw a 40 on the AH except for 200g LOL. I found one in trade a few weeks ago for 55g and took it, slapped on +8, prob will use over t2 head, we'll see.
---
The thing is, it makes sense in the theme (lore, maybe) perspective, and it makes sense in a PvE progression stance.
---
Tier 1 is about fire and flames, having the fire elementals and the dragons that breath fire and all the people who forge things (by fire) in the same area makes sense.
---
For PvP, yeah shit show.
---
Ah of course, secure chat systems is really difficult in 2019, give blizzard some slack
---
Not much will change.  Even with cross realm, horde will have long queues.  They will be doing the same thing in world while waiting in queue.
---
I actually got pretty lucky and didn't have to grind a ton for some of my harder to get items, but I've been raiding since week 3 as one of the only warlocks in my guild, so I'm way passed pre-bis at this point. Most of my time now is spent gold farming and leveling some alts. Just the way i enjoy the game i suppose.
---
You obviously know nothing about speedrunning to have an opinion on it
---
The economically part was 1 advantage that constitutes as cheating. Spy doesn't but a bot can so that's why it's bannable. Gatherer isn't cheating though. I could technically print out a map of every single zone on paper and when I pick an herb, mark an estimation of where I picked it and what herb I picked. That's why gatherer isn't banned, because I can just do that.
---
I am a DPS rogue with 0 threat meter. Because I wait and use Feint every now and then to ensure I don't pull any aggro. Also DPS meters give no advantage over any player, it just calculates all your damage to let you know who's doing the most and who's doing the least. It's not required to raid, there are plenty of guilds out there that do not require you be top dog DPS to raid.
---
I can win PvP battles and have done well in arenas in past WoWs thank you very much. I'm not expecting to win every single battle. I'm not a sweat and so I know I cannot and will not win every fight, but I can hold my own.
---
It sounds like you need to get a better understanding of what cheating is and then come back here and try again.
---
This is classic, the game design is fine, why do you think the subscription rate is more than it ever has been. People complaining non stop, not doing anything about it, and pushing this "omg alliance is so outnumbered" agenda is what is making everyone re roll horde or stop playing entirely.
---
They are the horde.... think about that for a second in the literal sense of what horde means. We are the alliance so ally the fuck up and play the game ffs. All these little whiny bitches are what make me want to roll horde not the imbalance.
---
I played BFA a bit on release, and also recently just to see  the story, and I know warmode is a thing.
---
But I don't really think it encourages wpvp unless you have dedicated groups for it. I always played with that mode on (because why wouldn't you) and barely encountered any pvp at all regardless, even tho the system is suppose to phase you into PvP situations. People just play the game normally and ignore each other when they encounter each other anyways. 
---
But to be fair, I barely played BFA, and it might have been more common before they added flying. 
---
&gt;Also, the faction imbalance in retail is a huge problem for mythic raiders,
---
I was thinking mostly about strict wpvp in my comments. Horde might have a slight edge in PvE in vanilla too because of windfury totem, altough paladins scale incredibly well as healers when they get high crit.
---
But for retail I guess horde has always been the dominant faction in PvE, and alliance were better in PvP since wrath when they got that broken racial.
---
60/40 really isn't that bad. Faerlinas either 60/40 or 55/45 and its fine on Alliance.
---
If something as minor as someone else botting bothers you this much, then i would suggest quitting and seeking help
---
You've obviously never written a single line of lua for this game because if you had you would know its clear as daylight what the ToS allows and what it doesn't because it's spelled out in protected and unprotected functions.
---
I know in phase 1 our server was almost completely even, and people on both sides would constantly talk about being 70/30 or worse.  Part of it is that at that time phasing didn't really accurately represent overall server population, and that may have been a legitimately fair anecdote.  I think the bigger issue though is hyperbole.  
---
I'm in a low play period myself now, mostly just raid logging, so I can't really comment on how even it is now.  All I know is those complaints have largely stopped, and I think it's because the people prone to hyperbole and making excuses have stopped playing by now.
---
The Battle chicken and Death Ray are the only BOP, but I strongly recommend you to get them, since in classic you have to swap trinkets and those are two very good ones, Battle chicken for PvE and Death Ray for PvP.
---
That‚Äôs what I was looking for thank you!
---
Vanish while in stealth
---
Maybe just quit playing the game dude
---
Lol this took me 3 hours got an entire level from it
---
Hmm didn't I read a post about a dude saying don't camp your enemy factions lowbies, especially on an unbalanced server, because you will make them quit and then you won't have anyone to kill at all.
---
But me being a tank 90% of the time i do a dungeon run and when i raid eventually shouldnt that be the first thing im looking for?
---
Only if the mage is awful. Sheep and wait for the timer to run out ezpz
---
No, I dont see it man.
---
It's how it works with NPCs as well, if I stealth right as I've body pulled a mob, it will still find and hit me.
---
Farm gold, pvp, level alt
---
classic is literally unplayable when you cant use the chat
---
How exactly would that work?  You can't /who the opposing faction.
---
convince people? hardly. should really learn to read.
---
maybe you should try actually playing the game instead of coming over to reddit and pouring your tears out into text.
---
oh right, i forgot the game is literally unplayable for morons. sucks to suck.
---
You cannot contractually sign your tights away.  There is plenty of case law on the subject - don‚Äôt be dense.
---
Enjoy getting ganked more because their honor didn't count and they've gotta do it again lol.
---
If you make a level 1 on the server to ask in general, you can just who instead, then delete character and make one of the opposite faction.
---
Had a 56 shaman guildie healing us in strat live last night and he did just fine
---
I‚Äôm staying sm/ruin. I feel I can 1v1 anything personally ;)
---
Alliance have families.
---
Been looking for an Ally server for me on east, perfect.
---
TBC servers die because it's the most incomplete version of WoW they have to work with in the Pserver scene. On top of that they have to shove thousands of people into one zone which causes lag and kills servers.
---
There is a reason that after TBC Blizzard stopped funneling everyone into one zone.
---
This is a classic wow sub you idiot
---
Census data from people who installed an addon. While it's quite easy to say the data isn't reflecting the exact proportion, it's much less likely the shift in proportions of players is nonexistent.

---
Herbs for the herb god!
---
Your description of targeting yourself is very interesting.
---
So you're telling me today is the day you realized your GM is 14?
---
Kind of like how a guild that uses DBM is going to have an advantage over a guild that doesn't?
---
Razorgore Horde and Gehennas Alliance
---
The change was that this time, *every single* griefer/aggressive-PvPer rolled horde
---
In what way is world content in Classic "piss easy" ? Most classes can't handle more than 2 mobs at once. Compared to retail where every single class can just pull tons of shit willy-nilly and effortlessly AoE it all down then heal right back up and have 0 downtime whatsoever.
---
Vanilla gear is not "simplified". You actually have to think about exactly what you gain from each stat, and comparing pieces of gear can be difficult, even moreso for healers where it's harder to "sim" things. Compared to retail where it's just "equip whatever has the highest ilvl and you're good to go".
---
Loot RNG in vanilla is just "did it drop or not". Loot RNG in retail is "did it drop, did it titanforge, did it roll a socket, did it roll tertiary stats? no? disenchant it"
---
Crafting professions in vanilla are not "useless", in the way that the gear you craft from them is just as good, if not better than things you can get from raids. Certain crafted items are BIS forever. Compared to retail where the crafted gear is literally the same stats that you get from dungeon gear.
---
&gt;actual rotations
---
I still don't understand the appeal of having a "rotation". It's just needlessly complicating things. In addition to all the boss mechanics, you have to carefully go through a "rotation" of 6 different buttons and 2 or 3 reactive buttons and 5 cooldowns, it's just cluttered as all hell. TBC struck a nice balance.
---
What side did u choose? Horde? Alliance?
---
You should include your faction, although I suspect its alliance due to being sick of wpvp lol
---
I'm just offering advice based on previous experience in the pugs that go by this loot system of 1 item only. Winning an item early may feel bad knowing you will get nothing else, but walking away with 0 items after waiting to roll is just worse. With some bad luck, you may not actually have an item to roll on at all the whole run. Roll on any upgrade period in those runs if you choose to join them.
---
Anyway, I stopped going to +1 after "-X to your next roll after your first item" runs have become more popular.
---
Nano.. Whitekidney... pls save us and release fresh
---
I started at launch and I'm only at 41 now. With a couple low level alts on a PvE server when I'm not feeling like being ganked
---
Live in ignorance then, i couldnt care less mate
---
what do you mean?
---
Looooooooo√≤oool
---
Neither is this over-population. Something has to change
---
It's they're game so yes they get to decide what is cheating and what is allowed.... Just like the NFL gets to decide what is cheating and what isn't for NFL games... It's not a matter of if it is right or wrong it's a matter of these are the rules the maker of the game decided on so that's the rules we play by.
---
Oh no, I caught it, I'm just positive this is all a load of shit
---
I personally fill my soul bag, then stick it in g bank until raids to avoid the whole mc corpse run. But my guild bought it for me for this reason :/
---
But anyone who runs Weakauras cast can still  see what spell your'e casting, so how is that going to work?
---
Cheating is okay if the people cheating take on more risk than their reward. I have only really played mulltiplayer games and league of legends probably is the best one in terms of cheating. Apparently there are scripts people run but I have never witnessed anything that was broken in my thousands of games played. I might go back to that.
---
I also play a lot of poker, which has bots, which is why I play live as well. Online however has a lot of consequences to cheating along with bots are easily able to be taken advantages of by good players at this point in time.
---
This is also assuming its ?? Warrior vs the mage so no I'd assume the gap would work as the sheep would likely break very early
---
This is all server dependent its not happening on ever sever.
---
There was no bug being abused. Its quite easy. Only Artvandelay did 360 healing per renew tick and he was the only one specced deep holy while the rest of priests in both Return and Progress were in discipline. In discipline you skip Improved Renew (+15% renew healing) plus Spiritual Healing (+10% healing) which combined make up for this 24% increase in renew healing per tick. If he was using the bug, the difference in healing would be way greater (also it would increase healing of all his other spells by a lot). Suq's renew (from Progress) heals for 294 per tick, while being in discipline and lacking these talents. If you add those percentages and give it a small room for difference (they dont have the same gear), you can easily calculate how is it possible to get 360 healing per tick in holy and 290 in disc.
---
horde has quantity
---
+1 from the "no, Vanilla wasn't like this" crowd.
---
I played on PvP servers from 2004 to 2015 when I quit retail, and I've never experienced camping to the magnitude of what's going on in Classic. It's 100% related to the increase in server population over Vanilla servers and then the imbalance itself.
---
&gt; We have people that cleared MC in the first week of the game.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bac8YDHFvFY
---
This guy cleared Dark Souls in 32 minutes. I guess Dark Souls is not a hard game after all :\^)
---
That's what you sound like when you keep bringing up "first week MC clear".
---
&gt;Yeah it'd be terrible if an MMO wanted to have a more constant level of players by having content for them to continually engage in.
---
The problem with that is the content is still the same. Retail content is the same as classic: farming the same shit over and over and over, but classic doesn't force you to log in every day and do things, you can farm at your own pace.
---
Disagree, I think current MC is about equal difficulty to WotLK Naxx.
---
Yes, they are just dicks, but sadly got a lot experience in WoW where officers are just scammers.
---
Obviously those mixed raids you talk about are scam, means for them only 20 people they have to share loot with, while you are just wasting your ID for them.
---
The thing is they broke the functionality of how the data was aquired, it has been broken for quite a while, because they nerfed /who
---
&gt; It doesn't.
---
Then why do you use it? Ill wait, cause I know you cant answer that.
---
I find this really odd, I am in a casual guild that clears mc in about 1h30min and I never close to running out of mana spamming flash heal with my holy spec. Are you running very few healers or something? Or are you in some speedrunning guild where its different?
---
The world pvp imbalance and asshole gameplay is not just Black rock mountain. Every important flightpath for questing 50+ is being camped by groups of hordes spawnraping and making sure you cant leave once you get there.
---
Shaman tanking is viable.
---
It‚Äôs nothing more than viable but it‚Äôs certainly viable.
---
Jamalz cheated!
---
Can't imagine Horde is the better PvE faction in vanilla. Windfury may be great, but totems only being group wide is a pain. I don't know if good shamans are constantly totemtwisting between windfury and tranquil air, but that would take up a lot of globals and mana and even then salvation is 10% more aggro reduction. I imagine threat is a bigger problem on a lot of fights for Horde unless you're doing something like DW fury tanks.
---
They literally told us for years that classic isnt what we actually wanted and here we are. I dont think they have any idea what we actually want and retail is a pretty good descriptor of that.
---

Everyone including myself knew that the honor system was awful but it just seemed too hard to try and implement a new system. Most people didn‚Äôt realize it would turn into what we see today. They should have just released bgs with honor.
---
I have no clue what he's talking about I played Alliance on a pvp sever from vanilla through Wrath. Makes no sense saying flying makes Alliance get exterminated by Horde. Haha I used dismount wack horde off their flying mount and bubble before landing and watch them die shit was great.
---
"pvP oN a pVP sErVeR LUL"
---
Same on my server Pagle-PvE, huge influx. Heres our numbers last 14 days:
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=14&amp;realm=4385_Pagle
---
19,869 characters observed in 14 days. Alliance Pagle is fucking *BOOMING* with refugees from PvP servers, its crazy.
---
So polymorph again? Mages can consistently kill warriors 5-8 levels higher than themselves. In the worst case, ice block when he closes the gap. Then nova, blink, etc.
---
I quit when P2 hit, got to 44 and called it quits. 
---
All my friends had already quit around lvl 33. I was getting pretty bored of my paladin and started to see the flaws with Vanilla all over again, so I was on the edge on whether to keep playing or not. Getting ganked over n over put the final nail n the coffin.
---
Glad for everyone enjoying Classic but It wasn't the game for me back then and it still isn't today.
---

Just make sure your Mortal Strike is ready if your Pummel fails.

There is times where you need to go to multiple zones, jumping around a bit is okay

---
Kill turtles on the south shore below undercity/above dalaran.
---
&gt; I would still compare it with wallhack in a PvP environment.
---
This is why I'm trying to explain things, your personal beliefs is causing you to point fingers in the wrong place.
---
Cheating is breaking the rules of the game, not breaking your beliefs of how the game should be played (everyone has a different opinion).
---
Based on that;
---
Wallhacks = Valve does not condone, breaks ToS, is cheating.
---
Addons = Blizzard supported, does not break ToS, is not cheating.
---
So again, what I'm trying to tell you is that if you want Spy to go away then the solution is not asking Blizzard to ban something that Blizzard says is legal and within the games rules. What you should be doing is telling blizzard that their API gives access to too much information about the player environment.
---
If Blizzard more aggressively censors log data then Spy and all addons like Spy instantly no longer exist.
---

---
Quality over quantity might work in real life warfare but in a videogame there's a certain threshold where you can't outplay it anymore.
---
Pulling \~5 mobs and then counterattacking with 2H and adding WW+ sweeping into the mix is quiet satisfying.
---
Shame you can only do it once every 30 min though.
---
Oh ya and north-ish STV
---
TBC did a really good job with balancing the classes out more without them losing their identity. Yeah things like ret paladins and boomkins were always towards bottom of dps, but they were way more viable and their utility made up for the lack of dps.
---
The big things here are, even though you may not have noticed them, I have friend who have 10+ Titans formulas when the layering bug happened. They were banned at the time but they were able to offload the recipes before the bans went through.
---
Although, this is not a botting example it just goes to show you how much less someone has to work if they chose to break the rules.
---
Here is another example, suppose gold seller are able to make an infinite amount of gold. Gold prices will ultimately drop. Say you're able to buy 1k gold for 50 bucks in classic. Do you think you're going to be able to compete with a person using titans, and unlimited amount of Lips, Fap, Majors on their way to getting to rank 14? Yes, if you're playing much much more than them. Everything equal though, you have a HUGE disadvantage.
---
I know you don't have a problem with that, but some people, like myself, get turned off of games that aren't played on an equal playing field.

Back then I played both factions. Now I play Alliance.

I should clarify, by "opponent tracking" I meant the list of past player encounters the addon tracks. The addon doesnt actually track anyone in the world, but I can see how that phrasing was confusing.
---
This would be over 10 levels higher... Your chance to hit would be about 64% assuming the warrior has 0 frost resistance gear. You would get one shot if you tried to cast another poly and then you'd have to hope your coc hits because you won't have time to frostbolt even rank 1
---
How is it less supply if there's an exact same number of devilsaurs spawning?
---
&gt;On top of that they have to shove thousands of people into one zone which causes lag and kills servers.
---
The genuine high quals servers usually starts at lvl 1, not 58. This is to make sure to keep the economy healthy. But even still, launches are always unstable and there are tons of crashes, its unavoidable. But those issues are usually resolved within the first few weeks.
---
It does not kill the server, thats for sure.
---
The servers are usually pretty decent for a few months, people hit 70, do the initial tier 4 rush, get their goodies steam through the content and then just quit.
---
But maybe it can be a decent success considered that Wrath is so successful, but I have my doubts as TBC doesn't really hit the same tone as wrath does with its mix of great PvP (arenas) and accessible raiding content.
---
&gt;TBC servers die because it's the most incomplete version of WoW they have to work with in the Pserver scene
---
Because there hasn't been much interest in it (yes, I am aware of the Corecraft fiasco). But even still, there are still some very high quality TBC servers, which still suffered when half the playerbase (all alliance basically) straight up quit the server.
---
Tenaris, felralas, stv, etc are all good

Horde get Belfs, and all the Alliance players who don't want to roll Horde because of the ugly races finally make the switch.

---
Rage income gets a lot better as you get abilities/hit rating.
---
30? You‚Äôre kidding right? Last time i was on it took our warlock nearly 2 hours to get there.
---
It‚Äôs crazy because the horde are now so desperate for honor on Stalagg that they set up shop in different houses in IF griefing anyone coming back from the open world who‚Äôs still flagged. People in the bank, in the AH, mystic ward, military ward, in the middle of IF waiting for their Pom-Pyro cooldowns to come back up so they can instagib people. It‚Äôs kind of ridiculous.
---
Even the days I‚Äôve logged on at 4-6 AM, no matter what zone, they‚Äôre on you like flies on shit actually corpse camping. I don‚Äôt go near BRM unless it‚Äôs raid night at this point. Glad I rolled a night elf at least!
---
Hey man. When I was SM/Ruin and a good rogue opened on me he would get me to 50% before I could coil/fear/he takes his hands off his keyboard and goes to get a drink/kill him. It should be 80%!  
---
As SL, TWO rogues open on me and get me to 50% and I might even have to healthstone while i'm fighting the not-feared one. Totally unfair that I have to use a shard to kill two rogues. Blizz needs to fix this ASAP, that shard would be better used elsewhere!
---
Because common sense.
---
this is fucked up to the MAX. I asked support what the fuck was going on 4 DAYS AGO. THEY SAID DUE WE HAVE PROBLEMS BUT BASICALLY GO EAT DICK, HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE BETTER.

Alliance has quality. Most of the extremely good private server guilds are alliance. And even better guild can emerge but not with this cry baby alliance attitude everyone seems to have these days. Ffs I've leveled toons in searing gorge and un goro, etc during this phase 2 warzone. I'm not crying
---
‚ÄúShould‚Äôve rolled a pve server;‚Äù  at least you realize it‚Äôs your fault.
---
i think the real world first is actually getting into MC and still having your world buffs
---
Why dont you guys from team 2 just split and make your own guild ?
---
It's just not a fun system. It's like playing a caster with zero mana.
---
bathroom fantasies? what.
---
We're assuming a warrior who fapped and is pvping
---
To Alliance, playing the game means mount circles in IF.
---
i play horde. we kill rag every week 1st try with no one being knocked back (except the mt sometimes) so yeah i believe i am right because... well because i am. just that simple. i don't need to invent imaginary inaccuracies to explain my failiure like you seem to do. i just don't fail. but as i said... people like you are not worth the time.
---
I did fury tank, usually with a shield though. The last two dungeons I tanked for was Uldaman (a few times) and RFD (once) and both dungeons were very tough, not trivial at all. Party members would pull extra mobs often (and generally not on purpose), I wouldn't have a ton of time to gain aggro on everything so 1-2 mobs chasing a DPS every pull, and the healer would usually focus on that dps instead of healing me so I would sometimes die once or twice per run if we didn't outright wipe. Maybe ZF, Marau and BRD are easy to tank... but not the 30-40 dungeons
---
I said "cheating", I consider a lot of addons "cheating" if you install 3rd party softwares/configurations that often give you quite massive advantages in-game. You are not playing on the same playing field as "everyone else", who doesn't have them installed.
---
And yes, I know you can break that argument by using some racing car analogies or whatever thats its within the criteria which is allowed by Blizzard.
---
The point is, that a lot of these 3rd party addons have too much impact (imo) and that Blizzard should deal with it, and should have tackled it on retail much earlier (like 14 years ago).
---
For pve they both are. For pvp ele is very good and enh is a total meme even with insane gear.
---
This is a classic sub why are you bringing up other games for no fucking reason? Holy shit you are mental
---
at 60 afaik there are like 1, maybe 2 pieces of leather gear a warrior would want. Truestrike shoulders and I couldn't even tell ya what/if there are more. And idek if rogues want truestrike. Its really just HOJ + rend blades they share (in some situations), right? Maybe a cloak. 
---
sorry you think 2 sentences is a "whole paragraph" and too long for you. stick to twitter or other short form media.

You are truly some kind of moron.

The faction imbalance is bad enough now that even with cross-server grouping there aren't enough people to play with alliance side.
---
Any form of cheating in a game where I'm spending a lot of hours to accomplish I will quit. Everyone cheats at every game, some games are harder to cheat at. Most realistic games, have much higher punishments/risk. In Wow you are rewarded for cheating. If they are banned they just create a new account. In life, sports, game shows, etc. the risks don't outweigh the rewards, which is what my level of standard would be met.
---
In another post I describe how I play league of legends. Compared to Starcraft (another Blizzard game they did nothing about) maphacking was rampant, and was terribly monitored. People blatantly hacking made me quit the game I used to LOVE. I only now watch professionals play and will never touch that game again. League does a good enough job where I don't ever see scripters, or maphackers at my level because of how accounts, levels, and character obtainment occurs. They have really done a great job in having a fair playing ground, especially as you get to play better people.
---
As I said, your leap in logic was I would find another reason to quit. This is almost fully wrong since the only reason I quit before was because of botters. The only thing that upsets me today about this game is how they still are letting it happen. Blizzard has a history of doing next to nothing when it comes to cheaters. And when I mention that people defend them and go, THEY CAN'T STOP THEM/THEY ARE DOING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN. No, I would be able to stop most of the obvious botters in a day on a server.
---
So 1-2% can cheat and you would want to play that game? The big difference here is 1-2% are cheating to obtain 10-15+% of gold in the game. It would be different if those 1-2% of people cheated but because of how Blizzard immediately cracked down on botters their efficiency would be down to next to nothing.
---
The last thing is is that both of us have no idea how big this problem is. Blizzard wants to keep as much money that there is. However, if there are  BLATENT botters running 24/7 I can only imagine how many are being undetected along with how many are just spamming dungeons on hundreds of accounts. They could easily hold and have sold up to 30% of the gold/mats on this server.
---
For some reason gaming companies feel like that "carrot on a stick" mentality is what people want and I have no idea why.
---
I played EA Sports FIFA a lot the last three years and this year they rolled out daily, weekly, and other objectives - I chose not to play this year.  The last thing I want to do is log in to a game and feel like I need to do a bunch of tasks just to keep up with everyone.  Do you have to do them?  No.  But if you choose not to everyone else is getting rewards in the form of gear, or in-game currency and progresses faster.
---
Bring back more open ended games where you can choose to do what you want, when you want and it isn't as detrimental.  That's one of the reasons I loved Star Wars Galaxies back in the day.  I could log in and PVP or I could log in and spend the day decorating my kick ass house set up in the remote wilderness on a random planet.
---
Can confirm. I instantly unsubbed when I got ganked in the fucking inn
---
I was there at the gurubashi arena, was great till APES rolled in and wiped everyone
---
The problem here is we have data and the Alliance still says they are outnumber 5 billion to 1.
---
Managing rage is pretty gratifying at later levels, I do admit that when I leveled my warrior it did kind of suck early so I bought him a lot of AH blues. I eventually had a blast once I got sweeping strikes and berserker rage and consistently having a shaman in group for wf.
---
No one on the alliance side has uploaded a census in the last ~4 days, but people on the horde side have. Each of the dots on the graph is an upload:

All the higher end guilds will likely be dw fury MTs
---
Cool you work at Blizzard? Please tell me more what the goal of this game is.
---
More frustrating than the reality that people are getting camped at every flight pointand dungeon entrance at a minimum? At least with flying you can choose to get away and stay away.
---
Nothing wrong with corpse camping for 2 or 3 times. Its more then that where you get zero honor to do so.
---
Go back to guild wars pussy
---
Same with bloodsail buccaneers
---
Hit cap for yellows is 9% on a raid boss for someone with 300 weapon skill. With 305, hit cap is 6%. 310 doesn't do enough to lower it to 5% and you can't get partial hit so you still want 6%.
---
It's also worth noting that as a combat rogue, a significant portion (50% +) of your dps is from whites and as a dual wield character, while the soft cap is only 9% (6% with 305 skill) you still benefit from more hit, it just may not be the optimal stat to focus on depending on how much AP and crit you have and what gear is available. Eventually you'll be going well past 10 hit.
---
I've never used Spy, but can't an add-on like weakauras essentially do the same thing just with more effort? You can set triggers based on combat log events. Only think WA couldn't do is click to target.
---
solo grind sucks, at least solo dungeon grind. don't mind stuff like herbing/devilsaur farming cause wpvp. and yeah when I was running strat live for star I usually reserved first orb or we did guild round-robin orb runs and made some good gold. the run I got my star I got some BoE blue dungeon set (bracers I think? maybe gloves?), shadow reflector recipe, an orb, and star. was a great run LOL
---
It seems that "*you thought you did, but you don't*" ;)

Naw, horde have goblin racial, best racial for dumb gimmicks

‚ÄúPVP on a PVP server‚Äù
---
I fucking hate this phrase. Stop blindly pretending that the current state of the game isn‚Äôt super unhealthy and broken. This is NOT how it‚Äôs supposed to be and saying otherwise is being intentionally disingenuous or naive.
---
Getting the jump on someone is literally how Rogues are designed to be played.
---
There's always an addon to overcome any player innovation, so either try to play your best and don't worry about it or sit and wait for the addons to determine the skilled champion victor. 
---
Your question defeats the point of the discussion, if they're using an addon to track your spell cast then baiting won't work either. 
---
Any spell blocker worth their salt will wait until half cast before kicking/bashing anyway.
---
When you're alliance there is always a new horde player waiting in line to get their 3 kills off of you.  I hit 60 the week before honor started, apart from a briarwood reed I am still in the same gear I hit 60 in...  I have only been able to run 2 dungeons since... every other group falls apart due to camped flight landings.
---
Says the horde that wants alliance to stay on his server so he can 4v1 them

Cool story kid

Alliance, since P2...

My favorite is attacking mages with honorless target and watch them instinctively use nova and then die afterward losing their honorless buff and thus giving h onor
---
The dailies in tbc don't give you anything special though yeah? It's just gold and rep for a faction that for the most part doesn't give anything tangible. For the shatt factions it's repeatable turn ins. Isle of Quel'danis sucks with dailies but unless you're gearing an alt by the time that comes out most of the gear is irrelevant.
---
While they might be antisocial cunts, you can't expect them to change.  You have to create systems to counteract the inevitable behaviour.
---
Those systems and faction q's with server transfers or faction changes for the dominant faction that gets caught in the Q.
---
Put those in place for a week and the problem will solve itself.
---
Haha sweet, my record is krol blade and maidens circle and 7 orbs in one run, lost the orbs but won both boe ;)
---
5-10 man groups can wipe 15 or 20 if they're much better and coordinated, sure. 
---
I'd like to see a video with a 10 man group wiping a full on 40 man raid though.
---
I'm going ignore the multiboxer example because a guy having 10 accounts is such an exorbitant outlier I'm not going to insult your intelligence by assuming you genuinely believe that's at all germaine to the larger conversation.

How is reducing the overall Alliance PVP population going to help?

Thanks for pointing out the issue.

I thought sulfuras was one of the more balanced serves?  One stat I saw showed 49-51%
---
Why would an anti cheating system fuck with chat and why are you being a fucking idiot about it? Haven't seen even the biggest "fanboys" make this connection and try to justify this issue like that.
---
Enemy castbar already have major limitations because the rank of the spell is not displayed in the combat log

How early would you get these talents?

That must be the case

It's a Unix system!

I get killed a lot. My buddy gets killed all the time. The level gap is closing and after we finish Jintha'alor and Sunken Temple, we are wary of what happens next. But we fight any reasonable fights, run and hide when we need to, and stay off the damn road. We get quests done fast because we team up.
---
Assuming you play horde on a horde dominant server?
---
Me n the boys make sure to spend and hour or two a day camping him and his buddies since they‚Äôre always at the same spot
---
You forgot "Jumping AFK People at flightpaths"
---
None of the examples you used are accurate through by your own admission. The first one isn‚Äôt even botting. In the 2nd...they aren‚Äôt farming an infinite amount of gold. Also, are you saying that i wouldn‚Äôt be able to compete with someone that is buying 1k gold for 50 bucks? If so - big assumption. What if I have that amount thru the hundreds of other methods of getting gold? You don‚Äôt need an unlimited amount of those to compete either. Also - people that go for rank 14 are such a small, small, small number of people it‚Äôs laughable to even use them as an example. I understand what you‚Äôre saying, I just think you are greatly over-exaggerating the negative affects to 99% of the population, if not more. It‚Äôs just not that big of a deal...but hey to each their own.
---
Looks like the Horde have won the war already in phase 2.
---
Boosting someone to ranking doesn't affect me at all. Whereas bots bringing in 30% more server gold makes every gold worth less for me.
---
I'm not familiar with Dota 2 cheaters but I have never felt cheaters in League.
---
Or maybe I'm not.
---
I feel you, though I feel like it's gotten worse in a way. You don't have your daily 'spend ten minutes doing your garrison chores' but every time I would end up playing the stupid matching game for the Tortollans I was just thinking "when do I get to play WoW and why am I not playing it now?"
---
As the top mage in that top parse on Stalagg who only plays Classic for PvP, it doesn't matter bud.
---
No matter how big you make your group, since Alliance are so rare, Horde heat about it or just have their level 1 spy alt /whoing zones and no matter how big a group you make, you get deathballed by one or several groups outnumbering you 3:1.
---
Also, with the size of Alliance brackets, to get R13 in any reasonable amount of time, you need to stay within standing 10. For R14, standing 2, if they arent being bracket stacked (which is less reliable in Classic).
---
Currently, it is too volatile. You cant reliably hold top 10. Ahmp, the top 1 player week 1, was standing 26 week 2. And now Alliance are colluding with Horde.
---
It's just not worth it.
---
The Horde that get killed mean Alliance are actually playing the game on a PVP server, instead of pretending its PVE or having mount parades in IF.
---
Anyone can lead a raid. It's not hard.
---
Congrats hordies, you won the war!
---
Well yeah, with the announcement of BGs, a lot of people are just waiting and you can bet most of them will be back on the 10th.
---
If it's so easy then why don't you go do it and be #1 on warcraftlogs? Because you're not good enough? Oh ok

I unsubscribed. I just find the game unplayable as Alliance

if they're 10+ levels higher than you and you're lucky enough to get the nova to land, you don't spend the 1.5 seconds+ to try your luck on a sheep. you gtfo.
---
Player vs Player or Player vs Envoirment. You seem to want The secound alternative. You The lore of Warcraft right!? Heck even The Game is named WARCRAFT &lt;&lt;&lt; So there is a war between Horde/Ally if you didnt know. Glhf
---
Yes, to each of their own. All I'm saying is is that this will make me want to quit WoW as it did before. If most people are like you, where they don't mind botters exist, nothing will be done by Blizzard because they just care about the biggest margins. All good.
---
You're implying that it's easy to detect. It's not. Blizz would have to keep an active record of IP addresses per account and keep track of if multiple accounts are using the same address at the same time. This is some backend stuff that would be pretty tedious to scan for all the time. Likewise, your IP address is actively changing so Blizz would also have to keep updating the current IP for your account frequently.
---
I am in game development and one of my roles is to moderate one of our projects for cheaters. You have no idea how easy it is for someone to conceal their IP address to avoid IP bans and other targetted actions.
---
The point still stands. By right, you are allowed to own multiple accounts. If you are not going to allow players to use multiple accounts at the same time then they should not be allowed to have multiple accounts active with the same CC at all. Thus, they would be eliminating the possibility of paying for someone else's sub when you have one of your own. By this reasoning, multiboxing is allowed.

They are 100% funneling gear into the speedrun team.
---
Spriest is okay now, as fights don't last long enough for mana to be as much of an issue as it used to be.
---
It's not 50/50 across all servers.  It's hilariously Horde heavy.
---
Even if you include the PvE servers which are Alliance heavy, they are much smaller than the PvP servers.
---
Horde will have long Q times.
---
Stay mad

Having fun is subjective. That's my point. Some people have fun RPing in goldshire... some people like to top the parses. People are different
---
no you are too dumb to get that the knockback has a range limit. if you are too far away you won't get hit.
---
like... what even is your point?
---
It was very good on kj. 
---
Name an other boss, where it was REALLY good. Sure it's a nice mobility cd, but some of the alliance racials are just straight up busted.

Nah keep killing us. Please. I need a bigger KoS list for when I hit 60 :)

Samples please

I play games to have fun. Often the fun comes from achieving a certain goal. Sometimes the fun is immersing myself into a digital world as a character avatar.
---
What would say it is that drives you to play games if it's not fun?

Yeah, retail has the best mechanically challenging group content in gaming.

It's the surrounding systems that are flawed.

Lmfaoo. When I was 13 and played WoW my first time I had many choices and saw ‚Äúpvp‚Äù I thought ‚Äúoooh scary I think I better roll PvE‚Äù. This was in early burning crusade and I still enjoyed my world PvP in an alliance guild called ‚Äúhorde killaz‚Äù. 
---
People silly man
---
What shield?
---
tthats ridiculous, most orbs ive seen in a run is 5 but figured you could get more if super lucky. i forgot which but some boe epic dropped one of the runs (I ran about 16 that day lol) and I didn't get it but my only thought was "Wow, it took this long for me to see a boe epic drop and its one that fucking sucks" lol.
---
wtf
---
My favorite thing to do is hang out in booty bay, and then distract people off the ramp into the water during the straight away.
---
Took me 13 days to hit 60 and was at 8 around your level, you‚Äôre doing fine :D
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it role play to want limited information on enemies. Then again, if you like add one like spy which make the game sterile and stripped of elements like surprise, you were also probably that kid who shamelessly screen peeked.
---
*Games aren‚Äôt about having fun.* 
---
-U/AdministrativeZebra8
---
Have you tried not being so unlucky?
---
&gt; Games arnt about having fun. 
---
Oh god, lol. I'm fielding a wild guess that you have an unhealthy relationship with video games.
---
Or they rolled horde cause they liked horde and it turned out they had the number advantage. It's not one or the other lol.
---
I‚Äôm not a metaphorical rich person. I‚Äôve dealt with my fair share of gank squads and alliance taking unfair battles against me. Not once have I been on a boat and someone didn‚Äôt try something against me. Never has a rogue at or above my level not attack me when I‚Äôm vulnerable. Warriors are pretty bad about it too. You know what I did when I was killed on the boat? I just took Res sickness. I don‚Äôt give a damn. Those rogues that kill me? I don‚Äôt go down without a fight. Having a friend helps to fight back. 
---
But I don‚Äôt go and cry on the forums and on reddit when I get killed. It‚Äôs very simple. I signed up to die. I chose a bloody server. And I know this happens to everyone. Even on servers that are 70-30, or even 80-20, there are still going to be gank squads from the lower populated side who make life miserable for the people who aren‚Äôt in groups. 
---
I would say to quest with a friend, but you don‚Äôt seem the kind of person anyone would want to quest with.
---
Areas surrounding flight masters are non-combat zones(or only the flight masters faction can attack so the other faction would be best staying away from the area). No more flight path spawn camping. Add/adjust flight paths to areas that are biased towards one faction so its A more equal time taken to get to said zone(not including zones where main citys are located).
---
WPvP is the best! NO CHANGES
---
That‚Äôs dumb as shit
---
So you love Night Elves more than anything but people shit on them, called them gay, and you want to make them way overpowered? If i was a dev i would change all NE's to only have pink hair color, very suitable
---
Your takes aren‚Äôt hot dude. No one cares what your opinion on the player base is. The point here, which is demonstrated by data, is a significant amount of players are spending more of their time outside of WoW because they find it more enjoyable than getting corpse camped due to server imbalance. You‚Äôre an outlier obviously.
---
I play Horde on what used to be a 50-50 server but has apparently dropped to 60-40 in favor of the Horde. 
---
Every flight path and portal location has at least two Alliance rogues waiting there to attack people. EPL/WPL/Felwood/Winterspring all have multiple 5-10 man Alliance kill teams wandering around. There are always at least 3 separate Alliance groups spread out at certain spots on the way into Dire Maul. BRM is a constant warzone.
---
It absolutely does happen on both sides, except for maybe on servers like Skeram or Stallag, and the reason it doesn't happen there is because the Alliance players there got fucked over by the people who moved to Heartseeker.
---
Urrrh, me not that kind of orc!
---
Was 51, managed to hit 52. Rerolled PvE but don't care as much. Only level 27 there. About to quit my subscription if Phase 3 doesn't fix stuff.
---
Flight paths at Searing Gorge, Azshara, Badlands, EPL and WPL were all camped or had horde just outside range of guards. Can't go more than 5 minutes without getting ganked if I do manage to get away from the FP. It's really fucking stupid.
---
Fair. And you assume correct lol
---
You can pummel a poly cast. But it really depends on who gets the jump on who. If I can charge and hamstring to make a mage burn blink I'm usually ok. Mages are pretty OP against warriors for now.
---
They don't seem to have a ton of 60s currently but I've seen them out with 40s and 50s when Horde comes knocking on Theramore's gates, so I gotta give them some credit
---
Except the fact that servers can hold up to 20k now is a change. Population size is more of an issue then the imbalance.
---
That's what's happening
---
You killed a mob that dropped it, didnt loot it and the corpse had to despawn. Sorry.
---
I've been enjoying retail this past week. Please don't shoot me.
---
no... faction balance is the issue
---
"Just group up and fight bro" he said, his server was only 67% horde "PvP happened on a PvP server bro, just man up and git gud", he looked over his shoulder to make sure that his twelve friends were still on the boat between Menethil and Theramore; "I am a PvP god, zug zug".
---
Unironically, unequivocally: cry about it
---
It isn't modern gaming and if WoW was created from the ground up today, there would be a lot different, including maybe deleting the factions.
---
I wanted to hate, but that third sentence made me like you
---
if your whole guild is doing it, then it is unfair to assume you should be allowed to raid with them without putting in the same effort, or at least expect the loot council to even think of you when a piece drops. if that isnt the environment your friend wants to be in then i would suggest he find a new guild. thats what i would do in his situation. Personally I like being in a guild where everyone is in full prebis because i like clearing MC in an hour and getting back to pvp and 5 mans for fun with my friends who are in more casual guilds.  there are more guilds that dont care than do
---
What a terrible take. Do you honestly think no one just picks the faction they like?
---
Raiders who don‚Äôt realize how useful it is outside of raiding
---
MikScrollingBattleText can do this. For some moves by default and if that nice isn't default, you can set it up to do so.
---
Its not hypocrisy, its people resorting to the lowest common denominator. People (like myself) who dont want LFG in the game would still use it to find groups if it was added, because everyone would be using it to find groups. This isnt hypocrisy.
---
Similarly with spy, I wish it would be blocked, but I'm currently using it because without it I cant do anything in the open world (literally). This is the pinnacle of people resorting to the lowest common denominator, not people being hypocritical.
---
You know there are fishing bots? You know there are bots that are on my list for months? You know there are hundreds of videos of people posting of bots? You know that most likely most bots are in instances where you will NEVER see them?
---
It still surprises me how fucking stupid people in this community are.

Real restrictive.
---
This is a classic sub why are you bringing up health issues for no fucking reason?

Doing this quest below level 12 is such an ordeal that if it doesn't make you to quit, you will eventually hit 60.
---
Nerf orc racial to 10% increased chance would be step #1

No, because then you have to skip either natures swiftness or reduced lightning bolt / chain lightning cast time talents.
---
I'm not gonna repeat anything these guys have already said, but wanna point out a couple things. There are a few pain in the ass items on the bis list (briarwood reed, banthok sash, drakestone, skul's wand) which all conviently have decent replacements and a large number of the items are BoE which you can just buy or have crafted. As far as pet management, I personally put all my pet actions on my mouse and it makes things so incredibly simple. 
---
Also, warlocks seem to be pretty underplayed. At least on my server. They are brought to raids more for utility than damage ATM. Although, as they've pointed out, warlocks get much better in later phases.
---
Sorry that 45/55 balance isn't your game. Have fun on Heartseeker!
---
This particular quest is a nightmare as a rogue, because half the mobs are warlocks with their own Voidwalkers, and as a rogue you kind of just die to that.
---
gnome and dwarf's have really good pvp racials don't know what people saying you have to play horde for the racials..
---
You would have to revamp all racial passives / abilities. Alliance is heavily geared for PvE content (gnomes escape artist make them good warriors / rogues for PvP though) and basically all Horde passives are great for PvP (except trolls, trolls are garbage). They would have to give everyone some form of PvP advantage in the form of racial passives and abilities other wise anyone who‚Äôs ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù about PvP is gonna run Horde and anyone who wants to raid ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù is gonna roll alliance.
---
I think people expected the PvP to be like how it was back in the day. Still a war zone as you say but not 10 people religiously camping every FP, dungeon entrance, capital city hearth point picking off singles and small groups almost 24/7.
---
I think that has changed is its now so hyper competitive that you need to log on at 5am to have a fair chance of handing in a quest in the open world.
---
I think the private servers bred some of this culture, which for those coming back to wow after 15 years break for a nostalgia trip is something quite alien.
---
I‚Äôm actually impressed with the sheer dedication that people are putting into this, not that it makes it particularly fun for anyone even remotely playing the game casually.
---
Meanwhile, it still alerts you to stealthed players and *definitely* has a range of over 50 yards.
---
Guess you didn't get the memo but wanted to sound cool for internet points.
---
Yeah like you need a whole raid and each member gets 10g or 20g. Nothing crazy but compared with the achievement alone, enough to motivate ppl
---
Trash in MC is way harder than any of the bosses.
---
How does that balance numbers? All you‚Äôre doing is making the camp zone a few meters out
---
Yes, theres just one reason we rolled Horde. We're all extreme min/maxers too. In fact all Horde are 60 and already have full T2. We're just that good scrubette.
---
If you try to keep idiots alive while they do idiotic things you'll only risk wiping due to mana problems... or worse, you'll lose money and time by flying through your consumables.  Sometimes the best thing to do is to let a player doing stupid things die.
---
waaah
---
I dont care what people think about my takes are on the player base neither nor the amount of downvotes I'm receiving I'm not arguing the data just the points people are making.
---
That doesn‚Äôt fix balance lol
---
That takes time, which not everyone has.
---
I have about 2 hours of game time on a good week night. Spending 1-1.5 hrs to form a group and get everyone to a dungeon, just to run out of time is not my idea of fun.
---
I'm sure you know one of these is a joke post to mock the other one.
---
In the time it took you to type that out you could have googled the answer as it hasn't changed in the last 16 years
---
This is wayy too low given how important this comment is.
---
Troll is by far the worst race if you look at racials man
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Frodo already went through all 3 movies with the spy addon. It only worked on orcs though, but it's close enough.
---
if you are on a 60-40 server allies on your server has it 50% worse than you. No it doesn't happen on both sides.
---
The fact you're able to get on the boat illustrates perfectly the lack of understanding you have. Menethil is so heavily camped it takes 3-4 deaths just to get *to* the boat, forget dying on it. That's the easy part. You're inconvenienced. Alliance is effectively shut out of the entire world in 48+ zones.
---
Your Phase 1 caliber gank stories are completely immaterial to this situation and equating them just shows how daft you truly are.
---
Okay there‚Äôs no way I believe this, I have over 10 characters above level 12 and I have done this quest multiple times, each time I got it within 10 kills.
---
k?
---
3:1 but 0.85 of the 1 are afk in ironforge or ghosts 
---
The rest are in dungeons
---
Literally what all Horde do.
---
I understand what you are trying to say, I just don't give a fuck about the game or you opinion about it. Go shill for it on their sub.
---
quick question:
---
the fuck would a guy who raidlogs know anything about what happens in game? oh that's right, nothing.
---
dude gets camped for 30min a few nights and bitches on reddit like it's the end of the world. funny part is this same old shit happened 15 years ago on vanilla forums.
---
and i can give two fucks if all the whiny bitches like you quit or hop servers. the server and bg ques will still be fine and nobody will miss you.
---
i have never used honorspy and i have been getting insane chat lag.
---
I literally just went through this as Horde on whitemane. Its assholes being assholes every chance they get. There's no "Horde started it first" its blobs of red nameplates killing 1 or 2 people at a time and occasionally running into a bigger blob and both sides are fucking cocksuckers right now.
---
fuckin lol at all the horde players being smartasses in this thread
---
It‚Äôs about having fun. It shouldn‚Äôt be about ‚Äútime.‚Äù Do what makes you happy. Leveling a new character is fun
---
reduce the suffering, because not enough horde players want to faction change and the players behind the characters wants easy.
---
Shoulda rolled alli where we dont have those quests
---
What if you find end game dungeons and questing fun?
---
Brd is nothing compared to dire maul zone in run
---
i would have planned ahead, had a few more servers up(alot more) linked some of them together atleast in the naming sense for a possibility of future merger,(so people can keep their names) slapped on faction specific ques to encourage bigger diversity while displaying horde/alliance player percentages on the launcher updated daily and ofc, do like most private servers and released BGs at the same time as the Honor system since there was a reason alot of them did that.
---
Then do it :)
---
THE GAME WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THAT MUCH POP ON A SINGLE REALM. That's what is causing all these problems.
---
Yeah because it‚Äôs totally possible to get [Cape of the Black Baron](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13340/cape-of-the-black-baron) just by playing more. 
---
Getting full pre-raid BiS isn‚Äôt necessary and some stuff just doesn‚Äôt drop. Grinding dungeons over and over isn‚Äôt realistic
---
How do you get this data ?
---
Gnome and dwarf are both extremely good
---
On Herod and Stalagg there are more ppl playing 
---
 undead than all of the alliance.
---
Yes they can, but horde druids can‚Äôt do that trick
---
I understand the ranking system very well. I was not aware there was collusion going on to that extent and feel very sorry for the people not ranking with the people colluding. Maybe I'm just a stubborn blind optimist but there must be a way to enjoy it until dec 10th. Like hit and running spots or something idk. But come dec 10th when alliance have insta ques I feel like there will be a sigh of relief to the people that stuck it out.
---
As an Alliance player who was lv 49 when P2 launched, I am level 56 now and it is terrible. Prime time horde camp east PL flight path, Lights hope is constantly camped by 10 horde, I have been farmed inside of everlook 9 out of 10 times, felwood north is constantly horde dominated, etc.  I started an alt on grob since it had been pretty much 50/50 and may make it my new home when I get a feel for things.  
---
Yes, alliance can and does put up a fight. I have joined raids that were put together to clear out east pl FP but here is the difference, alliance doesn't stay and defend their own FPs and horde seemingly camp for hours. When we get a group of 15-20 to clear out the 10-20 horde at an fp we move on to quest/farm again and the horde are back 15mins later and stay there for hours. Alliance players don't want to stay and defend their fps for hours and I can't really blame them. 
---
When menethil always has tons skeletons and east PL (and any other lv50+ FP) is camped everyday primetime by horde the server is not balanced.
---
Well some people enjoy it
---
Sounds like 40 suckers getting milked
---
You need a pocket healer
---
&gt; Blizzard should be held accountable for people not wanting to stay  because they care more about subscription money than making the best and  fairest game possible 
---
The amount of assumptions you made in this sentence is too much.. 2019 Blizz aren't in a position to make Classic the best and fairest game possible. Outside of banning people who break ToS what more could you possibly expect? This is 15 year old game that's experiencing the same 15 year old problems. Classic is inherently unfair. It was designed as such. If you're playing Classic for the fairness aspect... Sorry to break it to you, that was never a selling point or something intended by the original devs. 
---
&gt; I'm totally fine with gold sellers and buyers. I'm just not fine with  the amount of time Blizzard takes to ban OBVIOUS botters that have been  reported hundreds of times. They are able to get out thousands of gold  for each bot and I'm not OK with that. 
---
Which I find quite odd... Your problem is with blizz taking to long to ban automated gold farmers, but not the concept of RMT in general? So what.. you're fine with people cheating as long as it's not automated? What about when you said *"I literally have no intention of quitting WoW if there weren't people cheating."* 
---
??????????
---
&gt; Again, I don't care about people selling/buying gold AT ALL. I care  about people that are able to just have 500+g per day for cheating. 
---
So cheating and RMT is fine, you're quitting caus the devs doesn't ban bots as fast as you want them too. Ok.
---
Ah, good call. Poor form on my part.
---
gnomish
---
As we all know, "flight point" is just one letter off from "fight point".
---
Sometimes people need to hear the truth. OP had to ask a bunch of strangers for their opinion after already getting fucked really hard by the system. If that doesn't tell you that you're a dummy then it's fair if someone tells you.
---
There should be undead gnomes, dwarfs, cows, night elfs, orcs and trolls.
---
Imo for gold farming it's one of the best if not the best atm with DME hydro+zevrim+rtv rush. \~80gph on my server. Need to have mining though.
---
You're greatly misunderstanding what he saying, but I suppose when your experience as a neckbeard is having 40+ hours a week to play classic WoW you wouldn't understand
---
Actually wishing for spell reflect.
---
Anyone under 2 levels from you counts as a dishonorable kill, that would stop the high levels camping for Honor really fast, or at least lessen the blow to people not very close in level
---
However, I would also change how dishonorable kills are calculated, and make it so you have to actually participate in killing the low level by either healing the offending player or hurting the opposing faction member. Grouping would not effect dishonorable kills but regular honorable kills would still work. This would also fix npc dishonorable kills too, where as right now just being grouped with someone is enough.
---
Over thrash blade, for sure.
---
Over Sal rends? Not so much.
---
Btw humans don't get additional 2h skill. Just 1h maces / swords.
---
Name the new guild mutiny
---
Yeah it sounds like solid funneling to me. Make your own guild with group 2. Sometimes guilds want to funnel to the more active players, ex: if u raid log then you‚Äôre probably not gonna get big ticket items. Def sounds a little shady tbo
---
I've gotten to 27 on a horde and alliance toon. Think I have like a day played on each.  Ive learned that I hate Ashenvale, so I never want to level my toons any further.  So I keep making new toons and trying them out.  Maybe someday I'll actually hit 60.
---
In dungeons prot warrior, in raids priest
---
Suicide Kings with verrryyy light loot council is best loot system. DKP is for chodes
---
Keks in orcish
---
Yes, this is happening now as a result of people honor farming the only reasonably efficient way they can. In TBC the bulk of die hards live inside arena pushing rating, or farming BGs in premades. The honor system also changes in TBC. 
---
In TBC there's very little incentive to camp every spot known to man in raid groups other than if you enjoy it and those people are a minority whereas that just isn't the case with 1.4 honor but no BGs.
---
Usually when this happens it‚Äôs cause your tank got knocked away, and while he is running in the melees get clobbered.
---
We use an OT who runs In when the MT goes flying
---
But you just said that every raiding guild should complete raids as fast as they can. You're not being consistent here.
---
I mean you could have chosen a less stupid sounding name.  No wonder you have PTSD, I‚Äôd camp you too, hope Horde on your server do the same.
---
And of tbc* Which people seem to forget when bending over for tbc
---
It was 45/55 before Alliance started crying and leaving.
---
Boy are you gonna feel stupid: https://www.wowhead.com/news=296592/in-game-combat-log-range-reduced-to-50-yards-in-classic-wow
---
This is really only superior if you have a standard mouse. It's easier for sure but personally I find it inferior:)
---
I‚Äôm a Hunter main w/ Rhok‚Äôdelar and only three items not pre-BiS - one being SGC. 
---
I‚Äôm aware of my contribution and consistently pull good DPS - but I‚Äôd rather walk naked through hell than farm SGC. It‚Äôs just not going to happen - the item isn‚Äôt good enough nor does it last long enough to justify the time I‚Äôd spend on it. I‚Äôm more likely to get my t1 chest quicker than I could reliably farm that. 
---
Your amount of pre-BiS is a factor my guild takes with loot, though. You don‚Äôt have to be fully decked out but you can‚Äôt stroll in w/ full greens and expect an equal chance as someone who has put in some effort.
---
My server it‚Äôs reversed, the alliance are the higher numbers and doing the shitty shit to the horde. You are not all angels you know
---
Prot warrior imho.
---
I don't think you understand. I enjoyed the game plenty leveling my first character, that was very fun. Open world pvp was fun and engaging. But I don't want to do the same thing again. After 4 weeks of leveling, I want progression, not repeating the same thing with small changes. I found end game open world questing fun and dungeons fun on may main character.
---
Having "no time" is kind of stupid to be honest. Two hours per day is a LOT of time per day for someone who's working full time and supporting a family. On weekends I play more, but that can't be done either. If you're saying you need to play 10 hours a day and not have any responsibilities, maybe. But phase 1 was very fun and enjoyable for me, I could actually land in Chillwind point or Morgan's Vigil and get out. Now I can't even leave IF.
---
No, I had no idea pvp servers would be this bad come P2. My co-workers and friends all said not rolling on a PvP server would be missing out, so I rolled with them on a PvP server. But then they see what's happening. All but one guy quit the game. Most of them played vanilla, and they all say it was never this bad. Blizzard fucked up.
---
So I stopped playing as well, for now. I can't justify spends ng this much time on something that I no longer enjoy - being corpse camped everywhere I go.
---
haha classic Americans
---
Not all countries celebrate thanksgiving btw
---
I'm starting to think maybe the MMORPG genre just attracts people like this. How else would we end up with such a heavy concentration of empathy-devoid status chasers?
---
kek
---
It is better to get used to a key bind for travel form on it's own. It is possible to do it with a cast sequence macro but would still take multiple inputs
---
I‚Äôm literally getting camped in UC. Just loving alts till I can actually play
---
It's really not. Before the addon people did camp their combat logs. That is not new and is considered a skill. An addon doing the same thing is no different than what you can do on an individual level.
---
Omg you fucking **crybaby**.
---
Here sweetie =  [https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/704xn/p05rn65l.jpg](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/704xn/p05rn65l.jpg)
---
Also the servers are bigger than they were in the heyday of twinks anyway
---
He‚Äôs complaining about the same thing everyone else is. It‚Äôs hard to not understand. I also understand your being a dick tho
---
horde get it just as badFlamecrest Flight path is Camped 24/7 by alliance
---
That‚Äôs why I solo it or bring duo it with someone who has it XD Seems a lot of people see a few under 15 runs which doesn‚Äôt fit the 4% drop.
---
If you'd like to argue the point any further, come over to the Fight Club warrior Discord and see what they have to say about it.  
---
 [https://fightclub.academy/](https://fightclub.academy/)   
---
There has been extensive discussion and testing on the Ragnaros fight.
---
A level 60 alliance rogue camping the Portal in Orgrimmar then he Rezing people using a level 10 priest so they rez at low HP and one shots them on the rogue to get more Honor faster im sure this is against the Rules with Collusion.
---
Imo it limits the amount of people new players can group with. If all your doing is spamming dungeons with a 60 all day that‚Äôs missing the point of Classic to me. Grouping, fighting your way through dungeons and questing is part of the experience. There will be less people to group with because everyone just follows the meta of ‚Äúrun with 60‚Äôs for money‚Äù, thus making group finding even more difficult for new players (or people who simply enjoy it like me). I wont help perpetuate that meta.... But that‚Äôs my opinion on it.
---
hmm i‚Äôm playing classic and am having fun but what are some of the issues everyone is having with the game? just looking to learn or empathize
---
it looks like this where "Greater Heal" is obviously the spell that is in the mouse over macro
---
 /cast \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\] Greater Heal
---
Holy crud I didn‚Äôt realise that was a thing, I have the addon but that never occurred to me! Thanks for the tip
---
I was Horde on Herod and left for Earthfury. Just helping the alliance out.
---
Not on the form currently since I‚Äôm measuring confirmed drops, but feel free to share how many runs your on so far or how many HoJs you‚Äôve see. while grinding for it.
---
The point is to have fun you sperg
---
Unfortunately I still haven‚Äôt heard a single solution that would solve the problem. I just don‚Äôt see how the problem can be fixed without impacting user experience.
---
Blizzard can‚Äôt ‚Äòforce‚Äô you on to a faction, this wouldn‚Äôt work. People would want to play with their friends or they may want to be a specific faction, etc. Or this system could be abused where someone can keep making characters until they get the faction they want and ignore the 10 other characters that were created in the process. 
---
Faction based queues, especially this late into the game, doesn‚Äôt work either imo. I am horde on a horde dominated server and I think it would be unfair to punish people who simply joined a server at launch. I didn‚Äôt join for any advantage or anything like that and it would be unfair to now have the game be unplayable for hours due to a queue that wasn‚Äôt mentioned at launch and may have impacted people‚Äôs decisions. I also think it‚Äôs unfair to ask players like myself to then transfer to a server where I‚Äôm going to get stomped., flipping places isn‚Äôt a solution either. This could ultimately lead to loss of player base as well, as I think people would only deal with it for a few weeks and it wouldn‚Äôt get better with time. 
---
Maybe if you Blizz implemented a mass transfer, where on one day x amount of people are being transferred so that the servers would be balanced from the get go type of idea may work, but again, how do you guarantee friends and guilds stay together?
---
How come ? I have two extra buttons and on thumb and i have enough combinations on my mouse with ctrl shift alt etc . Also i can keep my target on boss or mob/person of interest and heal everyone without switching targets . Soo no reason how that is inferior in raid scenario to mouseover macros
---
You can't transfer from a PvP to a pve server right now.
---
I know I did. Shazzrah EU
---
At this point most Alliance have accepted defeat and are waiting in IF for BGs, gotta do what ya gotta do.
---
Don't join DKP guilds.
---
I have a 60 ally and am rolling a horde, it's a pretty big contrast in 'culture'.  Horde are far more spergy (probably younger), but chat is also more lively.  Also, I think the character models might have something to do with it, perhaps one tends to subtly play as their character would.
