Duuuuuuude I'm worried the internet is going to make classic different than it was. The game will be the same, but the meta will change somehow cause of weird ass threads and forums like this
---
Even at that gear level it's easy to see warrior is going to win more often than not. The only reason the druid gets the win there is because of a lucky intercept resist and because the warrior didn't use any pots/items at all. With a rage potion and an intercept landing that is not a close fight, even in 'medium' level gear, let alone proper naxx gear.
---
I‚Äôm hardly a classic elitist my argument is the exact opposite but virtue signal harder you stupid goose.
---
Early in Vanilla, battlegrounds were only between Horde and Alliance on a particular server. This caused serious issues on servers with imbalanced populations because the queue times could be insufferable. I don't recall the patch in question, but Blizzard made battlegrounds select players from all servers in a particular server group to alleviate wait times. It was the first major instance of cross-server player interactions, long before cross-server dungeons ever existed.
---
It could happen, but it won‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt. That time frame is either account sharing (against ToS) or simply not healthy.
---
It can be anything with the 40 mans really.  Maybe a high end guild do alt or gearing runs for their JV members, and just want to fill spots or have certain classes.  Sometimes people will sell raid items or spots for gold.  What I will be doing is just go to discord or forums and post in advance advertising for a group.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if someone made r/wowclassiclfg or something as well.  Early on there will be a lot of groups that just don‚Äôt have 40 players at lv 60, and will lfg in major cities to fill up.  
---

---
Doing a full Molten Core with an inexperienced group could take days, but doing Onyxia with 15-20 people who know what to do and nother 20 who can play their class and follow a few directions could take 20 minutes.
---
oh good call
---
I feel like you and I specifically go back and forth about this. If you dont play rs3 and osrs you shouldnt post a wall of text of how it is wrong or bad. Starting the post saying you arent trying to take a stance like that then providing only opinion as examples is also not helpful. The fact of the similarities of game age/falling playerbase on the modern version/finite endgame leading to majority stagnation is undeniable. They arent the same game but simply saying you dont think it would work because you dont believe it will isnt really a good argument. Wow being larger and having people from everywhere is as if rs is only played in one region of the world or something. You are building a position with no facts or even experience. Osrs also has specific requirements to vote on specific content to prevent troll accounts or bots from swaying the vote, but you wouldnt know that because apparently you googled for 10 minutes. I also really like how you close your post by saying you cant use future you dont know as an argument against the wall of text where youve done the same thing about a game you dont play lol. Did you not learn to write argumentative papers in highschool?
---
I'm hoping for 60 in the first phase.

---
Anyone who doesn‚Äôt relate to (or at least can appreciate) this is part of the problem!
---
The way I think of it is Life Steal if it's a fast weapon and 30 SP for slower ones. The cut-off would be somewhere around 2.2 speed, but I have no exact math on this.
---
You don't.
---
Since I'm gonna play Warrior and won't be pausing to do BG's or gear up around specific twinkable levels, I figure it's best to just rush to 60
---
With meat sauce!
---
Yeah it was pretty late in vanillas cycle if I recall. Has blizzard confirmed that they will be doing cross realm battleground groups?
---
I snagged this one today with a couple of guildies. Context was that we killed one of his guild members earlier. First a Bloodfang rogue came for us and died a couple of times, then five minutes later this absolute unit with thunderfury went for us and failed. Hilarious time on comms for all.
---
/?
---
Damn this is hype. Thank you friend. King‚Äôs honor.
---
There are several fears in vanilla that offer no warning. The Berserkers in ZG are one such example, and one of those can very quickly wipe a raid and crush morale. People tend to not pay as close attention during trash, or they'll be semi-afk fixing their music play list or something. The raid strings out instead of stays together then recovering from a bad fear with no fear ward gets harder and harder.
---
This sort of thing happens even in hardcore guilds, unless they are doing a focused speedrun.
---
The benefit from Human and Night Elf don't even compare. Even casuals should go dwarf unless they truly have no plans to raid or pvp. Fear ward is even stronger in pvp.
---
Sadly this is the era where Priest is forced to be Holy because Shadow for the most part won't do good enough damage and raids only really allow for just one Shadow Priest but I think Hardcore raiders will only allow Mage, Hunters and Warlocks. Balance Druid, Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priest have no place in Classic. :(

Agreed, all of the people I knew back in 2004-2008 have moved on. It's a shame and I don't think bringing back vanilla will change anything.

\&gt;S - BRD iconic place with varied encounters and enemies that all fit the theme. love the arena, the prison, lyceum etc. the place feels so large even on the 100th run through. tons of quests and great drops.  
---
\&gt;A
---
 \- Strath is basically two dungeons, you get two very different types of runs with their own unique challenges. burning city feels kinda sick. holds relevance for the righteous orbs. i really like the idea of making dungeons relevant with materials this way.
---
\- Scholo has always felt a bit more difficult then the others, tight crowded spaces with a little bit more challenging enemies. love the miniboss design  
---
\- Dire Maul varies from each wing, tribute runs for buffs, east jump runs for abars keep these places relevant long after you finish gearing from them (same as strat orbs)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- LBRS maybe i should of had this one lower, holds special place to me because of plenty of good memories of people dreading going into here. the runs taking forever and people complaining about it but looking back fondly on the struggles. this place just always feels like it take FOREVER.
---
\&gt;B 
---
\- Maraudon i like the way it looks, nothing really remarkable about the place but a solid instance regardless. I always make sure to do this one.
---
\- SFK this place used to be my favorite, took forever to get to as alliance and probably wasnt worth it for gear/exp but i had fun doing it.  
---
\- Scarlet monastery love this place, my favorite wing is probably the armory. playing warrior i loved getting the ww axe and hardly ever winning the other pieces. definitely going to run this one a few times while leveling.
---
\&gt;C all the C tier i don't really care for. they werent bad but nothing really great either. maybe i should of put deadmines and wailing caverns at B though. those were great first dungeons that were either really awesome or really terrible depending on the people you got in group. nobody really having abilities made it a challenge sometimes  
---
\&gt;D
---
\- Uldaman i could never get good groups for this, always someone would have to leave, tank would be so bad we couldnt progress, or we would just suck idk. i kind of dodged doing it
---
\- Gnomeregan same thing as uldaman, just never really had good runs with it. plus i just didnt like it for whatever reason. LFM Gnomer? thats a CBA
---
\- Sunken Temple wasn't that bad, maybe unfair to put it so low. skipped to do other things usually since quests were pretty good around this level
---
\- RFC felt uninspired and low effort. thats a dodge for sure
---
September unfortunately...
---
Or maybe the first day of summer and a blue post saying nothing more than the servers are now up boys!

Is nobody going to talk about how prot paladins are one of the best aoe grinding classes? 
---
Ever seen a prot paladin pull sorrow hill and not die?
---
Spec a little into holy and slap on a healing gear and youll heal almost as good as any holy paladin...
---
Prot paladin sure is overpowered but so underrated
---
I managed to finish every raid except last boss of AQ40 and most of Naxx because tbc came too soon. I want to kill all the bosses and get all the purpz on my rogue, and then enjoy pvp casually. Maybe go for rank14 but that's not a hard goal.
---
Yeah I think it's almost mandatory to be horde with this goal
---
Fleet Commanders Hat, pretty sure some achievement stuff happened and all my characters now have one.
---
Was that a meme back in the day or something? 50 pages full of that sentence is suspicious.
---
Yeah rofl, I tried to wonder what dwight would say if he played WoW
---
I don't know if they have, but I do know that it was introduced before 1.12, and this is one of those patch changes that I expect to be in the game from the outset, like the 8 to 16 debuff limit change in the ZG patch.
---
Mage is a very nice casual class. Easy to level, not gear dependant, has plenty of conveniences like portal, conjured food and easy gold grinding.
---
+1 Soupa
---
He is the cure to internet's toxicity.
---
With 0 hit or weap skill bonus its like 26 chance to miss vs 9 percent.
---
Yo, he was roleplaying like a boss. Why should he have to go to a normal realm?!
---
In what way am I virtue signaling? Guy asked a question, another guy answered with a video explaining. You say ignore it, then in the next comment explain everything the video states. I'm guessing you just learned the term and wanted to sound clever?
---
Honestly, the worst fearing mobs are trash. Berserkers in ZG while people aren't focused between bosses, and the warrior mobs in the mindslayer packs of AQ40 between Twin Emps and Ouro/C'Thun.
---
A wipe to trash is far more demoralizing than to a boss, so removing those wipes save a lot of stress and agony.
---
Many mobs that fear offer no warning when they will cast it, so stance dancing is unreliable.
---
Many mobs that fear cast this fear more often than the cooldown of Berserker Rage, so stance dancing is not always reliable.
---
Simple answer is that if you raid, even casually, or pvp at all, and don't go dwarf, you will regret it down the line. It's not about min-maxing it's about an encounter changing spell vs a small amount of spirit, or night elf appearance.
---

Doing this as Alliance might be a way to buck the trends and also find more prey.
---
Thats probably an issue with my english, rather than bias. In that particular reddi, the thread about OSRS is made in one repeatable way.
---
Someone makes a thread and sais that "OSRS is good" But they don't provide anything. Im not here to tell you that OSRS is good or bad game, im here to tell people that it's not something that just works and everyone is happy. There are arguments and that is a fact, this thread is more for people that ALSO haven't played OSRS but didn't even try to look it up as well.
---
As the ending, i wrote that bad, or my english called again.
---
I will rephrase then. The game is dead depending on how Blizzard looks at it. IMO if they follow the words of Brack, then whether 1 million people play, or 1000, it shouldn't matter. Therefore the game might not ever die. It's impossible to become emptier than that.
---
Thanks for pointing up that part.
---
Yeah, elves come from trolls, and they are indeed my favorite horde race. But still, NE druid is too alluring after reading how they came to be and how badass Malfurion truly is.

You're going to need some line breaks if you want anyone to be able to read your text.

Well crossrealm battlegrounds was introduced in 1.12 (source:  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_1.12.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0) )  
---
And blizzard have stated several times for authenic classic experience and that they will base Classic around 1.12 so find it very unlikely that they won't be doing cross realm bgs.
---
I read it just fine...
---
Oh my, you brought back some PTSD memories of getting aquatic form for me.  I thought it was the toughest thing ever.   Granted I was a little kid, probably not even a teen yet.  The satisfaction of being able to swim super fast and not need to breathe was awesome.
---
Thanks for updating your blog...
---
Having sets for pure builds is easy, just have one of the set bonuses directly synergize with the 31-point talent. Want a Fire Mage set? Have it make Combustion last for 5 crits instead of 3. Want a Frost Mage set? Have it make Ice Barrier also boost your damage while active.
---
And if they *do* want to keep some creativity they could make those the 8-piece set bonuses. That way if you want to go pure Frost then you go for a full 8-piece Frost set, but if you want a hybrid spec then you could get 5 pieces of the Frost set and 3 pieces of some other set. How flexible they want the system to be is itself pretty flexible.
---
But really they should look at it on a case-by-case basis. If the current best Mage spec is an Arcane build that only deals Frost damage then there's no reason to make a new set that benefits that hybrid spec and they should instead go for more pure sets. But on the other end, if the best Hunter spec is pure Marksmanship then focusing on some hybrid specs would be the better option. That's how you avoid excessive power creep.
---
If you dont mind spending a bit more time, go rogue and lvl to 10 for sprint.
---
Shouldn't have trouble playing another game since everyone just bots OSRS anyways. Friend of mine was on the top of the leaderboard for a few months before I convinced him "I don't care now please stop telling me about it". Probably still is. Not a healthy game by my estimation.
---
Amazing, thanks for showing me this

Your schedule looks almost exactly like mine. I‚Äôve never played vanilla or a pserver though, started in early BC so I‚Äôm aiming for 60 in maybe the first 2 months!
---
I replied elsewhere with this video, but Melderon does a great job of explaining threat in depth and in an easy to absorb way
---
I doubt Classic will start with cross-server BGs.
---
They only implemented this later in Vanilla to combat faction disparities on certain servers.
---
If they do implement this, it will be later in Classic when doing BGs becomes a problem for certain servers.
---
Fuck love these. The hype is real boys! Can‚Äôt wait to dive into classic with y‚Äôall!

Compared to things like a rank 14 grind or being a bleeding edge raider, I'd say it's pretty relaxed. Especially without any real tangible "goal."

That's why it's up to you to build the community you want to be a part of.
---
I don't think so. The character has that now, but its likely from holding money from my main in tbc or something. My rogue was my enchanter also and was sent items to DE hence some of the resources in bag. Honestly I don't remember. Didn't think people would be so OCD. Of course I have run around and done random shit like.. go to transmog, go to area 52 and grab the armor i was missing. But I have not played the character for exp, or for loot since TBC was released.
---
I'm here for a good run, not a long run.
---
fuck me, couldn't have made it any harder to read? Not even gonna bother.
---
Best feeling ever is when it‚Äôs already leaving and you jump anyway, and land in the little balcony on the zeppelin basement.
---
Do humans have the escapability natural ability?
---
It was definitely better than whatever dumb leather helmet I was wearing at the time! However, I think trolls seriously got the short end of the stick for armor in classic, because the Raging Berserker‚Äôs Helm, and other similar helms, were cut off in front for them. Like the entire part that made it cool was missing. They fixed this later, but it was too late for me.
---
Captain placeholder. He was the hero we all needed and was admired by all.
---
If the warrior uses pots a druid will use them too, if a druid faps there is literally no way for a warrior to even get a hit off on the druid for 30 seconds. Resist intercept don't matter this was a PVE druid in PVE spec facetanking one of the best warriors to play on private servers and he still managed to win, a resto or balance druid would not even have been touched.
---
Remember that Classic is releasing with phases not because they are being implemented in new patches but because Blizzard wants to shunt progression and provide an "authentic" experience. Cross-server BGs aren't content. They were essentially a "bug fix" for a civil engineering issue. Just like Blizzard's confirmation of limited sharding in starter zones to facilitate server lag, I wouldn't be surprised at all if they release cross-realm BGs in the same phase they release BGs at all to maintain a stable, constant experience for PvPers across all servers and avoid human-caused server issues.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can. I remember having one for all the mana gems. There will be a mage thread at some point sharing favourite macros. (I hope)
---
Patched out in 1.8 apparently, classic is based on 1.12, so no need internal information to deduce that it most likely won't be in the game
---
Wall of texts never read fine. Don't encourage it.
---
Probably doesn't smell that good there though...
---
Would be awesome if they made new content for Classic and I don't mean everything from TBC or after that. I say what they should do is give us all the cut content that didn't make it back then that was planned for Vanilla such as the Azshara Crater battleground, the original Emerald Dream and anything else from this list.
---

Think of it as an alternate universe version of WoW where the events in WoW went differently.

I mean yeah.....
---
It's just when I'm making slight,  but needed differences it's just annoying.
---
When it came out in BC I thought it was pretty awesome
---
It's going to release early September, Tuesday September 3rd to be exact. The same time it was originally announced back in 2001 at ECTS.
---
That seems a silly reason to play a whole different faction... Not judging, just sayin, I'd be mad at my friends for voting because of some negligibly differences.

Great podcast. Really enjoying it.

Just listened to the Molten Core podcast.

I apologize, I should have broken it into paragraphs in hindsight, but I was just typing this out from memory as it came to me.
---
My play schedule is quite similar to yours but I bet I won't even be close to 60 at the end of the month, not the whole "i want to enjoy the experience" thing, more so I'm just not efficient enough, I learned this playing poe. Long flight path? Start going down the YouTube rabbit hole and realize I landed 20 mins ago. Long corpse run? Line up a straight path to body and auto run as far as you can... come back 10 mins later and realize I'm in the middle of nowhere... etc etc

I still think she should be given boss status and should be something to contend with when Horde raid IF.

I posted above, I mostly solo farmed Tyr's hand for BOE purples, and remember getting a Krol blade and a dagger which I can't remember the name of. When I was getting camped by some horde I would move to the scarlet crusade spot in the north of the plaguelands and stealth farm the crusader enchant formula which I got a number of times.
---
On top of that, when I started getting more gear I went deep into Winterspring where the demons are to farm the unique boe thing priests needed for the staff. These were the 'big' ticket things that got me money, but other then that things like.. grinding silithus for AQ event and stuff just had a steady flow coming in. Although the guild I was in we go to 4 horsemen, I don't recall spending large amounts of money on consumables and stuff to i typically just saved money.

---
The fact that they made this server,  much to their now clear view that what they created sucks. 
---
There have been so many prevalent pservers that blizzard finally wants to cash in...
---
So the fact they can't add 1 server to fill  n obvious need is pretty stupid. 
---
Keep thinking they are doing this for us...... gtfo lmao
---
So much cringe. Not just the mage fight but most of the video
---
That just brought back a flood of flashbacks and good feelings. Alliance for me 100%
---
Its possible, but mages/warriors/rogues will still do more damage. It would be a serious uphill battle
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Unfortunately when I go into raiding I was like... the 6th rogue or something on the roster. I did manage to snake a raid spot by being the only hemo rogue but it did mean it was rare that I was getting gear. I joined mid AQ prog and we rarely ran BWL from that point on so I never really got the chance to replace it :P. Also I was a massive noob... what was dps 13 years ago, i just had mad fun.
---
Taladril is on this video. Nice! That dude is a beast.
---
You're right, that was added in very early in the game. Though I can't remember exactly when, if it was vanilla or BC. I am inclined to say later in vanilla.
---
If I remember right, it was pitched as a diminishing returns of 4 attempts on the last item for a quest. So the most you'd have to kill was 4 creatures, on the last item. But I never played attention to whether that was the case or not. I just went on questing.
---
Making friends is not nearly as socially daunting as finding a significant other.
---
We understand the argument and just disagree. It's just not the same as buying from the AH. BoE drops are part of running dungeons and are valid upgrades for attendees who should need them. It's not equivalent of saving 100g beause most people (myself included) would not actually go buy that same BoE on the AH. So they aren't making money over the rest of the group by upgrading, they're gaining a intrinsic value of gear and excitement to upgrade their toon.
---
Ok that makes sense, thank you!
---
I totally share your concern there. I‚Äôm worried the social atmosphere of the internet has completely changed since classic and people will be less willing to be as friendly as they used to be.
---
I feel confident that there are others who will be playing just like I am. I'm sure the min/maxers and server first people will die off, but there will always be true die hard fans.
---
A great example is Diablo 2. I've been playing it off and on since Diablo 3 launched, moreso lately now that i'm hungry for old that Blizzard feel. The game is absolutely still alive. I found plenty of people playing, because they love the game and find it insanely replayable.
---
A lot of people are touch and go with games nowadays, flocking to whatever is new, but you shouldn't underestimate the number of players who stay back and play the games they love.
---
I still remember my battlegroup. Bloodlust pride!!!!
---
Best answer. Was full T2 rogue, and pve druids decked out in AQ40/naxx just do not go down. The whittled me away for 5 minutes but they would usually win.
---
So you either corpse run or level an alt for 30 minutes. 
---
You're definitely a PVE type of guy.
---
Maybe all the people are just not accepting that they would much prefer aPVE server but their pride won't allow them too.
---
When I get killed I can be pretty annoyed,  but it's also kinda motivating to get back and try to avenge myself

Why is black lotus good?

You'd want to spam frost shocks anyways. It doesn't create extra aggro and it benefits from curse of the elements and winter's chill.

no-one is arguing in bad faith here. And you're coming off as an ass because you're insulting people's intelligence that you can't understand how we possibly don't agree with your pure amazing logic. I will be needing on upgrades that I would wear and will call out people who need just to sell it as ninja, because it is.

Unless, you're a top end raiding guild, not really. Vanilla isn't hard content, at the least through molten core/BWL you can bring 8 druids and still do fine
---
You're 100% right and this is what I did during vanilla..... however...
---
It's barely even a noticeable change....
---
The only negative is more gold in the actual flowing economy.
---
It‚Äôs pvplite
---
This character was rolled when they released oceanic servers. 95 days played from Nov2005 until TBC give give or take a few hours, something like 14months?

you're abstracting the loot items to their AH values when some of us just want to play the game and equip the shit we fought for rather than buy overpriced items from the AH.
---
not like it matters but I was the 1000's upvote... also alliance ftw
---
Then we agree sort of. I do believe AQ40 would be challenging but when it comes to Naxx, I really can't imagine many people going in there. If our younger selves couldn't get to Kel, I don't see how our older selves would.
---
Blizzard has no doubt learned very much in the last 15 years for how to curb gold selling. Granted they won't be using one of the techniques they learned, buying and selling game time with gold.
---
But that means it will be up to us even more to police our own community and Report gold sellers.
---
Me, my brother and a friend hopped in a round of castle wars a few weeks ago late on a Friday night.  We were pretty drunk, but man I miss content like castle wars.
---
it's not worth the same to everyone. To one or two players it is worth the upgrade value - this intangible benefit of "progress" that triggers dopamine rewards in the brain from the time spent of running a dungeon and seeing that random drop. The reward at least for me and many players is much higher in that setting than farming up greys to vendor and then buy something from the AH.
---
Lvl 60 male dwarf paladin, I got blessing of protection BABY!

Naked Gnome races.

Level 1.  Stormwind City to Booty Bay.

PvP server or PvP flags on.
---
I wouldn't have thought these would be rare. I still have every original manuals and Brady Games guides all the way from first edition for classic, all the way through Wrath, including the dungeon and leveling guides and bestiaries.
---
With all the talk about even Blizzard possibly not having 100% correct information, let alone pservers, how accurate to reality do you think all the values in the guides really are?
---
Either way, I'm so glad I kept them all.
---
If a blue answers a random ? on forums are we chalking that up as the blue post for the week these days. Not really an update of any sort.

With all the talk about even Blizzard possibly not having 100% correct information, let alone pservers, it would be neat if these were indeed technically valuable.
---
A lot of people never knew this was a mechanic in Vanilla, before they changed how their wall textures operated. If you faced a wall at *exactly* a cardinal direction right angle (by getting an add-on to tell you your bearing), you could climb up walls by jumping repeatedly into them. It allowed you to scale up the side of Hyjal, the walls of Orgrimmar, Grim Batol, etc. Obviously it was a wise idea to have a slow fall effect to get back down.
---
Some of my best memories in Vanilla and BC were the times that I climbed to impossible locations and watched other people try to follow me, or when I did it just for exploration purposes.
---
We have 15 more years of experience and knowledge, and no future expansions to make us rush.  I look forward to the first raid clears without warrior tanks, priest heals, or mage dps...just to show it can be done.
---
Will it be optimal?  Of course not.  Will it be a fun and exciting new challenge?  Heck yeah.
---
Most likely solo DME by enslaving the satyrs
---
Feral druid.
---
Play a warrior because your guild leader will make sure they are OP and that Paladins never are any good.
---
Its fine. Ironforge really is the best city and its very close to Blackrock Mountain. Humans rep advantage is nice. 
---
Can you convince me to roll Horde?
---
Well you couldn't hold your breath very long at all in vanilla, so any buff to that would be big (I don't even remember if it was in Vanilla, barely played warlock)
---
These days it gives a swim speed buff, which is useful once in a while
---
No. That‚Äôs gnome only. Great in pvp for warriors and rogues. Still great for lock just less so
---
I like it.
---
ROFLMAO I LOVE THIS
---
*champing
---
I remember thinking it was just luck if i managed to get past those dark ground textures that stop you halfway up a random hill in the barrens. It'll be interesting with more well known information to see what happens!
---
I don't think you do. Also, even if you did, you could wait outside until he clears up to the boss that drops the loot then roll on it from the gate.
---
Not really lmao

---
I know your making a joke but nah man...
---
So exactly like the others then haha, got it
---
&gt;Exactly! So why should just one guy get the 100g jackpot? 
---
Not just one guy gets a 100g jackpot, it goes around often multiple times during the dungeon. Sometimes it's your lucky day sometime's it's somebody else. And it's not a 100g jackpot if that person will equip it. If none in the group would immediately equip the item as an upgrade, then it is worth its AH value to everyone and should be a fair roll to all. If not, it's just part of that person's lucky day for character progression, it is literally not a sack of 100g because that already gets distributed evenly like XP.
---
I read all of this in the starting narrator‚Äôs voice. 
---
I have goosebumps.
---
I fucking lost my shit at the Jim gulp
---
friggin preach.
---
I will miss having Redridge to prowl as a 22, since I‚Äôm going alli in Classic. There‚Äôs no real equivalent to Redridge. Maybe stonetalon, but nobody goes there anyways, and if I get killed it‚Äôs a 10 min run back, so there‚Äôs less people to kill.
---
But I could always go 36-38 for Desolace and STV if I ever want to relive my rogue experience.
---
Sticky thread. Use it.
---
Does this work on expansions past Vanilla?
---
Or you'd like to be able to afk while raiding
---
Guys, it's a bad joke. He's referencing one of the old head developers of WoW, who previously got his fame by being a vocal EQ player.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the one that‚Äôs in wow today. Is that gone?
---
I said ret not mage
---
That was soo good! I laughed hard when Dwight asked for rogues and druids hahahaha
---
I bet you're a lot of fun at parties.
---
The point want a legitimate "what class should I play?"
---
It was more of a "Hey, it's 2004, WoW isn't released yet, the closest thing we have to WoW is EQ. Thinking about taking up this new game coming out, what are your thoughts" kind of playing pretend. Hoo boy your imagination must be shot.
---
How is the Classic community crying for handouts when the game isn‚Äôt out yet? 2004 WoW did have a more adventurous and less ingrained idea of the game, and that won‚Äôt come back for the most part. 
---
But how can you say you don‚Äôt like the community before the game is even out? You can say you don‚Äôt like *this* community, or private servers communities and have a leg to stand on. But how can you judge the community that doesn‚Äôt exist yet? That‚Äôs nonsense.  
---
?
---
way too many hooves on that bad boy
---
Wrath 4 horseman wasn‚Äôt tank and spank. It still had the same tank switching and corner switching stuff it did before, just with fewer tanks and a little bit less going on because of the 15 fewer people in the raid. It wasn‚Äôt nearly as hard, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt tank and spank.
---
At least you kinda got it. Figured it was something a bit different than the hundreds of "give me blue post nao!' threads and legitimate "omg how should I play wow classic" threads. Just meant to be a fun diversionary thread.
---
Ret does auto attack damage, at least mage has a one button rotation
---
Since he's asking specifically about mindlessly grinding mobs without paying much attention, it has to be mentioned that hunters need to keep an eye on ammo and pet happiness.
---
smart
---
July 16 is on the table still. After may 16, it‚Äôs unlikely, but I don‚Äôt think we will necessarily see more than a 2 month advance release, and anything more than 0-2 weeks beta.
---
This is my plan. I'm going to noilfe level my undead rogue so that I can park myself at the entrance to STV and kill every alliance player coming though one time. No camping, no mocking, just one quick death. Just so they know what awaits them in the jungles.
---
Yes ma'am!
---
LOL ty!
---
Warlock - Tailoring and skinning
---
Hunter - Herbalism and alchemy
---
Then you can make all the pots and flasks you‚Äôd like. You can use the leather to get mats for hunter gear. Tailoring will give you some BIS. Also replace alchemy and skinning if you want engineering. Can make some fun toys that are useful in PvP and PvE. Also don‚Äôt really worry about professions until your 60. Leveling first aid would be more useful than tailoring. Skinning adds time to leveling. Herb and alchemy can easily fall behind. Getting 60 first will make all areas of the game easier.
---
Skinning + Leatherworking for you guys, sell extra.
---
Herb + Alch for you guys, sell extra herbs and pots.
---
At least that's how I'd do it balancing the ability to get the gear you want and still generate cash.
---
are you saying you play a rogue and you're crying about being ganked lol? bruh become the danger
---
Seal, Judgement, Consecration, Oil of immolation, Sappers, Grenades, pulling too much threat and bubbling, spamming mana potions+Dark runes, more engaging than youd think
---
haha ty for the upvote! &lt;3
---
Pserver is gonna be nothing like the hell that was STV when you actually had to level there. my god that was the most fun I've ever had in WoW, first on my warrior and then when I came through with my rogue and took revenge.
---
Why you holdin' out on Lok tho mate
---
I'll probably hit in the first 2 weeks cause I have no life.
---
I just need to find a raiding guild that is also filled to the brim with no lifers charging to 60.
---
Bruh, there's a new meta. Wear T2 and spell gear, and have a 3 button / 8 second rotation with actual competitive DPS.
---
Ret has joined the ranks of moderately well endowed D (if not BigD) DPS.
---
Are they swinging they weapon or they paws?
---
Admittedly, I farmed and worked hard to make my gold. However, there's multiple gold sinks in the game. Whether it's an amazing item to buy (the best items can only be earned not bought.. well I guess you could pay for a guild to run you through a raid but that's a whole other thing).
---
Or mounts 90g at lvl 40 and 900 at 60.
---
Or repairs from dying (die a lot in raids).
---
Or buying potions and other buffs (again usually for raids).
---
Or leveling professions.
---
Plenty of ways to pay to play, but at least in my experience most people found ways to make the gold themselves rather than paying someone for it.
---
Always exceptions and to those people... I SMH
---
That lady who walks around Stormwind with a bunch of kids following her
---
Not very handy having your bank alt parked outside of town, though.
---
I kind of lucked out with my WoW experience (imo of course).  I started at the beginning of BC after watching friends play through vanilla and trying to convince me to join.
---
I missed playing Vanilla myself, so I'm there with you, but rolled on a new server with friends that were determined to show me how to play the WoW they knew.  There was a lot of instruction on group and social etiquette...on the importance of understanding everything your class could offer...etc.
---
I did not experience the Vanilla raids, but we completed every 5-man at level and pre-nerf.  Stopped to grind PvP every ten levels for various rewards and rep.
---
The only way I could get a mount at 40 was with a birthday present of gold from friends.  They made sure I hit 60 before the xp requirements were reduced so I knew what it took.
---
That's the WoW that I fell in love with.  I haven't played classic, but due to so many people taking so much time with me because they loved the game so much...I can't wait to experience the same original game they did.
---
I installed my first ever voice chat program so they could better explain the layout of Wailing Caverns.  I had a boss and some coworkers set aside an entire weekend to run through Dire Maul with me and teach me different things about the place.
---
The good thing about the game is that it's easy to meet people to play with. Grouping makes a lot of the content of the game much easier, which includes the leveling process, especially at early levels.
---
FYI you use one burn the energy, then use the other and dump. But yes it is verifiably sick. I had a renitakis and it is unkind what you can do to people, especially Squishies.
---
Swing on the spiral!
---
I'll never forget the first time I got the trinket from the chest on my rogue. Crazy fight with like 6 people, down to me and a troll hunter, I was low on health and killed him and ran for the chest but the fucker had just feign deathed and jumped up. I jumped up too, out of my chair, and managed to buttonmash and take him out.
---
You nailed it. That‚Äôs why I hate the elitist mentality. Hell, to me, true ‚Äúelite‚Äù players don‚Äôt need to be carried by everyone else playing ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù - they are able to clear all of that same, difficult content with scrubs, idiots and poorly geared noobs. Seriously - show me someone who can do that? And I‚Äôll show you a truly elite player!
---
Gabe is going to the grave with his one and only copy of HL3.
---
&gt;Ask any warrior who he want's back up from lol.
---
Shaman?  Definitely wind fury..
---
So you are saying that we should avoid professions until we are 60? Wont skinning and herba help us with xp?
---
Elemental shaman is legit one of the best PvP specs in the game, and shamans have been pretty popular on private servers in recent years. The one that rhymes with FourthMale is 5.8% shamans and 6.4% paladins, and when you consider that the server is like 46H/54A, that pretty much makes them equally popular.
---
Back in 07 I went from osrs crack head to world of warcrack. 
---
Came back to osrs once they released mobile. I personally enjoyed my wow adventure but I thoroughly enjoyed BC the most. Which is closest to classic
---
You don't just need bear asses, you need *pristine* bear asses.

I dont think druids should get weapon procs. If you want weapon procs play a class that gets weapon procs.
---
I know you didnt mention this. The other guy did. Just saying I'm one of those guys that you are talking about. Against his no harm change.

Big thanks, just trying to add fuel to the hype train.
---
KEK!
---
Yep! This is exactly why I want an RPPvP server also.
---
I enjoyed it.
---
Doesnt exist in vanilla
---
That's why its so fun. It makes you mad and then you see some enemy player trying to kill some mobs and you get your revenge and the cycle of hatred continues.
---
Dogwhistling about jews and trying to not get banned.
---
Agreed, you're not going to be able to avoid PvP in a PvP server, and a Druid would definitely help to avoid PvP because.. that's what a Druid's strategy in PvP usually is anyway, given that they can't really kill anything
---
Assuming being ahead of the level curve will help avoid PvP only works until you and everyone else are level 60. You're still going to encounter unwanted and annoying ganks outside of Onyxia's Lair, MC and BWL at level 60...
---
if your goal is to level up quickly you shouldn't be in STV in the first place
---
It‚Äôs fine if you set hearth to city and get flight paths to get your warlock to raid area before a scheduled raid
---
Agreed, channel /3 is always your friend on Horde side :)
---
Well, it would remove or significantly reduce a gold sink, so I wouldn't call it insignificant. Not game breaking, but it is significant.
---
That's difficult to choose, I have many favorites.
---
The first ones that come to my mind are either:
---
Sentinel Sweetspring
---
Shandris Feathermoon
---
Ysera
---
They are all lesbians &lt;3
---
Well shit. If it ain't ol shadowpanther himself, out in the wild. I used the hell out of your site back in 05-6.
---
Best one yet imo 10/10
---
You dont have to decide on professions they arent set in stone. 1-300 with almost every profession doesnt take that long and is usually cheap. I usually change my profession 4-5 times over the time on a pserver and I will do so on classic aswell.
---
Don‚Äôt think you get Xp from using professions. Skinning takes time per mob which will add to your total leveling time. Herbalism you have to find enough herbs. You can easily put level a profession causing you to back track. If your fine with taking your time it‚Äôs no issue. However getting to 60 ASAP will always yield more gold. It‚Äôs far easier to do everything at 60.
---
Really not sure, but I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt unless warlocks lost enslave demon
---
As a rogue who will pretty much pvp solo will this profession plan work ? Mining / herb on main and an alt in main city with engineer/alchemy to make stuff for my rogue. Or will i need engineering on my main eventually ?
---
I see. Thanks a lot.
---
Skinning/LW for rogue. You can make 20g an hour just afk crafting recipes when the server is fresh and leather sells at vendor value. Drop one for engineering.
---
Druid go herbalism/enchanting while leveling. Stockpile herbs for after getting smoking heart.
---
Sad :((
---
Excellent goals. I'm thinking about doing the same. I have a list of obnoxious griefy things I can do to the opposite faction ready to go.
---
If you're in a high end guild these things are pretty huge.
---
they werent
---
what happens on the 16th?
---
How about in phase 2? And will R14 be easier on PvE server if less people are grinding for it?
---
Saw your reply, then saw your name. Did you play LoL in the past? I played with a fella named akajpete. Nice guy.
---
No we just see like 5-15 of these posts every day.
---
Honestly, undead rogues are a lot of fun...
---
Yes. Yes. No. No. Yes.
---
Same boat as you mate. I think I decided I'm going mage. Been reading they are pretty casual friendly.
---
if you use addons that will be tested im sure for questing. 2 weeks would be average I'd say.
---
You need a minimum threshold of honorable kills to even get on the "rankings", so if you're on a dead server, you may not even have enough to get to that threshold in any given day. Low-pop-but-still-high-enough-to-get-queues is good for a R14 grind (if there are no cross-server BGs at first, anyway), but super-low-pop-and-you're-waiting-for-fifteen-minutes-a-game is not so good.
---
This is as good an answer as you'll get.
---
I don't know the difference between RP-PVP server and a regular PVP server and im abit afraid to ask at this point.
---
You need gold to buy spells and spell ranks as you level, hunter ammo, hunter pet food, spell reagents, level 40 mount and optional level 60 mount, any talent respecs, etc. All of this adds up. Gold isn't hard to come by per se, but you'll be farming it to keep up with these kinds of things.
---
There were gold sellers in vanilla. Lots of them. Blizz's security has come a long way, and there's the possibility that game time tokens from the live game might see their way into classic as well to combat gold sellers.
---
It's possible to buy third party gold with real money to get an advantage, but those third parties tend to be super sneaky about keylogging and stealing your account from you. Additionally Blizzard bans players caught buying gold.
---
This isn't a huge concern. People might buy gold, but it never was this hugely game breaking thing. You always kinda suspected so-and-so bought gold when they bought their epic riding and mount the day they dinged 60 on their first toon, but I'd have to say the vast majority of players either don't, or don't do it in large enough quantities that it tangibly gives them advantages. It really isn't a concern.
---
Blizard introduced the game time token to combat gold sellers. Players can purchase game time and sell it on the in-game auction house for gold. It doesn't generate new gold, it's existing gold exchanged from one player to another. It's like how a lot of us used to sell game time cards in trade chat, it's just Blizzard officially facilitating it now.
---
"How important is gold in Classic WoW?"
---
Incredibly important at the beginning, almost meaningless when you are done with progression.
---
"Were gold sellers a prominent thing back in the old days of WoW (will they be in Classic WoW)?"
---
Yes they were prominent, up until they introduced WoW Tokens. They won#t be as relevant in classic because retail and classic share asubscription, and with that the Token-system in a roundabout way.
---
"Is it possible for a player to "buy" their way to the top by purchasing gold from third party sites?"
---
Selling raidspots/gear was a thing back then and it's even more of a thing today. There will be guilds selling their services and there will be people who will trade retail gold for classic gold through third party sites.
---
"Is this not a huge concern?"
---
Since abusing the retail token system in classic won't generate as much gold (as opposed to bots and chinese farmers providing the service) it won't affect the economy in a major negative way. But it still allows a semi-pay to win playstyle, as long as top guilds are willing to offer boosts.
---
"Does Blizzard have an active way to prevent these issues?"
---
They would have to track down transactions between average players, I don't see how they could make a difference between two friends trading currency between retail and classic and strangers who organised the trade through a third party site - so no, they can't prevent. Maybe a threat to ban people if they find out could work as a deterrence for some, but that's it.
---
Iskar Monk

Or the top rankings on the server each day/week. I would check it all the time to see who the new Grand Marshals and High Warlords were.

A Booty Bay Guard. Nice pirate vibe, and you can crack open the skulls of dumb lowbies that click the wrong flight master or get tricked into fighting other players. And if things get hairy you just multiply into more guards and net them down.
---
Yep. Also Warlocks post BWL
---
I have not gotten that from the classic community at large (though the countless threads about "just this one little change is so I want" are alarming).
---
Most people seem to genuinely want to experience vanilla fully.
---
My biggest concern is all the people talking about viability and rushing through content...
---
I would throw myself off a cliff if I only had an hour or two every night to call my own. Sounds fucking horrendous.
---
Very useful, my only issue with the BiS lists that while having a bunch of pieces with +spell/shadow damage, I recall our spells coefficients suck ass. Like MF, which will be the most used spell by far, is like not even 50% or something right? Wouldn‚Äôt a mix of mp/5 or more int and spirit gear help for the longer fights?
---
You will need engineering in order to use most of the things made :)
---

---
Oh yeah you are super correct about that! Pet happiness is going to make you want to rip your hair out, especially if it dies a lot.
---
You can only track one at a time so it's not too beneficial to go mine / herb.  I would recommend mining / engineering (gnomish) at start.  Ore is worth more then herbs early and arcane crystals are very profitable.  After you get all your gnomish trinkets and such unlearn engineering and relearn and go goblin.  This way you can still use all the gadgets because they require it to craft not use.  Then you can make all your bombs and sappers.  Once ore / crystals taper down unlearn mining for herbalism because you can sell your herbs to buy mats for eng when needed and make a profit.
---
There‚Äôs not many items in AH that are game breakingly good yes there‚Äôs a couple of BiS and most people that want those will have them eventually. Really gold is important because at high level play you‚Äôll use a ton of consumables etc. so yeh buying gold is p2w but the risk out weigh the reward.
---
Thanks bud, checking them out as we speak (just as I was flagging mid-night-shift). Not so sure at first-glance, will give them some time.

If you do each dungeon once while leveling, you won't have any problems or need to grind.
---
softboy
---
Is...is this true?
---
that is what I thought. The way people are talking you just run out of quest and direction very often
---
&gt; **How important is gold in Classic WoW?**
---
Kind of important, but there's a limit to how much you can actually do with gold. Gold is really, really good up to about 2-4k and then it becomes pretty much meaningless because, well, what are you going to do with it? Each class has a few BoE epics that you'll probably want, some more than others, and you occasionally need enchants or consumables. You need your epic mount. You might respec now and then. 
---
Beyond that, you reach a point where there just isn't anything else to spend gold on unless you're funding a guildbank or just willingly waste it on weird shit like a rare pet collection.
---
&gt; **Were gold sellers a prominent thing back in the old days of WoW (will they be in Classic WoW)?**
---
I never saw goldspam when I played vanilla. I think it hadn't caught on yet. I know there were websites, and people sometimes talked about chinese farmers occupying the good grind spots, but I can say that it wasn't prominent enough that I really noticed it. However, it has been very widespread on the bigger private servers. This is at least in some part because you can freely make any number of accounts there, but I think we'll see plenty of gold-sellers in Classic anyway, whether or not they brazenly advertise in general chat.
---
&gt; **Is it possible for a player to "buy" their way to the top by purchasing gold from third party sites?**
---
No, not unless you're talking about buying your way into a rank carry or raid loot rights. I have no idea if that'll be a widespread thing in Classic, but I doubt it will for at least the first long while. I've never personally heard of anyone doing that in either vanilla up to 1.9 when I played or on any of the major private servers, but people occasionally mention it as a thing that does take place. 
---
So assuming you're not literally RMTing your way to high ranks or BoP loot, you can't buy your way to the top with gold. There are BoE epics you can buy, but for most classes there's only like two or three you'd actually use in the endgame, and that's usually only until BWL when nearly all BoEs become obsolete. Warriors have somewhat more expensive BoE needs, but it's still something you can get by just farming gold, so RMT gold isn't a route to the top in this regard.
---
&gt; **Is this not a huge concern?**
---
No, it's not. People can help themselves to an easier start by buying gold for their epic mount or Lionheart Helm or whatever, but it's not a really big deal. Spend a week farming gold and you should have enough for every big purchase you need. Long-term expenses pretty much amount to enchants, respecs and raid consumables which can easily be funded with moderate amounts of farming.
---
 
---
Does Blizzard have an active way to prevent these issues?
---
100% there is a guild already prepping and practicing. Their goal is 40 raiders at lvl 60 and attuned for MC &amp; Ony in about 12 days girl time. They plan to clear MC and Ony within 2 weeks of the Classic release. How is that fun?
---
Cringe.
---
Nope, I've never played LoL (I have a terminal case of sucking at all things PvP). But if you can't find akajpete, I'll pretend to be him if you'd like.
---
Hey, librarytimeisover! Long time no see! It's been so long since we did &lt;League of Legends thing&gt;. I remember the time that &lt;League of Legends thing&gt; happened and you got so upset because you really wanted &lt;League of Legends thing&gt; to happen instead. Good thing I was there to &lt;League of Legends thing&gt; and save you! Boy that was something!
---
she will technically need gold for her mount unless she plans on farming everything herself, which will take a long time and possibly be expensive anyway!
---
You can drop enchanting after you craft the heart. It does not require enchanting to use. It is just BoP and requires enchanting to craft.
---
Spell Penetration. (though it doesn't really show up till AQ+)
---
Whether they make a server or not, I think this is a very empowering image and shows just how hard people are willing to work to form the community they want to be a part of, no matter where that Community has to be based.
---
Oh I‚Äôd love BWL but you can‚Äôt beat BWL without beating MC. MC and ZG are on the same level so they are first!
---
Savia, Void, Last light, Lascivious and Lotus are a few of my favorites.
---
Working on professions while your significant other is not online is effective though, since I assume you would want to level together. Picking flowers or doesn't yield XP in Vanilla and you could get mining (since skinning requires killing, and grey monsters may not give you skillups).
---
If im lucky I‚Äôll be able to no-life a mage to 60. Hopefully get to good aoe grind spots faster
---
Gold for pally mount? I don't recall this! Please remind me.
---
Once you get good gear Pally's can solo the lashers and Water elemental boss in DM East and pick up the herbs for about 100g per hour
---
Well they are using their new client and retrofitting it to *feel* like classic.
---
i watched a MadSeason video about it a while ago - basically you need a bunch of expensive (if bought) mats in order to complete the quests to get the mount!
---
Just play the damn game and be a good peer. The rest will sort itself out.
---
Have people totally lost their social skills in here?
---
Well priests can dispel and warlocks have dispel as well so it's not that different. Shamans are annoying for sure, but then so are warriors with blessing of freedom and being spammed with cleanse for a druid. Hardiness is an annoying thing for alliance druids as well making bash super unreliable vs orcs.
---
Might want to go at level 10 unless you want to delay your class quest.
---
That sounds familiar. I'll look into that, maybe one of our profs can help negate the cost. Thank you.
---

The Guild my friends join. (We might make our own, we might find a big PvP guild, we might find a raid guild)
---
Thanks!
---
Realistically: August 10-20
---
Hopefully: Mid to late July
---
Pvp casually - Go for rank 14.
---
Yea
---
yeah dude no problem!! professions can definitely help negate the cost, and i think its still less than having to buy the full mount + riding!! good luck to you both :)
---
While I agree that we need RP-PvP servers, I never played on one, only regular RP ones. What‚Äôs the big difference between them? Other than the PvP of course.
---
Some argue that the AV blue crossbow is better.
---
You stop right now with all your kindness... binch. Thanks!
---
I think Night Elf Priest on a PvP server can have a stupid amount of fun with Mind Control. After reading the stories,  I'm half tempted to betray my entire WoW experience and roll one.
---
This.
---
Now this is the content I like to see.
---
Herbalism + Alchemy
---
Going 5/32/14 to level then 0/20/31 for cat form farming and raid healing
---
Casual WPvP/Raiding guild. Really want to see the end of Naxx but not sure if I have the right schedule for it. Plus I\`ll probably be on the Oceania server depending on lag from JPN to NA. So server population is gonna be a problem. Really just plan on seeing as much as I can since I started in Wrath and stopped playing with the Cata-MoP talent changes. Hated every X-pack since then.
---
While I understand that everything will probably work out, it‚Äôs cause for concern when you see everyone on the internet talking about their groups and how they‚Äôve already worked everything out while you don‚Äôt have any certainty that you‚Äôll meet people.
---
The internet is a significantly less magical place now than it was in 2005, people are assholes for no good reason and undoubtedly it will not be identical to original vanilla, especially if so many people already have full raidgroups established. Obviously there will be room for solo players to fill the gaps, but I‚Äôd rather not feel like the odd man out in an already close group.
---
Thanks for your useless and frankly rude input though!
---
Can't figure out who I want as my alt.. between 30/0/21 shaman and rogue. I'm not sure how much free time I'll have so I'm not sure whether to dedicate this alt to pvp or pve or a little of both. I'm planning on healing both raids and pvp on my priest which will be my main. I main shaman on retail so a part of me wants to do that.. but I'm not sure if I want to be a dedicated healer on both of my characters, especially since shaman has no place for dps in pve. As for rogue, a huge part of it is nostalgia, my first max lvl in BC was rogue and I can't wait to dual wield sword of omen and vanquisher's sword again. But I also understand that in premades, rogues aren't super sought after especially considering how many rogues there will be. Ugh please help
---
i wish they never got rid of night time. seeing how dark it use to be hurts.
---
Thank you for the answer. What exactly do you mean afk crafting? Just creating massive amounts of stuff while buying the leather dirt cheap and then vendoring?
---
Other than that great answer. Might do just that.
---
They only need 40 people in the raids instead of the 60+ we're used to on Luclin and Velious. Are you sure you'll still have a raid spot?
---
Most peoples current prediction for the release. Its Q3, it's summer and its the date when vanilla first released (if im not mistaken).
---
Planning on 2 chars, debating if I want to play 5 but I don't want that commitment again.
---
Orc Rogue, mining, eng
---
Troll Druid, herb, alch
---
Depending on which I want to pvp with, I will be farming with the other while downtime in bg's...or just 5 man them both as they both have mechanics similar.
---
Unsure of specs yet, but for leveling, combat/feral or combat and feral/resto druid.
---
If I main my druid, the rogue will be in dungeons farming pickpocketing. If I main my rogue, I may farm a lowbie dungeon over and over.
---
Unsure of what type of guild to join but more than likely a a casual pve (still does a weekly thing in raids and such) but mostly pvp guild.
---
Go on a pserver and play for a while. You will see that there is no reason to be concerned. If you are a good player and a nice guy people will want you in their group.
---
Some of these guys are assholes. Thanks for sharing, OP. Your post took me back down memory lane, I was 15 at the time and I can remember the excitement of finally hitting level 40, having to grind for gold for a level to be able to afford it because I was a warrior, and the elation at finally not having to run around all the time. Some really good times.
---
For one thing, it depends on the patch. More quests were added throughout vanilla, and if those are there from the start in Classic, it'll be easier to quest the whole way to 60. If not, you probably have to spend some time either doing dungeons or grinding mobs. The original 1.0 content definitely wasn't enough to solo quest every level.
---
If you're the kind of player who doesn't try to level fast at all, you shouldn't have problems. Do each dungeon at least once and get most of the instance quests done, that'll be enough to avoid having to grind questless. It's mostly an issue for very hardcore players who level so fast that there isn't really anyone for them to do dungeons with.
---
Played both back in the day.
---
Hunters are pretty chilled out, your cc options don't require much paying attention either.
---
Warlocks CC can break at a moments notice or pull adds if you position badly/get unlucky. That said you can dps through it.
---
Warlocks are more complex but in my opinion feel more powerful when grinding. It's really easy as a warlock to say have 1 mob on the void walker, keep 2 bouncing with swapping fear, and face tank one. You are completely safe doing this because most of your damage is instant casts and you can get a life drain dot that's constantly topping you up.
---
Hunters never feel that powerful imho, but that said warlocks as cloth casters are very vulnerable. Fuck up or get jumped by a red and if you're not paying attention it's a trip to the graveyard for you.
---
When you look at some of the major platforms people predominantly communicate in, then yea, people kind of have.
---
Nevertheless, I agree with your message. I think if enough people just play the game and realise that classic forces socializing more than current games, it will indeed sort itself out.
---
Pretty obvious "maybe" in front, as in maybe decide to go hard for rank 14.
---
Not typically.  In a world where big crits can 1 or 2 shot people, having a big opener and the ability to pick your fights like rogues can is a huge advantage.
---
I just realized this has the most upvotes and he didn't even see my sarcasm. Is it not obvious that I was disagreeing because he made what I am clearly claiming to be a strawman? :(
---
Im betting Method is already practicing hard on pservers and will be doing MC in leveling gear first week. People seem to forget though you have to be revered with Hydraxian Waterlords to summon Executus and subsequently Rag.
---
That's still not the same thing as creating new content.
---
They're specifically modeling the game after 1.12 as closely as they possibly can, not creating new content.
---
The RP PvP servers are usually 50/50 faction split or extremelt close to it, and connects the lore based RP with legit emotionally charged rivalries between guilds, factions, and individual characters.
---
That‚Äôs why repack is such a good way of comparing times. There‚Äôs no one else if you‚Äôre playing locally, so it‚Äôs not 100% comparable to a fresh launch etc, but it also doesn‚Äôt have those variables so everyone‚Äôs on an even playing field. You can even disable rested.
---
fantastic art.
---
This is pretty accurate.  Even though I mained a mage, when the raid was over I‚Äôd put it back on the shelf and bust out the druid alt.  I had very little trouble going 1v1 with any class when on the druid.
---
Troll Druid? Nice troll post
---
Your not the first person i have heard say this either. I have never personally used it, but on servers that shall not be named it was definitly a thing. 100% worth more research into the matter without a doubt. I think they key here is trying to get fights to last as short as possible. The longer the fight drags on the worse hybrid dps specs usually do
---
Thanks, my dude :) makes me think some people have never read a book or any long form writing. I‚Äôm on mobile so I dunno if it‚Äôs too different, but yeah! It‚Äôs all about connecting the community, I‚Äôm just trying to do my part.
---
I don't stream and am bad at the game but I'll stream just for you.
---
That's probably best. Just worried about losing out on so much gold disenchanting gear instead of vendoring.
---
When you turn left outside of Orgrimmar gate, see your Zeppelin docked and don‚Äôt have a mount yet.
---
Method doesn't give a flying fuck about vanilla, there's enough prep to do with current content. Will there be a sideteam for Method on vanilla? Maybe. Will it be their focus? Never.
---
Relative to live, resoundingly yes... The fact that the /played time (roughly 1/2, guessing...) to 120 is less than the time to 60 inherently means it feels more grindy. But it‚Äôs ultimately your own perspective, right? I don‚Äôt find it that grindy either, personally. But if you had to compare live to Classic WoW, the answer is definitely yes...
---
Yeah I guess I loathe the thought of not having engineering while leveling but it would be easier to just drop something at 60 and power level the egineering up then.
---
MadSeasonShow
---
I love his videos.
---
Taking a week off work and hoping to get close to 45 by that time. Def gonna push for 60 that first month or very close too it
---
I find the funnest people at parties are the ones who answer class advice questions all night.
---
I guess I was just curious why OP was concerned it wouldn't work.
---
Yep most casuals quit around lvl 30
---
Prot pala is a garbage meme spec.
---
LOL Azeroth is the name of the planet.  There is no single continent named "Azeroth".
---
Lmfao
---
I was too old for it when I was just a boy. If there was a realm where your PvP flag was only forced on at or around 60, I'd jump on that. But getting ganked by level 60 Rogues or a passing Mage who dismounts just to toss a Frostbolt my way... Imma hard pass.
---
Honestly a realistic goal is full tier 2. I really want to see the end of naxx though. Gonna really go for it this time around
---
How is this not gold
---
sex leg
---
It depends on how Blizzard releases content. At the beginning Silithus, Hinterlands and Searing Gorge had almost no quests that would fuck people hard in the late 40s and in the late 50s. If all quest hubs are out from the start its really not that bad.
---
Does it have to be in that order? For me it went:
---
* How much I'll play (semi-casual)
---
* Server Type (PvE)
---
* Faction (Horde)
---
* Class (Warlock)
---
* Talents (cookie-cutter)
---
* Professions (TBD)
---
* Guild (TBD)
---
Not exactly true, players could abuse logging out and wait until hearthstone reset..although for the 1-10 part it doesn't make any notable difference from the routes I've seen for the best times.
---
Here is a guild v guild fight happening as we speak
---
Hell yeah.
---
One does not go to STV to level up...
---
Interesting choice to choose one faction over another because of one trinket.
---
Eh, they probably won't even manage that. Odds are that people will drop off for whatever reason which would leave them a few men short.
---
Damn hoof biters
---
Agreed. And for me, the ganking is one thing. I'll be setting aside a couple hours at a time to level when it's out, and I don't want to spend 70% of that corpse running in peak hours. The other thing is that it doesn't end at 60. Sometimes you're the last person to get to the BRD run and there's a group of gankers outside. Where you also won't be able to summon the rest of your group. It makes that 2 hour run turn into 3 hours haha. It can be fun, but I just won't have the time or mental fortitude to deal with all that.
---
Atmosphere. The cities are great. The people aren't all refugees. With horde it's like you're a peon and just lucky to be there as you're talking to someone in a dilapidated tent. With the alliance, quest folks talk to you like you're an up and coming knight and its from their nice castles and outposts. It's just a less gritty and more polished day by day when you play alliance. All the night elven places are also just majestic. I was always much more in awe and joyful playing Alliance. Felt like a dirty rusty miscreant transient when playing horde.
---
I thought that was part of the joke. Dwight being surprised at the incorrect answer.
---
The hole of not finishing AQ40 and Naxx before TBC came out still yearns to be fulfilled. I tried on private servers but real life got in the way, and it really wouldn't have been the same to me. I'm almost at a point in my life where semi serious raiding is doable again and I. Can't. Wait.
---
If you're caught in the main zerg of players skip STV by spamming SM G/Lib/Arm/Cath from 30 - 38, meaning you skip the horrid Northern Stranglethorn cluster of quests that everyone tries to do. Another option is to do the few quests that are in Desolance and Dustwallow to squeeze your way through, personally I hate both these zones so I do SM for a bit and then go back to STV at a higher level (usually 36) when I have more abilities for PvP and higher level with dungeon gear, no one will even try and fuck with you, its much better than being a scrawny level 30 in greens.
---
Lmao
---
To elaborate: Yes. Yes. (No.) No. No. Yes.
---
Dang...
---
The things that people would do for classic...
---
pretty much ya
---
&gt; So you either corpse run or level an alt for 30 minutes.
---
You really are struggling to understand very simple concepts. Not everyone enjoys doing that *even if* taking everything into account they do want to play on a PvP server.
---
You don't have to like everything Blizzard puts on your plate. Especially if you only have two plates to choose from.
---
&gt; You're definitely a PVE type of guy.
---
It's not relevant what kind of guy I am. I am trying to get across to you the idea that different people like and dislike different things about the PvP server experience and that is okay.
---
&gt; Maybe all the people are just not accepting that they would much prefer aPVE server but their pride won't allow them too.
---
Maybe. Or, and this seems a lot more likely, they like some parts of the PvP server experience and not others. Because people aren't two-dimensional stereotypes who either unconditionally love every single thing about a complicated game or unconditionally hate every single thing about it.
---
&gt; When I get killed I can be pretty annoyed, but it's also kinda motivating to get back and try to avenge myself
---
That's you. Not everyone is you. You get that, right? That not everyone feels exactly the way you do about everything?
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get that shit, I never ran out of quests. If anything I had the odd quest or two go grey cause it was on the other continent and I never got around to it.
---
i don't understand why this quest is so known, you literally do it on the way and back from other quests like the harpy or oasis quests, you should never run around in circles killing these zhevras
---
That's what I thought but they have enough that half their core raid group could drop off and they would still have enough.
---
Truth. I quit at 35 in vanilla after wandering into burning steppes and dying to a skull level mob. Came back 3 months later when school got boring and loved it for the next 3 years straight.
---
That‚Äôs for the epic mount, I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
I know this comment doesn't add much but... 
---
this is me_irl
---
From what I've heard method isnt planning to push classic content.
---
I‚Äôm doing that but I‚Äôm going Herb/Alch because I always go Tailor / Enchanting.
---
Man I can‚Äôt wait, the fact that you‚Äôre playing an undead holy priest makes me excited to play my future undead holy priest.
---
Yeah I get that. Live leveling is a joke and means nothing. But these are supposed to be people who know classic inside and out and they are making it sound that way. Maybe they are talking to a more general demographic that hasn't played classic
---
Oh.  That would do it I guess lol.
---
Meta
---
Used to have these when i stayed up way too late (grinding out rank 11 - commander). My mind would be fried, almost segmented. Dreams were way too real and magical at the same time. I'd think I would be executing my dps rotation with some girl - if that makes any sense. It wouldn't be metaphorical, it would be like I literally tried to apply my dps rotation to sex. I was slowly losing my sanity and my brain became so intertwined with this fictional world I couldn't tell the difference.
---
If it helps, this will be my first real time playing wow. I didn‚Äôt play when it released or in high school but I started in 2010 when my friends kinda forced me to get WotLK/Cataclym and made me go horde and grind vs playing so I quit and never went back. I tried a trial and never went back mainly because I felt so far behind and this was just prior to Battle for Azeroth release. So now knowing about classic and going to square one and back in time to where it all started. I‚Äôm really looking forward to creating a human or dwarf for the alliance. Probably Paladin or Hunter. So looking forward to actually giving WoW a chance for a real fantasy experience.
---
I believe those hubs are in. Silithus may not be though. The other zones I see no reason why not
---
I would think the answer is obvious. NO
---
As you stated, how will you make large bulk sales when people have no gold to purchasr goods with.
---
I agree. The support of a vanilla experience for anyone that wants it being there can and should outweigh the potential for mis steps. Much clearer point in your response than your op.

Haha sorry didn‚Äôt mean to grill you, still just as cool to see it even if you‚Äôve got some stuff from TBC. Hopefully we‚Äôll be playing classic soon!
---
My queue time was 15-25 minutes average in 2006 and I hit rank 12 just fine.   I remember ganking for extra honor while most of my group just dueled
---
Whatcha mean updated items?
---
They added some quests in later patches, it is very hard to be out of quests in 1.12.
---
People who do are usualy just clueless of where the quest givers are
---
Every zone and questing area isn't 3 sticks on top of each other and a treestump.
---
Rank 12 is not Rank 14. Not by a long shot. 14 is orders of magnitude more difficult.
---
It obviously wont be as effective as expansion launches, I was just wondering if it is viable at all or just completely not worth doing.
---
Holy shit thats funny.
---
Fortunately, those of us on PvE servers will get to kick back and enjoy leveling in STV instead of being stressed out, paranoid, and inevitably pissed off when xp becomes impossible thanks to the endless ganking.
---
I'm not paying $15 per month so some neckbeard can sap/backstab me while I'm fighting a raptor at 50% health.  NO thanks.
---
Enjoy your happy sparkle double extra banana fortune gankfest!
---
From 57 to 60 all you can do to level is killing boars
---
I'm thinking there will be less competition (since you compete against your own faction in the old honor system).    I'm guessing theres not alot of pvpers around that came from pve servers.   
---
I know quite a few people in my group hit r14 only doing 12 hours a day from r13.  Competition was probably much lighter as it was late in vanilla and naxx was already out when I did it.
---
ZG is phase 4. BWL is Phase 3.
---
I'll probably play ret because I think it's fun, sorry that irritates you lol
---
So much Shaman hate in this thread.
---
Big if true
---
I think this is the first post I've ever seen asking which class in classic is most similar to the shadow knight in eq.
---
**How important is gold in Classic WoW?**
---
Very important mostly for leveling but not a hgue deal in end game, you can buy a few bis pre raid items gold but all the good gear is from killing bosses.
---
**Were gold sellers a prominent thing back in the old days of WoW (will they be in Classic WoW)?**
---
**no**
---
**Is it possible for a player to "buy" their way to the top by purchasing gold from third party sites?**
---
No
---
**Is this not a huge concern?**
---
no
---
**Does Blizzard have an active way to prevent these issues?**
---
yes buyers and sellers are banned on sight and sold gold is removed
---
There's literally no need for 40 people in MC. You can do it with fewer.
---
One of Alexstrasza's Consort
---
I see your point, but I think you underestimate the power of a dedicated team with specific player wanted updates to the game. When OSRS started it had half of RS3‚Äôs (the main game) player count. Today, OSRS has FIVE times the player count of RS3. Now a huge portion of Jagex‚Äôs income is related purely to the subscription fee of people who play OSRS. The reason it got to this point is through dedicated developers who only implement updates that don‚Äôt ruin the game integrity.
---
If classic WoW goes down the same path, it could end up being a bigger success and higher income than retail. I‚Äôm not taking away from people experience, I want us to go through all the phases   way before any changes are made. But if classic wow gets to its last phase and no changes are made ever, eventually people will get bored. It might takes 2 years, it might take 5, but people can‚Äôt play the same content forever. 
---
I think the argument ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know what sort of player will cast a vote‚Äù is pretty slack. If 75% of people agree something is a good change, then it probably is. Classic wow won‚Äôt attract casual players who want to make things easier, but it will attract players who want extra quests at max level. We don‚Äôt want power creep, so maybe no BiS items should be introduced, but more of the good story-telling content.
---
I'm stuck on Server/Type of Guild 
---
I was looking forward to playing on RP-PvP but with that not happening at launch I don't know where I'm going without a realm list for us all to talk about which one will be RP-PvP. 
---
I also don't know if I want to make my own guild or join one :/ I'd rather join with other mostly undeads that want to RP while progressing through end game content.
---
Great post. üëç
---
I mean there‚Äôs always something you can do if you‚Äôre a shit head; those types of people are always going to exist unfortunately.
---
You can grab certain items cheaply which will later give you a good return however, everyone was the same issue which is limited supply of gold.
---
Golds scarcity will remain for at least the first 1-3 months of a new server.
---
sorry im not too familiar with reckoning and its play style. why do you go Imp Crusader? 
---
i always thought you would use Command or righteousness cause it does dmg for each proc swing, i figured crusader would make each proc swing do less damage. 
---
or do you judge with crusader for the increased holy damage and then hit them with another seal active?
---
Hehe...that was entertaining :)
---
Thank you, just feeling some feels and getting psyched.
---
Nice gear/mount
---
&gt;So unless you want a crappy Buggy classic, just calm down
---
Bitch! Classic was buggy as hell, half the people here want the classic buggy "experience".

It's that moment when you enter Barrens chat and there's already a lively conversation about gay leperous transsexual necrophiliacs with poop fetishes.  Then you know you're truly home again.

Im concerned about server balance. Seems like a lot of people play horde. Being out numbered on a pvp server can really suck.

Lucky to ding 60 within three months tbh, 12-18 hours a week at most
---
My guess is that each server will have a discord and there will probably be channels for pre cap dungeons and post cap dungeons, along with trade channels, recruitment channels, and others.
---
Fear ward prevents fear. Tremor totem breaks it but it could take up to 3 seconds after being feared. My logic doesn't fail me.
---
where are you guys from?
---
To the top?
---
Could they cut out hours and hours of grinding gold ? Yes
---
Maybe you should focus on helping your fellow players rather than trying to become Scrooge McDuck ü§î

Geared undead shadow priest. It's a hard counter to a warrior - you take less damage, so less rage. You absorb damage, so less rage.
---
It kind of counters mages, being able to silence and fear, as well as dispel the roots and their buffs. You can also start healing if you get shadow locked.
---
Rogues will have a hard time with the shadow form damage reduction and power word shield, as well as fear &amp; blackout procs. Shadow word pain makes vanishing hard.
---
Na it doesn‚Äôt have to be grindy. There‚Äôs plenty of quests in the game. You can level to 60 without ever grinding mobs for XP.
---
Solid!
---
Not sure why but it made me laugh. Thanks.
---
I want to level resto druid for casual pvp. Am I crazy?
---
I actually wear Versace cologne, have my own house, in which my computer is in the living room, and am pretty middle of the road :)
---
Can I get alittle more context to this story? I‚Äôm putting together some heart warming WoW Classic stories
---
Oh totally. But I think 40 will let them do it quicker
---
Ooo please share
---
This one really summed up the feels here. Even if you aren't for memes, this is too real to deny.
---
Are there any US alliance guilds that are planning to raid Sunday- Wednesday , maybe Thursday with something like 7est to 11 est? My work schedule just pulls me out of town on weekends once every 3 or 4 weeks so i try to avoid those days.
---
I would really love to play a warrior and be a guilds MT but also open to a resto and/or feral Druid.  I am a very guild oriented person, always willing to help someone farm gear or get attuned.
---
What I am looking for: 
---
I consider myself a casual raider but when I do raid I take my raid time seriously.  I know the commitment an MT requires and can certainly give that.  I do want a guild that holds players responsible for simple mechanics. But I do not want a guild filled with elitists looking to push realm firsts. Life happens, accidents happens- life goes on.  If the game isn‚Äôt fun then why play. I do have raid leading experience and am glad to help the guild form in any capacity.
---
toss up really, troll gets shadowguard to proc blackout but undead gets wotf, could rely on other undead reducing population of ally warlocks though. devouring plague is strong and s. priests have no other use for inner focus and they share a 3 mim. CD so the high mana cost is meaningless, but most ppl know how to dispell it with jungle remedy or anyone with a disease cure around so hard to say how much mileage youll get out of it. mini-ms is spammable but it doesnt stack with mortal strike so hard to say. berserk is way less effective since mind blast is the only spell it effects.... personally im leaning troll for my priest for cheeky blackout procs, but if the animations of one race really speak to you thats gunna mean more over the long haul.
---
You had me at *cannibalize*. Good work.

Yes! I've been looking for this song for years!

I've sunk thousands of hours into osrs and I am super hyped to sink thousands more into classic wow, whilst afking shit in osrs lol
---
By the time you get there it‚Äôs made the trip there and back 100 times.
---
If you trust them to curate that experience, try giving them a little slack on fleshing out some old Azeroth stories k?
---
But T2 is the halfway point. Why would you stop there? AQ gear is significantly more powerful.
---
dirty sweaty gooch seat and beer
---
Perhaps, but classic still lost some sense of the MMORPGs that came before it. Having now played Project 1999, I can see where WoW improved upon EverQuest but also see where it ignored a lot that fostered the communities of old. 
---
My worry is the mindset of people now will taint the classic experience since the WoW community is largely selfish and only concerned with themselves and how "leet" they look compared to the plebs.
---
Yes I understand that. But anyone playing casually won‚Äôt even hit 60 by phase 2, probably start trying MC in phase 3, and if we can‚Äôt beat it by phase 4 we supplement with ZG to gear up.
---
Not all of us are hardcore private server players :)
---
**Alternative idea:** Become Scrooge McDuck.
---
There was nothing said about not helping other players, why is it not possible to do both? 
---
The auction house is in the game for a reason, why not use it?
---
Hunters and Mage can beat all 3.
---
Hi, /u/drfreeze54

I hope someday that l see your story here of success!!

They‚Äôre a lot weaker in T3 but still fine.
---
Yeah I like it, let's milk it some more

some excellent coin makers-

travel around and buy the expert skill books- many will not realize they can be bought so easily, or dont want to make the journey. relist for 1-2G, they sell v fast

I don‚Äôt understand why some want to speed run.  I want to play a LOT of hours, but some of that will be skilling professions or farming gnomer for that hat, or just existing in Azeroth.  There is no prize for getting to 60 quickly, and it will be harder to make gold because there are few others at your level.  No tanks for stratholme.  Warriors level slow.  I‚Äôm going to experience all of the game.  Gear myself for the deadmines, then run DM 4 times for drops.  Go back and skill up some gathering profs.  Run down the beach in darkshore fighting murlocs and crabs.  Raze thistlefur villages in ashenvale.  Slog through the bogs in the wetlands.  Get killed by the ?? sewer beast in Stormwind.  Get ganked by a level 60....wait wut lol that was mor‚Äôladim and his glowing sword of pain.  Go back in a few levels and chain shackle that bastard as a service to the adventurers of raven hill.  Lemme clean up some grave moss while I‚Äôm here.  Lolz no that‚Äôs not sellable groupie i‚Äôm just skilling up, don‚Äôt you bother with it.  You get briarthorn i get grave moss.  I want to get lost in sunken temple.  Killed for pre-HoTing.  Rez the guy who didn‚Äôt wait on sunder or revenge to land on all the mobs.  I want to curse warlocks and their chain fear and get PoM AP trinket x 2 pyro‚Äôed.  I want my mmo back.
---
Hahaha I am simply asking it the auction house is worth using as a source of revenue while levelling. I think you guys are looking for something that isn't here
---
Tauren Druid. I want to mainly PvP, and I‚Äôm ok with healing especially in premades.

Should I level resto?

 How you just gonna downplay the name of our daddy like that?

i agree- i still maintain classic will overtake retail and retail will die

I‚Äôve been living in the past playing retail for a long time...
---
It‚Äôs been 14 years- explain?
---
Not hardcore unless you live hardcore
---
Do you think that build would be viable for leveling? I plan on doing that build while I duo lvl with a warrior.

Also, it‚Äôs interesting to see that the vanilla box was $19.99 new

---
I will make a guild specifically for this
---
I swear that, once upon a time, I remember reading about an unfinished dungeon (possibly a dungeon/raid combo) that was supposed to go in The Tainted Scar between Naxx and TBC's release.  The lore would have been a prelude to the opening of the Dark Portal.
---
If this was accurate, it would be fucking amazing if Blizz finished it and opened it up after Naxx is officially on farm status.  Assuming Classic progresses into TBC, this would be a perfect little bonus for Classic players.
---

That part must have gone over my head as a young teenager.

Thank you for an actual constructive comment :)

That sounds like you hate yourself
---
Azeroth has a free market.  Take that shut elsewhere
---
Good thing because there's no bgs at release.
---
I always kinda liked doing a /who of people standing around in Orgrimmar to see if there were any warriors that would be willing to tank Wailing Caverns for the group of randoms I just met up with while questing.
---
Thanks so did i, it worked really well for me. I've got the razer tartarus now, essentially just an updated version. I'm old enough that I started gaming in the NES, Sega, SNES Era so I've never like moving with wasd, I've always preferred having a d-pad for my thumb.
---
nah, im on elysium's new server and everyone is super friendly, people group up for quests, buff each other, no one rages and drops group when you wipe, hell we wiped a dozen times doing the redridge elites and every1 was cool about it
---
super positive guild and community, prepping for my first mc run this week and am psyched!
---
the element you are describing wont last, they will be too frustrated when it takes 2-3 days to hit lvl 20
---
Hmm a push to talk foot pedal huh? I can't say I agree with putting push to talk on the foot, but I'll give you points for originality.
---
Well..at least one person caught on! haha...meant tauren
---
However much time you think you have to play the game, there is someone with less life and faster leveling skill than you. Anyone who thinks they won't be ganked by level 60 Rogues just because its only 1 week after launch is living in a fantasy world.
---
I would not fuck with the AH until you hit 60. Once you hit 60 you get access to the highest tier of gold grinds. You can use the income made along the way from skinning and herb vending to have a solid foundation of capital. I would invest heavily into items needed for raids; Examples being small flame sacks, grave moss, pre-raid bis devilsaur, ect. If you get to 60 as one of the first 500 on your server you will have a massive advantage. The problem will be can you build the capital to corner a market that has people over-gathering resources. I don‚Äôt think you will have the economic power super early on to control a market for any low tier item. I think it would be more viable to constantly stockpile raid items when you can. MC you have all the fire resist stuff that should be a primary goal early. With correct investments you could easily get a 200% increase in initial investments. I know from person experience I made out like I was bill gates with small flame sacs.
---
The way EQ fostered its community was also how it limited its own potential: by forcing groups everywhere. You couldn‚Äôt (effectively) make money, or craft, or advance your character without spending half an hour putting together a group. Even going from one capital city to another was akin to suicide. And if you were a Vah Shir, you were just plain hosed.
---
What WoW did was draw in the introverts, like me. I can get to max level without interacting with another player if I so choose. However, there are significant benefits to being social, such as dungeons and group quests with significant upgrades as rewards.
---
WoW incentivized grouping. EQ penalized soloing.
---
Warlocks do more raw damage than mages? I didn‚Äôt know that I thought mages were the heavy hitters of those two
---
u/wayne62682 and u/vinsaint315 you have both severely misunderstood the question.
---
The exact reason the AH is a free market is the reason you would want to get in early to be able to sell your goods for maximum profit before the demand and supply becomes completely controlled by the consumers. 
---
By doing this there is absolute no disadvantage to other players, if it's too expensive don't buy it no one is forcing the sale upon you. On the flip side it actually helps people that want large loads of goods early on and have the gold. The tradeoff is the items will be a little more expensive if you want to buy them early on
---
My 2 week vacation starts on the 17th so I would be down for this.
---
However. EQ also fostered a community. WoW has slowly eroded it over time. I'm not sure which approach I'd prefer now. Having to interact with the community for most things helps foster that community.
---
Most probably Warriors, Mages, Rogues
---
Least I would say is Druids, Priests and Warlocks
---
Oh man I remember that website!
---
I've already blown my annual leave for the year. But it also made me miss my flu shot. Hmmm...
---
Personal best is 8 days time played, and I didn‚Äôt feel like it was grinding. I did some dungeons and had fun along the way. I was a priest. I think hunters can rip through content in like 4 days if you‚Äôre a god. If you feel like it is grindy you can just speed level and hardly deal with it. I think leveling is the best time I have in vanilla wow.
---
Guilds will have 1-2 shadow priest and you will be hybrid healing spec and just keep your shadow weaving up while healing. You shouldn't be raiding almost full shadow till aq/bwl/zq due to itemization. If I saw a guild early raiding with spriest in classic I would not want to be part of it as its just a wasted spot.
---
People misremember vanilla so much.
---
It‚Äôs not like private servers.
---
Night elf rogues were everywhere in true vanilla. Most first gen priests were human, followed by night elf. 
---
You were hard pressed to find a dwarf priest at the start of vanilla. We didn‚Äôt know any better.
---
By the time people got around to levelling their second toons, you saw some second gen dwarf priests but still, those who mained a priest from the start were often human, ime.
---
Play what your like.
---
Might be worth it to spam craft wands and such for points plus spending money on skills/items for later selling. Sell just enough to be a nice profit but also affordable to customers. Then you get rep as that dude selling cheap wands with a free bracer enchant \*wink\*. win win for everyone
---
If your timer was outside of wow, it would solve this. It‚Äôs really simple.
---
Most played warrior, least played druid

Every Man for Himself was added in WOTLK
---
Autorun drinking and drink-walking sound the same but aren't.
---
Autorun drinking is a bug
---
Drink walking refers to timing drinking to the 2 second mana tick so you walk, drink, acquire a tick of water, and keep walking.
---
Yes, such amazing RPers as Ketoguido, Lazybones, Xxartemis and morphedmilk.
---
I remember when Rp realms had naming rules in place.
---
I get the idea at least.  I still use number keys for other things, and anything past 6 gets too uncomfortable for me to quickly use, though I still bind past that just in case.  And with the TellMeWhen addon, I basically arranged my rotational stuff and cooldowns in Mists of Pandaria in a box/grid-like setup off to the left-middle side of the screen, so I also get what you mean there.  For me, that turned short-cooldown class gameplay (6-12s cooldown abilities) into something fun for me.
---
And yeah, I certainly know why I'm terrible at PVP, haha, but even if I used "proper" keybinds, I'm still not one to enjoy it, so that's mostly okay with me.
---
Where‚Äôs your gut feeling now?
---
My exact plan! I'm hyped!
---
Its probably slated for September release date that gets pushed back to December. 
---
I'm already prepared to go into a medically induced coma for time travel purposes.
---
&gt; pushed back to December. 
---
You shut your mouth.
---
Wise of you to know which expansion to stop at.
---
female orcs have some of the best animations imo. make sure you go to an insta 60 server so you can see everything. its quite easy just find their website and follow their instructions for acct creation and realmlist setup, download the client they suggest or check for a torrent on your fav pirate site. just make sure you use an acct name and password that you dont use for anything else
---
Say what you want but some of those mounts are dope.
---
I mean look at that Core Hound. That's badass.
---
Keyboard turning is straight up slow but more importantly it has a static turn rate, meaning your character turns at a certain constant speed. If you turn your camera with your mouse then you can turn as fast or as slowly as you want, so it is way more precise and fine grained.
---
On top of that it is the default for FPS (and similar) to use A and D for strafing while controlling the camera with the mouse. I believe the Quake player "Thresh" popularized this style of control in the 90's and since then it is seen as the superiour cookie cutter control scheme.
---
Now in regards to backpedaling: Your character moves much slower when doing this, instead you can almost always strafe sideways w/o getting hit from behind, while maintaining maximum running speed. Well almost, since you need to slightly adjust your route to consistently keep the NPC or player from getting an angle on you, which would be admitedly very bad for you, since you then can get dazed, cannot block or parry and receive bonus damage from certain abilities.
---
However this technique is very beneficial to alot of classes, but especially for Hunters, since it allows them to kite at full speed, which is done in all content types: PvP, open world and raiding. In a PvP situation there is a lot of small movements going on from both sides to adjust to facing eachother and not getting hit from behind.
---
Backpedaling has its uses though. For example tanks are often doing it to precicely move a boss around. It is generally good for small adjustments but not so much for larger movement.
---
Hi, /u/jacobmcclinton
---
Dont do that though. It's bad advice and a waste of time.
---
Just to get to lvl 60. Ignore the AH and mail stuff to bank alts to put on AH later.
---
 No way it gets pushed back. Although for me it would be a great sign.
---
WSG: God tier flag carrier druid
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was leaning toward. Thanks for your vote :)
---
WSG= good Druid carrier
---
Vendor the weapons unless you really need essences. Most of your points can be gained from dusts de'eing armors. Bracer - health, Bracer - str, Bracer - stam, Bracer - higher stre, Boots - stam, Shield - stam, and Cloak - defense. gg that's like 280/300 points using dusts.
---
Haha yeah I‚Äôm just gonna hope I have friends with me and I don‚Äôt run into that guy

Back in the day I played tf out of Runescape until transitioning to wow so I‚Äôd think it‚Äôs a natural progression.
---
If you want the title id go warrior, plus gear wise warriors can make the most out of allthe diff gear. MS
---
At least if its pushed back to Sept, Oct,Nov  nobody books vacation time in those shitty months so it will be available.

As a warlock im gona fuck with my own faction.

Dancing on the mailbox. 
---
Never gets old.
---
When people say grindy, I don't think they mean you need to just go around and kill mobs and that's it. They're just talking the speed in which you level.
---
Killing is slower, there are LOTS of quests that are drop quests which have VERY low drop rates. While yes, you are doing a quest, you are still grinding a lot of mobs to get those quest items.
---
no need to level resto, you can heal/tank dungeons within your feral spec whilst leveling.
---
also i wouldn't try to level engineering whilst you are leveling. It is costly and you'll do it quicker at max level.
---
just rare spawns
---
If it gets too bad you just rez at the graveyard and hearth out
---
Not even STV, when my friends wanted to play on the pvp servers I made a warlock to reduce stress. I knew that if anyone wanted to try to fight me I could just go "Oh you want to fight? You're talking mad shit for someone within Fear and dot range!"
---
A shadow priest with shadowform and inner fire up has as much armor as a plate wearing class. Coupled with bubble and relentless stun procs from blackout I don't think you need to do much kiting.
---
The holy trinity.
---
worrying about your alt is cute but like 99% of players won't have 2 max levels in vanilla.
---
misinformation
---
&gt;Re-hosting 1.12 =/= Blizzard making new content
---
It's actually a really great version to get too. It's written basically in 1.11-1.12 area. It was finished before Naxx released with post patched info so much-all of the info applies.
---
Sure maybe you'll be ganked once or twice. But to be fearful of that to this ridiculous extent that some people are is just silly.
---
I levelled 1-60 on a psever in a month and people there are considered Hard-core. Didn't get ganked by a sixty once til I hit max even though I was waaay slower than other people. Only issue I can remember was once when I was lvl 48 a 56 killed me during an escort. A Mage as well. People shouldn't worry so much. It's not like you'll be the only one there of your faction. 
---
Not to mention if you rush 60 why the f would you go to Ashenvale or something for longer than maybe an hour? If I rushed I'd have many many other more important things to think to do before people catch up to me. Not saying it will never happen, just saying it's not as bad as people make it out to be.
---
put some respek on it
---
maybe paste a video link if someone recorded?

In Vanilla gold buying had an impact on 3  area of game play: Epic mounts,  powerful craftible gearing up for raids, and buying raid gear without being part of a raiding guild.   All 3 had a negligible effect on my Vanilla experience.
---
Gold farmers on the other hand where a constant pain in the ass for people trying to farm their own gold and a great deal of the hacking of accounts that went on, was aimed at stealing people's gold for resale.
---
# This is gold.
---
These are too good. I am beyond excited for this
---
If you don't raid or have the better pvp gear, those raiders will stomp your dick in the dirt, even if they aren't buffed yet.
---
DM and SM wings are short though. LBRS is one of the longest dungeons and UBRS is usually cleared with 10 players.
---
It's actually the opposite. Shadow priests start strong in relation to other classes and only get weaker as you progress.
---
I would highly recommend looking at this from at least a 2 person perspective.
---
By yourself, you're at the whims of the queue.  The teammates you have.  The enemies you face.  It's too much of a variable.
---
Even adding in one other person that's focused on playing with you and you with them can change everything.
---
You don't even have to have someone in mind now, just a goal of meeting them in game.
---
Your best bet of this is probably rolling a healer of some sort, then attaching yourself to a damage dealer, fast mover, or damage taker...or being one of those yourself and finding a healer friend.
---
-----
---
&gt; is there any class/spec that you see and you say, "Yep, we are about to win this Warsong Gulch"?
---
No.  Sometimes there were individual players that I knew were awesome, and I knew we had a better chance because they were there.
---
Besides that, it was about the overall team comp and the communication.
---
I'm 23 and I like titties, are you gay or something?
---
Yes, save the highest demand items for later on like Wool Cloth, Heavy Leather/Hide and such. Those are some of the most annoying to farm and you need alot of it to powerlevel proffs. Will sell well abit into MC/Ony when people start amassing some gold.
---
Elwynn Forest, Westfall
---
Can't believe you still have them man that's so awesome
---
I want to clear AQ40 and Naxx. Back in vanilla I had to start over with new raid groups a couple of times and ended up only having BWL on farm at the end. We killed one boss in Naxx with a super group of the best raiders shortly before BC. 
---
All because of all the drama in my first groups and them falling apart. When my last raid started in MC, I was fully MC/ZG geared.
---
I'm sad to see any sjws attracted to classic wow :(
---
One of my favorite things to do was go to Menethil harbor and get on the stationary boat across from the one that goes to Dustwallow Marsh. You can get there by swimming right up to the docks to avoid guard aggro.  There will be a constant stream of lowbies to gank as they try to take the boat to Kalimdor. 
---
When the alliance 60s show up have your crew retreat to the captains cabin.  Of you're organized, you will be almost impossible to remove even if vastly out numbered.
---
Thanks!  I was thinking about it after another post and I really didn‚Äôt want to forget about them.

I'm mostly playing with some RL friends. I had to tell myself I'm permanently done with alts, but if I wasn't, I'd play Mage or Hunter. I want to do some world PvP but mostly AV / AB when they're out.
---
I'm trying to focus on gradual progression goals rather than time-sensitive goals like raiding or high pvp ranks.
---
Some goals of mine are:
---
- Rank 7-10
---
- Exalted with AV &amp; AB
---
- Donate ~32,000 Runecloth again for the [Swift Stormsaber](http://www.gamer.ru/system/attached_images/images/000/004/661/normal/swift_stormsaber.jpg)
---
- Complete every soloable quest in the game
---
That is correct. Mind flay is 45.8% coefficient, mind blast is 42%, SWP is 133%. The average for a rotation is just over 50% since the bulk of our time spent casting is MF/MB. This is the main reason why shadow doesn't scale well. Compare to warlocks at 85% or fire mages at 100%, and they both scale with crit in addition while we don't.
---
You can gear heavily towards mp5, but it just won't be enough, or you'll gear so heavy that you won't do enough dps to warrant your spot. This is what happens in Naxx and why I suggest switching to heals at that point.
---
Phase 1 gear doesn't really offer the ability to do that as most of that mp5/regen gear comes from later patches. You shouldn't need it anyway as long as your guild is decent, the longest fight you'll see is Ragnaros which should be around 3 mins. Runes and major mana should be enough to last that long, possibly with some mind blast downranking if necessary.
---
He was going for fastest real time, and iirc he slept for about 3-4 hours a day during the attempt. Rested would have just been from those breaks.
---
No-one really cares about a 100% rested time as far as I know.
---
Can you no longer report names on RP realms?  Haven't been online in years, just wondering.
---
You can do full runs but it takes a while and you need patient players for that (best done within a guild or with friends). Full BRD runs are one of the best parts about Vanilla. You don't do them often but they are great.
---
Otherwise people usually skip quite a few parts and bosses or target specific ones. The most typical runs are:
---
Arena runs, where you basically only do the arena event and then reset. This is mostly done for specific loot, such as the gladiator chain. But there is also a summonable T0.5 boss in there I believe.
---
Lava runs, where you only need to do a couple of trash packs and jump over lava to reach the Lyceum as fast as possible. This is usually done to reach Thaurissian as fast as possible either for a quest or to farm his loot, typically HoJ, Ironfoe, but there is also some other good loot in there.
---
Yes but during launch and early phase, none of them will sell well on AH, as people wont have to money to buy.
---
Not sure if the year is 2004 or 2019....
---
My vacation time resets in June (original hire date with my company). 
---
Could really use when I want to take staycation.
---
Isn‚Äôt this a throwback to Alex Afrasiabi aka Furor talking about WoW &amp; Jeff?
---
So you expect Alliance raids to just eat 6-8+ second fears on their tank if Berserker Rage isn't off CD in time? Meanwhile the boss is cleaving/breathing on the raid killing dps and healers.
---
Ah nice work guys... Still cant decide on a class... I usually cant decide until fairly close to release. I'd like to play mage but i know there will be way too many, and AoE grinding probably wont be that much fun upon release. Thought about Shaman cause i have never truly leveled one and I like having the option to raid heal, but not sure if i want to commit to playing horde. Thought about lock instead of mage, but dont really want to get bored... and of course warrior is always a good choice  however, always over populated, and I have leveled a couple of them so that is up in the air. My last consideration is Druid, because I have only ever leveled one to like 30, and that was pretty damn fun, but then again i rather be a Tauren than a Nelf, and that leaves me with sticking with horde faction. Almost leaning towards horde because I have mained alliance for so long.  Ugh sorry for the rant just venting i suppose. See you in classic!
---
Been using this for a while in my rotation.  Excellent job!
---
a Healer. any kind. someone that actually heals and dispels.
---
your win rate will be 20-30% higher as a healer than any other role.
---
Strath is one of my favorite Dungeons. It is well designed and very rewarding in terms of loot as well, some of it is iconic. Live is a great dungeon to farm since righteous orbs can be sold for a high price throughout all stages. The atmosphere and the mechanics are great too.
---
Horde (is there another faction?)
---
Warlock/Hunter (still deciding)
---
No idea but pvp
---
Herb/Alch
---
SM/Rueeeen
---
Maybe raiding, maybe pvp. Ill see how it is when I hit max. I never went past MC and the 20 mans back in classic so I might want to raid.
---
I've been planning this at near autistic levels for awhile now. My go to is Dwarf Paladin and I do it whenever I'm left to my own devices, but this time my friends convinced me to go horde and play hunter to satisfy my lust for providing utility. After testing all the appearances and animations on an instant 60 pserver I've landed on Female Tauren Hunter. I mainly care about the look and feel of my character, but the aoe stun fits my utility cravings nicely. I'm also super curious if they will fix Tauren Hitbox to be larger again since that could potentially allow for some cheeky deadzone manipulation with deviate delights; There are currently no private servers to test this on so I'll have to find out the hard way.

Appearance/Pre-Raid Gear: \[[https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rozc0zJ89ccVMMz9m8m3t808m3e87ccna87Vc1P808mRK808m3v808m3g808mRS808cQL87c](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rozc0zJ89ccVMMz9m8m3t808m3e87ccna87Vc1P808mRK808m3v808m3g808mRS808cQL87c)\]([https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rozc0zJ89ccVMMz9m8m3t808m3e87ccna87Vc1P808mRK808m3v808m3g808mRS808cQL87c](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rozc0zJ89ccVMMz9m8m3t808m3e87ccna87Vc1P808mRK808m3v808m3g808mRS808cQL87c))  
---
Note on the gear: I really like beaststalker's and wearing mail over leather whenever possible, so \[I did the math\]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ArWKn5Ldzv2HKe\_kj65rwqLBCfxJcIEkvBnlWHWKzhE/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ArWKn5Ldzv2HKe_kj65rwqLBCfxJcIEkvBnlWHWKzhE/edit#gid=0)) and it turns out you can do it with solid results if you are willing to go surefooted. The biggest trade-off isn't the raw stats on the gear itself but rather the -3% to imp hawk to get surefooted. So this doesn't apply to anyone who wants to go 20/31/0, or anyone who wants to buy Dwarven Hand Cannon since you need hit on wep for this to work. I'll still need to have mask + truestrike in the bank to help transition into T1 while staying hit capped, but surefooted will help with that too. At the very least Voone's + Beaststalker Pants is only -4ap and -1.3% crit compared to Devilsaur so I'll be rolling those savings into my Arcanite Reaper. While Dal'Rends offers more crit, I don't want to bother taking them from other people when I'd only be using them on pve fights where I can't work in melee... I might still do it but Reaper -&gt; Lok'delar -&gt; Ashkandi is my current gameplan. What's really nice is by using Reaper + Black Crow until I obtain muh leaf I can get a lot of practice in for BWL Xbow + Ashkandi timings down the road. Okay, guess that note was more of a paragraph.
---
  
---
\[End-Game Spec\]([http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZiVohthtI0rmoh](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#cbZiVohthtI0rmoh)) While leveling I'll rush aimed shot, then go all the way down BM.  
---
Server: PvP or rp/pvp if the blizz gods will it. I'll be aiming for a semi-hardcore guild since I want to be with other active players but I don't put as much emphasis on min/maxing as proper hardcore guilds do.  
---
Profs: Mining/Engi all the way.
---
I forget, could you chat to opposite factions when MC?
---
Well that confirms dwarf over bled Hunter for me.
---
Definitely planning my character, but don't care at all about getting to 60 as fast as I can.
---
My main thoughts and drive:
---
- PvP Server
---
- Horde
---
- Something I played before or something new?
---
- Time on professions vs time 'progressing'?
---
I know this is vague and undefined...but I promise I've spent tons of hours contemplating these points and reading through old sources and playing with calculators.
---
Fair enough. I think that's a good way to voice the end-goal of anything added to the game. There were so many things that were just shocking and difficult to adjust to with expansions, which is why I think so many people resist the idea entirely. It was basically like making a whole new game out of the old version. And maybe that's what the player base has really tired of.  
---
Because in vanilla, the (usually) small adjustments/tweaks being made from patch to patch were generally considered improvements, especially as new content was released. Additionally, by adding new levels with each expansion, they really "moved the goalposts" and eventually leveling was considered overly daunting, so they ruined that to make it more user friendly to new players - eventually offering a pay-to-win option to skip it entirely.  
---
But, I think it would be amazing if they kept to the vanilla standard, as you suggest. What if  they simply add new content instead of increasing levels? (Especially by 10, holy cow). I mean, many of us have fantasized over "The Emerald Dream" for YEARS. They even built a base-map for it, before the program was scrapped, and we never got it. Or maybe they could re-build a classic version of Karazhan, Mt. Hyjal, and/or CoT - hell, they could use CoT to reset the entire last 10 years! ...all of this could be amazing, as long as they "kept it classic" by avoiding adding all the useless crap! Heck, even adding new races/classes was bad, especially those f\*\*king pandas (I tried MoP for a month. I HATED it) - so yes, I would much prefer the simplicity of the vanilla races/classes, but with hand-picked portions of the TBC and Wrath expansions. And ONLY the things that actually fit into the original lore - none of the randomly inserted nonsense like "OMG SPACEGOATS! NOW A PLAYABLE RACE!") I mean, did I miss the Dreanai altogether??? That was the weirdest thing I never saw coming...  
---
I don't know - I just think the vanilla version had SO much un-tapped potential, which was scrapped in favor of creating a new version every couple years or so, adding random trinkets and gizmos which eventually just distorted the game into something unrecognizable.  
---
But this brings me back to the "Change management" I started talking about initially - you've probably learned about it in some business management studies. Creating/implementing a change isn't always a bad thing, but always works best when everyone on the team is involved in the process, THE ENTIRE WAY. You probably already know many people get this wrong - they create a change, then try to bring in everybody into the process of implementing their change, wondering all along why it meets with tons of friction and resistence. Which is EXACTLY what Blizzard has done for all these years.  
---
I would love to see how many fans/users actually wanted to level up each expansion. Or how many people wanted Outlands instead of The Emerald Dream (the forums I remember were bitterly against TBC). But that's what they handed us. And we ate it up. So they thought they could keep doing it, and eventually we finally left. Broken-hearted. We want our old friend back - so they're bringing her back, and we all say "OMG YES BUT NO CHANGES" ...and yet, what if we could go back to the old ways of excruciatingly slow improvements, and the excitement of the new dungeon opening in just a couple months... I always felt like that was part of the allure of the game. There was always something just over the horizon...  
---
Take that away, and maybe that's part of why the game would die - much like pservers do...  
---
(If you actually read that whole thing, I am sorry for taking up your time) =D
---
Bran confirmed Cowboys fan.
---
I‚Äôd say like 60-80% of people will have a max level within a month.
---
95% of people will recommend deep feral levelling. The only real 'choice' is when to get OoC and furor. I think the standard is going straight for LotP (31pt feral) with an early single point in nature's grasp, then getting furor, then OoC.  
---
It's very hard to think up a reason why you'd go resto for levelling. A good set of int gear is enough to get you through healing 5 mans even without any talents in resto.
---
This is my actual response though. The core game is still there, it‚Äôs the same engine. Retail is fun
---
Simply put. 
---
You can't choose a PLAYER VS PLAYER server and not expect something like this. 
---
It's like joining a gang and being fucking shocked when you get jumped "for no reason"
---
The server you choose can completely eradicate those experiences.... 
---
If you choose to play on a server that involves contested areas then you would expect enemies......
---
Obviously you want to either 1v1 duel/salute every enemy.... which isn't gonna happen pvp server... or expect to only see people your level.
---
Like I said.... why play a pvp server and complain about pvp...?
---
You do realize that there are endless ways to get away from people in this game....
---
I agree it‚Äôs useful for tanking, but everything else is jump and mouseturn to avoid back hits. 
---
That‚Äôs completely untrue. You aren‚Äôt restricted to rtdfg. You probably haven‚Äôt even tried it. With QWE I can hit ASD with the joint of my finger. I can also hit RT,FG, and ZXCVB with my thumb and pinky. Furthermore, I bind the tilde key all the way to 6, but I generally just go to 4 because that‚Äôs more comfortable. Everything else is binded to my mouse side buttons and mouse wheel forward, back, and side to side (with modifiers). 
---
Shift, CTRL, and alt-Spacebar are also very effective bonds that most people don‚Äôt think of using.
---
Yeah but D7 is a bunch of twats.
---
Thought about this myself tbh. I've been horde since release and I've played with the idea a bit. The people joining me are down for either (main longtime friend wants to play a pally but she'll settle for horde rogue if need be). Do I change it up? Not sure. Playing a lock against WotF scares me a bit... as someone who played WotF back then as UD.
---
Going to the top of ironforge. You could go on top of the bridge, or go to the top of the mountain, slow fall all the way down to menethil harbor.
---
Since making this meme I've missed the zep 3 times in a row...
---
Fair point, but did not answer my internal dilemma lol. Also I would argue that a lot more people preparing to play classic know what they're doing/how to level efficiently compared to 2004 vanilla
---
I think he meant leper‚Äôs is
---
Not one person said keybindings, you‚Äôre all scrubs imo
---
Ass
---
I do I hunt lol
---
What is your guild on your RP realm doing right now?
---
I think he meant leperous.
---
Lol I knew someone would correct that with hunting.
---
Fake news
---
holy fuck the ending, best office gif yet
---
Is that clicking action bars instead of using key bindings I see?!?
---
Warlock my be a good option if you are handy in PvP. You may still get one shot by an ambush once in a while, but if you gear and pay attention that might not be too much of a problem. Id say you have a pretty good chance against most warriors, but later on it gets harder when they have fear drops and what not.
---
Fire mage is a nice option too, pretty decent leveling speed and will dominate frost mages, most ppl opt for playing frost mage from the start any way. As fire you can still kite and dominate warriors and rogues as well.
---
Compared to every caster, no. They are inefficient even with full consumables.
---
I want a buggy launch, just like retail #nochanges
---
Will they start off with the brackets being 10-19, 20-29, etc, or will it be 11-20, 21-30? The last time I made a bg character the level range to play in was 21-30 for WSG.
---
...you think you don't, but you do =P  
---
No but seriously, I don't mean to insult you. But eventually the game needs to be reset. Eventually you have to breathe new life into it. Instead of starting a new server, or re-playing the "meh" expansions, why not put in the work and effort to add more content to what we already have? I'm not saying more classes. I definitely don't want more races (we all know they'd just f\*\*k that up). But I would love to continue the lore (the parts that actually make sense - not the nonsense they added just because they could).  
---
Bring back Karazhan - but at lvl 60. Hell, make it a 20 man raid! Or bring back Mt. Hyjal, but in 40 man lvl 60 raid. I'd love to have ICC back (probably minus the UK stuff - just focus on the LK). Sunwell plateau was meh, so leave that out.  
---
And if you HAVE to build an expansion one day, make it The Emerald Dream. But not as a NEW game - keep it true to vanilla...
---
Would be funny if you‚Äôre was used correctly... Kinda ruins the meme for me tbh....
---
Yeah, I love the game, but won't miss deer camp, it's a blast
---
Side note: I never played Cata - but 1H Fury topping DPS meters sounds amazing. Would've loved to see that! (My first toon was a Warrior - loved that class all the way up until Wrath, when they were OP in BG's so EVERYONE had a warrior).
---
After Darkshore (nelf drood) Ima hit up abunch of connected areas for fps and run WC for Crescent Staff. Guaranteed drop and will be bis for a long time since I'll be floating between tanking and healing dungeons. Might be rough getting people to run there, but I'll save time by grabbing fps while I'm doing it :).
---
Yeah,  but more money for everyone isn't bad. 
---
Shit id settle for a monthly reset... just something.  
---
I forgot the cap,  but I remember it being like holy shit on my shaman and I stayed enhance and my guild luckily didn't care
---
I mean probably Druid in WSG, not so much for actually winning the game, but a good Druid delaying with the flag forever can make everyone on the other team just want to kill themselves. This, in the end can actually win you the game and people on the other side cycle out and leave. Its a strange "power" that a Druid has.
---
Otherwise, a hard carry is mostly going to be an overgeared Warrior, Ret/Reckoning Paladin and maybe a Rogue. The thing is, to carry, you have to be able to handle being dogpiled by a few people, which casters, even with good gear, struggle with and Hunters are actually pretty bad when being outnumbered and not with a group. Overgeared Warriors and Ret/Reckoning Paladins have the combination you need, tanky with a lot of punch. Rogues too, but not nearly as tanky nor do they have as good maneuverability.
---
Faction: Alliance

You're not wrong and these slots are usually reserved for guild leaders friends. I'm not sure why I keep seeing post endorsing raiding for classic as a spriest, it's like a 10 percent chance of you being able to.
---
&gt; Simply put. You can't choose a PLAYER VS PLAYER server and not expect something like this.
---
It seems to me there's a big, obvious difference between expecting something and liking something. Nobody is saying PvP server players don't expect gankers. We are just trying to explain to you that they aren't obliged to like gankers.
---
It seems like we are having a very pointless conversation where I am just saying "Some people don't like X" and you keep repeating "BUT X IS A THING THAT HAPPENS!!!" as if you think that somehow requires people to like it.
---
Agreed.
---
Made it a great time. 
---
5v5 was crazy as hell
---
Well, unless.you get 10 healers.
---
Oof oww help
---
Every song in the drakedog videos, also live to win!
---
 \&gt; You can't go wrong with crusader
---
Yes you can, since it is objectively worse in terms of threat.
---
This is pretty off brother. Hardcore guilds raided 5 nights a week for like 5 hours. There was a shit ton of casual guilds that raided once or two for a few hours and still got MC, BWL, and ZG down. You don‚Äôt need to up the effort until Twin Emps. Everything sub twin emps (aside from a couple bosses) requires no non-raid-hour effort at all
---
PVP is a different story but hybrid classes weren't really made for raiding in vanilla. Look at druids for example they can't tank unless they have a specific world epic BOE weapon.
---
Buddies of mine ran a 3 warrior tank ab game.  Park 1 on each node with heals and they won a good majority of the games.
---
My PC was so bad in vanilla that the load time from taking a zepplin took so long that it would be heading back by the time I finished loading lmfao
---
But do you honestly think anyone likes dying to griefers? 
---
Fuck no 
---
But it is cause and effect....
---
The effect is you either team up or have someone higher come help.
---
Have you played shadow, have you theorycrafted shadow, have you built a gear simulator for shadow?
---
I'm pretty sure I'm in a better position to determine performance.
---
Yes, but you got one *crucial* thing wrong; main spec is defined as what you're using in that specific run. If you're healing, then that is your main spec, and you can roll on healing gear. If you're DPSing in that run, then that is considered your main spec for the duration of the group.
---
There wouldn't be ANY point of main spec /off-spec if you can just pick a random spec, *opposite* of the current spec you already have.
---
Idk why retail dying is so important to some people.  That wasnt the point of the post.
---
 Just like we say to people who shit talk classic:  you dont have to play it.
---
Would really appreciate that if classic stays in its core principles. Had a shower thought a few minutes ago: I would love to see something like a T3.5 set which makes memespeccs really viable. Something like giving a taunt ability to paladins via set bonus etc.
---
Man that would be really awesome.
---
I remember my first level 40. I was like 9 or 10, and my mom made my brother make a character for me on his account. I remember hitting it, stealing gold from my brother's warlock, and buying my mount. Shit was so satisfying.
---
Exactly, there is no reason for them to do so. Most of them did it when it was current. They are focused on current progression raiding, not pushing progression on what is essentially old content. Anything that's released in Classic can be done now. All the strats are there. There isn't anything to prove.
---
I ran a website in vanilla called thefacesofrage.com where I would post hate messages I received on a second account. 
---
Guild was called Not the Face. 
---
We are coming back for classic.

Might be more like 10g an hour I was just pulling a number out of my ass at work. Assuming you stick to duo leveling, and have a few hours a day AFK time, LWing might be your best bet for gold.
---
I did this to mess around with druid and pally. I hit 20 in like an hour and it was just a roflstomp. Aoe'd everything and ran dungeons in 20 min or less. Got a lvl 20 paladin named Classicwow :P. This experience was like chinese food. It was fun for like an hour than left feeling empty again.
---
I'd like to know what server you roll on! Sounds great.
---
...then you have to roll hordeside, because alliance won't get there as quickly
---
I'll be on a Pve RP server which I imagine is the least possibly likely place to find those types. If you feel like trykng it out ever I'd recommend a place like that as well, haha.
---
I figure I'd better be prepared, either way. And if there's a class with the same versatility as my trusty SK, I can easily transition from tanking to DPS. Surely Blizzard wouldn't design classes that can fill multiple roles and then not balance their abilities to actually allow the to fulfill those roles in practice. Right?
---
Bah, my bad. I'll keep an eye out for next time, thanks for letting me know! (I'm a filthy Alliance so i couldnt tell)
---
I had a similar one on my warrior - mage came up, polymorphed me, froze the mobs and blinked away. My health regen'd and I finished the fight.
---
Ditto, I did that in high school when I was competing in sports and said never fucking again. I'm absolutely miserable if I don't have a significant amount of time to myself.
---
Ah, Emerald Dream. I transferred over there during MoP for the WPvP. Sadly, large scale WPvP has been dying due to phasing and server lag.
---
Am I a noob for using healbot? Lol
---
I think 3 weeks unless I have work travel or some shit like that. I don't see the need to race to do it in 1-2 weeks. First month and you'll be solidly ahead of the curve if raid spots or whatever are your worry.
---
Wait James Spader was on the office?
---
Gonna assume you mean Iksar? If so, I only play lizard people in Civilization III, preferably of the English or Russian civilization variant üòâ
---
I'm not sure how realistic it is, but I am going rogue, and I want Thunderfury.
---
I joined random raids and I don't recall any real pickiness. Pime build? A warm body that shows up lol
---
\&gt;  10 Damage more per target affected
---
Compare that to Crusader. Even if you had 100% uptime (which you wont have) that would only increase your single target DPS by 100 \* 2 / 14 =\~ 14. Now consider that 5mans are 95% trash packs and add all the other abilities that scale with spell damage and you can guess why it is superiour.
---
Big difference between "low on health" and "Never lose health when playing WoW".
---
Warlock, Hunter.
---
Tirion Fordring so I can be like Jon Snow and kill undead all day long
---
A skilled player can make a poor build perform well and a crappy player can blah blah blah it's subjective
---
Is semi casual more than casual or less than casual?
---
"No, what you have are bullets, and once you have run out of them, by the time you have reloaded, you will all be dead."
---
Are you worried about getting geared upn(pre-raid)?
---
Druid FC, Holy Paladin, Frost Mage, Warlock, geared Warrior.
---
I've already planned leveling builds for all of my alts :(
---
Slightly more lol.
---
or Strangle-gank Vietnam
---
Isn't retail opt-in PvP only now? You could do the same on a rp-pve server if everyone flags up
---
So many Horde players. I wonder what the Chinese servers will look like. Does anyone know what class/faction distribution is going to look like on Chinese servers?
---
I want to play rogue and don‚Äôt want to fight orc. Orc strong. Orc fight stun. I want fight stun.
---
Wow Joana is on Twitch? Not to mention streaming the original 4d20h time? Man I still remember when I first heard about this - and there was a guide!
---
That guide was awesome. I wonder if I still have the PDF laying around somewhere.
---
Fucking great.
---
How many nights will you be able to raid? I‚Äôm in the same boat as you probably. I want to raid, but time is kind of imperative!
---
* Horde
---
* Troll - male
---
* Shaman
---
* PvP
---
* Herb/Skinning to level - Alch Eng at 60. Hunter alt will be Herb/Mining
---
* Resto
---
* Raiding - not world first but pushing content pretty hard.
---
Look again ...
---
At some point in the game there was a stat squish.
---
Would this guide be compatible for a warrior? Or would grinding be required as well?
---
So never then.
---
definitely recommend POM-Pyro build. its a little cheesy but it literaly can 1 shot people. 
---
i played it a lot in vanilla, every 2 mins you basically have an i win button if you need it.
---
summon isnt too big of a hassle. a lot of the pet abilities are really usefull. for covering your weakness. soul like splits the dmg you take with your pet makin you really tanky, felhunter for casters and succubus seduce is really good. warlocks have 0 mobility tho. but fear is the best pvp CC in the game so there is that
---
&gt; But do you honestly think anyone likes dying to griefers?
---
Nobody said anything like that. What are you talking about?
---
&gt; But it is cause and effect....
---
So what? If I take a job with long hours and good benefits then long hours are cause and effect. But that doesn't mean I can't dislike the long hours and like the good benefits, does it?
---
&gt; The effect is you either team up or have someone higher come help.
---
But do you have to like it? Is that mandatory for some reason? What law are you breaking if it happens and you say "bah, this is the part of playing on a PvP server that sucks"?
---
Strong communities are messy and need work.   The why we form communities is is often inter-dependencies (i.e. you need each other to succeed) and not just geographical.   Remove inter-dependencies or the challenge of relationships, and you end up with weak communities.    Tinder-like dating, outsourcing, and  centralized distant governance do the  same in real life.  Classic wow is a view of how many of our parent's and grandparent's communities were like, minus the dragons.
---
I'd probably expect myself to raid 2 nights a week. With an optional night for 20mans. Anything more than that and it's a problem, anything less and I'd never make any progress.
---
This, every time.
---
Don't make me get my main
---
Warlock is even less than druid by that data on alliance/pvp.
---
Play a priest and camp Azuregos when the time comes. Wait on the highest nearby hill/mountain without being seen. Time your levitation down to perfectly float down and DoT the dragon and jump off the cliff. If they are fighting close enough to the drop off you will be able to get a reset. My best was resetting when she was around 40%. Followed me down the cliff and bugged out as I floated off into the distance. I was able to wipe them a few times for about an hour, but they eventually set up a strike team of people waiting on their mounts. 
---
Shoutout to Tyranny on Burning Legion. Can‚Äôt fuck with Ropetown, boiiiiii.
---
There's no way they wouldn't adhere to how it was in Vanilla. This was with brackets ending in 9s
---
I don't have to. I've played shadow my whole life. Link me fights were Spriest are out classing mages and warlocks in top guilds lol.
---
I needed dragons call as a mage in ST and won it. Felt bad for the rogue and war in group but I looked badass all the way to WOTLK
---
All those smells are just the shit on your upper lip, fam.
---
In a raid environment:
---
All Mages can buff / sheep / give water regardless of spec, so if an Arcane Mage did that, I wouldn't mind that he did less damage and was regularly oom.
---
If a Paladin didn't want to pay to respec to holy for three hours of MC/Ony farm night before respeccing back into PvP spec but this Paladin's still actively buffing, healing, dispeling, positioning himself to provide buffs, I wouldn't love it, but it'd be fine.
---
The primary appeal of a Shadow Priest is the talent Shadow Weaving to buff the Warlocks' DPS. In a situation where our raid had zero Warlocks and the buff wasn't being used, it wouldn't be ideal, but as long as the Shadow Priest isn't pulling threat and causing a wipe, I just recognize that it could be a lot worse.
---
Why would I have axe body spray on my upper lip.
---
Thanks. Thinking undead then.
---
Why would that lead to getting 60k RP and not reaching rank 14? It would lead to having same CP but getting different RP, which is fine. It would still be 13k for standing 1 and lower for lower standings.
---
It is just not reasonable to expect this to work. First of maybe it straight up does not (all our knowledge about honor system is guess work) and even if it does work it would be crazy expecting Blizz not to fix it.
---
rank 10 on druid maybe ? epic mount for sure and maxed professions.
---
And having a gear set for each roll that is no some greens i found while questing, maybe pre bis for each off spec dunno
---
Is that the sword that has a proc to summon an Emerald whelping?
---
But adds a debuff
---
Yeah two nights a week is pretty standard for casual type guilds right? Still though two nights is a lot. Hope I‚Äôll be able to pull it off.
---
I'm gonna kill so many levelers... I MEAN fully grown lvl 60s
---
Hahaha. So many potential gross answers for such a question.
---
Yeah! It was glorious - I‚Äôd melee spank shit , during BC I was in a great raiding guild and had a lot of money so I threw mongoose on it and used to call myself a battle mage lol. People were so confused
---
Two nights is totally do-able. Any guild that's got some decent leadership and manages time wisely can raid 2ish hours a night, 2 nights a week, and still clear a good amount of the raids.
---
Rogue CC was garbage.
---
Why Bring 2 druids? You bring one of them and a feral. And you really only need 2 priests. This gives your warlock groups some much needed treath reduction
---
Rolling a warlock or a rogue on pvp servers always a good bet, nobody wants to take on a warlock that has seen you and expects an attack. If you attack a rogue l, prepare to get yourself stalked for a long time.
---
Rolling a warrior on the other hand, for me anyway, is scary shit.
---
Assasins blade wasn¬¥t for me though.
---
With that kind of gear you don¬¥t rely on openers for most enemies. You can mostly just walk up to people and straight up smash their faces in.
---
2007 and living your best life.
---
Gets better after MS at 40. You have no ability to escape, so if you pull too many mobs, you will die. 
---
I only had one 60 in vanilla, so I didn‚Äôt know any better. I can‚Äôt imagine any classes being worse at leveling.
---
my point is just roll your main, don't rack your brain over what secondary toon to roll because it is unlikely you'll ever have the time or inclination for it.
---
Using the pre-raid bis list in this video, plus phase 1 enchants and consumables (no flask) shadow does 482 dps, but only has 92 seconds of dps time til oom. This is long enough for most bosses in MC. If you need more time you can downrank mind blast and you would still be doing competitive dps.
---
Using the same gear with same enchants/consumables, arcane power/frost does about 460 dps, but with much better longevity.
---
I‚Äôm chasing that world first spot down under, so I‚Äôll be joining you in stinky chair shenanigans.  
---
Playing a 36-40h initial run then 18h on/6h off to 60.  
---
Should be fun!
---
Barrens is a great zone. Love grinding quests, loot them greys, skin them beasts, spout absolute tosh on General Chat- live your best life.
---
Did you just say tank and spank?
---
Viscidus
---
Nope. Not a chance. Be sure to roll a legit hybrid with strong DPS, like a paladin. Also doesn't matter if your guild is horde - paladins can play either faction
---
There are two kinds of times: world first and world record. The record will go to the best execution and that will keep going down over time. Not sure how we will account for rested xp etc but we‚Äôll see.
---
You have 14 days ...
---
In vanilla the brackets did start off ending in 0s until they changed it in a later patch (also in vanilla). I know they're doing a "gradual" roll out of changes in stages so I was wondering if we know if they'll start off with the 21-30 bracket like they initially had. You could do a lot of crazy things in those brackets and it was extremely imbalanced but also fun.
---
I found the notes from where they added it just to make sure I wasn't crazy. Patch 1.7.0 was where they changed it to end in 9s: "Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin will now be level-banded as follows: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60"
---
You ever actually pvp on a warrior? Wf totem is win more. Blessing of freedom and cleanse are just win.
---
LOL
---
‚ÄúTo call my own‚Äù man it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm forced, plus the hours spend are spend hanging out doing other stuff with partner or friends. Try it. Chill.
---
Yeah I'll be there with Desolace Stanley
---
"Elemental shaman is legit one of the best PvP specs in the game."
---
After AQ40 they are absolutely t1 but I did say until AQ40. Before that ele is a dud.
---
desolace, DWM, badlands, SoS all work 30-42ish oh and Thousand Needles salt flats for 30-32
---
So... we just need targeting system introduced to WoW :)
---
Geared warrior with a pocket healer, you can single handedly win pub battlegrounds.
---
But you'll have better games if you join a pre-made
---
I get it. I do :-) thanks for your reply man! 
---
Plus grass in STV is pretty green. I mean when it‚Äôs not red of blood.
---
Enhance in pvp? Weak mobility, requires melee range, unreliable. But if lucky can delete an enemy in second(s). Still thinking if I'd want to roll this...
---
Thank you, updated with a new link!
---
Enhance doesn't delete anyone in seconds. Classic won't be patch 1.1.
---
Some of most memorable moments in WoW happened when I was playing alone. For reason or another no friends online so quiet night, some frozen pizza and WoW. Quite often it lead me meeting someone in game. Some people I did even add to my MSN Messenger and we might play for weeks together doing quests.
---
WoW is great place to meet people. Even today I have a lot of close real life friends I've met through WoW.
---
As neat as stoneform can be if you're on a pvp server how could you pass on shadowmeld for a hunter? I just cannot pass on that. Use it to guard flags in bg's or to gank or to just be able to safely afk.
---
The story is mainly told in the manuals and the mission briefings. The missions themselves don't really tell a story other than a fight took place here.
---
In vanilla you had to keep your mounts in your bags.
---
No. These people are all going to take release day off and then be mad when the servers go to shit.
---
How about ogri -&gt; Shat -&gt; fly to portal and then fly to blackrock?
---
Rogue
---
Enchanting and a gathering. Possibly mining since I'll be leveling slower so I can make use of the AH more as the faster players power level BS and Engi.
---
Combat Riposte for leveling.
---
My friends are starting a guild I think so I'll be in there.
---
I have a basic idea of what dungeon quests I'll do to keep myself in blue weapons most of the way. Other than that I'm intentionally not planning out any kind of leveling route.
---
I think it works but it's long time investment. At start people don't have too much gold because on day 1 there will be 0 gold in whole server. So if people want to get things sold they have to sell cheap. You could be important items for cheap (mostly trade goods) and wait.. wait even couple of months. When people have more money naturally prices start to rise to "normal" levels and then you can sell things you bought a long time ago.
---
Sure there will be problems. There is no gold in game but there isn't much of trade goods either. And many people use theirs to level crafting professions. So you can't just buy many stacks.
---
But overall I think you are not going to get rich or get any real advantage or head start. As I said you might get pretty nice profit on long run but buying things at start to sell later means you don't have gold for important things like abilities, gear and mount.
---
I get you, i truly do. And this is something which i would have been able to discuss better if i actually played OSRS.
---
Thing is, i followed blizzard since 1998, its really hard for me for believe in that dedicated team, especially in the era of Activision. Blizzard at this time has shown only one thing, that they always try to spread too thin, with every single game they made. It hurt Retail, it removed the reason Diablo 2 was called ARPG in Diablo 3.
---
75% agreeing on a change means that overall more people could come to play as well, because ofc that majority always represent success. Then again i wonder, what happens after 3 years? I fear that full circle which i gave as an example in the OP. I think this will have far more dire effect on WoW tha OSRS. 
---
So lets say it happens, do we go Jagex way and ignore people that want true vanilla experience and remove their desire? Or do we leave servers for them as well. How much can we divide a community? Do we drive people away in the name of progress? There are no easy answers but in the end i think we will get people that want "true" vanilla, just like  OSRS.
---
Iv made millions of gold over the years using the ah. Problem is there is no established market and the gold mint won‚Äôt start printing money until quests are done and people vendor shit. 
---
To go to the point of your initial question, if you buy at a low price to flip early on, for example first few days to weeks, the ‚Äúprofit‚Äù you are seeing when you sell later is likely just going to be inflation, I could be wrong demand may make prices spike and you see a lot of return on investment not just inflation correction. It‚Äôs hard to predict which market that will happen in, besides I‚Äôm not comfortable telling people where to invest the little gold they may have.
---
Troll
---
Hunter
---
PvP Realm
---
Skinning - Leatherworking
---
fuck around in the barrens from like level 10 to level 41 or some shit, then fall to my death in 1k
---
The thing about early AH is that nobody has surplus gold to corner the market.
---
By all means you can try to craft lots of bags, and sell them on the AH. But as many folk are leveling tailoring, there will be lots of bags. You don‚Äôt have the gold to buy all of them and re-list them at your price. 
---
Also, what I am seeing is many players will start in guilds already, as many are recruiting now. This means that folk will be helping their guild mates by crafting items if players provide the mats. It helps folk level their professions and guild mates get the items easily. 
---
I think the AH will take a long time to become established as most players won‚Äôt use it till they get to 60. 
---
My personal plan is to take skinning and mining, till I get to 60. I‚Äôll vendor most of my leather, and save the ore or bars till I am 60, by sending all to a bank alt (as well as any other things I find on my way to 60). I don‚Äôt plan on buying or listing anything at the AH till 60, as I want to save for my mount at 40 and epic at 60. 
---
I‚Äôll be asking guild mates for 8-10-12 bags as soon as possible (once I have the mats), then concentrating purely on leveling.
---
Ya it has been a pretty entertaining post to field. I really appreciate your thoughts. As far as additional evidence it would require an exhausting psychological analysis expressed in nested confidence intervals to really try to estimate how far off we could be on the state of hunters in classic. My idea was meant to be a more lighthearted exploration based on what I thought was a fairly intuitive set of potential biases. As you touched on, the sad part is that even if hunters could be much better given the openness of others to the possibility, it likely wont happen, if private servers are any indication. I assume that the private server community, and their guides and videos will largely dictate peoples opinions in classic. I worry though that metas are too rigid, and too little credit is given to the individuals potential. Now Ive gone on a tangent. Anyway, this was fun. Thanks for a useful contribution, lol. I hope your coffee was godly.
---
I know, it's just the stuff that I'm capable of doing is pretty stellar. I can't imagine how dope it is to be a warrior or whoever really with a pocket pally. 
---
That said, Shamans are a pretty incredible class in their own way. I went up against a group in WSG that has 4 AQ geared shamans and a resto shaman and we got slaughtered. I could go on for days about how difficult of a matchup they are, strong offensive capabilities and a literal counter to BOP / freedom.
---
What if i told you that they might be in a stage that they don't feel comfortable talking to us about the release date ? That's how companies working on products work. I'd rather have one true release date which is right, instead of 5 different postponed release dates.
---
People needs to play smarter, that's all ^^, I actually do believe that it'll be harder to play rogue today than back in the days, since people have a lot more knowledge now.
---
I'm planning to have my 'solo' character that focuses more on PvP and shenanigans and a 'party' character that I'd play with friends when they're on and it'd have a PvE focus. 
---
For the solo pvp char I constantly go back and forth between Rogue and Hunter. Both are great at leveling, at ganking, and pvp in general etc
---
For my friends &amp; group oriented character I am leaning towards warrior so I can tank. But if I do warrior here I fear I won't be all that into it or all that into my rogue as they have a bit of overlap in play styles - both being melee physical damage dealers who use similar gear even. So I figure if I do go warrior then my solo ganker char should be hunter.
---
And I'd be fine with playing warrior &amp; hunter if it weren't for how good stealth is at open world pvp shenanigans. I love sneaking into the enemy city and ganking flagged characters etc
---
So if I go rogue, I might take warrior out of consideration. Then I guess I'd be left with choosing a caster class for my PvE char. I suppose I could do Priest for something different.
---
Fellow female troll hunter checking in. Great choice.
---
When I played vanilla I had four level 60's and many lvl 20-30's. 
---
I'd bet many people who browse this subreddit aren't the casuals who will only have on character.
---
Haha let's go :)
---
&gt;The humans of the southern kingdom Stormwind mobilized to combat this threat in what would be referred to in future days as the Second War. They were victorious in the end, but it was a pyrrhic victory, embroiling them in deep racial tensions and scattering the Orcs across the land.
---
Well that's not correct. First Stormwind got destroyed in the first War, which shouldn't be omitted, and the survivors had to flee to Lordaeron where the first Alliance was formed. Eventually the Alliance won the second war because Gul'Dan had betrayed the Horde and thus had weekend their army. The Alliance was able to push the Horde back through the Dark Portal.
---
Then after two years, the Portal reopens and the Horde invades Azeroth for a second time. Ner'Zhul desires to get his hands on certain artifacts which allow him to open portals to other worlds so the Horde may conquer yet again. But an Alliance expedition led by Ranger General Alleria Windrunner, Turalyon, Danath Trollbane, Kurdran Wildhammer and Khadgar goes through the Portal and enters Draenor. There they fight the Horde and try to protect Azeroth from yet another attack.When Ner'Zhul finally manges to open the Portals, Draenor is being torn assunder and is made unstable due to the overflow of magic. The Alliance expedition is forced to close the portal to Azeroth, which they do, trapping themselves on Draenor in the process.
---
This is WC2 + the expansion set. Dunno why you didn't mention it.
---
The mission briefings had very little story in them, and I don't have the manuals. Even the mission briefing  for the level with Medivh is no more than "evil wizard, go kill." 
---
Perhaps playing through WC3 first before I went back through WC and WC2 jaded my expectations, but I felt that the story telling aspect of the first 2 games was lackluster. I can't really say it was a bad thing though, they were pretty early have from Blizzard and I don't think they expected the Warcraft universe to take off like it did.
---
BFA Community is amazing. If you either spend some time to find one that suits you, OR create your own. The work work you put in collectively to progress mythic raiding and work on parses with each other is a lot of fun and it takes dedication and time ! I miss the vanilla experience and the feels from 2004 too sometimes, but that‚Äôs just me missing the feeling of exploring a new gameworld yet seen. 
---
Plus 19 twinks was amazing! 
---
Anyway I‚Äôm just saying, BFA is great if you make an effort to find something that suits you.
---
Yeah it is grindy but I enjoy that. Find good spots and go for it. 
---
My personal trick was using my rested xp as grinding xp, I‚Äôd find caves were a Good spot with lots of mobs and good drops normally. Also, once I finished all the quests in an area, I‚Äôd grind till I dinged the next level, then move zone. Found this made the next zone to be easier and helped level quickly.
---
Oh god i laughed so hard at work. Colleagues are wondering why is "work" being so funny.
---
Jesus.
---
I guess I am.
---
Eli5 , what makes redridge so good for ganking lowbies?
---
Not really hunters are pretty good. Imp wingclip, deterrence, entrapment, scatter shot, imp conc shot, traps. All very useful things that make them hard targets for many classes, and of course you can Cheetah a way when you're out of range.

Dwarf Paladin.
---
They are a bit larger than Gnomes, but not quite as tall as Nightelves.
---
it's either mage or holy paladin, a druid holding the flag isn't doing shit if the rest of the team is too incompetent, mage does it all and paladin is defensive enough to enable your idiot teammates to actually do something without just dying yourself 
---
even then, it's still just mage, mage is the best class in vanilla (and most wow expansions) and it isn't really close
---
Hmmm.... True 
---
Damn you
---
Not with shields up. Besides a good mage won't even let the rogue get close enough for even one hit.
---
There are multiple guilds preparing for FIRST week clear as we speak. It is quite possible. I‚Äôd say 80%-90% chance that at least one of these guild is successful with a first reset MC clear.
---
Very good post ! Have to disagree when you say WoW was the last worthy MMORPG though, GW2 and FF14 were/are (arguably) very worthy, even if they didn't top WoW in its prime.
---
For your group character maybe consider druid? Stealth, ability to tank, ability to heal, very versatile, great in wsg and open world PVP and 5 man dungeons.
---
You use up for counterspell? What button moves you forward?
---
I ran in a hardcore raiding guild back in vanilla, and we had 2-3 r14 players. We ran in a premade team with 5-6 good server pvper‚Äôs also ranking up. It was a tough slog! 
---
I got to rank 12 and in the last 3 weeks, I was playing a min of 8-10hrs a day. The guys who made it to rank 14 were playing anything from 14-16 hrs a day. Pretty insane grind. 
---
I had to travel for wrk once I hit rank12 and couldn‚Äôt play...and this put me back about 3 weeks, with the decay. So that‚Äôs when I quit the honor grind and just played for fun after this. 
---
Getting rank 14 will never be easy as all it takes is a handful others on the server going for it, and you are all competing for the top spots.
---
Scroll up for counterspell
---
Never too late to edit.
---
No it's not. The spec peaks during BWL. If anything, it declines after AQ40 because there isn't much more new gear for it. Most of the spec's BiS is from T1 and T2. The AQ40 set is nearly identical except for the head which has more spell power, but if you really want to optimize, you'll wear 5-piece T2 (head, chest, belt, legs, boots). T2.5 chest is just about as good as the ZG chest, legs and boots are basically identical to T2, shoulders are way worse than Deep Earth. There's no new weapon or shield in AQ40.
---
One of the strengths of elemental shaman is the fact that you can get very high spell crit in early vanilla when other casters don't really have it yet, and the fact that T1 and T2 has some really powerful items for elemental. Look at these comparisons:
---
[T2.5 head](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21372) vs [T2 head](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16947) (mind the 5-piece bonus)
---
[T2.5 boots](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21373) vs [T2 boots]
---
[T2.5 legs](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21375) vs [T2 legs](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16946)
---
[T2.5 shoulders](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21376) vs [MC shoulders](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18829)
---
[T2.5 chest](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21374) vs [ZG chest](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19828)
---
As you can see, there are equal or better items before AQ40. In fact, there are early PvE shaman items that rival the epic PvP set. This is why the class is strong. I don't know where you obtained the impression that elemental shaman is a dud until late vanilla, but it's literally the opposite.
---

Don't know what's wrong with Ketoguido. But Lazybones, how is that not a good nickname in The Horde? You don't feel it's authentic that someone in the Horde would actually be called that?
---
I've played on RP realms since Steamwheedle Cartel opened in january 2006 and "serious" nicknames have always been ok.
---
Morphedmilk Xxartemis would have been forced to change within  a day or two though :p
---
We were supposed to have flying cars in 2019 but instead we have almost cartoon world of warcraft gnome porn.
---
Lol, that was my ass going to desolace after a few quests in stv :P
---
At best, gold can get you BoE's + the best enchants on your gear, which will get you ready to raid, but you still have to play the game to get the best gear in the game. P2W is not an issue in classic.
---
Personally, I'm not against people who buy gold. I actually like how the token system works on retail. People are going to do it anyway - might as well make it legal and make money off of it. (Side note: I feel the same way about drugs in real life.) But I don't think that system should be in classic because it wasn't around back in 2006.
---
That was all I did aswell. The addon told you if you were aiming right and you could climp verticaly on walls. IF pillarz. On top of the bank etc.
---
Reminds me of my video 10 years ago ( it was fixed in 2.3 ) 
---
https://youtu.be/WoekT9I8GD4
---
Those are all fair arguments. You might find it interesting that you are the first one to say it like that. Otherwise this discussion would not aggravate me as much.
---
You are also correct that, although I loved vanilla and will also enjoy classic immensely without changes, I don't care much about the "preservation" I just want WoW classic to be the best game it can be.
---
Obviously fixing balance (or introducing any changes) is never easy. But something being hard is not a valid argument against it (imo). If we wouldn't do things that are hard, ... Then where would we be today? And all changes should obviously be made with a vanilla mindset (without neglecting what we have learned).
---
If the class balance was bad or not is probably a matter of opinion at this point. Imo, being pigeon holed into certain roles in late game is bad balancing (for multi role classes). I don't like that if I wanted to play shaman, I'd have to heal in raids. What would be so bad about enhancement or elemental being viable or even competitive? The same obviously goes for all classes that could spec into more than one role. I have not played any of the newer expansions, so I don't really know how class balance is nowadays, I've just heard that all classes are very similar now. And I don't want that either (obviously).
---
Yeah, I remember just spamming MF and occasionally MB (MB did too much threat so I had to be careful.) and didn't bother with SW:P cause I was told not to.
---
ah yes, the sweet server first achievements in classic...oh wait
---
Is this what you mean https://web.archive.org/web/20060101204120/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/flash-rewards/ ?
---
Hunter or mage? I am liking the thought of hunter for the solo content side. And I feel I can try different things with a hunter aka soloing different dungeons for fun :) But can't go wrong with a mage just for doing all the content in general and AoE farming potential
---
Nice story, I remember my first wolf mount on my orc shaman too, great memories :)
---
I remember cycling in badlands with it, not so much interested in quests anymore but more in the ride itself :D
---
I agree with a lot of what you say - but isn‚Äôt regular updates part of the ‚Äútrue‚Äù vanilla feel? Classic wow had 12 major patches during its 2ish years. That means that there was a patch every 2-3 months with major changes that people seemed to enjoy. If the changes made involve the same game philosophy that blizzard had in 2005-2007, then I don‚Äôt think having updates makes the game ‚Äúfake‚Äù vanilla.
---
Hey it doesn't count you were not ganked :D
---
- Undead
---
- Mage

- PvP server

- Skinning+Mining / Tailering+Engenering

- Frost AOE leveling build ( rush to 60, time off work)
---
- semi-Hardcore raiding guild
---
i just had a lengthy conversation about why wow classic is awesome and why my fiance will not see me away form my pc for a few months. glad she understands what a nerd I am and I have prepared her early
---
For the most part, the classes that have a hard time levelling still have spots they can fill at the end. Ultimately I‚Äôd say the worst would be levelling as balance Druid because then your options are still limited in the late game. (Though I levelled as balance myself back in the day because I wanted to be a mage but hated playing as a an actual mage lol). 
---
Otherwise, I‚Äôd say NElf warrior or gnome warrior for difficult levelling experience.
---
Yeah I levelled a mage to 60 in vanilla, decided that was a mistake and levelled a Druid instead and never looked back. Mages are super boring
---
Fair enough! I like it fine, I just can't say it beats out shit like ZF, BRD, Scholo, Strat, etc for me.
---
You better play Gnome now.
---
Im already time traveling to classic release with Captain Morgan private stock and White Walker Kush With a $200 Steam Back catalog that i need to catch up on lol.
---
I can't wait for the first big WPVP battle! It'll be so damn fun.
---
Actually Arcane is pretty good early on as a mage when you don't have alot of spellpower and crit. Arcane Missiles can procc Clearcasting from each of the missiles, thus having a high uptime and conserving lots of mana.
---
Unsure
---
None until 60, then BS for Dark Iron Recipes and maybe engineering for pvp
---
Arms, unless sit critting works in Classic which I heard it does not (prot at 60 and eventually fury)
---
Casual guild where I can help new players
---
Here are my other plans:
---
I plan on taking at least one week off work (probably two). As long as the release date is between 11 July and mid-late august I should be fine. If not, I have to drop all my plans.
---
I have another friend who will be taking at least a week off as well. I will be driving to visit him and we are going to duo-level warrior priest. We are going to aim for \~20 hours a day and we will also be meal prepping. One of the great things about duo leveling is you can /f while the other person uses the bathroom or gets food.
---
At 60, I want to be the first to be able to make Dark Iron gear for Rag and also be in the first MC raid. 
---
Since I will be taking classes and working full time fall semester, all my tryharding will pretty much amount to nothing after I head back from vacation. Hence why I want to join a casual guild and become a casual after pushing myself for a few weeks.
---
the lip syncs of these meme's are too fast.
---
Troll warrior, leveling as arm but willing to tank any dj on my journey to lvl 60.
---
For the professions, mining and the second one is likely to be (des)enchant.
---
For the server I am still hesitating between pvp and pve, I dont really like pvp but want a lively server!
---
Already planning an alt for herb + alchemy, certainly a hunter because I love the class but not sure when I will have time to level one!
---
not everyone will get that lol
---
You can solve that mobility problem if you're willing to farm Free Action Pots or have the gold to pay a supplier. Not perfect, but its something.
---
Or better, have mushrooms.
---
The mission briefings in WC2 have a bit more story. But it's generally the same as in WC1. You can find the manuals online. Just read The Last Guardian. It fills all the gaps that WC1 left behind.
---
I played WC3 before WC1 and WC2 and enjoyed both of them. Those games were not about story telling the way WC3 was. The story is about the war, not about characters or the world.
---
hahahahahaha
---
ITT: peopleshitting on a group finder tool that was actually in vanilla. Good god you people are awful. #nochanges right?
---
Then don't announce that you are doing it soo far back and it would be fine. Be working on it and then say hey btw, we've been working on this when you are near release . :)  Truth be told my rational is gone, too much hype overload lol
---
It was mildly interesting to see how much lore and story Blizzard has changed/retconned since the release of WC3. Apparently I have a digital copy of the game manuals that came with my purchase and I didn't realize it. I'll have to check them out.
---
Herb + mining is not easy as you will have to constantly switch between the two radars, dont you think?
---
Then you‚Äôre going to be farming gold for the epic mount
---
Still farming gold
---
Can't believe you threw them away
---
It‚Äôs a 15-25 zone, so it‚Äôs contested, not ally territory. So, you can go as a low level horde and find some fun fights, when your kits are still pretty small and limited. As a 22 rogue, I have distract, crippling poison, and distract to help me out. 
---
Meanwhile, if I was alli, I could go to stonetalon, but I hate that place.
---
Altho I was pretty young when I started playing wow I used to play alot of COD before wow so I never played with the arrow keys.
---
Everything has a niche in some aspect of the game. That's why Vanilla is great. You can tailor your build based on what you want to do.
---
The only builds that are truly weak are Enhancement Shaman (it's just flat out bad compared to Elemental) and Protection Paladin (its glaring weaknesses overshadow its admittedly useful strength). Balance Druid is up there, but IMO the 3% crit aura saves it from obscurity.
---
Hi, /u/Strike1delta
---
If you want to get serious about it you can read up on the Aggregated Demand, Aggregated Supply (AD-AS model), so you can understand when the price shifts will occur
---
PSA: some people have fun pushing themselves when they play games, not everyone is looking to take 20 months to 60 to enjoy the journey. Who knew people can play the game how they want
---
this is the best thing I have seen today!
---
My goal is to just decide which class I'm going to play. I've narrowed it down to the healers, but beyond that I have no idea.
---
The R10 or R14 gear ? There's a big difference !
---
Sounds like leveling slave not partner
---
WoW, Linkin Park, 240p and 2006 are a classic combo
---
Or Mor'Ladim. That guy's got it all figured out.
---
Why not main the Mage and have a Hunter alt? Hunters make great alts for their solo capabilities. Mages not so much imho.
---
Greetings! NA West Coast PvP player here. Willing to play either Horde or Alliance, for the right guild. I have leveled both Ally / Horde toons to 60 on ND.  Looking to mainly focus on pvp and raid on the side.
---
 Here's what I'm looking to do:
---
\*World PvP - ( Devilsaur, World Bosses , 2/3 man gank squads ) - Would LOVE to get a Mafia going
---
\*Premade BG's - I've done the AV grind. Would like to learn/do more of WSG / AB
---
\*Guild Dungeon Runs - ( BiS, Alt , Gold runs ) - LOVE participating and starting these
---
\*Raid in a Medium / Relaxed atmosphere - 1 / 2 nights a week 
---
\*Have a DKP loot sytem - ( LC isn't necessarily a deal breaker )
---
\*Plans to play on a NA server - ( I can adjust to Timezone )
---
\*Has a Discord community to join and be a part of
---
Then, I think I would be a valuable asset and a solid addition to your guild come launch!
---
Feel free to DM me or we can swap discords and chat.
---
See you in Azeroth!!
---
&gt;Rhok'Delar
---
May I introduce you to our lord and saviour Ashjre'Thul?
---
Wallclimbing!! &lt;3
---
Warrior tank
---
Paladin healer mostly for blessings
---
Mage for sheep, water, &amp; counterspell
---
Hunter for freezing trap
---
Warlock for Blood Pact &amp; healthstones
---
15 bucks a month to support you... nah. I don't think even a broke person would do that vs just playing their character.
---
Actually I'd suggest the druid for the solo character. As they're very self reliant and great at world PVP.
---
Triggered
---
I agree that there is a good chance classic will overtake retail. But there is zero reason why it should die. They are two different games appealing to different people, they can coexist easily.
---
Yes it experienced another surge of popularity since Blizzard has started patching it again in 2018. Definetely worth checking out, especially now that Reforged is on the horizon.
---
My leveling queue has gotten long:
---
Warlock or Mage first or second - Lock for leveling speed, mage for overall utility. Both have a ton of utility, leveling speed, and can farm well so I'll use both to prep mats for other characters and professions.
---
Druid - My fun character for leveling, adventuring, and PvP. I will go full feral or maybe 0/30/21 for lulz. I can't wait!
---
Warrior - funneled all the good gear from the other characters, I want to tank at 60. I do not want to raid, but really enjoy the warrior feel.
---
Hunter - I've been wanting to feel the godliness that is survival Hunter in PvP again. This is a distant goal.
---
Yes, I am a serial leveler and alto-o-holic
---
It doesn't *have* to die, necessarily. But obviously classic simply existing could have an effect on retail populations. Wether that kills retail outright, or just slows it down somehow will have to be seen.
---
They had a lot of kickback at the time and needed the hype.
---
Which is why I was thinking hunter. Because of the soloing. But I will into have time to play one character for a while
---
The problem is that it's the modern retconned version of the lore. Not the one that was current during Vanilla WoW's lifespan. I'd rather go to the old sources.
---
So you're one of those huntards that roll need on all the deers ? /jk

---
Warrior, rogue mage (in this order) will compose a bit less than 50% of a PVP server pop (I did my own census on pservers).
---
Yikes
---
haha nice 1. I roll need on the skinning and venison lol
---
How about the ele/resto spec of 30/0/20, and then either Nature's Swiftness or Elemental Mastery, depending on what you want to do (Lightning Bolt -&gt; Elemental Mastery -&gt; Chain Lightning into a shock does disgusting damage), or the option of an instant damage spell or heal from Nature's Swiftness is sweet aswell.
---
It's a long CD. It doesn't help much in a BG where you're constantly fighting and therefore always slowed and kited.
---
Illuminating.
---
haha okay. i can respect that. The most important part of the game is to have fun. :D
---
What youre asking for is a slave for 15$ a month.
---
Make some friends to level with. Although I really wouldn‚Äôt want to be friends with you
---
If you buy gold with real money you'll get banned. However, if you farm thousands of gold it's not impossible to buy raid epics from guilds if they're willing to sell.
---
Obviously, since mobs there are level 47 48.
---
It can be done sure, but it's likely to frustrate groups. Having 30 seconds down time each pull to drink, compared to a Warrior or Feral being able to run straight in adds a lot of time to the run.
---
I like the sound of this! Will be in touch before release :)
---
A lot has changed since vanilla WoW and gaming in general.
---
Remember the horse armor controversy in 2006? Where Bethesda tried to sell a cosmetic item, horse armor? Hell, remember when people would tell you that spending $15/mo on a single game was crazy? 
---
Greed killed gaming. As it does most media. I'm also waiting for r/PantheonMMO to be honest while I get my itch with Classic.
---
Druid for sure, but since the race options limited your stuck as cow if you're on Horde.
---
lol Morhpedmilk didn't even look out of the ordinary at first sight for me xD
---
I'm interested in both PVP and Raiding for classic. Historically hybrid DPS-Healer has been my preference (Druid and Shaman are thematically my favorite) but I'm thinking Priest might be the best of both worlds for me. Great heals for raiding. Shadow melting faces in PVP.
---
In vanilla was one faction considered better for raiding? IIRC people considered Alliance the more PVE-oriented faction when I played. Not that Horde can't raid. Just curious if there will be more raid guilds / opportunities to raid as Alliance.
---
There are guilds already practicing full leveling gear MC runs.
---
Slavery with extra steps.
---
Why would warlock have a hard time on a PvP server ? Though they were doing well on PvP...
---
I want to believe.
---
&gt; most people (myself included) would not actually go buy that same BoE on the AH
---
Okay, so if the item has less value to you than its value on the AH, then why would you not sell it on the AH? Why would you make a conscious decision to lose value?
---
This is even worse - you're saying that an item should be defaulted to you when it has *even less* value to you than everyone else in your party. Yikes.
---
The rest of your group shouldn't suffer just because you're bad with your money.
---
When I seen birdman wiping his hands I immediately thought of the green goblins in booty bay
---
Is this craigslist? Wtf lol
---
No you're wrong stop talking
---
This is often something overlooked. Warlocks are less valuable on Alliance in PvP because Undead are so abundant and WoTF is so powerful. 
---
I imagine Druids are probably a bit more popular on Alliance because you don't have to play as a cow.
---
In general though, on most servers, at 60 the least popular class is going to be Druid overall. Only two races, plus in PvE they're not the prettiest girl at the ball, or at least what people on message boards and Reddit tend to say.
---
Do you have links to these twitter post?
---
i LOL'd hard on the pic "server first c'thun" gj
---
You're missing the great gansta bow shooting animation from the male model imo :o
---
It is somewhat grindy, but it lets you take in the scenery, adventure and the atmosphere. I particularly loved thw Jintha' alor quests in Hinterlands and the pirate cove in Tanaris. So many quests to do. Start up some music or even the game music, relax and quest. I missed this the most and I am looking forward to it.
---
I'll upvote later if true
---
!remindme 2 days
---
His BfA character is a warlock. But that's level 110+ already. His Vanilla character is a Mage (currently at level 22).
---
It's an interesting read to see what has to be adjusted to be true to the classic state, list is longer than I expected somehow.
---
Since when is a mammoth train considered RP?
---
31/20 Arms Warrior. I know it's a PvP beast but people just generally don't take them to raid due to Mortal Strike :(. I wish that damned priority would be changed on it so it wouldn't knock off important debuffs.
---

I used to run a warrior while my gf ran a priest.  We'd head straight for the farm and harass them there, I'd say 85% of the time we were so hard and they wasted so much time that our team won by just out numbering them at the other points.
---
Feel free to downvote me if I'm wrong and raising your hopes in vain.
---
&gt; Don't know what's wrong with Ketoguido.
---
You mean you don't know why it's a bad name for an RP realm?
---
Keto as in the ketogenic diet, and guido as in the slang term for an italian-american?  I don't think any member of the horde is an italian-american who eats a high fat diet and maybe is or maybe isn't healthier as a result.
---
I think you're gonna find plenty of guilds on both sides. For what it's worth, as a caster, I'd personally go Alliance over Horde if I were to min-max, simply because blessings apply to the whole raid whereas totems only affect the group the shaman is in. Especially Warlocks, who have issues with their high threat production, appreciate Paladins. 
---
That being said, I'll be rolling Horde. I used to play Horde back in the day, I prefer them thematically, and at the end of the day, it's just not that big a difference unless you're going to be part of one of those cutting edge Progression guilds. 
---
Priest is super versatile and fun by the way, but so are the other hybrids (except for Paladin I suppose). I'm also eventually going to level a priest because they're amazing healers in PvE and fairly strong in PvP with a plethora of specs (shadow, trispec, deep disc)
---
Alliance Warlocks at least have a harder time because Undead are an abundant race on the Horde and WoTF is so powerful. There is a noticeable disparity between the amount of Warlocks on the Alliance vs Horde, especially so on a PvP server.
---
Alliance for PvE because of blessing of salvation.
---
Horde for PvP for better PvP oriented racials.
---
Paladin
---
Blacksmithing + Mining
---
Holy 
---
Semi-HC raiding
---
It's only for Alliance. They have to deal with Will of the Forsaken. But in general in wpvp a Warlock isn't bad. In BGs they get piled on by melee alot though.
---
What exactly do you consider "soloing"? Mages can kite elites basically as well as hunters, are extremely self-reliant and sustainable. The only solo content you can't really do efficiently are things like Maraudon runs. 
---
So, if you could outline what type of solo content you're looking to do, it would be much easier to help you find your class :)
---
Forsaken Shadow Priest was my first character. I just might have to go back to that. Thanks for the suggestions.
---
I love The Office cross-overs
---
That's the impression I had. Thanks for confirming it.
---
This is just the Addons. I still have to do the FrameXML and GlueXML.
---
Alright Ty !
---
All I've narrowed down is I want to be in a hardcore raiding guild and I want to be a healer.
---
Troll Priest, Troll Shaman, Dwarf Paladin, Night Elf Druid are the race options I've got laid out. I'm tempted to try Tauren Druid, but I don't think I could get used to being a cow girl. Night Elf Priest if I end up on a PvP server because Shadowmeld + Mind Control is very fun.
---
Nothing will ever be as bad as a potential one night stand putting my own dick away.
---
Nothing can get me down
---
&gt; For the solo pvp char I constantly go back and forth between Rogue and Hunter. Both are great at leveling, at ganking, and pvp in general etc
---
Rogues are actually pretty atrocious levelers, whereas Hunters are likely the best leveling class. As for PvP, I think it really depends on your playstyle and what you enjoy - I much prefer playing Hunter because you're not nearly as reliant on your cooldowns, but on the other hand, your powerspikes are a bit lower than those of a rogue who has everything up - you trade those powerspikes for consistency. Granted, you won't have stealth. Druid might be up your alley - with the upside of having a variety of viable playstyles in PvP.
---
I wish Trolls could be Druids in vanilla. #nochanges I know, but I'm so close to swapping factions just to play Druid on a non-cow based character.
---
Soloing dungeons. As well as elites. Sorry should of been clear! Plus a better rotation than just frostbolt haha
---
You must be fun in groups....
---
No Barrens, nuff said.
---
I will give you gold if true
---
It's not a blue post, but I'll take it.
---
Because it's "competition" to a game that people have grown up with. If someone feels like classic will take something (dev time, playerbase, invalidating their time spent) away from retail it can lead to that sort of attitude. Some of it is people who legitimately like the ways retail has changed and think it's stupid to regress, some of it is just people who never played vanilla who think it's old dudes being nostalgic for "that old janky game" and trolling in response. Maybe its sour grapes from people who can't be teenagers again? Who knows.
---
Someone could probably write an essay on the psychology behind the polarization but these are the few things that immediately stand out to me.
---
If you level in phase 2, then from pserver experience its not exaggerated. It can feel like hell. Before pvp rewards and after bgs, its fine. 
---
I say roll pvp even if you are crazy. A lot of the fun stuff is not possible on pve servers, such as 7hours cancerous world pvp on a world boss.
---
Evidence or links?
---
Oh, well,  I guess that one is quite bad. I've heard Blizz don't care much for RP realms anymore =/ which is quite sad.
---
It could be harmless as well though. Slut is a Swedish word for "End"  ;) So you never know. But if it's offensive in EU on EU servers and in US on US servers, it should be changed.
---
You duo farm it, and it's great and safe
---
It was fixed, so I do not thing we can in 1.12. But you could chat though /e "text" with someone you mindcontrolle d.
---
I got stuck going from Darkshore to Menethil Harbor for over 15 minutes. We got a better PC after that...
---
Holy shit I'm using this. I know a ton of Cowgirl fans that love Game of Thrones. This is going to be solid GOLD!!!
---
I remember runescape. I cant believe I wasted so much time on it. Once I found WoW, I never went back to runescape. It's a completely different beast than RS. Although they have grinding in common, it's a lot more in depth than mindlessly clicking on a fishing spot or ore rock. The world is far more massive and theres much more to do. Definitely give WoW a shot when classic comes out. You might just give up runescape for good.
---
Im going to skill every goddamn profession while leveling... cooking fishing everything to 100% feel the old feeling again... there were very few ppl speedleveling at the old days
---
And here I was looking forward to dog pictures.
---
Please keep the gifs coming, love the mashups!
---
 because it was a million times better than retail currently even in its raw state.
---
Look at the overall numbers of players WoW was played till now, many left during some expansions as the game (to me at least) got worse and worse starting after wrath. 
---
In my opinion WoW left a hole behind, for everyone who played it and quit it after some years. It always was the primus of all MMOs.
---
For many it‚Äòs time now to come back and fill their hole left behind by an awesome game with a one time opportunity. 
---
I‚Äòm absolutely hyped on the game and i also hope we see many new players who haven‚Äòt stepped a foot into classic yet!
---
Well you've identified the core issue: two small-ish camps of extreme opinions that are very loud.
---
On one hand you've got the pro-Classic extremists who regard modern Retail as dumbed-down trash that stopped being an actual MMO and is instead just an instance-running game with an interactive lobby. They believe Classic is the return of a game that truly deserve the *Massively* part of "MMO".
---
On the other hand you've got people who believe the current way Retail works is a better formula to Classic, which they believe to be unncessarily slow: getting anything done, or getting to anywhere, involved a lot of downtime that they see as pointless. They regard pro-Classic players as essentially old people whining about how everything was better in the good old days and the youth of today are soft and spoiled.
---
Most people in the middle prefer one or the other and don't really care about the one they're not fond of.
---
People enjoying themselves, playing the game how they want? Preposterous...
---
The changes in expansions is what eroded WoW's community though. Modern WoW has a trash community, doesn't do nearly enough to incentivize it. But that's a different story for vanilla.
---
They have perception instead, which is a 20s buff that lets you see stealthed Units from far away.
---
If a shadow pulled aggro on a boss, your tanks were rly bad üßê, shadow mana isn‚Äòt even enough to go all out a full bossfight
---
I feel like I've been on a journey. Good job.
---
WOW is a poor MMO period. No friendly fire. No significant punishment for death. Limited group requirements. Instanced dungeons, raids and battlegrounds.
---
It's called the care bear MMO for a reason and I'm not arguing that it's not fun but above all else WOW was the single player MMO from the beginning when that wasn't really done before.
---
There would be quests you couldn't do alone but you can reach level 60 playing on your own and that combined with the minor punishment on death as well as the accessibility propelled it to popularity that older MMO games couldn't reach. Overall, it's a game that was built on players doing the developer created rides rather than games like EVE that are built on sandbox systems of territory control, war economy and shifting played created alliances.
---
It's really not hard to see how WOW got from A to B because it was already half way to B to begin with. People whine about LFD but instanced battlegrounds are just as absurd and they're  content that you queued for.
---
Well I'll have to steer clear of that book then, at least till I get BiS for all my horde classes haha!
---
The /sit macro thing is just a private server issue. It never existed and it won't exist when classic comes out, just like facestabbing.

Interview with Joana himself.
---
Listen at 43 minutes. he talks about how he did it in one run with no virtually rested xp
---
I'm in the same boat as you, except I care about the racials, at least in theory. As a PvP player, Orc would be the obvious choice, stun resist is pretty rad. But after playing both for a bit, I just vastly prefer the aesthetics of female Trolls over female Orcs. They're standing upright which is a big deal to me for some reason, and I think their shooting animation looks smoother.
---
Same here, went from most of AQ40 on farm back to MC with a new guild, and managed to get into Naxx, but never got past 4H, just too much time to gear that many tanks.
---
Leveling on PvE is faster, sure. I saw some wild statistic claiming it's like 1/4 faster. Even so, you're gimping yourself on the fun and unpredictable PvP interaction for the ENTIRITY of the game. If you're 100% PvE person, then it's for you I guess but if anybody has a speck of PvP interest in him, just go on PvP server.
---
Thanks my dude, I'll ship them out regularly until release ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
upvoting out of sheer gullible desperation
---
WoW is one of the most popular games of all time. Millions of people have played it. When you have millions of opinions, you'll get more polarizing opinions due to sheer probability.
---
It's also in a unique situation where the game will have two distinct "versions," and it's not really possible for a player to participate in both due to the large time requirement for each version of the game. So, I can see players having concerns that developer resources could be pulled away from their preferred version of the game, which would result in them attacking the opposing version. 
---
You see this a lot in all kinds of situations where people suddenly care about things that they wouldn't normally if they feel like they're going to be personally affected in some way.
---
That's wat I expect to do, because goblins unavailable xD
---
Those are the same people who are ret paladins.
---
If that‚Äòs true you are the real mvp
---
Loving it
---
I do like the idea of a druid but I know I won't be as satisfied with cat vs rogue abilities. No vanish!
---
After leveling my shaman and mage to 60 I thought rogues were fast haha.
---
Shadowfang, Angler's Hat and Double Arena Master. You might as well have gone for rank 14, it would have been easier.
---
Honestly i think there should be made a specifik set of rules(or more) depending on what way you wanna go speel leveling. Fx:
---
Consecutive run rules(Minimal rested XP) - best on new servers etc.
---
All the run must be streamed and played on consecutive days.
---
The player MUST sleep or take breakes for 8/24 hours a day, durring this time the play should not be logged into their character. (this is also a consideration for the health of the player)
---
The player MUST use /played whenever they log into the character AND before logging out, to ensure that the char have not been logged in durring the break times.
---
This is just a quick mockup of a set of rules that could be used.
---
Maybe some pro pallies are still here? Since there was no discussion about professions I was think abou the ultimate combo of Alchemy/Engineering, but obviously it would only be possible as a combo in super late game with an alt. What would you suggest to be a better paladin profession to level first? (During the levelling phase, dungeons, early raids, some pvp along the way). Spec would mostly be holy/ret.
---
zug zug
---
it's just that i think the only thing the big game studios are going to learn from it is "omg thats a brand, we need to re-release that game also, look how much money we are making" and instead of getting new games that follow good concepts we get the same thing over and over. somehow like the movie industry. instead of creating new cool things we get the same over and over. well it's like that allready, like battlefield/cod beeing the fast &amp; the furious franchise.
---
If you're going to raid hardcore, go human. If not, night elf

Can't talk about FF14 as I've never played it but I have one huge problem with GW2. Or maybe two. First, when I start GW2, I don't have a single idea what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I wanna or should do. Second I really miss the holy trinity. GW1 (I'm a GW1 veteran, played it for many years) at least always had dedicated healers and somehow tanks with builds like sf sin. In GW2 everyone can do everything. The moments where you love your healer for saving your life or where the healer wants to kiss his tank for saving his ass from huge hits are the ones that glue a team together. They might be there on some occasions in GW2 but for the most part they are lacking.

Was a NElf Hunter in Vanilla and used to enjoy sneaking onto the Org to STV Zeppelin and shadowmelding down below. Once we zoned into STV, still a fair distance from Grom'Gol, I'd run upstairs and kill everyone aboard, who were usually 30s-40s in level.
---
Also once spent a while inside Orgrimmar using Feign Death &gt; Invis Pot &gt; run and shadowmeld somewhere, as a means of escaping whenever I got cornered.
---
A Rogue friend of mine once got together a bunch of other Rogues and spammed distract at people trying to run into Blackrock Mountain to the instances. It didn't break stealth and with a 5-man group they effectively stopped people moving in any single direction with any consistency.
---
These are the best. Office mashups, fuckin' fantastic.
---
Watch out for STV!
---
Maybe before attack speed normalization, but not after.
---
So, You are basically asking why people on Classic WoW forums speak unflatteringly of the other version of the game? Why don't You go to OSRS / FF / ESO forum and ask what they think about WoW or any other MMO?
---

---
Based on one of the surveys I saw linked recently 52% of responders were going alliance. I wouldn't worry too much, just pick your favourite faction.
---
AQ gear doesn't seem good for hunters.
---
In the elite groups, they will feed everything to the tanks first.
---
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
---
It‚Äôs what you make of it. I see/hear a lot of people stating most will quit at lvl30. I stopped leveling at around 35 when I discovered the delights of being a rouge in STV.... Spent a week or more there just fighting players.
---
I can taste the salt!
---
Yeah, it's not official confirmation but its pretty nice to see
---
If you are not on pvp server you are missing the entire point of factions. Having pvp on transform a lame quest into an exciting world combat event. Mmorpg quests suck..., but not if there are other people doing them with you and against you. That is precious and I cannot accept trading that away for any reason.

Its not even been released and still we are getting good memes again!
---
But it's not really competition, I mean the games are so different at this point they basically share a name and loot rarity colour tiers.
---
Maybe people see it as competition but that's weird, eq tlps aren't seen as competition from live, in fact the whole sub sharing system of tlps and live sees more players in both really.
---
Oh no way! I was only 2/8 (Helm &amp; Legs) in Vanilla as we had Rag and Onyxia but had only really just started BWL by the time TBC came out.
---
Top quality meme.
---
I guess I'm confused as to why people feel attacked by the game given that eq and runescape enjoy healthy communities in two distinct versions. It's not like blizzard is breaking new ground here, it's demonstrably successful to a run both a modern faster paced mmo and a slower older style mmo in the same world concurrently.

Seems to me they do not have plans to keep a base to at least have everything ready to go to TBC. Might also be that they want to limit surface for people to poke and they still keep it for dev builds.
---
Thanks for the amazing work /u/perringaiden
---
I plan on running MC and Ony the instant I hit 60 (Since those raids get cleared by randoms in greens on Private servers) but I'll be grinding prebis in the downtime between raids or if I don't find a guild immediately
---
That was so good man. I had no idea all of these events occurred before the expansions. It leaves me a little disjointed with the progression of retail wow expansions as when they were coming out, I thought they were events happening then, not events that had previously happened that we just have progressive access to.
---
Like how the Lich King is already established and creates our beloved Sylvanas (who is clearly in vanilla), and before that the dark portal seems to have been opened? But the BC expansion clearly shows the portal opening then after we have met all these other prominent characters.
---
Am I just reading it wrong and totally confused? Either way, it was a great read!
---
Why has The Office memes completely taken over this sub?
---
See I have been wondering about this. Do you have a source for this? I was under the impression that new quest hubs would be added in their appropriate phase.
---
But September is basically Christmas!

Haha people are sleeping in my house and I just burst into laughter around the time it got to golden retrievers in goldshire.

---
From my experience in vanilla a really good druid beats them until people reach AQ40/Naxx gear. At that point the classes that scale well with gear (mostly the 3 in the title) start doing so much damage that the druid can no longer reliably create enough windows where he can safely damage them.
---
E.g. against warrior the druid needs bear form to survive long enough between CC windows (bash, roots, feral charge) and whittle the warrior down. I still distinctly remember fighting a warrior who had Might of Menethil (2H mace from Kel'Thuzad) and he did so much damage to my bear that it almost felt like I wasn't in bear form at all. I quickly ran out of mana from constantly having to shift and heal so I rooted him and buggered off.
---
Any links to this?

---
All these people wanting to skip STV... i cant wait
---
Naxx gear was the point where the damage got too high to rely on bear form anymore. A warrior with Might of Menethil did so much damage to my bear that it felt like fighting a BWL geared warrior, but without bear form.

Hard charge with this toon to get to raiding. Start an alt somewhere around level 30 to 40
---
The "downvoted" and Michael laugh face got me so bad! Close to the definition of ROFL right now :D
---
Per faction: Warrior, mage, shaman/paladin top3.
---
Both factions Warrior, mage, rogue probably.
---
It's nothing to do with the meteorological seasons. It's 23rd September at the latest.
---
It says that cause you should be healing on a priest not dpsing
---
Shamans and paladins are second most popular classes for their own faction interestingly.
---
Ferals have the advantage up until AQ40 gear (assuming they get the opener on the rogue, which is likely if they have the PvP gloves). With Naxx gear however, the top 3 just do too much damage. Arms warrior with Might of Menethil can just stupidly tunnel the bear; the feral will run out of mana before they can whittle the warrior down.

I too have noticed this and I find it all rather odd. There are people who have never played WoW that are throwing their 2 bits in. Frequently quite passionately.
---
I hit lvl60 in like 9 days /played on my Warrior in Felwood without having really even touched Winterspring,  WPL or EPL yet.  
---
I did do all the dungeons (including BRD) multiple times while I was leveling, though.
---
Didn't feel that grindy to me as I enjoyed every moment of it.

Yes but still: minimum 3.5 days of pex, 24 hours non stop of instance farming, reputation farm for RF stuff... I‚Äôm not sure it can be cleaned in less than 1 week...

But if it is, it will be very impressive
---
Number one reason for RPpvp servers is so people will stop bitching about it.

Would you prefer a market consistingly only of hardcore MMORPGs? I agree that it's bad as it is now, but vanilla struck a good balance in terms of difficulty for most people.

&gt; Comment in code: "-- Mental division was a skill in Classic WoW"
---
In Retail, the Auction house shows you price per individual item when you mouse-over a stack of items. They could easily have left that in, it is a completely minor and insignificant change. But they didn't. They checked it against the 1.12 client and threw it out with a snarky comment.

The amount of no changes this oozes pleases me immensely.

Yeah, ofc I am "tocix". There is one reddit left for that sort of questions, and it is overrun by people spamming memes. Nothing wrong with memes if you have nothing better to do, but if someone has a somewhat (!) meaningful question, I would really appreciate if people could stop trolling.

It is op bcuz the 5pc bonus give a chance to return mana. On priv servers all 3 targets healed could proc the mana return so you would get 0-3 procs every heal cast. Dont need mp5 on offteir slots can go full +healing. Always viable, best heals per mana in the game.
---
Don't apologize to captain asshole for sharing your cool memory. What do we say to these people? We say, "Go back to Icy Veins"
---
They say "Summer" but then dont even give a release date at the start of summer? assuming we hear nothing till the end of may, what a joke that would be.
---
It's whack. In general the mmo community has more intense opinions about games than most others I've observed. I suspect it's probably related to addiction pattern behaviours/addictive things drawing in people that are a little maladjusted.
---
Even so, this is all a little extreme.
---
It‚Äôs not surprising, some people will feel that the one invalidates the other. They certainly shouldn‚Äôt, but they will. A decades worth of time investment into one or the other simply means they will be defensive and biased towards each other.

---
Your argument is totally true for large parts of western demographics.
---
However, from a global business point of view, the demographic targeted by Classic is losing weight rapidly. 
---
Microtransactions, especially on mobile platforms (Smartphones), are the way to earn money in the 21th century, at least from a min-max-perspective. Reason is not only a change in western demographics itself, but moreso the developement of Chinese and Indian markets. People there all have Smartphones but! don¬¥t have time to play desctop-games (kike MMORPGs) cause they work for 10 hours and commuting especially in China is around 4 (!) hours on average. You can play Mobile Games while commuting. You can not play WoW while commuting. The same developement can be seen in India.
---
Simple as that.
---
Or maybe he's planning to roll rogue.
---
This is only true for PvP servers. If there was census data available on realm selection, it would make things worse probably as everyone would pick realms that already had an advantage for their faction.
---
I'm just hoping Blizzard has a solution to faction imbalance. Combining realm populations together, free transfers, etc.
---
If they were to do TBC, I'd guess it's easier to start from scratch from their 2.0.0 (Or possibly later in TBC) client they have available. Seems easier to strip that down, than to add all the new functionality all over.
---
Someone make the ‚Äúaw shit, here we go again‚Äù version of this.
---

---
well in a raid setting mages sim for more dps (until aq/naxx, then warlocks pull ahead). 
---
But when debuff slots are not an issue  like in open world, questing, pvp etc, Warlocks just put out a lot more, consistent damage. Mages rely on shatter combo to put enough pressure out, but warlock can just dot up  multiple targets, send pet after them and fish for nightfall procs.
---
It's more of a "feel", but warlocks have sort of a deathzone where they can kill anything aslong as it stays in range. Mages are more spikey and thier pressure is not as consistent.
---
Iirc troll rogue is the least played of anything. Found this so odd, I mained one myself and always loved it. Looks sweet in bloodfang
---
Im on a fence of Druid or Holy Paladin. I will be raiding or atleast try to. One thing I am sure of is that I will be pvp'ing alot. Mostly premades and random que's. I wonder if I could fill my role as a raid healer well enough with the Flag Carrier resto druid specc? Would Holy pala still be a better choice? The druids evasive playstyle really turns me on. I feel like I would get bored with paladin.
---
Nobody wants to carry you.
---
So I absolutely love Troll Male Rogues.  I'm torn whether I should roll one.. I love their stealth and melee animations and their lean and slouching figure just make them the perfect race for Rogues IMO. Plus I think they just look badass in T1/T2 (especially with red hair). It's just that I do care about the racials and Orc/UD are just a way better option, mostly because I want to do good in PvP. However picking Engineering might make up for the lack of good racials? Opinions?
---

---

---
Looks like I will start watching this show...
---
They will be in the game from the start
---
Fun detected!!
---
aslong as you pick only gnomes you are set as a evil group, everybody hates gnomes!
---
Yeah, classic "world firsts" will be less of an actual world first and more akin to speedrunning aka. "Awesome games done quick".
---
Can you even reach rag week 1? Isn't he behind a rep grind with Hydraxian waterlords?
---
This, I remember those days, even into WotLK.
---
I can't think of a scenario where a rogue outlevels a mage, and the mage doesn't necessarily have to be AoE grinding - they're just the faster levelers.
---
Shamans aren't that quick either, but their leveling playstyle is also pretty complicated to get the hang of if you really want to push efficiency. 
---
But yeah, leveling is just one part of the whole experience - you still have to enjoy yourself at 60. Do you plan on focussing on BGs or wPvP? I think that's what your choice really boils down to - as a solo player, Hunters are vastly superior to Rogues in BGs. They are both good in wPvP, but I can see how stealth is very appealing to have.
---
Best one yet! Keep them coming.
---
Yes.
---
that reminds me.. What's the situation with diminishing returns on chain-fearing at launch?
---
I don‚Äôt see why personally. Variety is a beautiful thing.
---
Somebody is rolling a troll.
---
In a fair fight, sure probably. That is thankfully not what Vanilla is about though.
---
Nice to see content that isn't just some bell-end asking if rogues can stealth etc.
---
If you're really looking to solo the higher level dungeons, Hunter is your choice. They're much better in that regard. Both are perfectly capable of kiting elites, as displayed by every hunter ever getting Rhok'Delar, and [Stupid Mage Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frS6BjaiD8)
---
But yeah, the hunter rotation, albeit just two spells and your AA, is much more engaging than spamming frostbolt
---
For me, Vanilla wow was awesome. It was a great game with so much to do, even once you had the 40 man raids on Farm status. I was in a pretty hard core raiding guild and we cleared MC/BWL?AQ40....but AQ40 was still not on "Farm" status, and we were barely into Naxx when tBC was announced.  Two years wasnt long enough in my opinion.  You'd be lucky if 1% of folk playing wow vanilla had actually made it to Kel Thuzad, let alone killed him.  Even less players were clearing Naxx weekly. It takes a long time for 40 raiders to get enough gear from raids to progress. Even clearing MC or BWL takes most hardcore raiding guilds time to do, to sufficiently gear up each raider (assuming approx 50 players to cover call offs and non-raid-signups.) 
---
So for me, there is so much stuff to do, and get into.  Gear progression was hard, and felt worthwhile, getting an epic mount was truly "epic".   Getting full T1 was a great feeling, T2 even more so.....(damn those legs from Rags). 
---
I'm really looking forward to 60 being the cap, for as long as possible, even 5yrs down the line.  
---
If folk drop off and stop playing, WOW will merge servers easily enough. But the fact there is no sudden level increase making years of work obsolete, works for me, and is the main reason I'm excited for classic release.
---
If that is true, and there's no reason to disbelieve you, it's truly tragic.
---
Hah there‚Äôs a throw back. Was it ever revealed who they were etc?
---
Forgive my ignorance, but i‚Äôve always wondered, and have never been a WC lore buff. 
---
Why is the dark portal on the vanilla box/login screen, when the Dark Portal wasn‚Äôt immediately relevant to the game until TBC? Aside from it looking totally badass, why was this a thing? It seems like it‚Äôs from the perspective of Outland looking thru to Azeroth. 
---
I do understand some things like Sneed‚Äôs shredder, Teebo‚Äôs sword, the STV dragon (which was never a thing in the end) were on the boxes because they‚Äôre cool as fuck but couldn‚Äôt never figure out the reasoning with the dark portal as the burning legion weren‚Äôt totally relevant in vanilla.
---
O dang, i forgot you can use holy shock as a taunt with righteous fury practically. Whats the cool down on it again?
---
It looks badass and it‚Äôs a good symbol for ‚Äúentering the world‚Äù, that‚Äôs about it really.
---
I‚Äòll go for tailoring too and try how that works. Will cost some gold though i guess.
---
I have a story you might like. I played to 21 on a pserver as a warr. I never played vanilla before and was questing in redridge when I got a random message asking if I want to tank DM. I felt flattered and accepted, it took us an hr and a half to finish the dungeon and I made a lot of mistakes as I've never tanked in vanilla but we had fun and talked for almost an hour afterwards about classic wow.
---
Wut
---
Fastest ways are through friends with professions and everyone gives you greens to DE. Solo the fastest way would be to buy one or level an alt to level 5, learn tailoring and leatherworking then make your main character and get enchanting/skinning. Lesser wand isn't too hard to get but if you want to get a greater wand you'll need your main to send a ton of your leather/cloth to your alt for DE matts
---
I'm extra hyped now
---
Warlock's an okay choice against a rogue, but it's still a very tough fight. As a lock you're going to be the reactive party, playing the defender's part if you will. Sac is a great defense layer but if you do it too early, say during cheap shot, the rogue can just vanish -&gt; reset. Death Coil obviously helps a ton. Best choice of spec against rogues in my experience is Soul Link.
---

---
If you're looking to set up something similar or know someone who will, I'm your man
---
Love them videos! Same as Hunter vs World ones are great too. Yeah I agree it's a lot more engaging. Making sure you are not clipping your AA for your spells extra as a hunter. Keeping your pet alive also. Just adds a bit more to the game. Rather than vending machine and spamming frostbolts haha
---
Ahh, even the smell of those makes me nostalgic
---
Post some Evidence to your claims maybe?
---
I dont need to take time off work ??
---
thats a great idea actually!
---
These people are the loud minority. He is just a troll. No one is gonna bite your yell in your ears when you play classic. Its gonna be all right.
---
I know. Thought they were added automatically to your mount tab. Nice to see them in bags.
---
Yeah my bad got it mixed up with eastern kingdoms, brain fart.
---
Wrath just made it obvious what we were dealing with. My BiS as an Affliction Lock was marginally better, and PvP (specifically arenas) was unrecognizable from the previous iterations.
---
The game had changed. It was about dailies and rep and structured grinds rather than do you want the Winterspring Frost Sabre or farm for the Baron Mount?

There's going to be duels infront of Orgrimmar though and it'll be great, like it used to be!
---
I hope we hear something very soon. I have never waited anything as much as I am waiting for Classic now, and it's killing me.
---
Press X to doubt.
---
If it were me, I would probably just level without a wand and fork over the gold for it when they enter the economy. It'll probably be expensive, but probably less expensive then leveling up to 75 enchanting. Leveling up a crafting skill also eats into the time you could be leveling, so there is that too.

Very funny but the text was a little fast I rarely had a chance to finish reading each line

I watch these with michaels voice in my head, it‚Äôs great
---
There is at least one thread a day where an OP uses bargaining logic to try and craft a world where WoW Classic comes sooner.
---
I'm a filthy socialist and can't wait to grief some nerds in their own zone. Why you gotta be like that
---
There‚Äôs a difference between pushing yourself and going after something that‚Äôs near impossible. 
---
Leveling alone, considering you go as fast as world record speeds, is going to be over 4 days. Which would entail finding 30-40 people who will essentially both no life and almost no sleep up over 100 hours. 
---
Then add in other requirements, gear, actually downing the boss, etc. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference between being ignorant and ‚Äúplaying the game how you want‚Äù
---
If a single guild manages to legitimately down MC the week of classic launch, I‚Äôll rescind my statement. However, I doubt that‚Äôll happen.

EU // Alliance // PvP
---
Semi-Hardcore (Note: NOT Casual. We just wont be doing world bosses mostly)
---
Raid Times: GMT+1 - 18:00-22:00  Friday/Saturday (Start with 1 day at the beginning)
---
Loot System: Loot Council with 1.2.3 point system
---
(Drakefang talisman or maladath is worth more then t2 rogue boots for example, details can be discussed on discord)
---
Also this system is just like normal LC. Only difference is that the point system is there to keep track of the values of the items a player has gotten.
---
Example: 
---
Rogue 1 gets Drakefang and T2boots wich is 3+1=4 points
---
Rogue 2 gets T2bracers and CTS wich is 1+2=3 points
---
So the next item that drops will go to the second rogue automatically if he wants it (If attendance is the same)
---
About us:
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
The main reason for many of us raiding is to get better gear and to be able to gank horde harder and harder. 
---
Requirements:
---
There has been some problems in the past on vanilla servers with "semi" hardcore guilds like this one when it comes to consumables and i just want to point out that semi-hardcore does not mean "casual".
---
You are expected to bring cunsumables (Flask is not needed untill AQ) every single raid.
---
Also id like to point out that odd specs like moonkin/retri paladin/Hemo rogue/Feral tanks and DPS is welcome ONLY if the player can pull it off, some of these specs actually work but require a much more hardcore playstyle
---
compared to the normal cookie cutter mage/rogue
---
Anyways having all that said we aim to be hardcore in raids but we wont be doing world bosses mostly (way to much competition and time consuming)
---
We might make an alliance with some of the other guilds ofcourse when it comes to world bosses but that is a question for later.

&gt; If they were to do TBC, I'd guess it's easier to start from scratch from their 2.0.0
---
They did not do this for WoW:Classic (where they replicated 1.12 in 7.3.5). So the idea is that, if they go TBC, they will use the same approach there.
---
And personally, one of my nightmare at that time ^^ appart when we were busing them to raid to go bwl
---
My hope is such that i will never not believe these rumours.
---
Beta next week? Cant wait.

Playing warlock... you best enjoy your never ending breath and imp fire shield!

Almost exactly the same :) Im just so hyped for the bow quest that ill be willing to pay for the leave if im not able to find a raiding guild.
---
I got bored and went to Tirisfal Glades on retail and crafted a lesser Magic Wand. 
---
Grind 60 Linen Cloth from humanoids.
---
Pick Up Tailoring and Enchanting to craft the Lesser Magic Wand if on a fresh server. Purchase 9 course threads from the vendor to make 9 Brown Linen Robes
---
Level Tailoring skill to 30 by crafting bolts of linen cloth and learn Brown Linen Robe 
---
Craft 9 Brown linen Robes
---
Make sure to craft a Runed Copper Rod before skill level 5 Enchanting if possible. Buy a copper rod. 
---
Disenchant Brown Linen Robes and enchant Bracers with strange dust until Enchanting skill 10 (need 60 more points for Greater Magic Wand)
---
Learn Lesser Magic Wand
---
If one Lesser Magic Essence was obtained during the Brown Linen Robe disenchants to craft the Lesser Magic wand. Buy some wood. 
---
If not then continue to craft Brown linen Robes and disenchant them. (6 linen cloth and 1 course thread each)
---
Fair play.
---
I don't know much about Runescape. But progression servers in EQ are very different from WoW Classic. Those servers all eventually become normal retail servers.
---
I believe only a very small minority of people believe in the extreme viewpoints we're discussing here (Classic WoW will immediately die vs. Modern WoW will immediately die).
---
Possible. Yes.
---
Optimal, likely not.
---
The real question is, would you spend more time overall crafting the wand, then you will save once using it.
---
Next time this happens you need to check your dream phone and give us a date.
---
Read the other post that got linked. And no, they will not put some of those things back in.
---
Worce thing is LFR difficulty.
---
It's very easy as long as you full buff
---
The difference is everyone knows how to use resources in a way they did not in 06...
---
The problem is by time nax rolls around you could in theory still have raiders who need to clear MC, BWL, ZG, AQ, and Nax every week
---
At the very least you're doing AQ/Nax which is easily two raid nights unless you're a very hardcore and efficient guild. 
---
So it ends up about being how often can you clear, how many raids do you clear a week? Did you start clearing on the first lockout it was released?
---
THere is a reason they put in LFR and crap like that this can be a huge time sink with no rewards if players are just left to themselves even with easy content. And Nax by modern MMO standards is easy, assuming your raid makes preparations. The preparations are much more extensive than your average modern MMO tho

Best content on this sub ez

Do you know how one would go about putting their guild in the spreadsheet? Thanks!

Just getting to 60 is my first goal, and thats a considerable effort in itself. After that, my next goal is to get all the attunements done by while I collect gear.
---
This post was more of a kill time and \*what if\* i just want peoples opinions on what would be the worst non vanilla feature..

THE GOAT
---
WoW ruined blizzard
---
Vanilla was made by them at a time when they were pure and everything they made was awesome. 
---
Retail is a product of Activision meant to suck every last dollar out of you
---
Vanilla while no where near perfect was much more about sucking up your time than every last dollar. They just wanted to suck you in. Parts of that are problems, things take forever like mounting takes forever for the arbitrary reason they wanna slow you down. But a lot of it is a benefit too and ads to immersion. 
---
They didn't design the game from square one to retain the most possible subscribers through every day of the year. They from day one made a game that would suck you in and addict you like crack. A subtle but important distinction. 
---
One is designed for a mass market audience one for a niche audience
---
The PvP reward system being the most obvious and raids being exclusive because most players will never see Nax even in classic
---
No we will be proud 26year olds instead
---
Once you've designed templates you can populate them with a CSV file too, so you can make a generic template then fill the card names, stats, values etc from a file. Makes for much easier tweaking
---
This is simply awesome
---
I don't think comming up with features to kill vanilla is a fun way if killing time. Also comming up with stuff that would improve (personally) vanilla is not fun.
---
But I'll play with you.. LFR ruint alot.

In WSG, druid hands down, yeah you aren't laying waste to the enemy team or anything but with consumes/engineering and some skill they are the single biggest contributing factor to a win. Second would be a good healer

I've never enjoyed raiding so I'm just planning to complete every quest, explore every zone, do some dungeons and some casual pvp on my journey to lvl 60 :)
---
I mean, who's to say virtual experiences aren't experiences? I've travelled to a lot of different countries but I can remember BFD and SM runs that felt just as meaningful and fun to me.
---
My goal is to have a fully BIS character, I have gotten close over the years but usually a drop or two just doesn't happen for me before the next expac rolls over. This time though no roll overs so eventually I will get it.
---
Some people think being the best is the funniest though. Makes no sense that being mediocre is fun.
---
I feel like this should be a weekly . . . sticky thread. I'll show myself out.
---
God if they did everybody would play one lol, weapons skill, paladins AND a trinket? anybody serious about playing a melee would play one.
---
What a good boy
---
We have to draw a line somewhere, otherwise the word Classic/Vanilla loses its' meaning.
---
In my mind i can picture an endless vanilla game with new content. But i don't trust the masses. Then comes the problem with Blizzard. Not only the old developers aren't here, but when it comes to the current ones, i can't simply ignore the fact that they were the ones that drove us to want vanilla in a first place. Their vision is different.
---
But even with all that aside, there is still one obstacle and it's name is Activision. Are you ready to put your trust in the masses, and let Actiblizz to implement them right?
---
These office memes are so golden, im lovin it

Thanks for the kind words People of r/classicwow!  After reciving a lot of messages asking if I'm making more Office classic mashups I just wanted to assure you all that I'm currently working on new ones (Plural) . So stay tuned ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Dunno, miss Death Recap tbh.
---
Hide &amp; Seek in Org!
---
In the greater scheme of things the racials only mean so much. If you love the aesthetics of the trolls go troll, all being well you will be looking at that character ALOT! Plus trolls are pretty dope mon.
---
It's because retail fans bashed Classic fans for multiple years for liking the "wrong game". Now they feel betrayed by Blizzard for putting ressources into Classic.
---
It's mostly people who have not grasped the concept of different oppinions. "Retail is new content so it must be better"
---
In addition I think many people (mostly casual players) don't like losing all of their progress and start from scratch. So they continue to bash Classic in hope of a failure and they have not "wasted" endless hours.
---
Check the combat log ;)
---
5man tanking is all about holding multimob threat. Things don't hit hard there with very few exceptions. Surely you want some mitigation but your main job is to keep the mobs in place. Very early on you want to focus on getting enough mitigation, but when you are at the point of choosing a weapon enchant that is as expensive as Crusader or spell damage then you are well beyound mitigation issues for 5mans. Believe me there is no better feeling than consistently glue every mob on you so everyone else can do their thing.
---
Well the Orks came through the portal and it has been really a center piece of the lore.
---
That‚Äôs cos it‚Äôs not Josh‚Äôs opinion that counts.
---
I didn't even know an addon existed for this, I just practised the popular locations so much I eventually got really good at doing it anywhere.
---
Vanilla Combat log is garbage. Unless you like scrolling through 'X gains blink' 'Blind fades from x', 'x gained 1 rage' 15 times in a row, etc. In most PVP/PVE scenarios it will scroll too fast to really get to.
---
Been on this subreddit for god knows how long, but these office memes are by far the best thing ive seen since I joined. Grade freaking A.

There used to be a site called facesofwow i think back in vanilla days it was like myspace/facebook but for WoW

The fact that anyone is doing a mammoth train in 2019 on the live game with subscriptions to live WoW is what is significant

In an environment with a lot of people around you (hell even a BG), it can move fast enough that the specific log you were looking for is pushed off the counter ;)

there's a tab for all combat, and a tab for things that happened to you only. you click that tab to filter all the background text out that you're too busy to read. ;).

Get tailoring, advertise in goldshire or the town you're in for linen and wool cloth and tell them you'll send them a wand once you're enchanter 75, craft green, desenchant, get 75 enchanter, craft wands, send them to the guys who helped you
---
Thanks to [**Kargoz**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxOd0DPfBmSpf70PQe5_MBw), you have a detailed answer [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7--FKSEXkFw).   
---
That being said, I am not sure whether you end up winning time overall compared to getting the wand from the merchant at level 15.
---
&lt;No Quarter&gt; on my server. They got the hated rep they wanted and were eventually camped so often they broke up due to guold drama and red is dead from the entire alliance chasing them down.

Because you need to be on an RP server for that to happen.

There is this fantastic guide for horde by Bookard: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsgmaEltsh\_3wm8BKKXkDM1mSni8kaXWmmdspm-dv7g/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsgmaEltsh_3wm8BKKXkDM1mSni8kaXWmmdspm-dv7g/edit)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsgmaEltsh\_3wm8BKKXkDM1mSni8kaXWmmdspm-dv7g/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsgmaEltsh_3wm8BKKXkDM1mSni8kaXWmmdspm-dv7g/edit)

What exactly is happening here?
---
They're all lined up about to head out of Org to a WPvP fight
---
It's looking at a furry bear butt for me :(
---
Not a pleasant last sight...
---
goodest of boyes defending goldshire from evil kobold
---
&gt; As in replicating 2.0.0 from their 7.3.5 client?
---
No. What will happen is, the would replicate 2.0 from the 1.13 (or 1.14) codebase. Provided they diviied up everything correctly, 1.14 should benefit from improvements in 9.0 without having to actually take 9.0 and use that as a baseline (as they did with 7.3.5).
---
So "a clean start" was neither what they had when they took 7.3.5, nor what they will have when moving from 1.14.
---
One of my most fond memories I had was when I rerolled on a brand new server, entered Barrens, did a /who and saw 4 other people in there.
---
Ok, and a lvl 19 hunter in Ashenvale, 6 levels ahead of the #2...
---
And 1000 people in the starting zones...
---
Just gotta wonder how much stuff they will miss for the real game if all of those changes had to be done manually. The final game will probably littered with hundreds of little things they missed and nobody knows if it was like that in retail vanilla?
---
10/10 meme

DANANANANANANANA DANANANANANANANA
---
THIS IS MY LAST RESORT
---
A good hunter will shit on any melee class, against GOOD (otherwise you'll shit on them) mages is kinda hard, but manageable if you know what you're doing.
---
Hunters have the highest skill ceiling in the game, keep that in mind.
---
Troll has bow weapon skill, health regen and additional damage towards beasts.
---
I believe that plays into his decision.
---
BiS Helmet missing though? or wasnt there this Helmet with 15 Stam + 15 Int from somewhere in Ungoro?
---
The guild &lt;Second Gurubashi Empire&gt; was a troll only guild on the server of Defias Brotherhood (rp-pvp). These trolls where infamous because they where slow walking around STV on their raptor mount, ganking everyone coming across their path. This created such e depth into the roleplay pvp system, when the &lt;Dwarven Rifle Squad&gt; came to aid the alliance in STV. This is why we need rp-pvp servers!!
---
So it begins. Dog memes.
---
The characters people have on the beta won't carry over to the official release, right? I think that's how it was in vanilla.
---
The tabs of Classic WoW videos is what got me. You know after refreshing that page you're going right back to binge watching classic videos.
---
It's retail tho
---
You can right now on pservers and retailer
---
That's how it was with every beta.
---
&gt;  economy must be believable 
---
One of the main reasons why vanilla works and is still an RPG (even though very simplified) is this. The economy in vanilla is incredibly important for every play stile. Regardless of your schedule, the content you do, you need to trade with other people.
---
The main weakness of the economy in WoW is IMO the action house as it is a convenient way to reduce player interaction. Yes, I'am dead serious. I believe if the action house wasn't in the game it would improve in terms of the RPG and the social aspects.
---
Vanilla and WoW in general had alot of other flaws too and the biggest one is tied to the economy thing. Blizzard never managed to design a progression system that is both casual friendly and rewarding for hardcore players but retains the RPG aspect. This is true for both content and rewards.
---
Modern WoW completely abandoned the RPG aspect in favor of fine grained pseudo progression. Vanilla and TBC almost had it, but they started to make mistakes already in TBC. They moved away from the economical aspect, which is heavily tied to tradeing crafted gear and consumables. Instead the consumable aspect got reduced and the gear crafting aspect got egocentric.
---
I could talk about this for a much longer time. The essence however is that Blizzard, and many AAA designers in general, underestimate their players in terms of what economical depth they can handle, which is to the detriment of their game.
---
Ha, yep. Sure did. Editing that...
---
Kill it with fire!
---
make it 60-80% will quit before lvl30

Hey you still in need of members for the guild?

You can live peacefully with little gold. However, you won't buy consumes (wich is very fun to do) and struggle to repair sometimes
---
When did we start talking about pvp??
---
Who is Alfie?
---
This so much. Get a good healer and your offense will eventually (hopefully) catch the enemies flag carrier. Of course if your team prefers to farm hk mid they won‚Äôt get anything done
---
Were you a rogue killing lowbie?
---
Which pet would be best for leveling a hunter? I see that Joana leveled with a cat.

This looks awesome! Did you make this OP?

Theyre coming back dude!

Hooray!

[credit to the original artist](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnluckyDress/comments/bmifh4/leeroy_jenkins/)
---
What comes after phases?1
---
You can buy everything with gold if GDKP is not banned. Combine this with the fact that blizz is incompetent in stopping gold buying in vanilla (to stop it you need to go after gold buyers not sellers). Result is a total P2W game.
---
I think that flair would work on tinder

Bro I thought this was ET
---
Many hordies are going to stonetalons after Barrens
---
But hey, who knows what Thermaplugg did during his free time? Just saying.
---
I made those notes based on a few guides floating around and then checked them to see if it still worked and it did.
---
Since this will probably be the last time within the next few years, me and my roommate will nolife into the release with a ~30hr session and then switch to a 16h/day cycle (16hr gaming, 6 hr sleep, 2hrs food/bio/miniworkouts) to 60. Goal is to see MC within the second ID. Could be hard since we will be leveling duo (2x frostmage). Anyway - everything depends on the release date :/
---
Good guide thanks for the link but idd after skimming through i would rather jsut speed level till a more accessible wand, 
---
Just more time efficient :)
---
i dont think he choose troll because of that, you can see in his speedrun that he used guns aswell, which is a mistake, that said, female trolls and female orcs have the best bow animation on horde
---
The cannibalize bit caught me off guard, great post!
---
&gt; The final game will probably littered with hundreds of little things they missed and nobody knows if it was like that in retail vanilla?
---
Probably yes. But they can check how it was in vanilla when people ask about things. They have actual vanilla running, which is what they are basing their changes on.
---
because it is a clash between old game design and new game design.
---
Personally, i tend to favor the old game design that valued exclusivity and not the new one that prioritize being as inclusive as possible and adapt to what players want.
---
The winner (so to say) would potentially affect how game devs view the future of mmo design.
---
take for instance the 1st extreme outcome where classic eclipse retails and all other mmo games and makes an insane climb starting and 3 million and growing to 10 million in a year. all the game industry would be looking at classic wow and trying to emulate what exactly makes it good.
---
On the other hand imagine if it fails and barely gets 100k active users after a few months, then it would be sort of a confirmation for activ-blizz that the old design is now for niche audiences. And please keep in mind that wow started losing subs when they started angling towards everyone and making it all inclusive.
---
The release game was super grindy.
---
Became much better later on.
---
&gt;Vindicaar
---
You mean that Activision creation? Of course *they* want you to think Azeroth is a sphere. They try to fucking control you. Don't be a dumb sheep, open your eyes and look for yourself - Azeroth is obviously flat, as proven by real scientific evidence.
---
You realize of course that if you end up disappointing me I will have to come gank you in STV?
---
Very.
---
Yes (probably).
---
Not for me.
---
Yes. (Nothing is perfect, though.)
---
honestly, i just want to do the Rohk Delar quest again, if i can finish it and complete your goal too i'd be super happy.
---
This sub has lost its mind. Pls blizzard give us a release date! üòÇüòõ
---
Actually at least one tlp is locked to a previous expansion (planes of power, largely regarded as the beginning of the end of the older style). So it's near perfect of a comparison to classic wow (at least as far as we know).
---
My cartoon examples were more for humour's sake than anything but even within this thread look at the dialogue. It skirts pretty close to "people that like retail are stupid" in quite a few comments.
---
Why do you think people feel so strongly like it's "us vs them" as opposed to "hey cool we all get some of what we want"
---
"competent leveler" wut.
---
* Alliance
---
* Night Elf
---
* Druid

* PvP - actual server can't be decided on until we get names :P
---
* Herbalism/Engineering
---
* 24/00/27 Moonglow/Nature's grace pve resto during progression, 1/29/21 during rank 10 or 11 farm in phase 2, and when I initially level I'll go omen of clarity -&gt; natural shapeshifter -&gt; furor and then the rest in feral until the mid 50s where I respec deep resto and heal dungeons until I max out.
---
* Already have a core group/guild lined up.
---
    
---
Outside of that I haven't thought about much. The biggest question for me is whether the unarmored epic mounts will be available during phase 1 - and in that case if ONLY they are available in phase 1, because that would change things. The plan is to stock up on materials early while the high level zones aren't being picked clean and store a healthy amount of herbs. But I'll have to prioritize making gold earlier if the unarmored epic mounts have an expiration date.
---
Yeah "this isn't like retail vanilla so if you notice anything off, tell us and we will fix it" is pretty different from what a lot of people are expecting, don't you think?
---
Yeah, as the other posters have said, OH weapon speed is relatively unimportant, and it's pretty complicated to quantify its impact exactly. I imagine there are break points, like ensuring a single OH hit (or glance) alone generates enough rage for Execute.
---
Playing on a pve server I used to duel horde (I was alliance) and mid duel I‚Äôd flag for pvp and /forfeit. It‚Äôd stop their auto attacks and announce I lost the duel, but often the players would hit another ability just after the duel ended without realising. This would hit me as I was pvp flagged and flag them for pvp. I‚Äôd then kill them, laugh, and walk away.
---
6/10 should be wearing devout shoulders.
---
Do you see yourself in third person when you hallucinate/dream? I usually dream in first person but there were some exceptions
---
How did you survive for 5 mins as T2 Rogue vs Naxx Druids. I call BS on this
---
I don't know what people where expecting? Obviously they are going to miss some small things. They showed their attitude towards that after the demo. They fixed how charge behaved, and did not "fix" warlock pet summoning, because apparently the people complaining about that were wrong.
---
&gt;But playing with people can be just as bad as solo if you don‚Äôt get along with them.
---
I don't really see the issue. You will be surrounded by players, talk with people you group up with, find a guild (they even have a "tinder profile" most of the time telling what the guild will focus on) and be active in gchat.
---
I've never had a problem finding nice people to play with, actually my problem is more often than not that I get too many on my friend list and can't keep social with them all.
---
I thought that was just a demo and was expected to be shit because it was so early and it was demo. I didn't realize they are only creation an approximation for the real release.
---
Let me pass a link your way - [owls are highly recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/4645yc/psa_for_hunters_pet_decision_aka_get_a_fucking_owl/?st=jvgkirv3&amp;sh=4bcb2765)
---
Some interesting info to take into consideration.
---
I'll have my bubble + hearthstone macro prepared.
---
&gt; I didn't realize they are only creation an approximation for the real release.
---
Now you know :)
---
Same here. It took me about 3 months of IRL time back in the day, and I expect about the same this time around.
---
Sure, I'm much better at video games today (thats not really sayin much) but I've noticed that if I do too long gaming sessions on the same game, I burn out a lot faster than if I just take it easy. It worked better with Path of Exile and would probably would well here too!
---
Sure, if you feral it out, it's a good set.
---
But I would go hunting for gear with Str and agility on it. 
---
Also there is better gear for tanking. 
---
But if you got nothing else, roll on it.
---
LOL 
---
Blizzard rules all!
---
Will they include dual-spec‚Äôing?
---
The more people play a game the more your achievements mean. Retail will loose a chunk of its playerbase and they don¬¥t like that. Objectively they won¬¥t notice any difference as xrealm and sharding buffers everything but they loose prestige.
---
Yes but then going for big release up front makes no sense. Why develop it without constantly pushing a demo out so that people can actually report things so that you have a better approximation for the real release? Meh. I mean I play on pservers and I know 100% accurate is not needed for great game but it's ... interesting.
---
No, no. They're the events leading *up* to Classic, mostly occurring either in Warcraft 3 and its expansion or in supplementary novels.
---
Because its a referendum on the current state of a game that tens of millions of people played. People see it as that. If one is more successful that the other, then its obvious which one the public prefers. Retail and Classic share very very few common game design concepts. Aside from both being called World of Warcraft, They‚Äôre not the same game
---
Your wife's art is pretty incredible, took a look at her twitter and those goblins are fantastic.
---
Lol I feel really bad for the OP, poor guy is probably too annoying to have friends
---
Wasn't in Vanilla so almost certainly not.
---
Reminds me of a good point I read years ago somewhere about why Ragnarok Online really got as popular as it did: It was an attractive MMORPG that merely happened to come around just as poor Southeast Asian and South American countries acquired barely passable and affordable internet for the first time ever, about 2002, and it was able to run on low-end computers.
---
Likewise, I think World of Warcraft also got as popular as it did due to some coincidental, non-gaming factors, the effects of which are probably impossible to ever happen again, at least for MMORPGs.  Being playable on low-end computers was absolutely one of the biggest factors, and that was likely the most important decision that they made deliberately.  Other things were probably just accidents at first, such as using quests to level.
---
When it comes down to it, luck (also meaning coincidence) is a big factor in anything becoming huge and revolutionary.  Of course, it is true that it really helps if the game itself is also revolutionary in some way like WoW was.  But sometimes it just doesn't matter how good or bad a game is: Luck/coincidence makes and breaks plenty of games.  It's sad but natural.
---
Its pretty even I think, but Alliance have an easier time in PvE because Paladins blessings are amazing. I wouldn't say there will be more Alliance raiding guilds, but yeah objectively speaking I think Alliance would have an easier time progressing through raids.
---
We won't know how close they get until release, so it's a bit early passing judgement in that regard. Maybe their internal testing is enough to make it very close? It's also possible they will have some sort of beta for exactly that reason.
---
I had 10,000 characters for the post and tried to fit as much as I could, so I truncated some details in terms of exact chronology. But I do admit a mistake in forgetting where Illidan was imprisoned.
---
Everyone's going into great detail about it, but honestly, Barrens chat.
---
Not exclusively. But a lot were caught in the crossfire. God bless their souls.
---
The classic /forfeit, surprisingly few people saw it coming.
---
My boss keeps asking me when Im going to take my summer holidays. Lets hope I can giver her an answer soon!
---
It's not the 7.3.5 client. They are using the current client, in a way. What they do is having a common "base" from which both current and Classic is built. So it'll be always up to date.
---
The Blizzcon demo was frozen at the time when Legion was current, that's why it was "7.3.5".
---
Who knows, maybe this will inspire EA to re-release FIFA *N* (pick your favourite version and insert here) and try to undo the terrible product its become.

You should not have to do any grinding if you closely follow the questing plan. For the most part, that route should work for any class, although I‚Äôll admit there are some points where I direct the player to stealth past mobs (usually inside caves) to achieve certain objectives. Often, it‚Äôs more of a convenience to complete quests more quickly, whereas non-stealth classes would need to take their time and fight their way through those gray/green mobs to complete the quest.
---
Also, I only included Rogue class quests, so you would need to incorporate any of your own class quests into the plan. From what I understand, Warriors prefer to level against lower level mobs, and that route is specifically optimized to achieve that. You might need to group up with someone occasionally to complete a few of the tougher objectives where stealth or other Rogue skills like Vanish are required, but that shouldn‚Äôt normally be necessary.
---
These *did* exist, and they didn't need a silly pop up achievement in game for people to know.
---
Servers had a forum and a *community*. People tracked progress and kept others up to date.
---
"Maybe edit dogs into classic wow pictures" omg the office meme fulfilled.
---
Just remember that for the first month or so there will be significantly more people so populations will be high, chances are ganking will happen more frequently.
---
why no wink at the end though? ;)
---
Only if he makes a deal with Blizzard first sadly. I would gladly support it tho
---
fuck me, right?
---
People will probably decide on one if there isn't an official RP-PvP servers, yes. Let's hope you guys get your server though :)
---
I‚Äôm glad my site has helped you out. I‚Äôve restored it and updated all of the charts and resources in preparation for Classic and now I‚Äôm working on this new guide.

and female troll has the worst shooting animations in the game + stands like a stick =)
---
Easy w/ keybinds. I've used left/right scroll wheel.
---
This seems perfect! Thank you!
---
The biggest MMO to come out since WOW and eclipsed it was Minecraft multiplayer servers.
---
I don't think kill, loot, repeat MMO games have much of a future because they are developer driven and expensive. I think games like Stardew Valley have a much better chance of making a great MMO.
---
Sure, but you have wikis available and said you only needed it to look up Blackmoore's name? I appreciate your post, but don't call yourself a loremaster when you can't even get simple lore facts right.
---
About the retconns. We're going to play Classic. The Lore we should use is the Lore that was current in 2004-2006. Taking into account all the retconns that happened post Vanilla is antithetical to the Classic Philosophy, just as including more modern gameplay mechanics from retail in Classic would. Illidan was never meant as a good guy who would fight the Legion. That was not his character. Them retconning this happened not for valid lore reasons but for gameplay reasons. 
---
If you want retconned lore, play retail.
---
Nice
---
Which ones? I know they cleared all of T7 content still wearing SWP gear, but I never noticed anyone still using SWP gear in Ulduar, or any T7 BiS list including level 70 items. Thunderfury in TBC however lasted a very long time for sure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8_JbDiALkY
---
If I knew the server list I would! Maybe ill have to make a discord and make a guild! I'll send you the info when i can or if you want to feel free to as well.
---
Same. I really like both, and female Orcs have arguably better casting animations, but I still play Troll females because they stand up straight and imo look good in everything. If Trolls could be Druids in vanilla I wouldn't play any other race.
---
Although I can't stand playing cows, so its either Trolls or NE Druid ):
---
True! I want like guild events to just get as many people as possiblen and go ganking. And not necessarily people of equal level. Plus I understand that raiding gear is good for pvp so of course at least having one raid night a week would probably be fine
---
All of my boxes were crushed by something falling down in my closet, unfortunately. I still have all the CDs, though.
---
Would it be better if the bear butt was less furry?
---
That has nothing to do with the spec and everything to do with all the fire resistance in the raids lmao.
---
I need to start watching this series. To hell with got.
---
the first I heard i could ride a mount was when I was lvl 35 in STV and ask how that night elf could ride a tiger :O. when he said I need to be lvl 40 I lvled as fast as I could. Was in for a shock when I saw the money cost and could not afford the mount untill I was 43. Good old times :D
---
not in green leveling gear man come on.
---
If you do let me know! I probably don't have the time or energy or experience needed to be a guild leader but I would totally be in a guild like this tho
---
It's this:

Many disagreements are just that. When you see the number of unique IPs logged into certain online forums that you think are extremely active you quickly realize it's just a few people who came to argue.
---
Just saying gold doesn't work. You have to actually award it.
---
I guess in theory you could use the rested xp gained between cuts to calculate how long the person spent offline and add it to the total. Not super practical but it's something
---
I know it's not accurate to vanilla/1.12 but I'm a little sad the combat log is being made worse. I wonder if they'll even have logging support for something like WCL.
---
Wtf are you doing with your pinky? I've always held books by putting my thumb in the centre to hold the pages apart.
---
I can absolutely agree with most of this. But the accessability is what made WoW work. Out of the many hardcore MMOs there are maybe 3 that are successfull and none of them even compares to WoW in terms of playerbase.
---
It is not entirely unreasonable to design an MMORPG that is accessible but also has player driven hardcore depth. Almost noone really attempted this properly though and those who did failed miserably. I think the key problem that is unsolved yet is economical. The more player driven, the more economy focussed an MMO is, but none of the hardcore games I know of managed to balance the economy in a way so it doesn't get completely overpowered by the few, which is quite frankly too realistic.
---
To keep casual and semi-hc players you need to provide meaningful and fun content that isn't dominated and controlled by players who completely live in the game. An even worse problem that is also largely unsolved is how the power progression over time affects the accessability of such games. If you join a server that is alive for several months you have a hard time involving yourself with the highest tier content even in a casual game like WoW.
---
Ashkandi
---
&gt;But that's a different story for vanilla.
---
lol
---
Vanilla was significantly more solo friendly than MMO games before it. Most of the people who played the game didn't reach max level and just did quests.
---
Great circlejerk!
---
honestly I think.you would be better off arguing to be a nightfall bot, shaman isn't any good at that either but hunters and warriors don't want to do it
---
i'll tested it for myself in contrast to my speed-level adventure.  
---
Durotar at lvl 10 it's possible, you need 10min to craft and learn all things you need. and around 60-80 Linen Cloth
---
and about 5-6 silver
---
not worth for me, 10min is to much downtime :/
---
at lvl 17-18 you'll get at ratchet a ward as a quest reward.

The FC build is perfectly fine for raiding. You can even raid in HOTW spec for early raids.

MMORPGS are a great escape from reality for some people. These people either need Classic to be successful so that they can ignore the real world and just play an MMORPG they enjoy again. Or they need Classic to be a disaster, so that they wont feel that their time in other MMORPGS is invalidated.
---
For the rest of us who just play MMORPGS to have fun and fantasise for a while, it doesnt really matter if it succeeds or fails - but we would obviously like it to succeed since we havnt really found any other MMORPG we like.
---
Try looking for a guild through discord‚Äôs or forums. Guilds with proper application forms and websites tend to be more serious and once you get to know people in there. They seem to have way better community
---
You said Flipsyde by someday. It‚Äôs the opposite.
---
I will go full retard and ding 60 as fast as I can, even if it cost me everything.
---
...but ours!
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat as you. Troll are my favorite race - though I think I'll go orc for hardiness, since I like you want to focus on pvp. [Check out user Stfuppercut's detailed reply far down in this thread](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1337) for some good info
---
what's your reason for not wanting achievements added?
---
The spec has a niche due to the content, which gives it viability, which in turn makes it pretty good. Are you trying to compare all specs in a vacuum irrespective of the situations in which they will perform? That would be pointless.
---
You don‚Äôt know what is in your own pockets?
---
Owls are exceptional. But i would go cats aswell for some power leveling
---
This is golden. Keep them comming!

And suddenly you've outleveled the quest ;) it's rng tho

I'm here early !

(Maybe the release date will be too)

^^^^I'm ^^^^hopeless
---
During wotlk I had a max hunter and Druid, I want to do something new however part of me is leaning on going down memory lane and grinding to max with a troll hunter like I did before.
---
Troll male rogue was my main for over 8 years.
---
They are exceptional and absolutely gorgeous with bloodfang armor.
---
Mega stylistic tip: Troll male COMBAT spec rogues are  just beautifull,used to have the Dal'rend and Krol blade just awesome all around
---
I would have preferred that professions did not have anything exclusive at all, that everything each profession could make or harvest could be traded. Am I correct in thinking that you have the same prefference?
---
Auberdine PvP  would be my home &lt;3
---
If people are stupid enough to donate to randoms playing computer games I don't really care.  What's more annoying is those streamers are just commercials in disguise used by companies to promote their shitty modern cash grab games. This is borderline illegal and has ruined any objective journalism and criticizim towards games nowadays and one of the reason players had to push for a classic wow rerelease(cause modern mmos are terrible). Not even mentioning the fact that those sellouts get every beta access, before anyone, beta is not even the right term anymore  I think, more like advertisement preview.
---
It would work, but you would need to grind more than usual, and do dungeons.
---
if there will be a beta, the chances are good to get some at launch.
---
If not, gl with that ^^
---
Exp per mob kill would be low, and certain "collect 900 boar assholes" quests would take a while. That being said world PVP would be a breeze having a gank squad at all times and claiming mobs and dealing with adds would be easy.
---
We always look to add more people to the guild :)
---
https://discord.gg/bKuQrQ
---
1. BFA will work with minor changes
---
2. If theres a beta, addons will be ported to classic
---
3. without a beta (open/closed), no addons.
---
maybe some super little addons will work without a classic port, but somthing like a dmg meter or elvUi, no way
---
5/7 Perfect
---
I played a bit of WoW during MoP, but didnt stick around for long. It's been a game I've always felt that I missed out on, and I'm super excited to jump into classic. I'm avoiding private servers to get the full experience. Worried about playing solo though, hopefully the game is as welcoming as I hear!
---
I would imagine some basic addons will be available within the first day. Questie and similar addons will be several weeks later as the addon api has been changed so much since vanilla days and will need to be rebuilt from scratch.
---
Next gif release date when?
---
Working on the Raider part 2 as we speak üëå
---
The counterpoint to that is that the people to whom it is more important might have more stake in the thing though, so maybe they should get to decide.
---
Otherwise you could end up in a situation where 90 people who don't really care and aren't affected much either way end up fucking over 10 people who care a lot and are very affected by it.
---
I dont know how you can start with a statement like that when talking about the most popular mmo ever made. It may not have certain mechanics that you think are necessary, but that doesn't mean it's a bad mmo. I think the accessible approach with the difficulty and depth at the end game is what made wow so great.
---
I played FF11 before wow and having to group constantly does ruin it at times. Sometimes you just want to solo, but have the option to put the time in for the bigger and better rewards. 
---
I dont think you deserve the downvote storm for your post, but starting off with a statement like that you are kind of asking for it.
---
They didnt obviously expect the Redridge Inquisition
---
The answer to this question is simply can you accept the most boring and one of the slowest leveling experience in the game? Then play Paladin.
---
There great, but a lot of people never make it to 60 because their leveling experience is a big snore.
---
I think you'd progress quests too fast for the exp gains. Eventually you'll have to dungeon or grind mobs together to catch up for exp lost due to party.
---
Can we have twin JO crystals? Nothing gay though.
---
The current version on the CDN had the 8.1 tag.
---
I know it's not the same client.
---
Because the retail casual plebs has invested hundreds- if not thousands of days/played on an inferior game only to get cucked by classic release that will make current retal expansion servers completely dead. So they resort to the only thing they know how: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE *CLASSIC ARE BAD!!!!* REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
A legend among legends.

You sir are the gallowboob of classicwow

The hero we need.

Thank you.
---
Switching between PvP/Raiding/farming specs was a significant gold sink in vanilla, it helped to combat inflation.
---
If we collectively say "release date coming tomorrow" everyday, eventually we'll hit the jackpot.
---
I think "obsess" is a bit of an euphemism considering the amount of time we spend discussing this game right now
---
The only thing making me second guess rolling Horde. But they are the only ones who can play shaman.
---
The main reason to go nightelf is because of shadowmeld (which is godlike on a pvp server (even in its 1.12 version) and animations).
---
As a rogue can confirm soul link is annoying.
---
Then those rogues better make it a stunlock, or they'll be running around like a headless chicken until the next server maintenance.
---
&gt; If 75% of people agree something is a good change, then it probably is. 
---
I'm skeptical about this notion. I believe that people can - and are eager to - be directed by charismatic voices. Just here on reddit I've seen plenty of highly upvoted, gilded, agreement-in-the-comments posts that were either clearly subjective or even objectively false. All it took to convince people was a compelling argument.
---
Well classic is going to be the modern game stripped down to its classic-like state with stubs here and there, right? So the api should be modern as well.
---
Yup looking like they are making major progress if they are willing to demo for content creators! Finally looking up!
---
This, but with the original logo would have been great.
---
 I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa
---
I'll be happy with whatever I land on honestly. I think the only one I wouldn't want to do is paladin, and that's just because I'm going horde.
---
It's just impossible for me to decide what I think is going to be the *most* fun... So I might as well leave it up to someone else haha. If I didn't have a guild, I'd probably just roll a die.
---
Every time I watch the announcement I have goosebumps
---
I don't feel like it is... I don't get sick of the leveling process until the last 3 levels or so. I also enjoy alts and just properly swap between them to not waste and maximize well rested. Well rested for me is why the grind doesn't feel grindy.
---
Thanks for the info! Makes a lot more sense now.
---
Nobody said it was possible, but if they wanna do it and see how far they can go whats the issue ? 
---
Also, you underestimate how crazy people are, mc will be cleared faster than you imagine
---
&gt; The economy in vanilla is incredibly important for every play stile.
---
Justify this because I don't see it at all or see how it has changed. Raiding requires consumables. PVP requires consumables. I don't see how the economy is relevant outside of this.
---
You can gear up for raiding without even touching the auction house. WOW is very Diablo in that you loot gear directly from corpses rather than looting crafting materials that can then be converted into gear from a person with the relevant skills.
---
I'd say WOW is a game that actually downplayed economy.
---
Yeah I was thinking it as a metaphor and just how badass it looks
---
Summer starts 22nd June.
---
It's so good at being in the same vein as the original content, too. Nicely done!
---
Now you just got me excited to level up my orc and grind out rep to get a raptor instead of a wolf.
---
29 level twink all the way bro
---
Oh just fuck me up right now
---
Most paladins wont use 25/26 spec for raiding. A priest just need 1 talentpoint to do the grind. And like i said, unless you do something else during the "saved time", the killing speed isnt really a advantage.
---
Atleast as alliance, HS'ing out of there (having HS in raid oriented location), just running back there takes a loong time.
---
As somebody who has mained a healer since forever, I can confirm that if you are healing idiots that you feel entirely useless. 
---
At least on a DPS class, if you are good you are always impactful.
---
Do you have to have an active sub to participate in beta?
---
I have played a few over vanilla - legion... never to max level. For me they aren't as fun as a few of my favorite classes.. but they are certainly enjoyable. They do all things well and solo'ing content is easier. I am rolling one to be my first 60 in classic because in vanilla i spent so much time broke, I want to be able to farm marudon and solo DM:T runs (hopefully possible in classic)
---
Alliance hunters are a bit more spoiled with, BoW, Kings and JoW.
---
Thanks for posting this! I couldn't remember that troll hunters name and I used her guide way back in the day for leveling
---
Tbh, sometimes the directions are so vague that even if you are a genious, you might not understand what they meant. But most quests, yeah, you have some general direction where to look for.
---
Yeah I don't really understand this weird attitude. There will be a large subset of people trying to optimize their quest path to get server first 60. Apparently these people are playing the game wrong...
---
Damn impressive reply. I mean you let the Druid reset over and over, which makes him topped off at all times. Meanwhile you will slowly degrade. And Im thinking 1-2 minutes tops. 5 mins is a looong time 1v1. I just felt you exxagerated thats all. Cheers
---
Id say... lets first see what blizzard does.
---
They are brilliant to play, easy to learn, hard to master.  
---
The thing about the Huntard title, is that everyone will soon know who you are if you are a good hunter.  
---
I was in a hardcore raiding guild back in vanilla, and had no issue raiding into Naxx (in fact we had 4 core hunters who were good raiders).  2 of us also PvP'd a lot, I got to Rank 12 and he got to rank 14.  They are great in AV, AB and WSG. work great in a team and fast to level solo too. 
---
I played horde, and went Tauren, as I liked the look. If I was to choose hunter again, and roll horde, I'd prob choose Orc or Troll.
---
GIVE ME BACK THE FUCKING PARK
---
Iirc about 30 mins, maybe 40-45 depending if you die from some mobs along the way
---
There's a guy on youtube who measured the size of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms by walking and comparing movements speeds from Vanilla wow to retail and did a timed run from the northern to the southern end.
---
So true, exact my thoughts 10/10
---
[deleted]
---
Yes they are, high skill ceiling in PvE, lot of fun in PvP even thou they're a bit squishy but you got the tools to avoid getting damage.
---
All race are good but horde side orc/troll are better due to +5% pet damage &amp; hardiness / Berserking &amp; bow spec
---
Alliance Nelf/Dwarf for more agi / gun spec &amp; stoneform
---
And honestly I hope people are streaming most of it, because I'm super interested! I'm hoping some people are going to take a lot of risks trying to push these server firsts.
---
Can we see more about the golden retrievers in goldshire
---
What do you mean?  Like tucked into your undies, zipped you up and sent you packing?
---
Yeah it does totally make sense! Though a lot of addons would still Need some changes I guess especially Quest addons etc. because the world has changed so much since then? 
---
But yeah still way better than starting from scratch :)
---
I dont think you do understand. How long do you think phases are going to last. You have no idea and you are already setting limitations on your guild. You're probably playing a huntard too and think you get all the loots.
---
From what I could gather some people are also pissed because they do like classic, but they would rather have some of it's features in retail instead.
---
They fear that Classic WoW will be the excuse to dumb down retail even more (if that's even possible at this point...). 
---
"If you don't like this and that, go play classic"
---
"If you don't like this and that, go play retail"
---
There is a good amount of players who would like the best of both worlds, but that's obviously difficult to deliver.
---
I think that's a legitimate concern to be honest, even if it won't affect me because retail is dead to me anyway.
---
If you need convincing it probably isn't for you.
---
woof
---
&gt; You wont be solo for long. The game organically forces you to group up.
---
You'll learn that statements like this just aren't true and become deeply unsatisfied with how both people need to synced up in terms of quests to play with each other.
---
Right? I loved my ele shaman. With t2/ZG gear I was able to get 2k Crits with lightning bolt and like a 28% crit rate.  I could off heal like a boss when needed. I could take a hit too, beefy caster (Tauren üòÇ)
---
Ppl underestimate shamans.
---
I love the office mashups, but this certainly piqued my interest
---
Wisdom. The value of the perceived consensus of any group is contextually based upon the topic. In the case of Classic vs. Retail the conversation really does seem to mostly be the more interested and opinionated Classic advocates vs. people sating their bullying impulses, so it's a slightly different thing. Then you get those who are offended vs. the wall-of-no, and the ensuing defensive people participating a bit. Total train wreck of a discussion between those two groups.
---
The thing is that a good group of 3 people could run most instances, which would be great XP and gear for all of you as long as you went to a Tank / DPSer / Healer. 
---
Its all about fun, you can group and level together no problem. Also, if the 3 of you are always going to be running together, you can help each other level professions. For example, have 1 skinner, 1 herber, 1 miner, as gathering professions. Then have Enchanting (great for leveling with additional enchants) / Tailoring  (great for Bags and greens for healer/DPSer if they choose mage/lock/priest) / and maybe engineering or alchemy for cool stuff to level. 
---
The 3 of you could easily support each other and do most group quests, even the tougher ones (may need 1 or even 2 to join you for the end ones in Arathi / WPL/ EPL).
---
I dont really think a lot of the systems like battlegrounds, and factions were a bad idea, but i think you are right when you say "it was already half way to B to begin with."
---
I think you kinda hit the nail on the head talking about how even from day one WoW catered to more of a casual demographic. Even though it was slower pace than what we have to day, then it was considered less hard-core than other titles.
---
So in conclusion, I think that Blizzard sort of continued along that trend, and more or less rewarded players for their time constraints. For example the less time you have the more easily we will make rewards achievable.  This is controversial because its nobodys fault, and I think upon the release of classic, we will see an overall more casual player base, whether they used to play hardcore or not.
---
That‚Äôs what she said
---
You should play on a pvp server. The constant threat/opportunity presented by an enemy faction adds so much to the immersion and community building.
---
If you haven't played much WoW stance dancing as a warrior in vanilla will add a significant amount of difficulty to the game for you - before you choose that class spend some time watching/reading about how warriors work.
---
Healers
---
Deciding between a troll or orc warrior. Mining &amp; smithing. Level as arms, end game prot. I have a few irl friends to level together and nobody wants to be tank. I've played the most out of us, so I figured I'd bite the bullet to level the warrior.
---
I got this reference

Ultima Online
---
However like WOW I only enjoy the game in its vanilla state or (2nd expansion) so to play this I have to play private servers but they are often abused by staff. So they are not as enjoyable.
---
To walk from one end of the continent to the other..? That seems like an incredibly conservative estimate. You're running through 10+ entire zones.
---
Playing on a PvP server is more immersive than a PvE server. That's all you need to know.
---
Thank you for doing this.. I need memes to fuel the void in me.
---
I fucking love this shit
---
Yes they are extremely fun to play 
---
leveling is great ... it can be super easy if you want play in relaxed way ... or you can increase skill cap and be very efficient 
---
pvp is great at all levels and you will get so many different experiences! ... different styles depending on lvl and at 60 gear ... 
---
Raiding is also great as only at end game you will lose top (top'ish :P )  dps bracket in hardcore guilds ... 5 man you are strong ... at 60 lvl raids you start strong ... mid way you start to not increase pve dps as fast as others ... but let's be honest are you going to play hardcore pve guild? ... and if so, do you need to be dps only class ? ... and even if again yes do you think all warriors, warlocks, mages, rogues will get their gear at the same time? Some of them will not progress with gear as fast as hunter because they need to share drops between them (class specific) ... less hunters in group, faster they share gear between themselves ... therefore you will still do lot of dmg in overall raid calculation ... and end game end game when everybody has top gear and you killed everything pve you don't give a **** :P 
---
If you want to add more flavour to it play Night Elf and use Shadowmeld ... get cat with prowl ... trust me waiting in ambush in stealth is OP ... use potion of lesser invisibility (cheap) ...  = omg !!

Stormwind was destroyed by the Orcish Horde in the First War (WC1), King Llane Wrynn (Varian's father) was killed, Anduin Lothar gathered the surviving refugees and fled to Southshore in Lordaeron, appealed to the leaders of the other 7 human kingdoms for help which created the original Alliance of Lordaeron, Orgim Doomhammer killed Lothar in the Siege of Blackrock Mountain at the end of the Second War (WC2 first expansion) after the defeat of the Horde the Alliance rebuilt Stormwind, but the rising costs fractured the Alliance and kingdoms started leaving, the Stormwind you see in WoW is actually New Stormwind, Old Town is called that because it's the only part of the city that survived mostly intact, the Defias Brotherhood were originally the masons who rebuilt the city then got ripped off of their rightful wages because of the black dragon Onyxia meddling in the politics, so Edwin VanCleef started a riot which killed Varian's wife Tiffin, so the masons were driven out and became bandits/domestic terrorists and despite all this it's one of the last bastions of humanity in WoW, due to the events of the Third War (WC3)
---
tl;dr basically just a shitshow for Azerothian humans all around
---
Wouldn't it make more sense if it was "at least I ain't chicken"?
---
I love you for making these
---
No way, my bet would be 70 minutes from booty bay to undercity
---
yep saw it too, it took him something like an hour to run from south to north.
---
It sounds like they might be removing the WoW token from Classic. Keeping in mind that Classic will share a subscription with modern WoW, so if you plan to farm gold to pay for you r game time, you will be doing it in the modern game. But there will not be a marketplace for WoW tokens inside the Classic game.
---
Haven't done it in years so it is rough, but done a few races with level 1's and Eastern Kingdom was under an hour
---
Do work, figure it out :)
---
Gnome Warlocks are the coolest Race/Class combo in the game
---
Yeah I feel like it takes me 20+mins  to get from Org to thousand needles :d
---
31 male troll prot warrior. Likes to fish, cook, &amp; camp. Enjoys leading the party. More of a country boy, doesnt like to spend much time in the cities. I like making things as a blacksmith and have high aspirations for my craft.
---
Oh hell yes üòÑ
---
I don't like the idea of useless specs. Really all ret needs to at least be viable pre-naxx is a properly tuned Crusader Strike. Even on a 6 second CD, that's 50 extra hits in a 5 minute boss fight, which is fairly substantial even if it's not topping meters.
---
Just lower the damage of exorcism to compensate for naxx and it's fine. Still low damage, but they still bring an extra cc, an aura, and blessings.
---
I know though, no changes. Same reason prot paladins will never get a taunt (although i would gladly see kings thrown into the ret tree and a taunt being put in its place).

You can see a short example of using the query builder [here](https://i.imgur.com/DW31qcM.gif).
---
Other notable changes/additions:
---
* The search/sort code now only looks at 1.12 stats but we still retain all the versions of all items for display
---
* New search operators; *set:* to search by set name and *usable:* to filter gear only usable by the supplied class
---
* Searching by shield block value is fixed now (has:block or has:blockvalue)
---
* Other small bug fixes and additions like http-&gt;https redirect and gzip support
---
There are probably still quite a few bugs lurking around in the query builder so feel free to report them in this thread or on the discord.

What kind of player do you use for the video ? 
---
For some reason it goes absolute lowest quality after a few seconds then back up to good quality.
---
There are no parameters I can modify.
---
I guess it's possible, but I doubt it. I don't think that they release content for public testing exactly 8 days after a streamer summit as a rule. Could be earlier, could be 8 days, could be later. I don't think it has any relation to the 8.2 testing, but we can always hope!
---
This is correct.
---
Fair enough. Which brings up an interesting point regarding the duration of phases.
---
How do you stretch it out to 3 years, and at the same time keep people interested - especially in the final phase - to include continued runs of Naxx even when they‚Äôve seen the content?
---
Oh - and if we all knew Naxx gear would actually be relevant in coming content, wouldn‚Äôt it go a long way to keep us active in farming the content available?

It's happend on some of his other gifs as well. I'm also curious.

As big a game as i talk, i wouldn't actually take it. You're 100% right, even more so considering i would probably be good friends with these people.
---
That epic hammer off the last boss in BRD is totally mine though, that's going to be my chase weapon for the entirety of classic as i want to tank 5s and that extra attack proc with seal of wisdom means i can keep consecration up for the entire fight.
---
I plan on doing lots of travelling and not much skipping. I will only be skipping stuff on launch if the quest has poor drop/spawn rate. I am not looking to speed race to 60. I will try my best during travel to gather all quests that may include my destination or passing en route. This helps me also gather all dungeon quests so that I maximize my one run of the dungeon while leveling.
---
I forgot to mention it happens on all his gifs for me.
---
DOWNVOTE!

Ok cool, yes this is exactly what I was wondering. My google skills suck.
---
You could make a second combat log tab with the filter set to only actions that happened to you.
---
I posted my thoughts up above, I'll just copy and paste for your convenience.  
---
Yeah,  OP's idea may seem somewhat reasonable on an opening day prospect (I'm  seriously not going to get into an argument about the logistics behind  anything, algorithms, queue times, etc.) BUT we have to think about long  term with this 1/1/1/1 idea. I just really think this would be an  annoyance on a big scale after a while. I mean... in 6 months when  servers are matured and I want to start playing for example I would have  an unknown amount of time potentially for a brand new player to start  on the other faction.  
---
What  if there are 50 people wanting to join horde and no body alliance  should we start forcing? WHAT IF Billybob popular streamer is playing  horde on this server? My friend plays on that server but I have a 600  person queue to create a horde toon because everyone wants to play on  the same server as Billybob and no body wants to play alliance against  his pro guild.  
---
I  know there are a TON of guilds already formed with 200+ members waiting  to pick a server and create their guild and get going. That's already  gonna bottleneck and fuck queue times right away. Theres just so many  variables that this doesn't account for and Blizzard will 100% not go  with. It's simpler to let it play out and look back in 4 months and see  the hailstorm certain servers became and allow free transfers to even it  out.  
---
This just honestly will cause a lot of unnecessary problems just from that simple perspective, non IT related.

i LOVE these office/wow classic mashup memes!

I had to do ELI5 on spell batching to my gf. After she finally understood, asked why bother throttling the game like that? 
---
I told her the 1%ers are that anal.

Her response, "they'll just go back to illegals in a month anyway. So much work for so little payout"
---
Ive played a bunch of osrs, and also wow back in my days. 
---
I gotta say both are absolutely a-m-zing games.
---
But
---
Problem here is, that ppl have their vanilla AND private server experiences mixed in memory so badly, that i for one cant differentiate those two in most cases. So theres going to be loads of "i remember this being different in vanilla" turning up to be "it was different in private servers".
---
The OST playing when you enter Stormwind via flight path (or foot?), always gives me goosebumps and a lump in my throat. 
---
Gnomes.
---
Elwynn Forest (+Darkshore) rain and ambience.
---
Teldrassil music.

When I first started playing WoW (Vanilla launch 2004) I started as a NE Priest, got all the way to 60, raided up to BWL and switched over to Horde as a Resto Shaman and only managed to clear AQ40 (C'Thun after patch) and a couple of Naxx wings. 
---
As much as I loved my shammy, especially with the 30/0/21 build blowing up people in BG's &amp; Tyr's Hand, I really did miss the Alliance. The music, the cities, riding through the lower level zones for herbalism etc and stopping, dismounting and just enjoying the music, especially if it's raining heavily is priceless.
---
My partner and I were going to roll alliance in Classic along with some friends, however I've convinced them to go Alliance and will personally be rolling a Gnome Mage - the hype is getting too much and difficult to handle.

Having a 75% threshold to pass content in polls, you say the remaining 25% have to "quit or deal with it" that simply is not correct. The OSRS community has done nothing but grow since release (aside from the first year where no new content was being added). The thing is with osrs (and similarly WoW) you never truly quit. The majority of people always come back eventually.. and the ones who don't return, nobody will miss them.. the proof is in the growth numbers. The player base is at an all time high 6 years after release despite the 'flawed' polling system and new osrs specific content being added.
---
The end got me.
---
I think I could still find the exact spot just outside of Orgrimmar that would allow to climb the cliff and the enter the city from above. There was also a glitch to climb behind the transparent wall of the AH in Orgrimmar.

Totally forgot the bank was changed, remembered the AH and the wall jumping to get behind the AH but totally forgot about how huge the Classic bank is and the weird closed off instance portals.
---
but there was the War of Three Hammers between the Bronzebeard clan, the Wildhammer clan, and the Dark Iron clan, so even the dwarves haven't been totally untouched
---
Controversial opinion, I hated The Office and these memes are all getting annoying.
---
I never had any trouble with Warriors and Mages on my Warlock.  If the rogue knows how to never ending stunlock you so that you never get any casts off they are really tough.  However, if you can get a dot and a curse of exhaustion on them, or if you get a fear off on them and chain fear them while they die of dots, they're doable.
---
While leveling on a Pserver, I was around level 26 and there was a 30 rogue that jumped me at the Zoram Strand....I was able to get a fear off on him after Void bubbling and was able to kill him by chain fearing and dotting.
---
Then another time on a different character I was around lvl30 in shimmering flats and a 32 rogue jumped me, and that guy was able to kick and stun me to death and I was like...wow...wtf...
---
Mage..fear, dot, drain mana, repeat...if you get sheeped enjoy the free full heal then void bubble before the pyroblast hits you and they waste all that mana casting it, then repeat the fear, dot, drain mana
---
Warrior is bubble fear dot drain slow repeat.  If you have the talent, recall a new void after bubble and when the first one wears off bubble again.  Warrior won't have any rage and will be super pissed lmao
---
At higher levels it gets even easier when you get all of your spells available.
---
If you really believe that, just look at the graphs for rs3 and osrs active players.. it's a pretty self explanatory picture.
---
Hey i will park my hunter in STveitnam everyday with the only goal to gank every f****** alliance.
---
&lt;misfit&gt; will gank every alliance lvl 1-60 on sight
---
Oh my god dude, these are so funny.
---
They are the best form of publicity blizzard has for a project like this. Free, other than their flights/meals/room they just provided, which is chump change. 
---
They want these guys singing their praises and keeping the hype train full steam ahead.
---
1 hour 15 minutes ~
---
Hey man, when you hit lvl 60, can you run me through RFK?  I want that axe for my shaman.
---
My body is ready.
---
oh damn i thought it was just me.
---
You're being downvoted but you're right. Now that I've played P99 I see why wow did a lit of things, but I'm.unsure if it was good or not. 
---
There is a subset of MMO players who feel WoW ruined the genre by making things too easy and being able to do things solo, and how instances ruin immersion. I'm not necessarily agreeing with that, but I see why they feel that way.
---
TWF you have hearthstone set in Crossroads
---
this is one of the best class to play in classic actually, its pure fun, you can rekt rogues(especially with free action potion) , priest, mages. They lack of healing, but cmon, what were you expecting?
---
PVE - a lot of kitting and fun, cool quest from the LEAF in MC.
---
Maybe they are not the highest DPS in PVP or PVE, but they are good, there are just not many GOOD hunters.
---
Whys that? These guys would have a critical eye on the content since they been reviewing it for so long for their videos
---
Yeah. Which is why I think Arms is going to be superior for leveling. Also Tactical Mastery.
---
Definitely agree with you on the Activision point. Blizzard is garbage at the moment at listening to their players. All their games I loved (Retail WoW, Hearthstone, Overwatch and HoTs) are garbage at the moment and it wouldn‚Äôt be so difficult to fix them. Hopefully they don‚Äôt do the same with Classic Wow.
---
I'm living for these right now. Thank you!
---
Very interesting, but if they were there yesterday whatever was shown to them probably won‚Äôt reach us until at least next week.
---
Play warrior or priest if you want every one to expect you to know everything. Play paladin if you'd rather they think your handicapped. 
---
/s
---
We don‚Äôt talk about that.
---
I think they have are great for being relied on. They want Classic to be as authentic as possible which is what a majority of the fan base wants.
---
Dear god. The Office is the vanilla of TV Shows. Easily the greatest. Timeless. Classic. Incredible. You will not regret for even one moment your decision to watch this show.
---
Yes but the same is true is reverse. Charismatic voices can sway people to vote against updates too. Therefore I think it‚Äôs balanced. I trust that 75% is a high enough threshold, that‚Äôs 3 in 4 people.
---
Dude you're hilarious, this is excellent bahaha
---
Windfury will be the way it was in vanilla, however the videos you see are a bit misleading. Playing that build is like a slot machine, and the compilation videos are just all the jackpots.
---
The true definition of "A sense of pride and accomplishment".
---
Very good, very GOOD
---
This is a fantastic way to start my day.
---
These are hilarious
---
Why not, they are the visible face of the community on various media sources, and they have the most followers for Classic's target audience.
---
Unless you really like the lore/feel/aesthetic of Warlocks, Mage is probably just objectively superior if you want to do either, but especially if you want to do both.
---
You are doing Gods work.
---
True ! Not saying it's a masterpiece or better than WoW or anything, but it was worthy of playtime.
---
come to /r/warcraftlore and learn, young padawan.
---
(warning, we also discuss lore that will not apply to Classic there, because it hadn't happened yet during original WoW)
---
Bound to happen at some point. :)
---
Man you are amasing. Keep making these for some years plz.
---
Who cares about Ali at Xroads?  If you're pvp flagged there, it's your own damn fault.  Now if you had said Splinter Tree Post, or Tarren Mill, or Grom'Gol....would have been much funnier.
---
Okay this was good
---
I played a ret pally mainly in classic and I was able to heal dungeons and MC by just switching my gear and down ranking spells. I think you‚Äôd enjoy shaman more since each spec is more viable than paladin. Don‚Äôt get me wrong tho, pally is a lot of fun, tons of defensive utility while shaman is the opposite with offensiveness.
---
Is this pserver or actual Classic?
---
Isn't there some debate as to whether Rogue abilities worked like they did on pserver vs Classic.
---
On Pservers, things like Gouge, Blind, Evis consistently hit lvl 60s even if you are lvl 30. 
---
Not sure if Classic is like that
---
The "I thought you weren't doing the competitive stuff anymore" hits too close to home.

I didn't say that. What I said was that it isn't the end all be all of raiding. Damn man. I didn't come here to argue. I came here to state that Fear ward shouldn't be the final decision maker in choosing a race and that he will still get invited to raids as a Human or NE Priest.

why does it need level 5 out of interest?

---
wat
---
I think this is the blue/gold dress of the wow community.  Does he say ‚Äúhave‚Äù or ‚Äúain‚Äôt‚Äù?
---
I suppose.  I‚Äôm ok with Naxx being the last phase and staying that patch forever tbh.  Unless you‚Äôre a hardcore player you‚Äôre not going to see Naxx often so leaving it open for a while is fine by me.  And I think people will stay interested cause classic coming back as a whole is like a museum for folks to come and play in for years to come without the fear of it being closed or updated
---
If you have a life outside WoW kill speed is very much an advantage, I have as much gold as I do because I can clear in 20 minutes then do errands or walk my dog or cook dinner etc. 
---
Also 25/26 is perfectly fine for raiding outside of progression. Most of our paladins run this build outside of maybe the first 2-3 weeks a raid is released. You also don't need it it just make it easier I could still double clear as 30/21 and if you want to go full holy you might just need to single pull but you'de still be faster than a priest since you don't have to drink/eat.

---
I think it‚Äôs a representation of how commercialization has taken over gaming.
---
Think about it: In retail, I can buy my way to success. Just like any other pay-to-win games. I don‚Äôt have to worry about being laughed or told ‚Äúget gud scrub‚Äù - I simply farm content to get gear, then join a guild to farm the same thing but on a harder setting. It‚Äôs simple, and completely encompasses me in a nice, cushy bubble I can enjoy at my leisure.
---
But vanilla was built for gamers. If you were bad, it usually showed. Painfully. If you couldn‚Äôt contribute, you didn‚Äôt get gear, and your character looked stupid. But societally, we helped each other. 
---
Today, people don‚Äôt tend to be helpful. They‚Äôd rather make fun of each other, unless helping would fit their agenda. And they‚Äôd rather hide their bad gear or poor reputation by living in the fog. (Because that‚Äôs essentially what retail is like with tons of mechanisms in place to encourage it). 
---
But it costs something - and bad gamers don‚Äôt seem to realize that paying money to play a game isn‚Äôt really playing it! (I‚Äôve been this person - looking back, I realize exactly what that statement means).
---
So from these angular perspectives, both seem to destroy the other when viewed solely from one side. But I think what will actually happen, is that blizzard will spread out the phase releases just enough, in order that classic players will eventually try retail (because hey, I have it anyway, right?) and maybe some retailers will try Classic (because hey, I just finished all content in 3 days and I‚Äôm waiting for a mythic run...) - but In the end, BOTH games will thrive off the others success...
---
...and that‚Äôs why these guys are professional game developers. That‚Äôs their game. And they will win. Why? Because the house always wins.
---
&gt; it‚Äôd probably go over your head
---
just say ‚Äúremember all those times you said ‚ÄòSon! Dinner‚Äôs ready! Come eat with the family!‚Äô
---
And I always yelled back ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt , I‚Äôm raiding!‚Äô

..
---
Well I‚Äôm playing that exact game again but now I have uberEats‚Äù

Does this mean Blizzard ate the release date? And do we get to bill them for it?

Don't remember the dog from back in the day but will make sure I double check this time.

The WoW Token Tutorial has been removed.
---
I covered this in my note 30 spell power isn't really relevant to threat unless you are min/maxing threat on a raid boss. Most people run a mitigation weapon such as quel with crusader and than a max tps weapon like mageblade with sp enchant.
---
OP is talking about dungeons where tps isn't as important because you don't have 20 big dick dps trying to top meters you just have people trying to clear a dungeon. If someone is pulling aggro you tell them to chill and give you an extra second to get aggro before attacking.
---
Damn, you beat me to it.
---
These are amazing. So perfect. Truly incredibly funny and original. You, sir, need to get paid for having such a creative mind.

That's your opinion..one of the more popular 1-60 level guides for horde involves a lot of STV:

Your statement is true because of what I said. It's not efficient on a populated PvP server.

Of course it's competition. So many of us did stuck to play retail because there's no better option available. Now, that there is a better option coming up, we'll be gone away from retail and play classic. How can that not be competition?
---
I think WOW has a lot of good elements of a good multiplayer game but not many of a good MMO game. Raiding is multiplayer. Dungeons are multiplayer. Battlegrounds are multiplayer.
---
Gear is primarily acquired through multiplayer content and is soulbound.
---
While crafting and economy is there to an extent it's a secondary system rather than the primary system of character progression.
---
Quest design is distinctly single player and if you aren't synced in quest progression then somebody is losing out. The best ever experience I had in questing was leveling with someone after the 7.3.5 zone scaling changes but we had to designate a zone to level together in and leave that zone when not together so we don't lose quest synchronization. Even then it only lasted until one of us reached the end of the scaling bracket (60-80) and had to stop questing together.
---
Doubt he is liked by blizz

At least i can quit any time üòÖ

Yeah. Can you eli5 on spell batching so  I can clearly relay this info to my newb wife.  Clearly I know but cant explain it to her. Shes so casual...
---
This kind of makes sense, both Esfand and Towelliee were on "vacation". 
---
Both of them didn't stream on Tuesday as well. Which is very unlikely cuz Towelliee does his box openings every Tuesday and Esfand got unbanned that day. 
---
I hope your right :)

release date ?
---
I don‚Äôt have a lot of faith in them as content creators or as representatives of the community. I appreciate that they have put in effort and are passionate, and maybe I am not their target demographic. Players with a in depth understanding of the games mechanics such as Skarm, OG, and Taladril would be individuals I would prefer getting that first look and feedback for Blizzard. I understand why Blizzard would choose them as they provide a broader platform to hype and advertise the coming launch.
---
The gold makers will be rushing to make wands to sell and make money with as soon as possible.
---
My plan is to start checking AH periodically until they show up and get it then.  
---
My original plan was to level tailoring or LW up to the first green and pump those out for my bank alt to DE which would get him to 75 and give him the ability to make the wand, but that's probably what the gold sellers are doing to get their wands on the AH...at that point I might as well make a bunch of wands and sell them on the AH to make money...well great so I don't know what I'm going to do then.  probably a combination of start checking AH daily until I either find one on AH or make my own..which ever comes first.  I'll do Tailoring and skinning on my Lock main and Enchanting/LW on my bank alt.  The first green item for tailoring is around level 40 skill...the first green for LW is around level 45 skill....however leather is much easier to farm than cloth.  I could grind on beasts for a level or grind on the humans by razor hill for a level...it could go either way.  I'll have to decide if more quests require beast killing or humanoid killing and do those quests while I grind up mats.  
---
Can I level without the wand...sure...but from level 5-13 the wand does like 3 times the damage of any of my spells...you can literally just wand everything and not spend any mana lol.
---
Lol there‚Äôs a timeline where I never got a job and moved out and I lived in the basement eating hot pockets my mom bought and playing classic WoW til I became a 40 year old incel and...

&gt; classic eclipse retails and all other mmo games and makes an insane climb starting and 3 million and growing to 10 million in a year. all the game industry would be looking at classic wow and trying to emulate what exactly makes it good. 
---
You mean exactly like 14 years ago and all those "wow killer MMO" did?
---
I told mine that all spells and skills are sent 5 times per second. She understood after that.
---
* I don't really know the exact interval, but it's simple enough to understand.
---
Your mom definitely sees this as a relapse lol.
---
May I ask what program you use to make these?
---
Because if you watch these people's videos, their content is generally divided into 3 categories:
---
* wrong information, mistakes and tips&amp;trick that work on private servers, but did not work in vanilla - like the /sit macro for warrior to proc Enrage
---
* Just wrong information that is obvious once you look at some private server player performance data - "horde have more problem with threat in raiding" (not true, horde tanks do bonkers threat. If they are properly equipped+geared, they out-threat Ally even if you take Salvation into account).
---
* The really obvious things that everybody knows - "you have to interrupt this, because it does like really really a lot of damage".
---
It's just not well informed content. And you do not want these guys affecting development.
---
A shitty one. Basically a mashup of MS Paint and rectal cancer. Making these (believe it or not) is a hassle. I dont have money for a computer, so I make em on my tablet.
---
I remember getting lunch with her the day of BFA release (before we knew it sucked) and I explained that I had to leave after an hour or so to make it home for WoW. She rolled her eyes and said ‚Äúyou still play that game?‚Äù It‚Äôs been a long 15 years
---
The shitposting reminds me of the osrs community, I love it
---
Envious you had some foresight to save some screenshots... If I could browse the things i took screenshots of when I was younger? Oh man what a trip that would be. Very cool stuff :)
---
Well you're correct about Warcraft being a piecemeal lore allthough the major retconning only started with TBC. Before that Warcraft was actually pretty consistent except for some minor inconsistencies. But since Vanilla was around during 2004-2006, wouldn't it make most sense to use the "piece" that was most accurate at that time. Classic is Classic. It's an adventure into the past. Blizz is actively trying not to change things about Classic, that includes the lore. So it's just baffeling to me how you would bring up the retconned lore as cannon for Classic. It applies to retail, not to Classic.
---
I explained everything you got wrong. You can check it on the wikis. I know you wrote this spontaneously so some mistakes are bound to happen. Just don't call yourself a loremaster when your knowledge about lore is clearly lacking. It felt more like you played WC3 5 years ago and now tried to remember what actually happened there. You got the rough plot right, but the details tend to be wrong or important story details aren't even mentioned.
---
My friends pulled me into watching the current season of game of thrones with them, so I started on season 8 having never seen an episode before that. 
---
It‚Äôs dark as shit, how do people see what‚Äôs going on?
---
&gt; These guys would have a critical eye on the content 
---
Most of them are idiots and terrible at the game
---
I think you can rest easy on that point.   PServs already have something very similar to WCL.  Look up legacyplayers(DOT)com (not sure if links to pserv type stuff are allowed) to see the type of logging that is already available in a true 1.12 scenario.  There is no doubt in my mind similar or better functionality will be available for Classic.
---
Learning professions becomes available at lvl 5.
---
I'm not trying to rush it or anything, but the first time I played on bad internet and like a 50 dollar desktop in 07. It took me a year on my warrior. By the time I started getting my blue PvP set TBC was coming out. I kind of want to enjoy the game at 60. My girlfriend is duo leveling as a shaman with my warrior so I doubt we'll be slow. 
---
Getting to 60, then just dicking around on my alt hunter (best most practical alt imo) will be best.
---
Because they have no clue
---
Haha cool, thanks!

---
I will try the 8-9 day stretch with 15+ hours a day grind. Try to get ahead of the pack with paid vacation for 4 weeks total, so i can grind gear and gold in my own pase at 60. Will maby have a LAN during launch with my buddies aswell, to keep the hype going!

Kinda yea.

Ever since I got hooked on WoW and eventually went down the path of competitive games she got used to me no lifing stuff every now and then. She handles it well now.

playing PvE server is like having part of the game turned off.

Guys, group up to do the quests, it's really simple. You're gonna be competing for named kills and mobs anyway, just get a group going and knock out the quests fast. Yeah, you'll lose some grinding XP, but you can make up for that after you finish STV which just has a metric fuckton of quests.
---
Don't be shy - say, "invite please" if you see a group, or invite people yourself and say hello.  Most of the time people are happy to knock out objectives real fast and be on their way. Safety in numbers and even then most aspy of asperger gankers don't want to deal with a crowd of red...they want that lowly priest all by herself with a low mana bar.
---
They don't know what authentic is, so that's a problem off the bat
---
Unfortunately yes. Their critical eye is meaningless and many of them "played" vanilla far far far away from being someone that has any idea about the game.
---
These are so great!
---
God I wish that was me. I started full time bartending at my current job back in September so I‚Äôll only have a few days to work with.
---
Nooo I'll be away all weekend that weekend! Now I don't know if I want to get a lucky beta invite or if it would be easier not to get one lol.
---
How long does it take you to make one?
---
Clearing Naxx. That's what I missed out on in vanilla. Probably get rank 10 aswell. More than that will probably be too much for my current life. (Lottery jackpot might alter this statement)
---
We need more dogs.
---
Maybe because your Account is 19 days old and your Mom types like a 14 Year old in your Screenshot, no offense.
---
I am blowing three weeks at launch and then banking until the AQ war effort. I am prepared.
---
Yeah.. I would love to see a "perfect speedrun" done by 40+ people.. It would go down as a legendary feat in gameing!
---
I am sure there are thousands of small optemiziations you can do. If you have a party of waaay above average players you can probably start clearing end game dungeons as early as 55 and if you optimize the groups you can probably acquire a lot of pre-raid bis, attunements, firelords rep on crucial people by the time they hit 60.
---
I think they are just overhyping it because its a breeze in live but in classic it actually takes TIME. Maby one level or two here and there you have to stay 2-3 hours and farm mobs, or you do a couple of dungeons. Its not like your going to hit a brick wall. The streamers likes to be dramaqueens. And it also depends on when quests are getting added as many have stated in this thread already.
---
I think everyone is over thinking classic or maybe its just because I'm a hunter and I'm going to level with my milkshake in one hand with my feet kicked up on the desk while I watch the Harry Potter series again and lvl auto attacking while hitting mend pet every once in a while.

Critically misinformed eye, that is.

No guild bank? :(

oh the headache of organising the guild bank on alts...
---
it's important to remember that the lore didn't just begin with WoW, there's 3 RTS games (and a bunch of novels/comics etc.) that set up the story of the world. (of Warcraft)
---
(also some things from Warcraft 1, 2, and 3 were later retconned)
---
They want an authentic experience, but don't know what an authentic experience is because their idea of authentic is often incorrect or just plain janky private server bs.
---
This can be taken 2 ways:
---
Noobs stoning to org to tell 60s
---
Or
---
Stoning to defend your pride, knowing you may as well be trekking into your own doom.

I made a new account with a WoW themed name because I‚Äôm hype about classic. And my mom is pretty young all things considered (turning 41 this year) so she likes to think she‚Äôs still hip. Relax detective there‚Äôs no case to be solved here.

Yeah it spawns where mankrik's wife is.

Yes, it was the best surprise when it started to rain!
---
Loved this video back in the day. No, he won't be in classic, as he was an early, early placeholder for the boats. But you better throw a thanks to the wind every time those sails catch a breeze.
---
Seconded. I took a 5-6 years break from WoW when Cata ended, to focus on my career and RL and stuff. I really thought those things matter more than a game. Wrong, heh. I do have a fancy job title in a fancy company now, and I think I needed to get there to realize that it's NOT more meaningful than a game. I resubscribed in September.
---
WoW's lore got me reading H.P. Lovecraft stories, so it got me interested in some classic horror literature. I made some friends I still talk to 10-12 years later. And I too still remember my first Deadmines run in elaborate detail, to this day. These things mean more to me than some forms or emails or team meetings at the office.
---
Meaning is subjective. Just do what you can and want and ignore society's dictations. "Think for yourself, question authority" - Timothy Leery.
---
Undead rogues are popular for a reason.
---
lol there is no way it worked like that in retail vanilla

2 druids means more even distribution of gear / less wasted purples.

If you don‚Äôt have money for a computer does that mean you‚Äôre putting out all this great humor and you are t even able to play wow when it‚Äôs finally here?
---
Nope. I have watched every classic content creator I can find on YouTube including every episode of Classicast multiple times to build my hype and they are definitely not the /sit crowd. They have said on multiple occasions that the /sit for enrage and reckoning is not a vanilla thing and will almost certainly not be in the game. If they talk about it, it's usually in the context of playing on a private server where the bug exists and they are fully aware it is not "working as intended". The "horde have more of a problem with threat in raiding" is not saying horde are inferior for threat, just that when a guild first starts raiding, salvation buffs are hugely beneficial.
---
I haven't seen anything from MrGM so I can't comment on his views, but you seem to have a hate-on for these guys that is unfounded. Of all the classic content creators, they are the ones who I feel most comfortable with speaking for the community.

 **Goblin Smasher** is level 6 for tauren, its from a lvl 12 quest. [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=765](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=765)
---
We generally don't look at the current state of cars and say: "Gee, these cause a lot of waste, pollution and congestions - let's ditch them, go back to riding horses and then figure out how to create a better mode of transportation based on THAT." This would neither be efficient nor practical, especially in a material world, limited mostly by time and resources.
---
But... we humans have the unique ability of foresight. We can assess the current situation and imagine (based on past experiences and logic) where this might take us in the future. Then, if we don't like the potential outcome, we can adjust our behavior to change things. In this regard, we truly _are_ the engineers of our own fate.
---
(Our *willingness* to actually *commit* to these changes, well, that's an entirely different story...)
---
When it comes to Classic, simply emulating Vanilla and copy-pasting 99% of its original features is neither an evolution nor progress, on the contrary. But that doesn't really matter here, as Classic was never meant to be a remaster or an update to begin with.
---
...unfortunately.
---
If Blizzard had used the current state of the game with its modern engine, many QoL features and detailed world building and if they had reworked the core gameplay based on lessons learned from Vanilla, producing a game that pays tribute and honors its roots instead of trying to cookie-cutter reproduce a past experience which can never be reproduced - well, THEN we'd be moving forward.
---
This would feel so much more natural and organic - because that's how life works and how it has worked for hundreds of millions of years. There is hardly anything more basic (and essential) for us humans than progressing forward. The moment we stop moving forward, we lose.
---
Of all the words you could use to describe these guys: "critical eye"

is probably the least accurate you could have chosen.

I don‚Äôt trust Blizzard and their whack ass servers even during the first week!

How a multi billion dollar company can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt fix issues that have been plaguing the game since the 2nd expansion will always puzzle me...

RIP, I personally wouldn't have recommend skipping the best seasons to these last 2. But least you get to see cool battles and dragons in action. The night is dark and full of terrors, the writing quality fell drastically over the last 3 seasons.
---
They're correct.
---
You could climb the meeting stones too! And using this method you could get on top of the entrance to Karazhan. I would do that and snipe horde while I waited for raids to start.
---
It's more fun and how the game is supposed to be played as, with friends!
---
Me, my GF and some friends have played a bit now on Yarr Harr servers and it's super fun! It's very boring to lvl alone compared to lvling with friends.
---
That was just that one episode. Most aren't that dark
---
People in these screens are rank 10+, some have AV 2h mace. Its just obvious that this server is very old. Hence the ppl running around ganking meaninglessly. If you have a decent speed and dont jump people, horde and alliance will live in harmony the first months untill Phase 2. At that point you are 60 and can compete against most classes. I dont see this "im to old for this shit", to mee it seems you are scared. Like what does a 5-10min corpserun do to you? just ress behind a tree, mount away and the danger is gone. PVE server to me seem so stale and seems like a job where there is nothing that excites you. Thats my two cents thou.
---
And can you max profs on a level 5?
---
Female
---
Tailoring/LW(during leveling for instant cash)/Herb for cash farming at 60
---
Standard leveling spec / SM Ruin at 60 / Soul Link to fuck with people out in world PVP / Succy Soulfire spec to also fuck with people in world PVP
---
Any guild in the beginning to level and get Pre-BIS...then find a raiding guild or stay in guild if it turns into a raiding guild
---
I remember that guild!! The RP on Defias Brotherhood was amazing.
---
I'm all for playing as optimally as possible, but this is just overdoing it lol
---
For the last two years
---
This meta bullshit is only tangentially related to wow in any way. Good job mods, you guys are killing it lately.
---
Not in 1.12, not grindy at all. Plenty of quests and a lot of fun in dungeons! It does take time compred to retail though.
---
Gold cap in Vanilla was 2\^31 - 1 = 2147483647 copper. Internally, all money values are represented as copper. The division into Gold, Silver, and Copper is simply a display issue. So a Bid cap of 2 billion copper is perfectly reasonable. As for nobody getting to the Gold Cap, there have been a few who've achieved it. The earliest I was able to find after a google search was someone in late 2007, followed a few months later by someone in January 2008.
---
What u/Vandegroen said is the truth from what I understand. 1.12 is 1.12, but late game content will be released in phases. Quests related to AQ, ZG, Naxx etc will be released with that raid ofc.
---
No harm really. I find these sort of posts interesting just to see creative min/max approaches. Though I think planning things out to such a degree ruins the fun of leveling by exploring for those that do it. It's their choice though. And maybe they've leveled a million characters in vanilla/private so just want to get it done fast.
---
All I'm planning out is my name, race, and class. And been thinking on professions, but no decisions made. As a vanilla player with no pserver use, I'm going in blind'ish to relive as much of the original experience as possible.
---
Watch the video, he definitely says aint.
---
Autoshot weaving is dumb. Just cast aimed between 2 autoshot. However, hitting melee hit between autoshot requires perfect timing resulting in 10% (roughly) dps increase
---
I don't even get a shout-out?

Fucking banned.
---
you wanna talk immersion?
---
hard mode: RP-PvE server and stay in character at all times.
---
expert mode mode: RP-PvP server (if Blizzard does them) and stay in character at all times while getting mercilessly ganked in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Hell mode: RP-PvP server, AND you can't camp the corpse of a ganker with your buddies for revenge, because that is meta-gaming, in character they are "dead" and in character you don't "know" where the enemy is.
---
&gt;horde tanks do bonkers threat. If they are properly equipped+geared, they out-threat Ally even if you take Salvation into account 
---
Why is that? Windfury? I've always heard that with Salvation, Alliance tanks have a much easier time with threat, but i don't know from a numbers perspective.
---
Priest won't be my main, but when I eventually do roll one, how much am I losing if I go Nelf instead of dwarf? My big priest fantasy is popping out of stealth to mind control someone off of an AB cliff or the chain in BRM. However, if I don't get invited to raids or am significantly weaker in certain matchups because I lack fear ward, idk if it's worth it. Please explain to me the value I'm giving up if I roll the lowest rated race for the class where race might matter the most. Thanks!
---
retail is MUCH more of a grind than vanilla. Because all you do is force your self for very very small rewards all the time, instead of working for something big.
---
I did not hear it here first, I heard it in my brain first =)
---
Difficult to want an authentic experience that they've never played.
---
I'd rather eat my own tongue
---
Couldn't agree more. So many posts about rushing to 60... I am excited as the next guy about classic, but this ain't retail. Enjoy the ride, folks! I will be going out of my way to get side-tracked lol
---
I really wish it wasn't them (Classicast guys). At least 2 of them (realistically all 3 probably - but  I'm not sure about staysafe) are just in it to milk it like theres no tomorrow. They have close to zero knowledge about actual vanilla (no, shitty private servers don't count. there's such a large number of things wrong on privat server's it will be a shock for a lot of those people when we get real authentic servers). They spread a lot of misinformation and it feels like they are just paid shills at this point. I dont wanna talk any more bad about them, I would probably do the same if I were them. 
---
Then again I'm in general really against the "streamer early access" stuff thats happening for literally every game nowadays.
---
That isn't true at all, especially for a game that's getting a fresh launch. With all the players we're going to have, it'll be easier than ever to find people to help you with your quests.
---
They probably invited more than just the classicast guys though
---
If this event was anything like the 8.2 event Blizz held a few weeks ago then this is purely for hype/PR rather than actual constructive feedback, basically doing marketing for Blizzard.
---
I do not like any of their faces

I see zero swords and boards; nice!

Who is he??

That DOG ref - ur a good boy

The quest chain can be started at level 5  [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=749](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=749). Classicdb's minimum level is just a log of the lowest character to have ever accepted the quest, not necessarily the minimum level that it requires. I've tested this on numerous quests over a few different servers over the last few months and it's always a little different. I looked at a few different private servers for this quest specifically and they were all available at level 5.
---
They are being relied on for content

How can you remove something that wont exist in classic?

*my mom and dad were perfect*
---
Racist? I said the country of Finland sucks. I didn‚Äôt say anything enshrined about the Finnish people. I did make an observation that Finnish people pretend they are Scandinavian, which they are not. 
---
Actually if you look up a list of famous Finnish people, you will find that many of them have high accolades from fields ranging the hard science, theology, and sports! I have nothing against Finnish people, quite the opposite actually!
---
But Finland as a country, that place suck balls.

How is this racist?

Hey do you know if the bfa raids will be removed in Classic ?

This better not be true. I'll be at EDC in Vegas from the 15th thru the 22nd...

Would you really save time thou, attempting a level 12 quest on level 5 ? Sure there will be other people in that mine, but its packed with mobs, wont you pull aggro left to right ?

Unless you are leveling in a group, but if you are you wont need that weapon upgrade as much.

Are we making Dwight a hardcore classic raider?
---
Yeah.  This community is fairly devoted so it can be tough to see but I've got something like 3000 days played across various eq servers (and no, not bazaar time) and frankly eq in its heyday (classic to velious or pop being generous) is absolutely dogshit when you can't commit serious time blocks.  If you have all day It's one of the finest experiences out there though.
---
...retriever?
---
did you play on tich?
---
Why gatekeeping so hard? Lmao
---
.............................That‚Äôs what she said! LOL
---
..... Are you going.... To play classic on your tablet...?
---
That's fair lol I really enjoy analyzing all of the data of a certain topic and then making a conclusion. One thing I found really interesting with this research was the difference in each starting zones quests. In Mulgore you can choose 5 or 6 different leveling routes because of the lack of quest chains from 5-10 but as for Teldrassil, it's so linear with prerequisites for nearly every quest, you can't really travel off the beaten path. The game design of Vanilla always peaks my interest.
---
So if popular Billybob steamer and his swarm of fans want to ruin our balance, we should do nothing? If 50 people want to play alliance while 0 want to play horde, that is a bad thing. I am okay with this system ruining things like that for the sake of balance. 
---
But things must be adaptable, what if this system was in use only during the launch mania? To establish balanced servers in the beginning and then give way to the free transfer method you suggest take place.
---
I have what I presume is an unpopular, perhaps faulty opinion that isn't really fully-formed but here goes.
---
I don't think greed killed gaming, at least not in the way it's portrayed. I'm not sure greed is really implemented in very much of gaming. I know, I know, on Reddit there's the "DAE HATE EA?!" but I think people miss the mark because we're so pumped full of emotion about things anymore.
---
We like to talk about how games used to be you'd buy the game, and you'd play it forever. One price and you're done. But people conveniently omit that this isn't the 90s or even early 2000s. This is an era of hyper-connectivity, and when you have a delivery method where additional content can - and has - been provided to expand a game virtually with no end, it has become an expectation. One of the big qualifiers of a game is that it has replay value. That has become "WILL IT HAVE DLC?!" It's expected.
---
Bethesda sold a completed game. Then they tried something new along the lines of "Hey we know this is unorthodox and weird, but our team put together some stuff you might like as a bonus for the game. We'd like to deliver it to you for a few dollars if that's okay." It wasn't necessary to play the game, but was something crafted by the developer itself to work within the game. That is the sort of thing that our Jekyll/Hyde minds both seem to crave but then revile when there is a dollar sign attached to it. We want more content, but we want it for free. We expect people to take their talents and organization and give us something without recompense.
---
I mean, just look at Destiny. People find things to nitpick about, and then despite Bungie busting their balls to fix things and get them to where the noisemakers of the community have shouted angrily that they should be, the community demands that expansion be made free "as an apology". There's weird entitlement in a lot of gaming.
---
I think greed label can be placed on the neck of gamers themselves. People flock to F2P games because hey, I don't have to pay for it. Someone comes along and asks that their work be paid for, we break out pitch forks because now our entertainment costs something. That, to me, is toxic and indeed the definition of greedy. We shriek "COMPANIES JUST WANT TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE!!" like it's some terrifying concept, but out the other side of the mouth is, "I WANT TO PLAY GAMES AND SPEND AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE!" Also normal, but that sentiment is lauded.
---
Player greed has deformed gaming. We're getting away from the idea that content has value.
---
I see you were a fan of warrior alts aswell üëå
---
I heard they showed Tips retail and he didn't notice the difference.
---
It's not tragic. It's just the way times change.
---
There‚Äôs almost 0 chance they‚Äôre being invited for any kind of development related feedback. It‚Äôs almost certainly just because they‚Äôre the popular content creators. They‚Äôre likely sitting in a room being told they will have the first beta keys and they can stream it. Probably being told what to do and what kind of ways they can promote classic to reach the biggest audience. That kind of stuff
---
This is from Blizz forums:
---
" 
---
I come to you with the biggest thing we have ever seen. I asked Towelliee ‚ÄúGoing with the North Korean Narrative, how hyped should we be about that wonderful trip?‚Äù
---
What is the North Korean Narrative? Yesterday while in Irvine StaySafe tweeted saying his viewers located him in North Korea. Many people including Towelliee were in Irvine yesterday. MrGm as we know tweeting about it and spilling the beans a bit.
---
To quote him exactly since I can not link the clip (thanks Blizz).
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so hyped that things are going to be happening so fast, and your gonna be like‚Ä¶ wut?‚Äù
---
If you wanna hear it yourself, go to 1:10:24 on his current stream. I also clipped it."
---
LET ME IN !!!!
---
I use a few add-ons in BFA. but for Classic, until I hit 60, I'm going to go without. true #NoChanges experience.
---
(also that will give the add-on devs some time to work out the bugs)
---
BITE THE PILLOW IM GOIN IN DRY
---
It's obviously not the horde tanks that are the problem, but the horde dps that are doing more threat because of lacking salvation.
---
Just slap my name in the next GIF, but make sure it's somehow relevant.
---
But I was just kidding plz don't do that.
---
Why are these clowns going instead of people that actually know what they are talking about?
---
More complex than spamming one button.
---
Why are they not inviting someone like Joanna who has leveled to 60 as his religion to play it? He would have more useful feedback than a hype man
---
You're not flagged automatically for PVP in The Barrens.
---
Beat me to it.
---
The scenario I picture in my head is you getting out of Camp Narache before everyone else and completing the first wave of quests in Bloodhoof Village before everyone. By this time your level 6 and you normally hit that Ravaged Caravan quest at the end of that first wave of quests. Then you convince 4 other warriors to complete the quest with you because of the weapon upgrade and then disband and continue leveling through the zone. Lol with the right coordination I think it could ensure that you level ahead of the pack and never get caught by "the wave" on a fresh launch.
---
Can 12 days girl time be converted to boy time for me? I can't quite get the conversion down for whether I should be impressed or scared.

Probably choosing by their own audience size rather than merit
---
If I remember correctly there was one called James Alliance Leveling guide...or something like that.
---
This is just a dream scenario thou, its not really realistic. Who know what RNG you will have camping spawn points.
---
It's super easy if you save the lifesteal skull from the senjin village zalazane quest. It eats like half of his hp and heals you.
---
Oh man I wonder what the first raid is gonna be! What the new max level is ü§§
---
Which is garbage i wish I was hired based on my audience size instead of my merit
---
more useful feedback maybe... but not a huge draw of watching fans
---
playing non-RP servers is like taking the RP out of MMORPG
---
WSG: Druid flag carrier.
---
AB: Holy paladin. Healing and cleansing is very powerful and changes the tides of fights, and holy paladin is by far the most difficult healer to kill or shut down. Unlike other healers a holy paladin can heal and survive very well under pressure without teammate assistance.
---
Holy paladin obviously relies on their team to do damage so on a truly terrible team other classes will perform better. But if on a truly terrible team you aren't winning no matter what you do so it doesn't matter.
---
Sounds like an echo chamber :(
---
&gt; My point was that an enhancement shaman is not a charity case, he can earn his keep like everyone else. 
---
Enh shamans don't actually do 500 DPS in prebis. They might do 100-200. If you could do 500 DPS in prebis enh shaman would be primary DPS class, obviously that isn't the case. And in the realistic 100-200 dps case you are not earning your keep, you are deadweight.
---
The context of the ‚Äúsituation‚Äù clearly indicates he ‚Äúain‚Äôt chicken‚Äù because he dove right in.
---
Yeah, that's all it is. I'm sure some conversations happened, but ultimately this sort of thing is for publicity. Besides, Blizzard is getting ready for launch. The time for feedback is pretty much over for now.
---
If I get beta release for my birthday, I will be overjoyed.  Fingers crossed
---
Agree. TipsOut is a farce.
---
&gt;horde tanks do bonkers threat
---
why is that?
---
i was wondering this, i can't see any reason why horde tanks would do more threat other than a bit of windfury dps which is pretty irrelevant?
---
sounds like BS to me
---
Racials are enough a difference to make you switch?
---
If you look at the little grey line you can see he isn't replying to you, just a friendly headsup.
---
really cause it violates some code of conduct if you choose to RP on a non RP server... Considering the RP you are referring to is completely voluntary. 
---
Where the RPG from a game just means you are roleplaying a character type. How do you explain RPG games that have no choice of dialogue you are just following a story script is that some how not RP?
---
Sorry, I just completely disagree. It takes less than a day after hitting max level to get gear good enough to raid current content or get into mythic+. Whereas in vanilla you had to progress through each raid to get up to current content because catchup mechanics weren‚Äôt a thing. I believe you‚Äôre mistaking grind for hamster-wheel-RNG.
---
lol if you go into Venture Co. Mine at level 6 on a fresh launch, no one else is going to be there xD   same goes with Vagash in Dun Morogh.
---
Honestly, there's no reason to downvote substance-based speculation that is appropriately qualified as speculation.  It drives me nuts when people rage about speculation that fails to materialize.  It's the nature of speculation; until it's happened, things can change.  Hell, "official announcements" sometimes fail to materialize because of unexpected events - and yet speculation is expected to be ironclad or else that means it was a baseless lie lol.
---
At least try to spellcheck, dear lord.
---
Lol that might not work out so well for my large audience of me, myself, and I.  Agree though, hopefully they targeted somewhat of a mix at least.
---
If the pre armor Epic mounts are in(which they should be) I need to rush that Ivory Raptor! :D

i wonder if kargoz will be there.  he'll probably be saying "but... warriors in full t3 and using tons of engineering items and the helmet from gnomeregan on its huge cd can aoe tank stratholme better than palas!!!1!"
---
guy talks so much crap
---
what misinformation do they spread?  just curious
---
In PR your audience size is your merit.
---
You could just make timer outside of the game for the same effect. That‚Äôs how other long run speedruns work. No point in doing some math that could be inaccurate to back into the time.
---
SS should be in the highest tier since it's intentionally applied debuff that is not a dot. So it will overwrite things like gift of arthas and other DPS boosts that are procs.
---
Holy shit
---
Fearz sounds really familiar.  Did you kill people in Org all the time?  There was a rogue that everyone always talked about on the forums.
---
are you just talking out of your ass?  
---
Esfand was a raider in vanilla WoW and Staysafe was also an avid player during vanilla,  having obtained one of the pre 1.4  unarmoured  mounts.
---
Probably was.  But remember back then there were a lot more keyboard turners than there are now ;)
---
This is......wait for it.......CLASSIC!
---
Where does he mention raids?
---
Don't watch the office. Love thess
---
You'll probably have to do a little more raveling and hit up as many quests/dungeons as possible to make up for the exp loss from kills but you'll be fine. You'll be able to chain kill mobs, have super low downtime, and you'll rarely have to skip an elite quest. Additionally, PvP will be a breeze and as long as you're not all DPS, dungeons groups will be nearly instant.
---
Highly recommend that you guys roll tank, healer, and DPS of course but at the very least try and split up gear types so you guys can trade greens and not fight over dungeon drops. Rogue/Hunter/Druid for example would be a huge pain but something like Warrior, Hunter, Priest would have very little overlap.
---
no not really. I like horde as there is always less drama as horde. More of the youngsters roll alliance as they see horde as big baddies :D

Is he the guy in the canyon in durotar with all the kodos? My memory is a little hazy.

He probably went on a rant how is this authentic vanilla experience until he realised that he was shown KOTOR.
---
If you really have 2-4 per day, go PvP 100%. Otherwise roll PvE. You wouldn't want to spend half of your time corpserunning. Also look further than 6 months into your future daily available hours. If it's still the same as now, PvP.
---
That could be true. Then maybe 60-80% of the remaining will get max.
---
And so it has begun.

can we stop this "private servers are nothing like vanilla" meme? there only difference between classic and private servers will be that classic will be easyer (besides a few bugfixes that are common on private servers). the raids will be the same (but easyer) and the leveling will be the same (but easyer)

I wasn't referring to all the content creators invited in that statement.

---
Do you mean sharding?  Phasing is thing think they introduced in WotLK where a zone would slowly change as you did quests, getting to it's final phase upon completion of the quest line then everyone would be in that phase.  Incidentally, that shouldn't be in classic as there was no phased content in vanilla.
---
Sharding, on the other hand, is the practice of diving players into micro-severs where you can be on your sever with someone else and both in Boralus and still not see them because you're in a different shard.
---
If that's what you mean, my understanding is that sharding is basically eliminated from classic.  I believe the current plan is to have a limited about of sharding in the starter zones for launch (just to mitigate the CRUSH of characters starting out) and then, at some point it fades away to no sharding at all.  The exact details (zones, levels, and whether it will always be in place or just for launch) have not been announced afaik.
---
Hi, /u/cabaq
---
Is this the Dark Storms quest?
---
And this is why I think I'm gonna roll on a PvE server for the first time. I respect PvP for what it is, and 14yo me would have joined you, but I have kids and a ~50hr/wk job now. I don't have time for dealing with getting camped outside BRM when I only have a couple hours to play.
---
Alternately, having chicken explains why he was afk during the explanation. They didn't have KFC delivery drones back in the day.
---
alliance tanks ahve a higher skill floor but a lower skill skill ceiling while horde tanks have a lower skill floor but a higher skill ceiling.
---
So youre just gonna lump all classic youtubers into one category based on a couple of vague discrepancies?  Kinda unfair if you ask me.  I get that this subreddit has some hate towards content creators because their content gets stale but people being worried about them affecting development is ridiculous, if anything their voices on social media has helped more than hurt.
---
I see. I guess I‚Äôll take these classic creators info with a grain of salt until classic actually releases
---
Very funny man. Had me rolling
---
There is no way that you can get coldridge hammer at level 6. It is a level 12 elite. You would have to have a higher level come kill it for you.... It is exactly the same as planning to kill hogger at level 6.
---
Your point is right, but let's not act like people pay "a few cents" every so often in mobile games. They are a success because people throw money at them.
---
That‚Äôs your opinion. Wpvp still happens on non pvp servers. There are guilds who required people to be flagged at all times on my server in vanilla. What is fun for you may not be fun for me.   I can‚Äôt wait to not be on a pvp server. I just wanna level in peace.

I don‚Äôt understand the meme but still rate it 10/10

1-2 minutes tops would only allow for one bandage which only happened if I missed a stun and died early. Usually two blinds got me two bandages. Gotta try to catch them without barkskin, cold blood eviscerate and hope I have enough of a lead. Rarely did I. 
---
1-2 minutes or 5. The point is: raid druid(with tier 3) will beat a pvp rogue with T2 in my experience.
---
Don't know how it would be T3 v T3 but I'm not sure if it would improve my chances beyond 50/50
---
Note: I was not an engineer nor did I use consumables outside of bandages.

So for your Orc vs Troll comparison, can't either race just train the other weapons thus putting them on even ground? I know weapon trainers can be found in Org, perhaps there are more outside of Org?

You don‚Äôt queue for dungeons. Lying into a role will not be appreciated. But you can heal or tank most if not all dungeons as other specs. I would be honest about that. Don‚Äôt forget to get int gear as healer! If you don‚Äôt it‚Äôll end up in kicks for sure at higher levels.

&gt; AH Categories returned to old style, 2 level categories, from 3 levels.
---
I wonder if this includes the dead categories that matched no items (e.g. cloaks other than cloak, jewellery outside of Miscellaenous, etc.). and were basically UI clutter. I wouldn't mind them not making it back.
---
isn't that convenient.  
---
Also,  even if a content creator never experience an authentic experience, that does not mean that it is difficult for them to want or advocate for an authentic experience.
---
I am in the same predicament. Except that... 1.) We will be playing on a PvP server.  2.) Comp will be Warrior/Holy Pal/Mage or Warlock or Rogue.

I am trying to push the third to be a Mage so that the AoE grind with a pocket Holy Paladin will be a breeze.

Just go look at Artifact if you want to know why you dont rely on content creators for criticism of your game.

Because I said there isn't any reason for them to focus on it? There isn't. They could go do it right now if they wanted. They care about "cutting edge" and pushing new content that requires work and figuring out a strategy before anyone else.

Only Paladins would try to complete this quest at level 6 because of the 2h mace. Get a group of 5 pallys together and bounce around aggro with a couple of rank 2 Holy lights? No one said it would be easy but its a possibility :D

Yes, also has an imp

Also the shaman windfury totem does not benefit Druids. So Alliance Druids are definetly better if you take the pala/shammy thing into account.

I believe you can still get a box for BFA
---
I mentioned I played classic,I actually raided through AQ I know you don't que for dungeons, I meant raid healing. where they mostly just want druids to spam low rank healing touch and innervate priests/brez
---
No, but I do see the appeal now that I have limited (very limited my toon on P99 is only level 9 right now) vision into the older style. 
---
For example, in EQ and its ilk questing isn't really a big thing (ironic given its name). There are some and a lot of turn in quests which aren't bad but you're mainly hunting monsters. There is something to be said about making friends because you're in a group camping an area with like 6 mobs and after you kill them sitting down whilst you wait for them to respawn. But I can also see how that would get boring as fuck; spending a couple hours killing the same six mobs over and over again. 
---
This is where WoW went "casual" by giving you a more linear progression based on quests. Sometimes I think they went too far, even in vanilla. The whole game is quests, which is why it's a "theme park" MMO. I don't mind story quests in a zone or that span zones (think the Defias stuff that starts in Elwynn and goes into Westfall) but I think they went too far with quests everywhere. 
---
Would it be somehow better if you had to group up constantly?  If say those gnoll camps in Westfall were a great source of XP but you needed a group and had to sit waiting for them to respawn for a couple hours?  I can't say. It would be a totally different dynamic than what we're used to, that's for sure.  Better?  Who knows. 
---
I guess my point is that both sides have interesting viewpoints that make sense. There is something missing about WoW, even vanilla, that existed in the older MMOs. There is stuff in the older games that feel very outdated and likely only existed due to technical limitations of the time.
---
Why is the need to sell to everyone your personnal choice when it comes to a server type? 
---
I don't understand the point, it's not like you're getting  some revenues out of it or gathering members of a cult.
---
Pve and pvp servers are 2 differents tastes and the bette choice is the one that fits you, period.
---
What's that religious fervor of wanting people to follow you way be it pve or pvp?
---
If more people would mind their business i think the whole world would be brigther.
---
Why do you need to be a dick about someone else fun and goal?
---
I kinda just want to play 1 character in classic (not counting bankchars or w/e). Its probably going to be a hunter. Im not sure what professions to pick. Herbalism sounds like a yes and skinning maybe while leveling? I m not sure about what second professions to pick. Thought about leatherworking too but alchemy sounds like its free $$ combined with the herbalism i wanna pick 100%. So questions is Herbalism + Alchemy or Herbalism + Leatherworking? (on a Hunter thats going to be the only 60 char for me)
---
Apply that to anything. Some people will always want to see X fail to justify their position.
---
That makes sense. I don't think hard equates to good. There has to be enough ease to buy in, mainly because we all have outside priorities. However, not so much that the experience has to be provided on a legendary silver platter and fluffed. Slogs are part of the fun of life. Let us work at least enough to break a sweat. 
---
On another note, I like how empty CLASSIC is, environmentally speaking. Flashy ideas at every turn isn't a turn on. At some point it all looks like icing. Some monotony is necessary, so that when you see the next big thing (Ironforge for example), the player is left awestruck. 
---

Which streamers? Proof of them saying that?
---
I had a 60 Shaman/Warrior/Druid/Hunter in Classic.  The Shaman probably took the longest of the 4 but it was also my first character of the game.  It was also created just as they had released BWL.  Or perhaps right before.  
---
Warrior and Druid were leveled with a coworker... (warrior/priest) and (druid/hunter) so the leveling was super easy and quick.  The Hunter I leveled in 5 days, maybe 2 days played in game total so about 48 hours.  This was a week prior to BC being released.  So it would of had the most quests offered at the time and probably had a lot of QoL changes.
---
They don‚Äôt really, OP is correct on many of his points but might be misinformed on this. Windfury helps some, but it is mostly offset by paladin blessings might/kings and human sword specialization (orc have axes but most tanking 1h‚Äôs including thunderfury are swords).
---
I have a kid and work 40-50 hrs a week too. I don't mind being camped because I'll have a whole guild behind me that will want to wpvp. And I can always res at the spirit healer and just take a 10 minute break or work on a tradeskill or something.
---
This is amazing! To the top with you!
---
For the last 12 years...
---
if you want why not.. lol
---
You might misguide ppl putting it like that, the fact is these quest accessible from lvl5 or 6, it doesn mean its lvl 5 quest rewards... these quests are much higher level. 
---
just straight up say, in the first sentence and clear it out, that your strategy involves doing high level quests at low levels and getting rewards above your level.
---
in my opinion its completely not worth the hussle and doesn't matter, in ideal condition 6-10 takes literally like 40 minutes. and how much time you spend doing this quest like that? its not worth it, its better to level naturally and get to this quest when it happens, than forcing them. 
---
and lets say you even did them in group wasted like 20 minutes, then what? you came back doing lvl 6 quests? by that time it all will be filled with ppl and will be much harder to do. 
---
its really not about weapons at early levels. but about staying head, that snowballs. you can't take some side time doing some quest for a weapon that will serve you literally for 40 minutes... or that you would get like in 30 minutes anyways if you'd level normally.
---
its ridiculous, especially considering that at lvl11 you can get +4stam crossroads staff from that easy thunderbluff delivery quests, which is better anyways.
---

The point is to usually get enchanting for a bank alt to DE garbage stuff as you can list the dust on AH for free.
---
A good pally plus warrior/mage is really deadly.
---
It would make sense since 2,147,483,648 is the max for a signed 32-bit int, where in-game it looks like: 214,748 Gold 36 Silver 48 Copper.
---
200k gold is just a neater number for the user to understand since most people aren't programmers.
---
Yup that's how it works when you actually depend on others to succeed with stuff.
---
Apply yourself to the task and be a good guy. Rest  will work out just fine.

HAHAHAHA, I'm his raid leader.

It definitely is competition, especially for your time.

No proof, no upvote...

JK I UPVOTED
---
This sub reddit is banking on it to succeed. Several people in other gaming communities and even retail players take the "You think you do, but you won't" mindset.
---
True, but how do you even define fail in this situation. Simply having the game available for me and my few wow classic friends is a huge win in my books.
---
Prot pallies are great in 5 mans, specifically strat and scholo

"creators"
---
Jesus thnx man. Never though that was a option. He is tough AF. Always LFG for that stulid quest.
---
His streams are abysmal. He should stick to scripted content.
---
In gold shire
---
Obviously. It's a defense mechanism as they require self soothing due to their fear of retail being eclipsed.
---
Come on man.
---
Yeah, that is the most important.  Playing what you love.  I was on the fence for Druid vs Holy Paladin because early Paladin leveling sucks.  But it won't be so bad in a group I figure and it might be my only opportunity to have a group to carry me through that early game haha.
---
Are you doing the Feral or Paladin or Lock?
---
To add to the pot, last week, I know of one classic creator that was sent an email by Blizzard asking to confirm their Battlenet id.
---
OP - these Office gifs are all great but this one is easily the best so far. Well done, I'm actually laughing out loud on a train and getting looks from strangers.
---
You're making the "Wait for the Date" a little more bearable.
---
It does. There is a classic settings button, however.
---
I thought Towelliee hated classic
---
I use the starter 2H hammer until I get Coldridge Hammer at level 8.
---
Ho this was not really clear, and the rampant elitism in this sub makes me paranoid ! Take care ! I wish you luck with your guild :)
---
This is my main issue when it comes to changes, the trust. In all the chnage or OSRS threads where people start to argue about what should be changed, no one seem to remember that it ultimately is done by Actiblizz.
---
It's more of a response to the equally rabid and irrational people claiming that classic is going to be even more successful than it was 14 years ago and will crush retail.
---
I play Priest on Horde, but I can't imagine how oppressive obsessive min-maxers are over giving people shit for choosing anything but Dwarf on Alliance for Priests. \*\*The most important thing about your character is that you like it\*\*. If making a NE priest is what makes you happiest, then roll the NE Priest and tell people who say "hurr you should have rolled a Dwarf because Fear Ward" to fuck off. 
---
Shadowmeld is such an underrated ability imo (at least from my Horde perspective) in terms of what you can do while leveling, avoiding confrontation, surprising people, etc.
---
Gotcha idk what meme bias you were referring to. I like all of those as well but idk I feel deadmines is up there with them. Not necessarily better but still up there. I also liked sunken temple because of the atmosphere the dungeon gave off.
---
And when they do, the entire class fantasy of a plate melee healer is shattered since you have to wear cloth/leather for 80% of the gear. It fucking sucks. Out of all the things in Vanilla that suck, itemization is the worst. Don't even care about all the meme specs, what I hate most is the terrible itemization.
---
Old man here.....Wtf is tinder???
---
I'm sure I have them somewhere in the abyss that is my basement.
---
They might have been invited, for content they can use in videos, so they can release the videos at the same time as the announcement. Kinda similar to what happened in Fortnite with the "Creative" mode. A bunch of streamers were invited, they all made videos and were told to not release them until Epic games had announced the mode.
---
What happened was that one guy accidentally didn't set his video to private when he uploaded it to youtube, so it was leaked before the announcement.
---
OH look, it's this thread again.
---
Maybe you can mark someone with your hunters mark :D
---
Yeah, I'm not giving ya shit or anything. You gotta know what the possibilities are when you play on a PvP server. I used to love WPvp and thought that PvE players were soft (and maybe they/we are) but I think I've come around. If I only have two hours or so a night to play after the kids are in bed and I have to waste 30m ghost running or if I have to skip quests because of people roaming STV, I'd probably end up quitting and doing something else. 
---
I figure a PvE server will get me my Classic fix without the frustrations of a PvP server.
---
Additionally, this all really depends on the server sizes in Classic. I may just be jaded from 10k pop pservers where sometimes the game is borderline unplayable during peak hours in certain zones.
---
Pretty sure there‚Äôs a globe of Azeroth in Ulduar
---
It makes sense because the WoW Token costs almost 200k on retail, which is unachievable for all but maybe 5 people in all of Vanilla.
---
And I imagine it would be impossible to do a currency conversion of retail gold to vanilla gold. How would you even quantify or calculate that?
---
No i got the point of the picture.
---
I'm not trying to misguide people with this information, honestly just wanted people to go read full post I had already written out on [Classicwow.live](https://Classicwow.live). I think it's a lot more clear how difficult these quests after you analyze all of the data from all of the starting zones in that post.
---
Yes, yEs, yeS, YYYEEESSS!!!
---
So when Blizz had content creators out under NDA for 8.2, does anyone know how long it was between that meeting and when 8.2 hit the PTR?
---
Yeah, nobody's going to be soloing it. It's the hogger of Dun Morogh.
---
/1 killing Vagash in like 5 minutes, LFM.
---
BAM, you've got 4 more in your group in a heartbeat.
---
wasn't suppose to be i wanted him to think a stranger was being a dick to him for no reason. I knew his account, wasn't sure if he remembered mine cause he started to argue with me about the BWL comment.
---
Towelliee loves Classic since the moment he realized he can make a ton of money off it.
---
The quest line was so awesome from what I can remember. The feeling of doing the 4th Demon aged 14 was so cool.
---
Tips is awful though.
---
Like your egoistical response. The day vanilla ended the game kept growing, up to 12 million people. Yet the most requested thing over the 15 years was vanilla. So how does growth measure what people miss? The question should be about the threshold that one can reach when it comes to changes. So technically you told me and everyone that doesn't want changes to "fuck off". Just like we've been told from the very day we asked for Vanilla.
---
Years might pass but these people that leave for one reason or another will also ask for "true" vanilla WoW if OSRS approach is implemented. But as you said "nobody will miss them". 
---
Grow and appeal doesn't negate opinions, and enough opinions and desires eventually get big. Thats why people asked for Vanilla in a first place. Your argument is bad.
---
You land at the fp and see the boat already at the dock.
---
Only in the sense that reading is also competition for your time.
---
Given the shared sub there's likely to be a fair bit of toe dipping and in an ongoing sense both versions are available to everyone at the same time based only on preference. What competition is there? People will just play what they like. Even if you're worried about loosing community that's ridiculous, you only need about 4000 semi regular people to have an extremely healthy server community so even worst case unless you think there are less than 4000 people interested in whatever version you prefer in your region you'll still have an active healthy server community.
---
Didn't catch that!
---
Fellow old man here: you don't want to know.
---
I have never been as pale and skinny with an absolute horrendous posture as in 2005.

Good times.

I know, but with macros it wasn't really a problem changing.. And great fun to just one shot people..

Then blind&gt;sap&gt;bandage&gt;stealth&gt;gg

If you don't care who you play with that might be true but if you want to continually play with the same people it's a big problem.
---
Google ‚ÄúKnow your Lore‚Äù. It‚Äôs a great series of articles on WoW‚Äôs lore and offered some interesting perspectives on Horde and Alliance politics. You can google more specially too, for example, ‚ÄúKnow your Lore Tauren‚Äù and see what comes up. Loved these articles and still dig for them.

Holy shit you're right I just googled it

Thanks for the tip, I am so hyped

Baldur's Gate | US-PVP | Horde  
---
Raid Times: 7:00pm - 11:00pm (EST) Tue/Wed/3rd for progression
---
Baldur's Gate is an established gaming community that spans across multiple games. We found our roots in
---
Amazon's New World where we grew from a small unknown entity to being one of the top companies on the
---
Server. We are currently looking to expand into Classic wow. We are primarily a PvP community, but we
---
do not forget that PvE is essential, we will be pushing for server first kills with our raid group.
---
Baldur's Gate places a strong emphasis on reputation as such we strive to maintain a respectful and
---
welcoming atmosphere to both our members and the community as a whole. Baldur's Gate is a close knit
---
community where you are more than just a number on the battlefield.
---
We welcome all mature players looking to enjoy the game, our goal is build a massive community with a huge
---
pressence in the world. Raiding alliance city's, killing world bosses, taking over contested zones, assisting 
---
members of the horde, we are hardcore but welcome Casuals to join our Horde.
---
Feel free to send a PM if you're interested or have more questions.

We've gotten to the point where the barrier to entry for creating content is super low.  Given a relatively new audience, it's not surprise you'll end up with some crappy content creators to start out.  I'm just surprised he's stuck around as he's only gotten worse it seems, I used to find his videos tolerable at least when this subreddit started
---
Yeah agreed, but he said it so confidently I thought hmm maybe I'm missing something like Warchief's Blessing + troll tank + windfury, but I doubt that would even do it and would be very situational.

I'm going as balls deep as possible givin my job and responsibilities. That being said i work 9-5 and have no children and a low-key supportive wife I'll be hardcore just not as hardcore as was possible during vanilla. Was  senior year of HS and I moved to a new school, my girlfriend at the time lived an hour away. What was the point of making friends the year before everyone leaves? The girlfriend at the time did lay down an ultimatum saying I needed to spend more time with her. I did and pretty much gave up raiding. Worst mistake of my life. Girl ended up leaving me for a friend of mine from WoW.

It would probably be seen as a failure if servers start fizzling out before the later phases are even inplemented.

---
Not really, if anything you're quite late to the party. People have been discussing this in respective streamers Twitch chat among other places. So yeah, sorry little buddy.
---
by using a gun being a troll means a wasted racial, the bow racial isnt that worth because after rhok'delar you'll be using xbows only, and ranged skill isnt a big of a deal like melee because they dont glance and hunters can get hit capped easily anyways
---
&gt; Feel free to downvote me if I'm wrong and raising your hopes in vain.
---
No worries, I got you. I already downvoted.
---
Don't attack the plainstrider sitting in the middle of the road... It belongs to a night elf hunter who is shadowmelded behind a tree
---
Seriously, these are all amazing. Perfect on multiple levels.
---
I can taste the salt from here.
---
I can see how people get there.  You have to remember that classic was changed largely *because* of feedback and people complaining.  Particularly going into TBC.  
---
The complaints were all pretty valid, and led to a lot of "QOL" additions that really sucked the soul out of the game.
---
At the same time, classic was much simpler in terms of PvE.  Many classes had 1-2 button rotations in raids, for example.  
---
I don't agree with them, but if you look at both things it makes classic sound like a really simplistic but administratively challenging game, rather than challenging etc.
---
barrens is horde controlled

this would make sense if it were lakeshire or darkshire though

---
You just contradicted yourself by saying that pservers are buggy and different from vanilla. Yeah the discrepancies are minor when viewed 1:1 but when there are thousands of them it makes a difference overall.
---
You‚Äôre clueless

Lol I avoid them like the plague. Did they invite madseasonshow? Probably not.

How can you advocate an authentic experience if your version of authentic differs from reality?

I sure hope we are still able to get on the roof! I have so many memories of hanging out with folks up there. Or on the castle walls of Stormwind. A lot of my memories are hanging out with folks in places you weren't supposed to get to.

This guy is focusing way too much on stats... the reason you want a cat is for the almost double attack speed which absolutely BTFO any other stat in pvp... And in terms of pve, a raptor is still a better choice because more damage, more armour.

"Alright guyz, Blizz is targeting my stream."

If that were an objective statement, his view count would reflect that.

But we are all certainly entitled to our own opinions.
---
Absolutely.  I havent played since 2007/TBC launch but I'll be damned if I talk shit about retail.  
---
That's the most obnoxious and embarrassing point of any community:  the idea that we're better than anyone else.  We all eat, piss, shit, and go to work.  Few do much else.

Thanks mate, I'll check it out! I really want to get the standard up with some better effects and stuff. My first GIF (Made 24 hours ago) looks like it was made in 1958. So the standard is slowly, but surely going up ;-)

---
What‚Äôs with the hype around a beta? All I want is the actual release so I can start sinking my time into it.
---
Hope so. Would love a proper "remake" where the game stays the same but the graphics are updated.
---
His stream is titled "SOON T EFFING M" as well. HYPE!
---
I still watch his stuff but I am on the fence about him. The only Classic YouTuber I can say with certain I hate is Greysfordays. He is the annoying, intolerable Chad of Classic.
---
Skinning dagger is underrated for shaman.
---
ESFAAAAANNNNNDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Oh shit lets goooooo
---
Just starting to make a series where I walk people through gathering every single quest for each dungeon before they go through and do it. Gotta be efficent! :D
---
Nelf warriors look so dope
---
To be fair, the hardcore vanilla people are pretty antagonistic ... rarely do you see people say things like, "I'm glad you love WoW still, but I just don't care for the design decisions blizzard has made over the last few years."
---
More often you see, "WoW fucking sucks now. It's a garbage game and anyone who likes it is an idiot."
---
Obviously, this is a vocal minority, but so is the hardcore group of haters pushing back.
---
It's all just shouting into the wind.
---
Won't change how much I am going to love such a terrible, slow-paced game like Classic. :D
---
How so? If you purge their seals you should be in a better position.
---
haha sorry about that ;)
---
The person that originally said "Competition" was also referring to the fact that there will be "Competition" in development resources if and when classic turns out to be "better" than retail.
---
Some folks might be worried that if classic is a hit, then less focus overall, will be spent on the aspects of retail that they like.
---
Oof
---
Loved the Deadmines, one of my favorite instances in wow. I even run it later as Horde to farm for the defias armor to sell on the horde AH for twinks :D
---
I don't have any solid info here but I do know Towelliee one of the WoW Twitch streamers was afk on 5/7 and wouldn't give any details on why he wouldn't be streaming which was super odd because he is usually super transparent when it comes to his schedule. There several tweets from him on that day such as, "Wow what a day! Excited as fuck is all I can say! Driving home now should be on in the AM! GN ALL".
---
Hi, /u/Yelnik
---
Hell, even people who are already clamouring about "after Naxx" daily are pulling the "you think you do, but you don't" mindset that people would rather have TBC or Wrath than new Classic content.
---
Keep em coming.
---
Stop
---
I still have to disagree w the alliance lock sentiment. In a 10v10, chances are you‚Äôre facing 4 undead. That‚Äôs 4 fear breaks every 2 minutes.
---
Meanwhile, if you‚Äôre facing alliance, chances are you‚Äôre facing dwarf priest (more popular for PvP) and at least one paladin. One dwarf priest alone provides fear immunity x4 every 2 min (once every 30 sec) *and* paladins can dispel.
---
Thanks
---
Blizzard, let me waste my time trying to get the elites outside deadmines for half an hour already!
---
Esfand and Staysafe played a ton of vanilla and know their shit. I can't say much about Tips since he didn't cap but to say the other 2 have close to zero knowledge about Vanilla makes you sound like a pretentious douchebag.

When did I say I wanted flying in dungeons? I don't want any changes either... The flying is legit to make showing the dungeon off easier.
---
Haha. Nice. :) Love the original.
---
I watched several classic content creator (and I personally don't like that much most of them), but you just cherry picked few things that turned out to be private server specific, leaving out many (most?) things they bring in their videos that are actually valid representations of vanilla (like spell batching, many important quest chains, talent builds etc). Not to mention that some private servers even inflate raid bosses to make them more challenging than they used to be.
---
Obviously private servers aren't exact replica of vanilla and their content heavily relies on these, but you wrote is blatantly incorrect. Most of their videos, in fact, center around blue posts (what else??) and guides to leveling / class picking (shocking I know, right), since this is what most people will be doing and you can't exactly switch mains as quickly as you can in current retail.
---
It just moved out. The melee range is farther away, and the dead zone is the same size but farther away
---
I'm not "more" excited, but I am very excited for it as well.
---
Moar.
---
Yeah it was definitely one of my favorites. Actually now that I think of it... All dungeons leveling up through vanilla were my favorites.. Except BFD, hated that place for some reason. Probably because it was so far away.
---
there was no dog in classic.  #NoChanges
---
All I saw for a good minute was his hand and thinking ‚Äúis his pinky super long or is his thumb‚Äù or both?  And then I realized he was hold a book about wow.
---
&gt; Interacting with NPCs
---
Pft, it doesn't even mention this sub
---
They have their ways... they seem pretty confident. I still think there‚Äôs a chance they won‚Äôt make it, but it looks good.
---
I honestly would not mind at all if literally everything was the same but the graphics were on par with today. Never gonna happen and people would get mad, but I'd love it.
---
Excuse me what class should I play I want to be rank14 and farm Naxx but I only have 15 minutes a month to devote to WoW caus I have a family and job and my job has a family and my family has a job so I'm not like you smelly nerds so what class is the best at everything so that I can be that plzthanks.
---
both interesting points
---
I still think a gnome warrior is deceiving because he hits like a truck but looks like a flea
---

---

---

---
What is with the tips hate? This is too meta for me. I am being wooshed.
---
The rings with the correct enchant are pretty underestimated imo.
---
People didn't do the conversion and vendored them, but when they went from 1% dodge in Classic they changed it to 12 or 14 Rating which is 1% for a lvl 60 player, but 4,x% for a level 19 player.
---
It's a miracle I fished 4 of them from the auction house each costing me about 50 silver.
---
It's the internet, if there's a position to be taken on something, you best believe some group of people are gonna park themselves there
---
We don't know yet.  In any event you'll likely want to look at current methods and work back as needed. There's a good chance it's the same setup as retail, the difference will be in the API methods available to you (likely a subset, restricted for classic)
---
if its like any other wow beta. No, you do not. I've been invited to beta's with no sub a few times.
---
Prepare your body.  If you thought that WoW was addicting wait until you take a deep dive in Gif making.  You're doing great, keep up the good work.
---
I've always been pretty sad about all the changes that happened to the original zones in Cataclysm, but this son of a bitch being buried under the waves was the retribution of thousands of low level dead orcs and trolls.
---
&gt; Do we know if the addons will work as they did in classic
---
They will not.
---
&gt;  what should you look at to actually write addons that will work in classic?
---
As of now, the classic build is based off of 8.1.5, will probably be based off of 8.2 or 8.2.5 whenever it actually releases, so plan for the much more modern api.
---
Could be. It could also be he hated until he tried it. If you just watch videos of other people playing classic. It would be very hard to see what people love about the game.
---
I dunno mang I'd have to vote goldshire or dun morough 
---
Grim Guzzler was no longer relevant as of TBC and many of us never wrapped our minds around the fucking monster that is Blackrock Depths. It is HUGE in there. Like its own zone.
---
I played pservers and I still can't really manage my way around BRD despite attempting to rogue farm shanker. 
---
So yeah. Definitely cool, wouldn't say *iconic* though.
---
People don't like him because he streches 2 minute topics out to 10 minutes for ad revenue and he never played in vanilla. I don't mind the guy and I like his videos. That's just what i've heard
---
I had someone seriously tell me that Blizzard took Nostralius's code and just "dumped" it on top of their 7.3.5 client with very few tweaks or changes.  I think this disproves that tinfoil hat idea.
---
They do not. Beta is not a free preview/head start.
---
Invitees are their to test and only test.
---
&lt;Golden's in Goldshire&gt;
---
that's not how you spell "Lion's Pride Inn"
---
Can i join you for ganking alliance scum?
---
I'm the feral boy.  It was my third alt in vanilla. But it ended up being the class I enjoyed the most. So that's what I'm doing.
---
odd to me they went with a signed int. 
---
My guess is they went that route incase there was a bug that let you go below 0 copper it wouldn't overflow to max gold.
---
Retail is liquid stool designed for "user-engagement" and "user-retention". We want a world where the strong are strong, the weak are weak, and the dead are dead. If you can't log in, you don't move forward. No weekly cooldowns, no free gear, no computer-assisted-friend-finding, no achievements. Just Warcraft!

Lmaoo
---
I think someone said that the announcement for it, was then a week later..
---
See I thought so but that's the second comment I got like that (on the other thread for a different video) so I wasn't sure xD
---
They would need to have a literal counter on each server in my opinion then. A lot of people won't care where they are going when launch happens. If I wanted to be horde and saw 3 servers with a 200 alliance queue, I'd go there and pick a horde. But if we are blind to the queue it will be BS and chaos. Maybe with an actual visible tracker from the realm list screen a lot of the problems could be solved by the loner's who dgaf and just want to play. If that makes sense.

Higher "cap"? What does that mean?
---
Classic will have some options which come free with the modern client. Mainly modern shadows, water and increased ground clutter distance.
---
All models, animations, textures, effects, etc. will be like in Vanilla. Including the view distance which will be fixed to the maximum which was in Vanilla.

Yeah it was cool climbing up behind Ironforge and visit the airport up there. Even when you couldnt do anything there, it was just somehow fun to be in places where you wasn't supposed to be
---
&gt; Warriors being the uncontested kings of shit mountain
---
This comment shows clearly you have no idea what you're talking about
---
Warrior levelling is rough but endgame is a god. Uncontested kings of shit mountain? They are uncontested kings of PvP *AND* PvE in late game way.
---
Your ignorance is showing you filthy casual!
---
How can you list things on the AH for free..?
---
Your a lucky man, i have a limit date to say what week a want for summer vacation, after this date i must choose last of my office division so it like in december, i had to choose wisely so i went for the mid August just in case.
---
That's a good point you make. A ton of my rl friends hated retail vanilla when I told them to come watch me play so they could see if they wanted it. Took me months of never shutting the fuck up about it for them to try it. They all loved it of course.
---
Should be "we didn't stand in fire"
---
Seems like this proves that Guild Banks will not be a thing. This seems like a very working client, ready for Beta.
---
Hell yeah. I'm saving this list so I can remember everything I need to start compiling. It'll probably all go to shit when I'm constantly getting sidetracked by world pvp and running all over the place or dungeons I don't really need but hey it's about having fun, right?
---
I think you got PvP and PvE switched
---
Its basic marketing. How can I reach the most people, preferably my target audience as well for the least amount of money spend.
---
These give me sustenance is this our time of drought.
---
It‚Äôs just a joke lighten up ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Retail is indeed garbo. I also eat vomit. So get on my level casual.
---
If you had an actual audience you would be... lol
---
Imagine your favourite band. They're awesome and you love them. Slowly over time, they change their musical style. Initially, you still like the change of direction and they still make good albums.
---
After about 15 years though they become [insert a genre of music you fucking despise] and the band doesn't have any of the original members either. It's just called the same name.
---
Then the original band come back, with the original line up, playing the original style of music.
---
I use music as an analogy because music speaks to a lot of people in a big way and people are very passionate about it. WoW is the same. People feel an attachment and ownership over things they're passionate about. They believe they have contributed to the success. 
---
So when something comes along that's so glaringly in opposition to what they like, they get angry/upset etc. Because we have the internet now, you get to read about it.
---
This is truly a masterpiece.  10/10
---
will they remove pandas from classic wow?

1. I have never stretched stretched out a topic for revenue. I do sometimes do longer discussion style videos.  The reason for this is that most people who watch videos arent waist-deep in the news like we are, so its important to recap so people can actually understand the context of the discussion topic. Feel free to browse through my channel videos to see the lengths; seldom is a video actually 10 mins. 
---
2. I played during vanilla and have shown my account history countless times on stream. Really dont know what to say about this, but ill say it here again; My current account was started in the beginning of June 2005, right as WSG and AV came out.

Doing God's work

So damn true.
---
Can you name some names for this? The only two I really watch are Tips and Esfand. They don't do any of the stuff you are accusing people of. I learned that /sit would not work from tips.
---
Esfand was dying to start streaming after he was banned yet he waited a day to start streaming again? i wonder why haha. definitely had to be something real important to keep him waiting a day
---
but forreal, when are we getting a series of dog memes.
---
Grabe üòç
---
Kids get all the fun toys lol
---
Considering they invited a bunch of shills but left Preach out, then yea
---
His entire post is a fiction. Tips is literally the one who confirmed /sit won't work for me. He is making up that horde tanks pull way better threat.
---
I don't speak Twitch. Someone translate.
---
merit is a fuckin' spook my dude
---
You get a lot of people from both OSRS and RS3 who kind of get at each other's throats at times. The only difference is Runescape has more stuff to do in each of their games currently than BFA, (or Classic currently, given no one can play it because it isn't out yet) so they're not complaining as much as WoW.
---
I just think there's a lot of misplaced hype from people who don't really know what they're getting into. It's a super Grindy, slow, time consuming game. The retail crowd, justifiably roll their eyes when there's a giant circle jerk about how much better classic is than retail.
---
Ultimately, it's just better to tune out the extremes on both ends and just enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Could be a fun thing to do. Take a SS after every 10 lvls or every 24 hours played or something like that
---
Noted
---
if you count harder then vanilla as different then yes private servers are different. but everyone is saying that private servers are undertuned and classic will be much harder wich is th oposit of what is true. and there arent thousands of bugs. there are a few small bugs

How the hell are gnomes a plus?

I've been told I'm lying in this sub but there were certain mobs that would wield the weapon model of the weapon they were going to drop. One such mob group was the elite cave in Searing Gorge. Instead of the staves and 1h swords (I think) theybususlly wielded, very rarely you would see one with a different model weapon. It made off one day when I got Kang off a mob wielding, sure enough, the 2h Kang axe model.

Still wouldn't take important debuffs, deep wound is nothing and 16 debuff slots is a lot. Thanks for explaining though.

Feel free. I'm thinking I might print all my shit out and put it in a folder. Maximum autismo. But I think it would be cool to have so I can look back at it years down the line lol.
---
People like the guy you are responding to will just read your response up until the point you admit some difference. They will take no nuance on what the difference is or why it occurs or how big of a deal it is. I wouldn't argue with them. This subreddit is filled with people who are purist that rely on the human memory of all things.
---
It could also be a gnome warlock on pve server and still work tho.

These are awesome!

I thought it was North Korea they went to

Pink pigtails + gnome giggle for maximum rage inducement from horde.

They've got a perma-global taunt in pvp, so you can use them as tiny meat shields.

Just refreshing what i've heard people say over and over again here because someome asked. My apologies for spreading misinformation.
---
Can you give me an example of when I acted "super hardcore vanilla player that knows all"? That's never been my thing, and I have always been frank and forward with that. Will I be playing a lot in Classic? Absolutely. Do I know everything about the game? No, I don't, but then again, do you? Does anyone? That's the beautiful thing about Vanilla - even my friends in APES and PROGRESS are discovering new things every week.
---
If you entire judgement of me is based on a mistake I made during a 5 hour dueling tournament which I had to organize, promote, produce, solocast on my own (the first thing I ever casted in my life btw) while at the same time being under the pressure of a 10,000+ viewer stream, then I'm really sorry dude. Ya, I made a mistake. I'll be making a lot more today, tomorrow, and in the future. That's life man.
---
Lol thanks!
---
They gave Tips a Severed Axe of the Wolf to play with in the corner. My sources claim he is still praising the dev team on how amazing the addition of spirit is on a melee weapon. "Absolutely insane game design" was uttered multiple times.
---
The truth is out there scully.
---
I am willing to bet all three of the classicast guys played more vanilla than you did.
---
Get the fuck off of you circle jerk hate for these dudes cause it's been overplayed.
---
these are amazing!
---
That‚Äôs great! But also irrelevant to your first question if I understood correctly. You ask about leveling, dungeons and PvP. You should know that both shaman and paladin will heal fine through leveling, dungeons and PvP with a spec not designed for the role. Although it isn‚Äôt optimal it is very viable.
---
If you talk about raids, I don‚Äôt know too much as I don‚Äôt consider pvtsvr raiding as vanilla raiding. But it‚Äôs safe to say you‚Äôll want a dedicated spec to your role.
---
lmfao
---
No worries brother :)
---
It‚Äôs more of a meme at this point. There are some people who dislike him but he‚Äôs pretty popular
---
1.12 talents in MC progression isn't authentic.
---
That's just a fact.
---
I also have never been a fan of holy power. I don‚Äôt really see why mana bars exist anymore in the game.
---
&gt;as time passes, it becomes ever more likely they'll be "right".
---
I think the assumption is that beta means release is imminent and with it will come an idea of release date.
---
Basically, if this thing is dropping soon, beta is the next step... so nothing can happen until that happens.
---
And some people really like playing in betas (I don't personally - I think they spoil the launch).
---
I used to make my roommate so mad by repeatedly insisting that it grammatically should be *"The Crossroads* ***are*** *under attack."*
---
It's been a long time since vanilla but I remember my mage just drinking all the time. My rogue on the other hand had about zero downtime. Thats the way I recall it anyhow.
---
Please find me one instance where these guys are advocating for something that is completely different than what is actually vanilla.
---
Their classic chicken sammichs + onion rings,  /drool
---
Unless he resists, then you're fucked.
---
Very much agree with much of what you've said.
---
I'm looking forward to doing content I remember, with friends I played vanilla with, while also meeting new people.
---
As well, I'm excited that we'll be able to see raids we never made it to, before TBC released.
---
As you've said, there are so many things to do, see, read, engage in. I'm very happy we get the chance to play this amazing game again.
---
was mauradon such a big thing that you needed it with molten core? isnt it a like lvl 45 dungeon ?
---
Most people are in on jokes about you for the memes. Don‚Äôt sweat it too much.

You can‚Äôt tame plainstriders

hehe no such thing as a mount tab back then.

I literally fell asleep playing legion ret. Twice.
---
Ill probably shoot for a month and a half - 2 months. Not really in a rush to do anything in classic.
---
The when feeling?
---
Played on a pserver where a NE hunter tamed Sarkoth and named him.  Parked it right where Sarkoth usually spawned and just lit the level 4s up...was comical.
---
I like the cut of your jib, will be checking out more of your content.
---
Pretty sure it was just a racist joke at the end of the video. Video sets up the group to be a bunch of white nerdy kids with one black dude. Last line drive that joke home.
---
Yes you can?
---
I'm excited to skip this quest and just kill harpies instead
---
All you just told me is that people are obnoxious and, stupid. The industry says you get paid at 10 minutes not 2. Streaming and youtubing is hard work. I know it seems easy but, it's not you have to sacrifice everything to be successful. Not gonna hate on a dude for making a living while delivering the info I need. If you want the cliff notes hit up reddit not hit up youtube.
---
You can? Nvm then I‚Äôm a noob. Maybe I was thinking of giraffes
---
&gt; I have never stretched stretched out a topic for revenue. I do sometimes do longer discussion style videos.

---
This is just false. I had to remove all your videos from my feed because your videos are littered with this tactic.
---
Same goes for the other creators with similar videos.
---
It's okay to do what you do, if it works for you, but you can't just flat out deny it.
---
Yeah I was thinking it was the safest choice very early on in development because unsigned excludes any possibility of player debt.

I would not mind if the remake had some of the tbc talent fixes to the meme specs in it aswell. Fixing ret, oomkin, feral, shadow priest and such most blatant issues would be great, along with slightly better itemized gear choices, like that from Karazhan üëå
---
There are a lot of dildoes on the Classic Reddit who just regurgitate misinformation they heard about you. I've watched pretty much everything you've made - and every Classicast multiple times - so I can confidently say they are full of shit. Don't let these dickbags get to you.
---
You are my current favorite person. keep these up
---
I mean yeah. This sub pretty much hates most vanilla content creators. Probably for that exact reasoning
---
This is one of the biggest reasons why I hated Cataclysm as a previous Ret main, not a fan of holy power.
---
WOTLK is still the best time I had playing Ret.
---
So Tauren hunter can't make ranged attacks until 10 yards?
---
I understand that you don't like him and nor am I suggesting you should, but its hard to argue with his view numbers and likes on youtube. When you say "most ppl" that's inaccurate. Its usually the vocal minority that voice their opinions against him. He puts time and effort into his videos and content. Don't like his videos, dont watch and downvote it. Yeah he has made errors in the past, so what. At least he is trying. I really dont know why  this this subreddit trys to gatekeep content creators because they didnt reach rank 14 and clear Naxx.
---
I was looking for "Mental Division" as a boss spell in ClassicDB. Stay in school kids.
---
Release will be September like most other expansions recently. That way they can talk all about how great the new release of Classic WoW has been going for just a few weeks at Blizzcon.
---
People who haven't played on private servers like to tell themselves that there are huge differences. Like their chastity for avoiding them will somehow be beneficial.
---
It‚Äôs also extremely rare and sought after.
---
Yeah I quit WoW once. Now look where I'm at.. Checking here for updates every 30 minutes.
---
I played a Ret Paladin on a Pserver and it was an absolute mess. Took 5 minutes to auto attack kill anything and I had to heal after almost every pull. If I hadn‚Äôt grouped up with others to hit level 20 I would have quit by 12 or so. Once I started a rogue and hit 16 within about half the time, I knew paladin was trash.
---
So many Alliance scums here...
---
I dont know the exact numbers but yes it is farther out than other races
---
Yep understanding this has led me to a 100% girlfriend plays wow success rate. Never ask your friends to play. Ask them to help you. Then let the game seduce them. It's all about getting them through the door with zero expectations. If you can do that. You will have another classic player soon enough.
---
Very clear ‚Äúhave chicken‚Äù
---
Does anyone else agree that Legion ruined Ret paladins? Like, they got rid of a lot of the OG abilities and instead gave us a bunch of boring offensive/melee spells.
---
Never stretched out a video? Let me seeeee.... user, posts, ah the MOST RECENT post from 4 days ago is this vid https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6V9FyWhtT5M&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
where you spend 11 mins talking to cover 2-3 mins of content, not to mention the actual titled content ends 3 mins before the video does so you can do shameless self-promotion. lmao okay dude, you do you i understand youre trying to make a living in this ecosystem but dont act like the criticism is for nonexistent things. but as a fan of vanilla i must say you do a disservice to us all with such nonsense. im playing this game because it reminds me of a time before big companies ruined games, before streamers and personalities who appeal to the lowest common denominator became rampant and unavoidable. no hate for how you feed yourself but come on dude, youre a joke

oops

Summary of this thread:  
---
Post type #1: "Awesome! I can't wait"
---
Post type #2: "Tips/Esfand/Classicast don't know shit and claim that /sit macros are part of the rotation for enrage/reckoning"  
---
Post type #3: "No they don't, they literally said the opposite multiple times, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about and just want to hate them."
---
No replies from camp #2.
---
I‚Äôve never heard this interpretation. Seems odd that that‚Äôs where your mind would go.
---
Im pretty sure he's refering to troll tanking, which AQ and past out threat's any other horde tank due to the beserking racial. Allowing for an insane threat dump at the start of the fight and allows for dps to start putting dmg out sooner.
---
Honestly, the retail group of players are going to be problematic. Either, they have never played vanilla and it‚Äôs gonna be too tough for them,  or they are going to just play retail and shit in Classic for no other reason than people leaving retail to play it.
---
^^^^REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
As hyped as I am for Classic, this is my fear.  I really feel WoW was it's best self with TBC - not necessarily the content (Outland was fine, but doesn't get me overly excited) but the classes in particular.
---
Having most every class and spec be viable but still feel different was so refreshing from the Vanilla days.  There are small in-game QoL stuff that was very good, things like the Calendar and showing price per item on mouseover in the AH that had no effect on gameplay or community building but were very nice to have.  I wish some of those things had stayed in.
---
That said, it's a slippery slope and I'd much rather have true Classic, warts and all, than slide into LFD/LFR/Sharding/CRZ.
---
no i dont know everything about vanilla. i know alot but not everything. but then again im not making class guides for vanilla. and namedropping some big private server guilds now are we. all you do is spreading missinformation in 10 min + videos.
---
and yes i judge you on that mistake cause that was never even close to be a thing on wow, so getting this wrong just shows how little you know about vanilla
---
Should we tell him about endgame?
---
It feel so good to defeat a mob lv5 higher than you as a Pala
---
Should be mentioned that vendor items give more return on spending power early on, as you can buy those items that will rise along with inflation. Not spending your gold on such items will make you lose spending power over the course of the expansion
---
Keep up the good work Tips, ignore the asshat vanilla gatekeepers.
---
Why? Can they not help themselves?
---
I love these lol
---
This got me good.
---
Rogue alt dead in redridge.. this post checks out
---
hahah fuckin Ranchy
---
Kind of hard to compare these two games but I find osrs way more mindless and grindy than classic. Grinding levels and unlocking new armor in osrs is fun but doesn't compare to leveling, getting new abilities, and gearing up in classic. Feels more rewarding and is more interesting to me because you're not sat there auto attacking everything for hours on end. Granted some classes don't have the most complex rotations but anything is more interesting than osrs combat imo.
---
Also if you like pking you may enjoy pvp in classic. Its not super balanced but its a lot of fun and prefer it any day over osrs pking.
---
Man this is great, keep up the good work. Just too funny.
---
As someone who played warrior all the way through vanilla and and has been planning to mos def roll a mage come rerelease...this just made me wanna roll a rogue. Just to three shot people in their own home city and get away all cheeky like
---
I hate this thread
---
If retail and classic both benefit off each other's success, we ALL win.
---
So addons that will work on 8.2.5 will work on classic too?
---
Yes. With glorious grass density to the max.
---
I really don't think that you owe an explanation to the loud, toxic minority. Keep doing what you are doing, most of us like your content and appreciate what you are doing for this community dude!
---
Ya I definitely like gnome for warrior. It's very unique. The engineering racial is also one of the most overpowered twink racials in the game. Allowing you to get access to engineering items nobody else in the bracket can get.
---
There is debate and differing information on how engi pets scale at 60 so I'm not sure how good it is later on.
---
I think from this fact alone, we can safely say that Blizzard is ‚Äúnot working on TBC/Wrath Classic‚Äù. 
---
They could be planning it, it could be an internal discussion, but unless they‚Äôve got a private branch and a secret division doing the work, then it‚Äôs clear that by taking out TBC systems, they aren‚Äôt working on it. 
---
Also, they‚Äôd be doubling their effort if they take another branch from retail and have to implement these changes *again*. That would be an awful cost for not a lot of return. Even if they branch Classic WoW to add TBC stuff, they‚Äôre going to have to add items back that were just removed. That doesn‚Äôt make sense IF you‚Äôre planning to have TBC Classic.
---
Just for the record a lot of the changes to Classic that have been made after the Classic Panel at  BlizzCon, that most of you guys were very happy were addressed or fixed, were things that I specifically talked about to Blizzard directly about after I streamed Classic at BlizzCon.  
---
4 Phases of Content Release needs to be at least 6 (7 if they weren't going to spread PvP out into multiple phases.)  
---
Loot Trading needs to be bare minimum relegated to only being in raids. (I ran into Ion Hazzikostas in hotel lobby at BlizzCon and almost immediately started talking about this like a sperg lol)  
---
Spell Batching.  
---
Sharding (This is literally the first thing I asked about when I got off my stream at BlizzCon. They said it was the current solution that was from the retail Client, they kept it at least for the sake of the demo, and that they are going to work on finding the best possible solution for the actual launch of Classic.)
---
There's more that hasn't been addressed yet, like the concerns with right click reporting, chat restrictions, some [battle.net](https://battle.net) functionality, and more. Obviously they aren't going 100% do whatever is given to them as feedback, but there's a lot of feedback that I've gotten the opportunity to give and when I do it's always in this kind of format:  
---
A) This is the current issue  
---
B) This is what general consensus of the community is on this topic  
---
C) This is what my suggested solution is  
---
But to say or act like I don't know what I'm talking about is so ridiculously misguided it's insane. After I got DMCA'd for streaming Private servers on YouTube a year and a half ago, I basically stopped using private server footage for streams or videos, because I had to in order to not get DMCA'd again and keep streaming. A lot of the Classic content that I did before, basically got cucked because I am a gameplay guy and I can't show off my gameplay if I don't have a game to play. So I had to shift the direction of my channel into talking about Classic instead of actually playing it and basically do everything I can to give good public feedback about Classic. As my stream grew again on Twitch and people saw that I knew what I was talking about, Blizzard saw that I wasn't breaking rules anymore, they eventually invited me out to stream at BlizzCon like right before BlizzCon last year. And since then, I've basically been able to give feedback about different topics that have been brought up by the community. What do they do with that feedback? I don't know until we get a blue post or something about it, because the people I've talked to can't tell me anything. But I do know they're getting the feedback, and at least with a few of the updates I know that it's been effective.  
---
This isn't some secret bombshell or anything, I've talked about this on stream before.  
---
I gave up a lot of my YouTube content until Classic, and while a lot of other people are out there making videos and farming subs, views, etc. (which is fine) I've been focused mostly on streaming IRL and Variety on Twitch, while talking about Classic and while it's hurt my personal YouTube growth a lot, but in turn "following the rules" or whatever has also given me a chance to give direct feedback about the things that everyone has been concerned about with Classic.
---
We demand it!
---
streamer benefits is pissing me off
---
I‚Äôve just been on PvP servers in vanilla, TBC, and twice on private servers. My point is that most if not all the pvp that happens in the world is ganking, out-numbering, or just straight meaningless. It‚Äôs not at all that I‚Äôm scared lol, I‚Äôve just done it before and don‚Äôt have the time to deal with it again. 
---
Although I do understand your point here, the piece about being ‚Äútoo old for this shit‚Äù is that I don‚Äôt necessarily need to ‚Äú1-up‚Äù anybody to enjoy the game. I don‚Äôt need to prove my worth anymore. I‚Äôll only have a set number of hours to play a week, so multiple corpse runs back to BRD for 30min before a dungeon run actually does have an effect. (To answer your question about what a 5-10min run does). I don‚Äôt need to let it be THAT competitive. And hold a large weight on my life. I‚Äôve been there and done that. 
---
But I love vanilla wow and I want to enjoy it again. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to do, but this time around I‚Äôll enjoy it differently. Because I‚Äôm a different person than I was 13 years ago. :D
---
This is my favorite one.
---
I come here only for the awesome Gifs from the Office now 
---
Blue posts have lost my interest
---
Yes they're going to be using a modified version of the modern scripting API.  So in general a lot of what works in retail will work in classic.
---
With the exception that certain things are being removed, which we don't know the details of yet, and anything that relies on specific spell/ability/item id's or what have you will likely not work without changing the id's to whatever they are in classic.
---
I believe blizzard said they will limit the api to more resemble original WoW‚Äôs api features.
---
[give code tidies](https://i.imgur.com/bevgodn.jpg)

Woof? Awoo!!!
---
We have no clue. I would lean more towards yes than no, though.
---
These are amazing but half way through they get super blurry for me. Is this a function of the meme? Or is this my internet rendering it poorly?
---
I like this trend
---
yup, that's me. LMFAO I would terrorize ORG / Blimp / outside of Org and do raids to org that would consist of druids and rogues only.
---
Shhhhh they will learn to love their dress.
---
NGL I would seriously love to do this, especially if it was centered in STV.
---
I don't think there's much need for feedback.  This is likely entirely for building hype and PR.
---
It's not like there are things in terms of design that anyone would sway blizzard on.  This is classic after all.
---
Can I just say that the "No Changes" community is filled with some pretty toxic individuals? Most of them never explain the reasoning behind why they are opposed to the specific change.
---
Hell, you could suggest something like getting rid of Subscription requirements altogether and they be shouting that down.
---
If the "No Change" crowd really wants to bring back the original vanilla WoW experience, I expect them to run with 20 year old rigs on dial-up or DSL and use a randomizer that disconnects them from the internet/game without warning.
---
I dunno man, I feel like a lot of people that played vanilla seriously have the names of the Bar Patrons turning red burned into their minds.
---
Why is everyone posting pictures of boxes? They sold millions - tens of millions of copies of this game. We all have the same boxes and books.
---
fuck the haters tips. love your content!
---
This sub is officially /r/GoldenRetrieversInGoldshire now

You absolutely do not need 75 enchanting to craft your first wand. The recipe turns yellow at 75. 
---
You need about 80 linen cloth and the wand is yours. At that point, you‚Äôll be able to continue crafting wands for other casters, or bags. 
---
Try it on a private server.
---
So essentially we get a hybrid of classic and retail. Based on retail API but modifed to be closer to classic. You can still learn the basics especially with retail API but yeah we don't know how exactly it will all work, so wait until classic.

Thank Thralls Balls for the guard pup

You get to raid with a famous streamer!!!
---
... Effin scrub can't be greatful...
---
I love the people that think its only going to last a month. They clearly don't know that thats around the time people actually start getting to max and then the real fun starts.
---
We're talking about different kinds of value here. You are abstracting to gold value, I am talking about dopamine rewards of drops and upgrading your character value which has an intrinsic enjoyment value that is different and not replacemeable with a purchase from the AH
---
They're being used as marketing tools.. not criticism..?
---
Oh, totally. The same goes for whatever the fuck happened to enhancement shamans' spellbook.
---
I think Blizzards biggest mistake with Paladins was cutting holy strike and crusader strike one patch before vanillas launch. The class was super fun to level and play (even if it was a bit OP because of the holy damage) with those two simple buttons. Seals and blessings also got reworked right before launch IIRC.
---
Egotistical fuck.
---
Funny, that's also my nickname.
---
Yup, OP just hates Holy Power so much it's making the next worst thing - basically Ret Paladins in vanilla - seem super appealing.
---
Oh yeah that's right you had to emote it. Thanks
---
People actually watch you tube videos about people talking about the game?  Damn that makes me feel old, I like to  play games not watch people play games.....
---
I am probably in the vast minority though since people make money off of it.  The world is a strange place
---
Auto attack and with terrible SOC rng. Can't wait!

Anyone else not have that bad of an experience in vanilla in STV?  Is this a private server thing?  The hunter camp was pretty bad but the other 90% of the zone (besides booty bay and the immediate surroundings) was not any worse than any other contested zone for me.  Leveled on 3 different servers during their vanilla launches although I guess that is still a relatively small sample size, and there is the possibility that I was just too far ahead of the curve to see the worst of it.
---
Congratulations on making yourself look like even more of a dumbass with this response.
---
Also, real quick, I'm just curious what you mean by "if you don't jump people". Somebody has to "jump" somebody, otherwise there would literally never be any pvp.  Somebody has to start it. It's very rare to see two people charging at each other know for certain they're about to fight haha.
---
If rumors are true and you may know something that we all desperately want know, it must feel good considering how many dickbags on this subreddit give you shit. I wish I could see you sitting there smugly grinning.
---
I think you‚Äôre talking about getting Desperate Prayer. If so, there‚Äôs a Priest trainer in Darn at level 10 that will direct you to go to SW to start that chain. No need to stick around Elwynn just for that.
---
Its a temporary fix for a temporary problem. Relax
---
I can't wait to commit genocide there
---
hahaha oh man I even like tips and these had me busting a gut. I think it's just all in good fun.
---
You lose fear ward but I have a hard time believing you won't find a spot. A healer is a healer and there's probably going to be someone else with fear ward anyways. Priests are great healers and other classes without fear ward get invited as healers all the time.
---
I had the original, uncopyright-struck version of my old hardrive. Let me tell you, my favourite songs being played with all rogue specs in a fantastic edit was just a dopamine rush every time.
---
Haha I was actually a holy pally main for a majority of my WoW career so I plan on ret leveling until late 40s and then hopping on the holy bus for dungeons and raiding. Co leveling with a buddy who wants to main warrior so we should have a decent setup for lowbie dungeons and stuff with some caster gear in my bags
---
we‚Äôve gone full meta
---
classic when?
---
"Can I just say..."
---
TipsOut is the prime example of who I had in mind when I wrote that comment. Tips has the famous "he should just WotF the sheep" that the community called him out on, but he really did not stop there.
---
If Kargoz wasn‚Äôt there, it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.
---
Love your videos!
---
Dope, thanks for doing this
---
It was me Austin
---
No proc, dodge, no proc, miss, no proc, no proc.... next mob: PROC PROC PROC 3shot. Can‚Äôt wait
---
I really want to watch it. Like I love a lot of the clips I see, it's just I can't watch "cringe" humour. I feel too embarrassed for the characters and can't stand it. So unfortunately, The Office will be one of those shows i never watch.
---
Your character reminds me of this video, which was also the reason I rerolled from UD rogue to Nelf warrior!
---
https://youtu.be/BvtKCp4TIOg
---
The criticism wasn't that he didn't play Vanilla, the criticism was that he never hit 60 during Vanilla.
---
I think warlocks will be pretty popular in classic. Not as popular as mages but they'll be up there.
---
Haha, you win the comment section sir.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. But I still think the hate they get leveling is overstated. Playing a bit on a private server to get warmed up I made it to 30 in a breeze and being able to multi role low level dungeons is fantastic
---
This video got me so hyped back in the day
---
Thanks I‚Äôll probably just afk osrs while playing classic and I‚Äôll see how I like it. I don‚Äôt like to play osrs for ehp makes it feel too much like a chore imo
---
Haha from someone who watches entirely to much office and plays wow while watching. This is awesome. Thank you.
---
I think it's got alot to do with the games that you played prior to wow, for example I grew up playing 8 and 16 bit games that had very rudimentary difficulty settings if any, and most of them are brutally difficult compared to modern games and as such that's what I expected a good game to be. 
---
Somebody who started later would have cut their teeth on games with tons of difficulty sliders tons of custimization etc and its expected that these are the standard and anything else is subpar.
---
Not to say these are hard rules, just a generalization based on having a brother whos a teen now and us being 16 years apart in age, he appreciates the older games because I played them with him before he ever got introduced to "modern" game design, but most of his friends just can't see how old games are enjoyable
---
Glad you can appreciate it :) I‚Äôd love to hear some creative solutions from the community, whether it‚Äôs how to level faster or making like a level 5 twink or something g crazy like that!
---
I would say herb and skin while levelling is a good choice and then dropping skinning for alchemy is a great idea if you'll be sticking with herb. Smart move.
---
Welp. Turns out I did anyway.
---
Tips confused about things and 10 minute videos is more a running joke than hate. I find it funny.
---
It sounds like you should just play a mage. People still want you in groups because they're CC gods. They also do great dps through all of vanilla. They're world PvP is great because they can just hide behind trees and shoot frostbolts. By the time the person reaches you, you've already hit them 3 times and boom, fireblast, they're dead.
---
Ignore the hate tips. Stay on the high ground. You cant please everyone sadly, its a hard fact of life. Love the content man, keep it up.
---
Sounds like you were trash and not Paladins tbh :P Their leveling speed is pretty decent. Killspeed is slower than other classes, but they should really not have much downtime.
---
No idea what you were doing, if you tried attacking higher level mobs all the way or what. But I have leveled 3 Paladins on private servers and dont really recognize anything you are saying here.
---
&gt; He has a pretty large hate-on for them 
---
Not really mate, I do like the more informed ones a whole lot - Skarm is pretty good, for one.
---
I also didn't say that all of them do all of those things, but people seem to take the comment that way, so I guess I am sorry for saying your favourite YouTuber sucks, even though I did not say that.
---
The "problem" is there are quests in one hub that lead to entire chains in different zones, so if you don't pickup that 1st quest and you travel to the zone you'll end up thinking that zone sucks and has no quests. 
---
Good example is Desolace for Alliance, there's a quest from Ironforge that leads to two 3 quest chains (6 quests total) in Desolace that give tons of exp, but you would never know if you went straight there..
---
Personally I know the 1-60 route for alliance so I'm fine with it, but knew players without questie or classidb constantly open will be SOL.
---
Very Nice
---
I want to play as a ranged DPS and will probably do a lot of BG's. This might sound like a weird criteria, but I'd like to play a class that can be ready to go pretty fast after dying and ressing in a BG. If I go Warlock I might have to summon pet, conjure hs and possibly ss, buff up and then drink before I'm ready. I'm assuming Mage and Hunter are both better in that aspect, but what class is the best/nicest?
---
I think if we're being honest here it'll be rushed out the door like every other Blizz product in the past couple years. New ESO expac releases June 4th and the new FFXIV expac releases July 2nd. You think Blizz is really going to wait 2-3 more months to release Classic? They, 99% of the time, release near/before their competitors do. 
---
Beta will be next week and then release in mid June calling it now. No one will see that coming expecting the Blizz of old to "release when ready".
---
It does.
---
But a rogue will sap you, kill the pet, then go to town, and while levelling you won't have an insignia.
---
word has it Esfand wants lfr in classic.
---
Polymorph memes amirite
---
imagine dedicating your day to making content and wanting to be paid for it #notmyclassiccontentcreators
---
I call July 15th.
---
Look at that spiky boi
---
Given your want for a mobile melee class, feral druid may be up your alley. You will most likely need to be a healer in raids, but feral tank is a good FC in WSG. 
---
If you want to heal, you'll have to relearn healing priorities, as it's different to more modern wow. Look into learning about overhealing, downranking, consumables, role specific healing, and spec.
---
Give me more than 20 quest slots tho
---
I'm not talking about your "dopamine value" because it's absolutely irrelevant. If you expect other players in your group to lose out on actual monetary value and character progression because of your personal "dopamine value" then you're just kind of a jerk.
---
No son, undead bones.  Arthritis and all after all these years.  
---
Are you Alliance, by chance?
---
Now me and my golden are disappointed that we won't get this :(
---
You have my frost nova, friend.
---
*distant borks*
---
Mainly because of Windfury - the fact that you get extra attacks, which generates extra rage, which allows you to spend more rage, which equals more threat generated.
---
Some people below are mentioning Troll's racial ability, which obviously helps because of the same principle - more AS = more rage = more threat.
---
Ah. Levelling as a paladin will be punishment enough anyway.
---
Dude. Iam feeling you. Iam working on my master thesis right now
---
Its the small things man
---
Old school runescape did for me for a little while mostly because I started playing it in like 2003 and played it up until I discovered what WoW was in 2007.
---
Just to stop hybrids from being able to constantly heal in pvp when not healing specced. That's literally it.
---
Partially, yes :-) Windfury is the other big threat boost for horde tanks.
---
I thought he name was Ziz. Now I'm wondering who the hell is Ziz
---
Maybe a half joke as there's definitely some basis to it, the reality is that classic content is stretched thin so making consistent videos is impossible unless you milk them.  Amusing seeing the change of tone once he comments in here himself though.
---
STV makes me hesitate to roll an alliance warlock lol
---
Yea I think this is a goldmine

Bonus: The forum post of people‚Äôs characters that got me hyped for the game in June 2005: https://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/253211-Show-us-wat-ur-char-looks-like-)?s=9be0e4a8740b2d0f1b98eb9c3ce2cbaf
---
You don't like 2h rogues bruh???
---
I really do wonder if Goldshire will be ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù on Classic realms compared to current version realms.
---
I hope it will.
---
Imagine actually being able to RP there because all the ERP is done on current version.
---
Already doing that and its glorious. Managing the waman work and vanila os hard tho
---
[here's my reply on this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bmj8zs/classic_content_creators_were_invited_to_irvine/emxlire/), Windfury is really good for warriors, that's all :)
---
It was introduced to bring more flavor to each spec.  The effect was far from that, but I think it's pretty easy to see the intent - especially if you look at what they did with MW monks and chi.
---
Whatever happened to "community matters" and all that talk that people who laud Classic want to return?  Helping others is part of that community and something that apparently has been sorely lost since the olden days of MMOs.
---
AV: Hunter because you basically just sit there autoattacking at max range and focus down enemy squishies.  You have good burst, good survivability, and good range.  Add in a pet for distracting NPCs so you can get caps off far easier and yeah ...
---
Mate these are gold hahaha
---
These gifs are the best part of my day, thank you /u/Provosorisk \-- keep em coming mate!
---
You think you'll get upgrades every three hours!? You fool!
---
Took me a second to remember but the memory came rushing back. 
---
 Ugh.  Pretty sure this guy is the Horde's Hogger.  And he's not even elite.
---
Hm, I do not know about that, sir. I can't see why ally would have a higher floor, since you have Salvation as a crutch. What are you reasons behind this?
---
I can't tell if you're being ironic or stupid lol
---
And if you're a caster, just get the level 5 wand and you don't even need your spells anymore...and will carry you past 10
---
They raped paladins and all other classes on retail. It‚Äôs just not the same game. I‚Äôve tried to play multiple classes on retail but I just can‚Äôt enjoy it.
---
This is one of the things I worry about with modern wow. I worry about things like SJW culture. I only use the word because it is an easy indicator for the type of person I am speaking about. They are obsessed with fairness and consent. World pvp is the antithesis of fairness and consent. My worry is they will simply declare pvp they don't like as bullying and greifing. Because of course that's exactly what WPVP is. It's you being a bully.
---
I have some pretty serious worries that no one will be able to play the villain. No one will be able to ruin their reputation and make peoples lives miserable. Without villains. You don't get heroes. You don't get people sitting around talking about the people they hate. In short. You go from a real feeling world where fairness and consent have no place, and instead. You get the standard view of an SJW's utopia. Everyone getting along and snuggling. With no one having a bad day. Again I'll state this is Antithetical to the idea of world pvp.
---
To be clear. I am not trying to make a fuck SJW's post. They can be eye rolly sometimes but, the world holds far worse lol. I am just saying their world view is antithetical to a warzone.
---
Not to worry. You got this!
---
Hi, /u/GmrMolg
---
&gt; Yeah plus really sticky glue if you aggro an add
---
You would waste [Really Sticky Glue] on a quest mob? I'm sorry but I'm saving that for level 60 world pvp where I can soul crush someone on my shitlist with it.
---
Hey all, I have two friends who I plan to level to 60 with (on the Horde) when classic is released. One friend is going to play a protection warrior and the other a beast mastery hunter. I plan to play a healer but I am struggling to choose between a Priest, Shaman, and Druid. Any suggestion on what might synergize best with this group? Thanks!
---
&gt;It's very easy as long as you full buff
---
That's kind of the problem. Only a small fraction of the player base will have the time and the dedication to take so much time out of their week just to clear a raid. If only 0,01% of the people in classic cleared Naxx at the time, I don't see why it would be any different 12 years later. 
---
My proposal never included Naxx. I'm not interested in it, I don't think most are. Even those who believe they will raid it, ultimately won't. It's also well known now that the player base drops at the end of an expansion, this won't be any different. It's hard to remain motivated to raid for so long. It will only happen in phase 6, that could be in 2 years time for all we know. 
---
I believe an enh shaman would be fine through out phase 1 to 4. Even if you only do 70% compared to other dps class, you make up for it by bring important buffs. Those 30% lacking would be filled in the end because of WF totem.  Phase 5 might be more of a challenge and I'm honestly not calculating phase 6.
---
It just seems like a efficient way to structure your raid. You need shamans, you don't need 2345 healers. You need 1 in your tank group, 3 for your melee group and certainly you'd want one in priest group. Some raids don't value one in your priest group, I think it's a mathematical crime.
---
There's also convenient things about playing an enhancement shaman. Dragonslayer buff gives 10% spell crit, 5% melee crit and 140ap and unlike other classes, you're using 100% of that buff. There's only one flask a warrior or a rogue can use and it's flask of titans but it doesn't increase  their dps making it mediocre for them. Enh sham can use distilled wisdom or supreme power, they also use any comsumes those 2 melee classes use while using dps caster ones.
---
Imagine you're on farming status, meaning you'll probably keep your buffs. If you have a 5% spell crit base, adding to that winter's chill 10% + dragonslayer. You'll get 25% crit chance with your frost shocks, minus the 16% miss, you'd still get around 1 chance out of 5 to crit or something like that. If you get elemental devastation you'll get a 9% melee crit for 10sec. Sure it's random, but shocks are on a 4sec cd. Nothing keeps you from spamming r1 frost shocks if you're smart about mana pot and runes management. 
---
I'd say it scales well enough under the right circumstances.
---
Probably should have clarified that, you are right. I was mainly responding to the guy asking why we do not want classic youtubers influencing Blizzard on the meeting/summit - hence I was speaking about the ones "big enough" to get invited, for which I think my post applies.
---
I do like smaller Youtubers that know what they are talking about - like Skarm for example.
---
If so... Yikes.
---
People have been overusing Mr Smite and Edwin's quotes for yeaaaaars now.
---
Oh wowie, look at all that free pick pocketing money.
---
Saw like two of those.. In a year.
---
Horde only for non-premade pvp. There, when your team isnt as coordinated the usefulness if individual perks (racials) are more important. However, when you are in a coordinated premade the paladin bring too much to the table to pass up and alliance are once again better than horde.
---
As long as you do like 40-50% of its hp, then you can solo it by kiting it to the mountaineer that patrols the road nearby. There could be different leashing mechanics in actual classic though.
---
Yes, because the super low droprate xbox from Chromaggus is so easy to get that Ill just not even bother looting the bow that has a 50% drop from every MC.
---
I'm really not worried about others flaming me or giving me shit. I'm just wondering how often *I'll* be kicking *myself* for losing a 1v1 because of fear or dying to a random elite with a fear ability. I never played priest during vanilla (never hit 60 on anything), so I'm just not very sure how often I'll feel like I'm missing something. That's what I'm trying to figure out before I make my choice.
---
Why are you saying it's correct when its not? Rhok'delar is a huge upgrade over Bloodseeker in 1.12.
---
Never leveled there, I can't wait to not level there again!
---
Its too much of a hassle to get there over other zones in that range for horde, honestly.
---
True, top 5% of levelers never have big problems... but I have a feeling that will be less true this go around.
---
It's ok, he edited his comment without notice in order for you to get downvoted.
---
I'm sick and tired of you filthy horde sharing badly overpriced savory deviates so I've come many hours and invaded your territory to come get my own and you wint stop me until Blizzard makes your NPC guards one shot me when I get to close. Then I'll go home crying and back to booty bay to buy them.
---
They are pretty effective at levelling. But that doesn't stop it from being the most boring shit ever.
---
Is this the "Everyone, get in here!" room?
---
Keep up the good work, Tips. Thanks for sharing your enthusiasm for Classic! Hopefully, your content will help bring more passionate people into the fold. Much love from Brazil, brother!
---
It's not that important on 16 debuff slots.
---
Great story OP. I'm at work, with free time so it was a good time killer for a few minutes. I've never played Vanilla but I'm looking forward to it. I played retail for a few years, and never really had any wholesome experiences. Can't wait for my first level 40 in Classic, let alone 60!
---
Those are two different play styles.. based on the header, I thought you wanted to DPS.  I was going to suggest going Warrior if you wanted to DPS and just steal all of those Rogue leather pieces.   This is totally a decision you need to make.
---
Tha... that's just an alliance inn that the undead have commandeered.
---
Wait a second, is that a corgi?
---
Yeah I noticed that too! I got a free level 100 boost at the end of WoD and used it on a shaman. When legion hit I went to redo my talents and spells, but many of them were either gone or changed.
---
We don't currently know what the classic dev team's plan are for phasing. 
---
They have yet to comment on whether it will be used in starter zones, expand from there, or none at all.  The only comment we have is later on in high level zones they don't plan on using it because it would break how competition for world bosses and resources would pan out.
---
This time around I will keep a screenshot diary of my character.
---
From Level 1 till the end.
---
Cheers and congrats on the Masters, friend! Two summer classes to go and I am done with college too, hello time after work spent on Classic instead of homework! Secretly hoping for an August release ;)
---
I love Elwynn Forest, so many memories. Playing alliance, so very much looking forward to playing through there again.

Yeah for sure I also don‚Äôt have enough time so I‚Äôm gonna be using the help of many officers

Just another dumb phrase, used by those who get destroyed if they try to argue. Just like "change my mind"

F
---
Well, you have about 2 months to make your own decision because in the end whatever we tell you doesn't mean anything.
---
Yes! I‚Äôve got a wand section in the full guide of the lesser and greater magic wand, the quests for the wands in the 10-20 zones and the wand merchants in the cities that sell level 15 and 20 wands! Realistically I think on a fresh server you can get the lesser magic wand as early as level 10 because of the materials required! But Kargoz has a great guide over obtaining it and we‚Äôve tested it, it actually works out really well to finish Durotar and craft the lesser magic wand right before you head to the Barrens

If you went to the pals for life website back in the day, you would know that this definitely was racist. Leeroy's actual character model was medium/dark skin. Blizzard changed it so he was white when they decided to add the Leeroy character to their repitoire.
---
They‚Äôre both good but offer different play styles. Try looking up pvp videos of each one might appeal to you more.

Enchanting mats are free to list on the AH

Lol, I clearly took time to review the site. You right though

..And anyone that would be eligible to give an honst and informed opinion about you guys (or, at least you in particular), knew all those things.

To me these people seem like they have no idea what they are talking about. But yes, I'd also feel the need to reply if someone talked some shit about me that is absolutely not justified.

Keep up the great work Esfand, can't wait to see you stream Classic =)
---
With 1.12 loot changes to classic gear, will the Arcanite Reaper still be BiS pre raid? I know the Bonereaver's Edge will be BiS once you get it off Rag for all phases(kinda sucks there won't be any 2h progression thru-out the phases tho)
---
So are there any other options that compare to Arcanite Reaper, and do you think players will grind out all those bars to craft one or will it actually take less time to just get a Bonereaver?
---
It really depends what you plan on doing. There's a handful of different enchants that all benefit Protection in different ways.
---
* \+30 Spellpower is likely the best overall enchants. It buffs all your threat generating abilities except auto attack.
---
* Lifestealing is also great. With SoR being able tp proc effects, the Lifesteal enchant has a huge procrate (12 ppm) and with Shadow Vulnerability debuffs on the boss, it can hit quite hard. It also does a small amount of threat from its healing compoment. Overall a pretty good singletarget threat enchant.
---
* Fiery Blaze Enchantment. Obtainable from a quest in Badlands. Once per character. This enchant has a flat procrate (15% per hit) and the proc can trigger Judgement of Wisdom. I would advice you put this on a Flurry Axe and use it as a weapon to switch into when you need to regenerate mana. It's really fantastic for that.
---
* \+15 Agility. Only something I would advice if you have a weapon to use in a heavy mitigation set. Otherwise the above enchants should all be preferrable.
---
Isn't TBC when they introduced Coren Direbrew?
---
Yup they would rather rely on the human memory alone to form arguments. It is insane.
---
I might be able to help you make this decision.
---
Warrior main tank with TF- Has dedicated entire life to wow. Very low chance of girlfriend or life progress. This is normally reserved for people at a specific point in their life. Where all the stars have aligned and for a time they can be WoW man. As an MT you will not be able to miss a raid. Wow will be your life.
---
Rogue- A fuck off class. You can top dps so people will want you. You are also a yellow bar cockroach so no one will miss you when you dip for the night. Allows for far more real lifeing. This is why I personally chose Rogue over Warrior. Even though I prefer warrior. I am at a point in my life where if something is going to be told to fuck off. It will be wow not IRL,

&gt; I have never stretched stretched out a topic for revenue. I do sometimes do longer discussion style videos. The reason for this is that most people who watch videos arent waist-deep in the news like we are, so its important to recap so people can actually understand the context of the discussion topic. Feel free to browse through my channel videos to see the lengths; seldom is a video actually 10 mins. 
---
Like somebody said, your last video was 7 minutes of content and 4 minutes of sellout. And while your average video length is greater than 10 minutes for sure, many of those videos 18 minute videos could have been 7 minutes without losing any information. The deep dives, I dig though ;-)

The "no changes community" doesn't care about changes in technical aspects, higher resolution graphics, sane keyboard settings by default, no mandatory Wed. Serverdown, etc.

The "no changes community" cares about things that change the gameplay. The fact that we can enjoy classic on our modern 1080 or 4k monitors, instead of having to dust off a 14 year old, 14kg CRT monitor after digging it out of our attic, is not something that impacts gameplay.

I never saw that, but would have been interesting.  I feel like there used to be an issue with some weapons on models if it was unintended and I feel like it would show a square box with an '?' on it.  Could be wrong though.
---
One thing to remember about Druids is they only have a battle Rez on a 30m cd but Druids are soo fun. In the early levels you can run a feral spec and still heal dungeons if you have int gear. 
---
I would make sure you like the theme and the different specs of the class Incase you want to swap roles down the road to switch things up. 
---
All are solid options and each have their own niches.
---
He's not entirely joking I think. Beastslaying just adds a straight up +6 damage on your SoR when fighting beasts which translates into decent threat with RF.
---
Not while this is almost certainly just a private server bug, it does make the enchant somewhat useful there.
---
Eww, mrgm is still a thing?
---
Same. Trying to finish before classic comes out so I can no life it.
---
Did this with a couple buddies once. We called it "cleansing the land of noobs." Took us a couple hrs, but we stopped for cleansing purposes a few times.
---
I stopped playing pallys when Holy power became a thing.  I loved the class in wrath.
---
Thanks, this is great!
---
The Str only affect your Autoattack while also giving you like 6.5 Block Value while its up. Not really that great for Paladins.
---
Hello, I appreciate this, however it's not the page I am thinking of. Petopia is fantastic, but the site I am thinking of has them all side by side including stat differences.
---
Nope, Sheltie.
---
Or a Collie, I can't tell. They're basically the same breed.
---
Badass, Druid was my 3rd character in vanilla too!  But I was resto.  And I remember getting perm tree form and was soooooo hyped.
---
&gt; so no need internal information to deduce that it most likely won't be in the game
---
Apparently r/classicwow has a different definition of "proof" and enough people believe in said definition to downvote anyone who actually asks for real proof.
---
Classy.
---
[here](https://mobile.twitter.com/MrGMYT/status/1126176910826983424)
---
Disagree. It's really difficult to reach defense cap as a Paladin. Not even Warriors really care about it anymore since threat is by far more important.
---
Since you will get crit occasionally, Reckoning just adds more Threat. It's not a bad talent. For 5mans its absolutely fantastic.
---
Then sit on your arse for 5 minutes until Cooldowns are back up :D
---
Haha wow... That's one way to get yourself blacklisted from any futures invites from any developer ever. RIP
---
What? Druids have normal ressurection,mass ressurection and revive spell which can be used in combat to revive ally?
---
Let me get that barman's shanker
---
What a glorious time, when PvP videos were not yet poisoned by a constant barrage of bad dubstep :P
---
I do know what you're talking about, I think that there used to be a page on petopia with exactly that.  Not sure if that's no more or it was in fact a different site
---
&gt;strength increasing the amount blocked.
---
6.5 Block Value when the boss hits for 2000 damage. Just saying.
---
STAHP! :D
---
Iam just a bit angsty that the game will come out before i finish..because knowing myself iam gonna no life it either way lol
---
I vaguely remember it having a black background with a blue theme?
---
You can only rez once every 30 mins.
---
Sounds interesting üôÇ what is the average age of tour guild members?üôÇ
---
They have a battle Rez ability in vanilla that has a 30 min C... I‚Äôm actually going to main a Druid in classic this time around
---
Where are you seeing this revive spell at lvl 12? That‚Äôs only on retail. In classic Druids only have a battle rez that has a 30m cd.
---
In classic wow, druids don't learn revive.
---
This is the classic wow reddit are you lost?
---
Mine is due this fall, but I'm trying to get as much done as I can before launch.  People keep telling me they can't believe how responsible I am since I'm so much further along with my research than the rest of my cohort.  I haven't told anyone that it's because I want to nolife a 15 year old computer game this summer.
---
Good luck!
---
I absolutely cannot decide what I want to play.
---
I have only played vanilla on private servers, started in wotlk and ended in Cata.
---
I generally prefer casters, and got r1 gladiator in both s7 and s8 on two different toons as mage and warlock.
---
My concern with classic is that warlocks have no way to handle melee if they get tanked with a fellhunter out.
---
It‚Äôs really between mage and warlock.
---
I don‚Äôt mind micro mgmt and actually excel at it.
---
I‚Äôll Ben mostly pvping, don‚Äôt care about pve except for gear.
---
I‚Äôll be playing with two irl friendsD a disc priest and a warrior.
---
They want me to go mage, but I‚Äôm leaning towards lock.
---
Pet mgmt does seem kind of bad in vanilla,
---
With no way to resummon a pet during fears length due to long cast time.
---
It‚Äôs 15 minutes for the shortened cast time on cd from demo?
---
Hell yeah brother same here!
---
It's not really going to be pure classic and nostalgia is a gas tank.
---
Every instance of a shit game mechanic you forgot existed resurfaces you lose a little nostalgia gas.
---
At one point most players will be upset about it and ask for changes.
---
Forum beasts begin to creep in from the marshes and slowly grow into a collosus.
---
Blizzard does what they do and screw things up but either not doing anything or doing too much and bam! No longer "classic" even though it wasnt to begin with.
---
If you're going to raid you need some gear. Getting into a group as a rogue was hard in vanilla, and you would have to wait for hours to get a group together. If you go the warrior route you can start off with a tank spec, get into a group instantly and roll on that phat lewt. You are much more likely to be able to start a group and keep those classes you don't want to share loot with from joining. Making you get the gear you want faster.
---
Just my two cents..
---
This. This is why I am going Rogue over Warrior, lol. Warrior is not only demanding in raid, but requires much more time and dedication to truly master in comparison to Rogue - and I am NOT saying rogue is a super easy class to master, just easier in comparison to warrior.
---
All the classes are pretty much the same now.
---
Been tanking my way through dungeons on a paladin, a warrior, and a monk, and they are all the exact same class. I have a druid tank that I haven't gotten to using yet but from what I could tell it's exactly the same as the others. Haven't checked out the Death Knight yet.
---
Why so many tanks? I was a shaman throughout classic. Resto raider.   
---
When TBC came around I made a warrior, and taking was fucking *amazing*. So I made a paladin and tanking was a whole other experience but still great. So I made a druid, and tanking with that was pretty much somewhere between warrior and Paladin so still great, but healing was where I felt the druid shined.
---
Warrior tanks got such a ridiculous amount of love in TBC. The things you could do with proper use of cooldowns, THREE charges, and your offensive abilities was just off the charts. Some healers remarked how insane it was watching me zoom around dungeons barely taking damage even though I pulled entire rooms.   
---
There really was nothing like it. 
---
Returning to BfA lately is just... drab. It's drab. Tanking used to be fun, now I'm just annoyed that there's no "optimal" way of doing things. Monks are the worst, the entire schtick is keeping a DoT up on yourself and clearing it. Pathetic as fuck, infuriating even.
---
Yeah private servers are so much easier with their Black Lotus dropping like candy and their world buffs firing off every five seconds instead of having a proper server cooldown.
---
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs up! I‚Äôm so pumped for my Tauren adventure
---
Same same &lt;3
---
Blizz is going out of their way to make an entire phase dedicated to wpvp. I dont think Blizz is going to ban wpvp lmao
---
Are you sure?  I was a Troll Male Rogue in vanilla purely because I wanted to min/max PVE dps. My biggest regret the entire time was being a Troll because I thought the UD looked wayyyyyy better.
---
Lifesteal procrate is 6ppm (12ppm with SoR). Weapon speed makes no difference.
---
10th anniversary MC kiddies gonna be in for a treat when they hit garr and suddenly you actually need warlock banish
---
[Listen at 5:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4)
---
"The complaints were all pretty valid," 
---
What the players never understood at the time, myself included. Is that it is much better to rely on other players to help mitigate issues. Over simply having the company wave a magic wand and suddenly you don't need friends to help you anymore. Now you can play the game alone completely unhindered by inconvenience. Turns out being miserable together. Is way better then being handed everything alone.
---
Rofl clearly took a wrong turn
---
No only curse / magic / poison spells basically spell like abilitys that are staples to the class. Trinkets, racial cannot be despelled. And shamans can purge buffs &amp; hunters /warlocks can drain mana

I hate The Office but these memes are freaking hilarious.
---
Yesss! Can‚Äôt wait to be zooming around zones picking flowers.
---
&gt;Crusader offers Damage Reduction though.
---
People say this, and they never do math.
---
Crusader enchant is 6.5 Block Value. Thats barely worth mentioning, especially since the reduction only occur when you are actually blocking. The heal from lifesteal alone will make up for that, while doing more singletarget threat.
---
You will clear kill quests faster but collect quests slower.  Also you will get a massive -exp% penalty for being in a group above 2
---
I feel you man. That's why I stopped playing a few months ago. I've been way too hype for Classic, and I spent way too much time playing OSRS efficiently. It got to a point where it felt like if I wasn't playing efficiently I was just wasting my time. It definitely becomes a chore lol
---
The Grim Guzzler doesn't spring to mind when someone mentions iconic taverns in WoW.
---
Bet that place stinks...
---
"if you're going to raid you need some gear. Getting into a group as a rogue was hard in vanilla"
---
All too true. Everything in classic is work. Their are levels to this shit though. Warriors will put out 1000% times the work a rogue will need to just to succeed. That being said your criticism of rogues finding dungeons is all too true.
---
That being said as we all know. Classic dungeon finder is the rogue class lol.
---
These are gold my friend
---
Want to stealth and use poison? Rogue. Want to tank? Warrior.
---
Dispel does not remove curse effects.
---
It means i'm retarded
---
I worked it out, It CompanionCodex, however for some reason my internet provider is stating the website is unsafe and blocking it.
---
It works, it just works slow, and thats totally fine.
---
Everyone will always have the updated gear, no one rage quits, and there is less down time looking for others
---
As far as xp goes, its horrid.  But thats ok!  In between dungeons you can either all go solo or travel around in a group destroying quests to get to the next dungeon.
---
Cool :D The average age seems to be around 25-30.
---
In my experience, rogues have to eat just as much as mages after a fight, because if you spend your time on damage mitigation (Kidney Shot), you're going to take a long, long time to kill every single mob. And it doesn't really matter if you have to fill up HP or Mana, both are resources you need to fight mobs. Mages stop going out OOM super quickly at a certain point, and as soon as Frostbite/Shatter comes online you're going to start saving some serious mana in the long run because of all the crits. Rogues on the other hand have to go toe-to-toe with every mob they fight, so their HP is always going to dwindle, they don't really have any way to avoid that. 
---
Admittedly, I haven't leveled a rogue to 60 since vanilla, but I played one on an unnamed server to 47. I've leveled quite a few mages in the last couple of years, and in my experience, they are faster. ESPECIALLY if you take AoE grinding into the equation. Now, your mileage may vary, and I think as long as one is enjoying themselves, it doesn't really matter how long something takes.
---
This is my favorite thing to happen to this sub since The Age of Blue Posts.
---
Thank you, u/Provosorisk, for this wonderful gift you've given us.
---
That's definitely ironic don't worry.
---
Haha same here! I‚Äôm going HOTW till WSG drops and then full resto with herb and eng.. HBU?
---
How much can you tell us?  
---
Also props for coming to the thread where everyone is shitting on you.
---
My bro was a tank pally back then and he shares the same view. He quit playing that class in legion
---
I'm not talking about wanting to take 20 months to hit 60. I've planned my route out and should be 60 and key attuned within 8-9 days /played so I get wanting to push things. I completely understand 1-60 racing and all of that. I'm saying that having an entire guild essentially require it's members to play 18+hrs/day for several days and then farm MC trash to hit reverend with hydraxian waterlords to kill rag in a week seems (to me) too tryhardy.  I've heard of some guilds planning to camp faction cities for weeks to prevent progression of the opposing side. Sure the game technically allows it, but it's toxic AF. I mean play the game however you want. Live your best life or w/e. It doesnt effect me as long as I pick a different server. But I personally don't feel that being forced to play within such a narrow scope of what's acceptable to be fun.
---
I'm very similar to that, and while I have to skip some episodes now when I rewatch, I very strongly suggest giving the show a go - especially after season one, it just becomes genuinely funny, and isn't terribly cringey all the time.
---
I'm upvoting you regardless because you have your post marked as speculation and either way, I appreciate the information!
---
Most bosses can't be slowed, can they?
---
Don‚Äôt forget mana burn on priests!
---
My point is this isn't like artifact.
---
That just links to your profile that has a single post that redirects to a T-shirt selling page. 
---
I smell shenanigans.
---
You don't owe these dildoes an explanation. You clearly know your shit and are passionate about the game, which is why I love Classicast so much: everyone on there loves the game and has put a lot of work into building community and hype. 
---
Keep it up man!
---
Well there is Zyzz, the Internet meme body builder...
---
Shaman. Find a warrior to follow and pocket heal dropping wf totem. Plenty of utility with the slowing totem, resist/grounding totems, rank 1 es spell interrupt, purge, fs for instant slow, and even be a backup flag runner with gw. Oh yeah, and chain heal.
---
Shanker!
---
Soooooo dispel is both a spell and an action from other spells.
---
Gotcha, I don‚Äôt follow wow subs that much so could be why I don‚Äôt see it.
---
Whew! you are quite the douche.
---
Low effort meme tbh
---
What's the % exp breakdown for levelling in groups of 2-5 people? Is 2 the most efficient?
---
You dispel (offensively) only magic buffs. You can dispel stuff like most class buffs (fortitude, mark of the wild, pally blessings) but can‚Äôt dispel non-magic buffs like Battle Shout, Sprint, etc. 
---
If you mouseover your buffs, it will tell you if it‚Äôs a magic buff. Same for debuffs, it will show if it‚Äôs a Curse, Magic, Poison or Disease debuff. There are also un-marked debuffs (no types specified) like Hamstring, and I think bleeds are also unmarked but not 100% sure. 
---
As a rule of thumb, you can offensively dispel buffs cast by other players or mobs. You generally want to dispel mage/priest shields and pally blessings such as freedom.

---
You're right, and yeah this used to be Hunter's Pet Bestiary which is what I was picturing.  Glad to help but also find this myself lol
---
My goal is more about progression, what gear I have isn't as important as the guild I'm in getting through AQ &amp; Naxx. If I'm contributing, my gear will be fine.
---
Limit already over. Settled for 3 weeks at the start of july.
---
I truly hope you are right. That being said. Blizz is located in Irvine California. So what they consider "world pvp" may be different from our view. World pvp is all about taking away consent. It's all about forcing a type of content on someone else. Yes I know they picked a pvp server but, their view of what that means could be very different from yours.
---
For example I see no issue with camping a player for hours on end. I think it is a rotten thing to do but, I also love that people can be rotten. It is part of a motivating force for other people to ride out and meet them. It's this lack of consent and ability to terrorize other players that makes pvp servers unforgettable. It drives faction enmity and makes the game more immersive and better.

So to prevent any advantage for someone who mashes their buttons 6 times per second?

---
Yeah same, I eventually want to get a set for balance for the memes.
---
It makes sense as it is. Lowbies complaining about quest givers being killed.
---
That is what they TRY to bring, but healing shamans are a myth. Hardly anyone plays a shaman to heal. Sure there are some, but you are right with them always needing more.
---
I want to believe
---
Goodluck with the wife portion of that equation.
---
lmao I'm adding this to the list
---
A shaman and the warlock his pet, the fellhunter, can purge. This means they can remove benificial effects, such as buffs, from an attackable target. Those are the only two that can do this in whole vaanilla.
---
god Towelliee makes me rolls my eyes, guy constantly was shitting on classic the past 2 years.
---
Seriously. That and I haven't found a face on any of the new models (female models at least) that isn't horrifying to look at.
---
You didn‚Äôt play Classic did you?
---
I am in the exact same situation man! Best of luck, and see you on the other side!
---
Dude, play a NE priest. Unless you‚Äôre in a super hardcore guild (which I doubt you are/plan to be since you‚Äôre asking reddit which class to play), not being a dwarf isn‚Äôt going to stop you from raiding. Plenty of guilds will need LOTS of priests for raids, and while fear ward is a plus it‚Äôs not required for every priest. Hell its not even needed for every encounter in every raid. You say you don‚Äôt want to be a dwarf so don‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs a game. Be what you want.  You say you want benediction (which honestly is cool as fuck), so go priest. You can alt a Druid if you want. 
---
I‚Äôve leveled two dwarf priests to 60, once in vanilla and once on a private server, and both times all I thought about was how ugly that little fucker was and how I wish I had rolled human or NE.  You have to look at your toon for a LONG time through leveling. Just make one you want to look at. It‚Äôs a game - are you going to enjoy being the race/class combo most appealing to you for 2 years, or having fear ward for a few boss fights?
---
Better dead than red, horde filth.
---
And don't forget dudefellabros, nips out!
---
You should probably save the skull for the "boss" in the cultist cave for the "This Item Starts a Quest" drop.
---
God I wish the strikes had made it in, apparently they were just placeholders until the Seal system was finished. But man they made the class so much fun.
---
It's not just the comments though. In fact, I can take toxic comments for the most part. It's the downvotes that bury good topics/discussions that piss me off the most.
---
As someone who never played vanilla then, it was like hacking thr mainframe.
---
I'm not going to go through all your video. But of the most recent 18 videos. 
---
* 12 are 10+ minutes 6 being 15+. 3 of those are nearly half an hour. and 1 deep dive which is a deep dive so it being long is totally fine imo.
---
* 4 are 8+ minutes, 2 of those 4 videos are 16/17 seconds away from being 10 minutes.
---
* Only 2 of your last 18 videos are sub 7 minutes.
---
Now I don't dislike you like a lot of people on this subreddit seem to, in fact I enjoy your videos...not all of them, to be fair. However I think it's a bit untrue to say "seldom is a video actually 10 mins" when at a glance it easily looks as if 50% or more of your videos historically are over 10 minutes, and when 66% of your last 18 videos are over 10 minutes.
---
That being said, even if you were stretching out two minute videos, who cares? You're just trying to survive like all the other content creators. I haven't seen many of your videos, but keep killin' it brother.
---
salty boi
---
The real hero
---
But at least you're not debasing yourself while playing.
---
Jerry, I got a great idea. Let's roll ice mages and farm DM, what could go wrong?
---
I remember rocking the gear pieces 10 or so levels out of date on the regular.
---
People think that just because paladins lack on demand burst they are slow levelers but they really aren't.
---
Leveling is a marathon not a sprint and pallys have staying power that allows them to kill one mob after another without stopping. Your not a hunter or a warlock but your basically a warrior/rogue who never has to eat or drink and you also have cooldowns that save you from a graveyard run and let you even solo certain encounters that those two classes couldn't.
---
Especially up until around level 45 you can match the dps of any class outside of hunter. I would regularly top damage meters once I got SoC and this was playing with other good players who were leveling at a quick pace.
---
are we having the "golden days" of this sub?
---
What about realm population caps? I really think this should be discussed more, I have a bad feeling Blizz will up it. Also the amount of realms at launch.
---
Just get her to play with you! Problem solved

Hi, is there possibility(or to add this funcionality in the future) to use logical disjunction between parameters?

F.e. i want to search all cloth items in phase 1 that have spelldmg or spellhit or spellcrit

I would use something like  
---
subtype:cloth phase:1 (has:spelldmg OR has:spellhit OR has:spellcrit)

And I'm sorry you can't make a cohesive, coherent statement without having to add another comment after the fact to try and make yourself look less like an ignorant dink.
---
Also, not my favourite YouTuber, I just respect their work and don't like people misrepresenting it.
---
Alright, let's do this. BRIIIING OOOON WOOOOOW
---
Druids are the best flag carriers in wsg. Druids are not viable MT in raids. Period.
---
I think Holy and Ret can tank those dungeons just as well as (or maybe even better than) a Prot Paladin, as long as they have a few points in the Prot tree for Imp Righteous Fury. You don't need Holy Shield to help mitigate crushing blows in a dungeon.
---
You still think you do, but you still don't
---
WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDS?
---
Efficiency drops as a group expands due to area, as players in a group go up you are able to kill things faster at a compareable rate to the group members you requier, Ie with 3 players you get 1/3 xp, 5 players 1/5 xp. The limiting factor is range at which people can receive kill xp/loot, a group of 5 people are going to have to act more nomadic than a group of 2.
---
Boooo
---
Probably favorite so far üòÇ
---
Asmongold said he knows the Beta date a few days ago.
---
My guess is beta is dropped tomorrow, all the classic content creators release their videos, and Blizz gives them bets keys to give out to viewers to generate more hype.
---
Dwight is a hardcore classic raid LEADER
---
Ah, this is perfect. Thanks. Yer, not sure what's happened with the site.
---
I hope you don't let the haters get to you. My friends and I all love your content and enthusiasm for Classic.
---
Remember the satanic whispering children at midnight?
---
Using your formula you get more total XP the bigger your group is tho?
---
Is dungeon grinding viable at this point if you've got a group of 5 anyway?
---
These are awesome XD love them.
---
Madseason is the best. Dude should be the gold standard for classic content creation.
---
Hmm okay. That doesn't sound very good for a Hunter
---
Towelliee is an egomaniac and a hypocrite. he just does whatever seems to be a popular thing to say.
---
At first he appeased to his massive BfA fanboy audience, but now that most of them are gone he is being a hypocrite in favor of classic now.
---
Use gold from enchanting to buy cloth?
---
Only the true messiah would deny his own divinity
---
Atleast you made a joke about this the other people just jumping to conclusions without asking questions. I will be detailing it a bit more later just wanted to get this posted asap.
---
No dungeon exp is pretty bad. You would need to have each pull of the dungeon optimized and speed clearing. Most people run a dungeon for specific drops or quest rewards.

What's the alliance equivalent to crossroads? I played alliance and would always raid crossroads but I'm horde for classic and want to wreak havoc on some allies and take their town.
---
Why should I play druid over rogue/warrior
---
Grind elites and massacre alliance.... gg
---
As a fellow content creator (for another game) you have my sympathies. Being known and loved by some also means being known and hated by others. You can't have one without the other. You seem to handle it well though!
---
I miss totems for shamans. I miss seals for paladins. I miss stances for warriors. Retail just feels gutted.
---
My (very basic) understanding is the the client or server processes players actions at set intervals. For this example, lets say that interval is 0.5 seconds. It looks like this:
---
|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
---
So two mages cast Poly on each other within one of these intervals. Even though one mage cast his Poly 0.1 seconds faster that the other, both Polys take effect within one of these intervals, so you have two sheep wandering around. 
---
This same system is used in retail, but the intervals are much shorter, let's say 0.1 seconds. Looks like this:
---
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
---
The above example could still happen in retail, it's just MUCH less likely. Hope this helped.
---
I can believe it. On stream the other day Asmon remarked that he knew when the classic beta/retail launch was. He didnt specify but the context was beta I believe.
---

Looking at this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaVmoxse1_4), it takes 69 minutes and 5 seconds to run from the Booty Bay inn to Stratholme. Since Undercity is closer, it will take less time.

What the fuck shaman don't have totems?
---
Interested. Posting to come back to later
---
Last Friday on Joanas stream a guy said big announcement in 2 weeks

Sure mate.

Yeah but first ill need to level up that enchanting, and to do that ill need cloth to get the materials.
---
wut.?
---
Ehh, that kinda depends on your guilds rules/guild loot council...
---
And 30 spell dmg is +1 dmg per tick of consecrate which isn't very relevant either. Neither will make or break you. Also the enchant isn't even out at release.

---
Totally depends on whether you are on a guild run or pug.
---
Pug run every rouge should roll. In a guild run, they can all bid what dkp they think it‚Äôs worth. That‚Äôs totally fair.
---
So your "special" ?
---
I‚Äôm a fan of any rogue as long as they respec daggers. I can see why the current dagger rogues would get priority though.
---
He does. Of all the wow content creators/streamers he was the most vocal against it. He also was demanding it be its on category on twitch instead of being clumped into retail wow. 
---
The man is rather insufferable and it makes me happy that his channel essentially dies when other streamers are on.
---
"YOU CAN PRY THIS CRT FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"
---
I don't know what kind of answer you are expecting lol this fully depends on your guild.
---
Tbh 2 toons lvling to 60 should give you enough cloth to manage, managed to make everything I needed with my lock doing 0 cloth farming and just sending over stuff from alts
---
Hey, looking for a semi-hardcore raiding guild for Classic.
---
Looking for: NA | PVP | Faction doesn't matter
---
Raid Times: Any time after 10PM EST. 
---
I will be playing Dwarf Priest (A) or Undead Priest (H).
---
I played WoW from Vanilla - Cata, and have private server experience up to C'thun.  Dedicated and will be prepared for raids.
---
There is a chance I'll have a few friends initially playing with me at launch, but I'm unsure how dedicated they'll be.  So, if you accept socials, that's especially great!
---
Feel free to PM me here.
---
Hopefully Madseasonshow was invited?
---
I think it's actually 
---
MXP / (P# * Modifier)
---
MXP is the monster exp from the kill. P# is the number of members.  Modifier is the modifier he listed.
---
So with a monster that gives 100 exp in a 1 person party would give 100 (duh).
---
In a 4 person party it would give 100 / (4 * 1.3) = 19 exp.
---
Im almost positive itd take longer to level another char than it would for you farm as disc
---
It's more that, if two mages are trying to polymorph each other at the same time, if they press the button within ~0.1 second of each other, they will both get sheeped because both spells are considered part of the same batch (there is a new batch every 0.2 seconds).
---
That made the game more fair for people with low fps or bad latency, or when the server was hungover and laggy.
---
In modern WoW, it's realtime, so if you hit polymorph a few ms earlier, they get sheeped and you don't.
---
This sub is finally starting to put out some good content . With that said....LOOK AT THAT GOODEST BOY!
---
Because the video you‚Äôre basing your arguments on is a complete joke. 
---
* Using gear that enhances realistically won‚Äôt get
---
* Not using Windfury totem, using agi totem to pad their own meters instead
---
* Not using Nightfall
---
* Fully consumed up and flasked, as well as having full optimal debuffs on the target
---
Nobody is going to flask on an enhance, and guilds that can get all those debuffs on a boss won‚Äôt bring an enhance shaman in the first place. 
---
On top of that, if you‚Äôre entitled to the point of playing enhancement shaman instead of playing what‚Äôs useful for the raid, then you aren‚Äôt going to pull your weight consumables-wise, let alone flask up every raid.
---
Make RobJob great again
---
No because you still split that xp among 5 members. Lets say the total xp of a mob is 500. You get a small 1.4x boost to that 500, but then you divide it by 5 and that's the xp each person gets, which is much lower than if 1-2 people were in a group.
---
Well, it could be problematic when a key element of vanilla was gold scarcity as well as having to make meaningful choices and really consider whether respeccing for the 6th time is worth it.
---
I get that it's not everybody's cup o' tea, it's a fairly pedantic interpretation of vanilla but it's exactly the kind of mechanic a lot of us are looking forward to. It's one of those gray areas where it'd be welcome by some, but genuinely disliked by some others.
---
The only totems left are cooldowns, like mana tide. A very select few returned as PvP talents, but it's nowhere near the level of vanilla/tbc/wotlk totems.
---
Nah I think there were better options than the Arcanite Reaper at that time, or at least very similar and easier to get. I just wanted one because I thought they were cool!
---
Calling it now, next update Monday 13th... my Birthday gift from Blizzard :)
---
Happy to see you unbanned. Not everyone on this sub hates the classic cast crew.
---
If you also pay for my house and car, I will be your personal healer all the way to gm/hw
---
You get slightly more total exp.
---
What if they want the dagger for PvP and respec occasionally for that purpose and use the dagger then, but continue using swords for PvE? 
---
I think if you want to spend DKP to get it, you should (so long as it‚Äôs something your class can use/is useful to you, not like a warlock bidding on it) - whether you respec or not is not the guild‚Äôs concern - you earn DKP so you can spend it how you want.
---
30 seconds. Once per pull but you can judge righteousness on separate elites to tag those. Exorcism for the rest if you're in strat or scholomance. Don't even need defense gear really.
---
No he‚Äôs right. Passed lvl 45, sometimes you don‚Äôt switch items for quite a long time
---
Weird. I didn‚Äôt. Neither did a single person I know. To be fair, though, none of us ever experienced the challenge that people refer to so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If mob XP is 500 and 5 people are killing one mob each without grouping, they get 500 XP each. If those people group up instead, they get 700 XP each. To me it seems like you should always try to group up with others nearby players if that formula is correct, assuming the other players aren't killing mobs significantly slower than you.
---
I plan on dinging 60 at the end of week 1. I have no concerns about STV. I think everyone else in my level range by that point will also be more concerned about quickly leveling than pointless low level PvP. Unless there's a contested questing area killing someone helps speed up....
---
What does druid FC most resemble as far as retail FCs go? Is the best spec supposed to take a bunch of damage, or is it more of reliant on out pacing the enemy team?
---
I‚Äôm not hating but why is having an opinion ‚Äútoxic‚Äù?
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear what happened...
---
Just looked through your account, straight up carrying this sub. Holy shit
---
Pay attention to the sticky threads.
---
**You're not even my real daaaad!**
---
Oh yeah gazzuz. Hes a bitch. He is level 14 though so im not sure you could solo him even with the skull
---
Still rolling need on int rings in deadmines on your warrior and advocating rolling need on items in groups to vendor them?
---
I'd add to that my primary gripe with GW2 (and ESO, and DCUO, and and and...): unlimited instant/fast travel. As long as you've been to a region and hit the asura gate you can 'port there instantly from anywhere else. It made this great big world ANet had created for us to run around in feel about as expansive as my living room.
---
In WoW, if you're tooling around in Ferelas and your guild mate tells you about something awesome going on in the Hinterlands, there was generally only one way to get there: hoof it to the nearest flightmaster, fly up to Darkshore or Orgrimmar, zone to EK, hit up the flightmaster again then hoof it to wherever the thing in Hinterlands is happening.
---
You might be able to skip the first half of that with your hearthstone or 'port to a capital city if you were a mage (or pay one for a portal), but even with whatever shortcuts there was no getting around needing to fly/run through the world to wherever it was you were going. Which meant, at any given time, you had characters of all levels running all 'round the world for one reason or another, making it all feel alive.
---
I really can't overstate how excited I am to get back to the game world *being an actual world* being a significant factor of play again.
---
Most BiS list it as best pre-raid tho, so unless the 1.12 loot changes that for some reason, it will still be the best til you get the Bonereaver. 
---
There was a 2h sword from Dire Maul (Barbarous Blade) that would replace the AR, but since the 1.12 version of Bonereavers Edge will be obtainable in phase 1, there may never be a need for the Blade unless you're unlucky with Ragnaros loot or don't raid.
---
Hunter loot.
---
I‚Äôd roll a priest alt just for this. May Odin guide you
---
I agree, If there are enough mobs and people are killing mobs as quick as you, then it‚Äôs advantageous to group up.
---
Even in non-loot council systems like DKP or SK, any sane guild will still have policies around who can take what loot. In this case, generally the rogues would have identified themselves as daggers or swords respectively to the rogue class lead who would then limit the item to the dagger rogues. 
---
It also depends on the current level of gear. If one of the sword rogues had Vis'kag and Brut blade, they'd be excluded. However if you were looking at a sword rogue who was rocking dallrends, they might express to the class lead that if given the dagger they will switch to daggers, particularly if said rogue was non-human.
---
Sentinel Hill, Lakeshire, Darkshire
---
Automod removed it because LHC is both an in-game location and a certain pserver. Let's try this again.
---
Here you go. It's lengthy, and some of them might not work out so well. Some are pretty well known and some might take advantage of pserver bugs that won't exist in classic.
---
## ANY
---
* Camp Humar the Pridelord in Barrens and kill him. Pre-cata his spawn timer was estimated at 8-12 hours and was a popular hunter tame.
---
* Kill people on boats.
---
* Kill escort NPCs.
---
* Healer: Heal friendly mobs enemy faction players are attacking (Kul'tiras in Durotar, Dalaran mages in Silverpine, etc)
---
* Stealth: Hide at enemy boat launches and kill people just before the boat arrives so they miss it.
---
* Stealth: Hide in an enemy capital and gank unsuspecting flagged players when they're alone.
---
* Stealth: With Engineering and Explosive sheep, pay a visit to enemy starting zones.
---
* Alliance: Kill the high elf escort NPC in The Barrens just before he arrives in Ratchet, causing horde to waste 20+ minutes of their time
---
* Alliance: Kill lowbies in northern Stone Talon Mountains so they have a long corpse walk. Bonus points if it's in the druid cave during a group quest.
---
* Horde: Head to Menethil Harbor and get on the stationary boat across from the one that goes to Dustwallow Marsh. Swim to the docks to avoid guard aggro. There will be a constant stream of lowbies to gank as they try to take the boat to Kalimdor. When the alliance 60s show up have your crew retreat to the captains cabin. If you're organized, you will be almost impossible to remove even if vastly out numbered.
---
## HUNTER
---
* Night Elf: PvP flag and shadowmeld with a generic named low level pet like "Boar" or "Plainstrider" outside Crossroads or other populated Horde hub and wait for lowbies to attack pet, get flagged, and kill them.
---
* Hide in a high or well hidden location so you won't be found then use Eyes of the Beast to kill other players.
---
## MAGE
---
* Throw up a portal to the furthest away faction capital and tell people to click the summoning portal.
---
* Keep sheeping other players' mob so it quick-heals and won't die. Works for enemy and friendly players alike.
---
## PRIEST
---
* MC people into the lava in BRM.
---
* MC people off of boats between continents. This is a pretty well known one and can be hard to pull off.
---
* MC the flight master at LHChapel (EPL) so the guards kill it.
---
* MC Goblins from a safe spot and kill low level players with them.
---
* Alliance: Hide behind flight master in Felwood horde camp and MC horde off the cliff
---
* Alliance: MC people as they approach/get off the Great Lift at 1k/Barrens. Bonus point if your name is Gravity or falling-themed.
---
## ROGUE
---
* Follow leveling opposing faction players around and just sap them. Don't ever unstealth. Just sap them several times then move on.
---
* Use 'Distract' on enemy players to interrupt auto-run/follow just to be annoying.
---
## WARLOCK
---
* Summon people off of cliffs
---
* Keep banishing demons or elementals other players are attacking so it won't die.
---
* Summon infernal on friendly low level towns and let it run amok.
---
* Follow leveling enemy warriors around and keep Curse of Weakness up on them.
---
## WARRIOR
---
* Taunt enemy player pets in neutral cities. The pet will attack you, and the guards will kill the pet and its master.
---
If I'm understanding it correctly:
---
500 xp per kill solo
---
1.4x multiplier in a group of 5 = 700
---
But that is the full xp for the entire party, you divide the 700 by 5, giving you 140 xp each.
---
You get significantly less when you group up. It has it's pros and cons, but too many cons to be worth in my opinion.
---
No it's unnecessary. Your should never be farming what you need unless it BoP. Instead you farm what is the most efficient GPH. Then you buy what you need. In the cast of a priest. That will be DM when it comes out. Not sure what you do before that.
---
Popularity does not and has never directly reflected the quality of content
---
You can get a mod that will show buffs with a colored frame based on the type of buff, that way you can tell at a glance what is able to be dispelled.
---
No, they get 700 divided 5 ways or 140 XP.  They will be able to kill more mobs quickly though.  For example if you need to explore a kobold or yeti cave, your group could clear the entire cave in the time it would take a solo player to get through the first few mobs.
---
People just joke on him because he always talks about vanilla when he never hit level 60 on retail vanilla.
---
Sorry! I will do in the future!
---
They just have more mobility and options than any other fc, abolish poisons , shift out of roots, self heals, feral charge into travel form.
---
These are comedy genius
---
i always stay just for fun
---
WHAT DOES THIS MEEEEAN
---
Ok mr human basic af combat swords. With that logic, a dwarf rogue who is daggers has every right to roll on a precious sword you want as well.
---
The hero we need , but not the hero we deserve
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs not like raids require a lot of tanks. How many tanks does molten core need?
---
You don‚Äôt take holy shield for threat, you need it for the block value because outside of redoubt and your shield you have none.
---
You won‚Äôt be able to tank anything as ret, they have no damage mitigation without speccing into the prot tree. Unlike warriors who have shield block and shield wall regardless of your spec.  
---
Likewise you don‚Äôt get anything to help your tanking from the ret tree. 31 prot and 20 holy is probably the best bet for dungeons because you double as a backup healer. (with a decent +healing set)
---
Yea of course you get less **per mob**, but if 5 people are killing mobs then you also get your share of XP from the other 4 peoples mob kills so 560 extra XP for mobs you didn't kill and 140 XP for the mob you killed.
---
did not pick up on that at all, i personally like his videos .. and the fact that they are longer.. gives me something to watch .. and as far as milking the ad revenue.. that is job.. what do you expect him to not try to maximize his revenue?
---
I found this thread because in just a few days of posting and reading through this sub, I noticed an unusually high proportion of the population seems intent to spread aggression and hostility far and wide and wanted to see if I was alone in this observation. Turns out I wasn't. Compare this, then, to the warframe subreddit for example. It's another MMO with a passionate fan-base but it manages to not glorify, rationalize, and tolerate emotional vampires like this sub does. 
---
Instead, the warframe community prides itself on being as helpful and welcoming as possible, almost zealous in it's attempts to get people to play with them.
---
The same goes for games like Titanfall 2. That community is nothing but welcoming. And that is where I start to see a pattern forming.
---
The issue with the WoW Classic community, imo, is that it's community seems to take new players for granted because they know that there will be a decent chunk of players at launch. They don't seem to understand what it's like to play a multiplayer game with a tiny population, or with a community filled to the brim with gatekeeping elitists that refuse to even entertain the notion that there are ways to enjoy the game that don't center around die-hard competitive "Server-first" culture. 
---
And if they DO understand what it's like to play a multiplayer game that suffers from population issues, they still don't seem to put 2 and 2 together that their behavior can directly affect the enjoyment of others and can drive people away from their game that would otherwise enjoy it. 
---
I would hope that the most die-hard fans would also be the most passionate about the game, and that they would by extension be the most excited to share this experience with others, but if my last few days have taught me anything, it's that these die-hard fans are only worried about themselves, and are one step from a conniption at all times, just waiting for someone to suggest a "Sub-optimal" way of playing "their" game.
---
All of this is to say, I'm not "referring to" the general fanbase/fandom as toxic. They are SHOWING me that it is, whether the people I've interacted with here are just a 'vocal minority' or not.
---
I'm going to listen to so many audiobooks while playing Paladin. Graphic Audio and chill.
---
Tips out baby!
---
Yeah, hard to experience the challenge when you didn't actually participate in live innit
---
I prefer the [original] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_wzlrB9d9s), personally, but you gotta' love Cranius.
---
I doubt we'll see him again, sadly, but I think it would be awesome if Blizz put him in just for the first month or so as an Easter egg of sorts.
---
Thank you, now I know a little more:)
---
Its pretty common to switch your spec around the best weapon you managed to obtain. as gear is few and between, especially good weapons. sometimes takes literally monthes to obtain something decent. So ya, ppl make specs for best weapon they got, not other way around.
---
So any rogue can roll, if he'll use it and it'll boost the dps.
---
Unless its like some rogue that publically stated he is playing just one particular archetype and not planing to respec any time soon. and everone knows it. But then he probably wouldn't roll himself.
---
What is spell batching?
---
Some of us got it lol
---
"toxic" is just a buzzword for "negative opinion I disagree with".
---
Hunter is basically the only dps that isn't braindead easy to do well in PvE. "Huntards" are a thing because they're the easiest class to level so they don't need to improve to get by like other classes might.
---
My favorite pass time until Classic WoW will be find the puppy.
---
Since we will have many more quests than most people originally leveled with, not that bad. I leveled a mage almost entirely through are grinding earlier on and it was one of my faster leveling times. But towards the end leveled a rogue mostly through questing in just a bit longer.
---
The main thing to keep in mind is you won't hit 60 entirely off quests. If you actively avoid killing extra stuff between quests your going to stall and have to grind. The best advice I can give you, is kill stuff on the way to and from quests. If you just do that little bit of consistent grinding you won't have to stop and strait grind without quests really.
---
Also jumping off the tram to SW and running the entire length on foot just to see what was down there
---
Sure, if you wanna go about it like that, you're right. 
---
That just seems a bit more complicated that it's worth. My opinion though, you do you.
---
Its not an opinion if you spread false stories and talking just BS.
---
Right but if you are doing a item loot quest, you will have to kill 5x the amount of mobs and will have huge downtime after you cleared out the zone
---
Telling people that they are a joke for making longer videos than 10 minutes sounds pretty toxic to me.
---
My guess is even the people who were young teens during vanilla now have jobs. Its relatable to everyone.
---
Can't wait to spend 6 hours trying to get Brokentooth and then preventing alliance hunters from taming him when I finally get him.
---
It will be glorious.
---
I find your ideas intriguing and wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
Also, I hope to organize/take part in the opposite: stampedes of naked level 1 taurens across Kalimdor.
---
I remember having guild meetings in The Blue Recluse in Stormwind, we weren't even on an RP server lol
---
Just since I see you‚Äôre in this thread, I enjoy your channel and discussions you guys have on the classic cast, but rank 14 won‚Äôt be as significantly acquired as the hype. A lot of people don‚Äôt have the time for that grind nowadays. Keep doin what you‚Äôre doin!
---
Hah! Fuck I‚Äôm still a year from finishing and trying to avoid letting this game consume my soul.
---
MY MAN  
---
People who say Paladin is boring don't know what they're talking about, it's incredibly fun and rewarding to play. Really open ended class.
---
Yeah, I think for a lot of the fan base this classic WoW will be a last 'hurrah' to the game they knew. It was formative and fun. It would be nice if they kept it strictly vanilla until Naxx, and then after that (when most people will have it out their system) look at implementing features based off a community vote (like RS).
---
Month? I plan to be sleep deprived and level 60 week 2
---
Dude please stop, I hope you act like this on retail classic so everyone can blacklist you vanilla expertüòÇüòÇ
---
You probably shouldn‚Äôt tbh. If you PVE you have to heal as Druid and PvP feral is decent but nothing insane. Lots of the gear for feral that is good is from raiding so once again you have to heal for PvP as well. Druids are fun and all but they are good at basically everything and great at nothing! But it also depends on the player, a skilled druid can change things I‚Äôve said.
---
Asmon don't know shit
---
Good question
---
D:
---
I don't remember which patch took it out, but the launch-day version of vanilla, paladins could use their exorcism spell on undead players. 
---
Either way, paladins have some pretty √ºber dps in duskwood and the plaguelands.
---
Blizz has always had a pretty clear stance on wPvP and griefing when there is a solution in place--such as questing somewhere else, getting high level players involved for a pvp solution, etc. The only time I've seen them possibly get involved is when somebody is killing a quest NPC that bottlenecks an entire zone, and even then, "you could quest somewhere else" is the answer I saw more than anything from the CS blues.
---
I think Paladin is boring, but I'm also happy when other people enjoy something so much.
---
So more power to you.
---
It's probably your web browser not your isp. See if there's an advanced button on the page and then a "proceed to site (unsafe)" link.
---
Sounds good.
---
Blizz has always maintained that corpse camping does not fall under their griefing policy.
---
And he delivers!
---
i'm saving my holidays too lol once i know the date i will ask for those days :D
---
DISCLAIMER: I never played hunter on vanilla.
---
From what I've read, it seems the common wisdom is that 1) Pet Damage doesn't scale well with gear, so the more gear people get into the extra phases, the less optimal your pet becomes. And 2) it is too easy to cc the pet to shut down a huge chunk of your dps (which is where the utility / survivabilty of SV comes in handy more in PvP). This why conventional wisdom says "Level as BM (and your pet will own in pvp) and switch to MM when you get some better gear at 60."
---
Again, this is just from reading I have done into the matter. I think you can do fine... you just won't do as well as you could with a BM/SV setup. Nothing wrong with that, imo.
---
I give this kid @eddyJroth a maximum of 1 month before he rerolls to a different class.
---
Only way to find out is to try it and see if it works for you. For my PvP focused build I'm thinking about trying out 21/21/9. Intimidate, Scatter shot and the 4 points into Imp. Wing Clip for that close range CC. You do miss out on the high end damage talents but being able to control your enemy is a worthwhile trade off.
---
Well, I guess to be fair, he always sounded like he only hated that the two communities were going to be viewed as homogeneous.
---
As a streamer, could you blame him for wanting to get in on the hype and not seem like a Johnny-come-lately?
---
He's fucking realistic. He likes it, but he doesn't have rose tinted glasses like most of you guys do.
---
dude i get what ur saying lol i play lots of orcs and the dirt and barren wastelands are getting to me i skip desolace because of it
---
Bawitdaba da bang da bang diggy diggy diggy?
---
 He's fucking realistic. He likes it, but he doesn't have rose tinted glasses like most of you guys do.
---
What do you mean by optimal?
---
It‚Äôs all a complete shame being Alliance.
---
You literally took that clip out of context. Don't be an ignorant twat.
---
All this wow classic + the office...just makes my heart sing :D
---
Omg these are diabolical. I love it.
---
 And you know exactly who you need to block or ignore in order to better craft your personal Community or fandom experience.
---
So your basically picking between the best classes against melee. Mage is the better option in PVE because you‚Äôll never see locks top the Dps meters in raids. Mage is still better than lock in PvP. I do disagree with you though, locks are actually insanely good in PvP and especially, melee. For example, when dueling a rogue, locks can have void walker out for the shield+healthstone+healthpot..  In other words, locks can take some hits and with fear + dots management you‚Äôll beat most melee. But in the end, it does come down to skill if both players are skilled. Mage is still better at both. Your choice :)
---
He never does lol.
---
I mean if you use dkp sure. That‚Äôs a pretty selfish mindset though. I‚Äôd let the dagger rogues use it before I took it for pvp. I prefer swords. I like loot council. I‚Äôve been in a +1 guild though. They gave the daggers to rogues that were already dagger spec. We had core hound and perdition blade drop in the same run and the same/only dagger rogue got both. There were rogues that wanted to go daggers in the run though.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs basically a rudimentary form of SportsCenter. There‚Äôs nothing really new about it
---
Removal of the auction house would be worse for the game. Have you played Path of Exile? Trade interaction is so toxic in that game that I have decided to quit the game until something is done to improve it. Without an in game auction house there would just be website replacements that players would have to use in order to trade. Unless you want there to be a trading system like Lineage 2 where the players simply go AFK after setting up a shop in a city.
---
I started listening to your podcast a couple weeks ago, I‚Äôve listened to 15 or so episodes so far.  I love the production quality of this podcast compared to some other ones with similar classic wow content.  
---
Just wanted to say thanks!
---
I mean people call him a joke because he spreads misinformation and then profits off of it.

Neither did I. During vanilla I was busy levelling, having fun and making friends. Am I less worthy of participating in classic hype because my actual experience of classic was different than yours? What about someone who never played until Wrath?
---
I don't understand the gatekeeping around here. Classic is for everyone, not just the original hardcore vanilla raiders.

it's a fine inn until someone missclicks and auto attacks a patron whislt the tank is afk and the whole group dies.
---
Nope, I've never done  that.....
---
What do you say to people who call you out for spreading misinformation? Or saying things like "I don't know why he doesn't wotf out of polymorph does this ud even know his racial"
---
I sincerely apologise...rofl
---
What misinformation? I genuinely don't know.
---
Yeah, that's the drawback, but I've also seen a lot of people completely ignore pets at 60 due to that fact. I know Survival has some % chance for hard CC like from imp. wing clip and entrapment, allowing for a chance to get some big damage with aimed shot. I guess another drawback would be relying solely on your pet when the enemy hides in your dead-zone; while with survival you can push them into melee range for a wing clip or trap, then kite back out of the dead-zone.
---
your only posts here is in this thread about him, and you posted this exact same comment twice to two different people

&gt; Yeah but it‚Äôs not like raids require a lot of tanks
---
That is one of the big issues. Raids only have one MT. Also a tank with no TF is dog shit at aggro compared to a tank with it. So if you step into the MT slot. Be prepared to no life it. People will miss you when you are gone.
---
A priest would probably be the best in that scenario. Shaman is nice too. Don‚Äôt do druid, not having a consistent rez is the worst.
---
Nope, not 700 each. 700 to split between all players in the party. If a player is outside of the xp gain area, they are just not considered in the calculation, including the group bonus and the split
---
I went out after I saw this post, and that's exactly what I got ahaha.

Non humans will get daggers generally

If you're rolling human you should want swords

It's the clip he's referring to, the only thing out of context is your reply...wtf?
---
Big enough that there's a zeppelin from Grom'gol (a bit north of booty Bay) that flies to Brill (just outside UC).
---
Just like when he was shilling Anthem like a corporate shark trying to sell his MLM scheme.

I think I'd agree (in theory), especially if you have friends or are playing BGs.

---
Streaming is his livelyhood.  Why was he going to alienate his audience by shitting on the only version of the game that he could stream?  I doesn't feel honest to call a streamer hypocritical because they are mercurial according to their audience.
---
These people stream to make money.  Why bother subjecting them to purity tests like what bandwagon they jump on or when they jump?
---
Thought it gets resisted by higher lvls? True false?

I was gonna feral off tank in raids and then once AQ comes out run a balance/restro spec

No they aren't, people here are just rationalizing and tolerating toxic behavior because it's an inconvenience to them to call it out for what it is, and because this game is relatively secure in it's prospective player count. Smaller Player-count games have to be more welcoming to ensure the longevity of their games. Meanwhile, games with stable future prospects don't have to worry if 1/2 of the prospective players were scared off by the ones who seem to make it a mission to ruin their experience.
---
My favorite, off hand, comment is when he said wotf (will of the forsaken) breaks polymorph.
---
But his content is riddled with things that show he hasn't done deep research into what he's talking about. Albeit its not evident to people who also haven't done the research. So players who don't know every little nuance of the system, won't understand he misleads his viewers. Which is why the "toxic minority" is a minority, because not that many people spend 4+ hours a day testing things or reading guides. And that is fine, no one expects everyone to.
---
You too! Hope you have a Classic summer üòé
---
Cool spec but I think you can get more control from surv/marks, probably with more damage too.
---
I used to run my Troll Rogue over to the front of Ironforge where people dueled, and wait until the fight was over. Usually both players would be at low health, so they were free kills. Did the same in front of Orgrimmar on my Alliance Rogue.
---
I absolutely love what you are doing here

That's where the name came from

Same, but don't tell anyone! They'll blame us if it releases any later than july 16th :|

Stretched out or not, most of us appreciate the content.  You don't owe anyone here shit.  
---
Keep doing you!
---
People don't mention this alot, but keep in mind anyone that wears plate repair costs are insane given how difficult gold was to make. The caveat here being lower overall realm population being a contributing factor. So no clue how it will stack up compared to original vanilla. But if you planned on dying alot, which as a MT you died first it's your job. It required a lot of grinding to keep up your gold which means more time playing.
---
The dog is really well hidden in this one.
---
I forgot about Eyes of the Beast! Holy shit.
---
Oh god, thanks for taking the hit on your youtube career for without your great sacrifice, wow classic might've been a disaster! Y'all better start showing this man respect, else he might start telling Blizz to make changes you don't like. 
---
Blizzard is including you to strum up excitement for the release of the game. Don't delude yourself into thinking you're some community hero. You can take that smug attitude and stick it.
---
It isn't gatekeeping lol, it's just a joke. One of the people part of the classic group never hit level 60 during vanilla, which is funny to some people.
---
same
---
Damn, to quick
---
I remember winning so many duels against people way higher level than me here by laying a trap and when theyre stunned i run into the inn and go invis in the fire place. I was a hunter but i can't remember the ability that allowed me to go invis
---
YAS!
---
Back in Legion, I made a paladin, and solod every dungeon from 1-55, had to stop at BRD, as ret with a Crusader axe. 
---
I was doing 500% of the work expected, since I was just one of a dive man team, so you‚Äôd think I was having fun right? Not really... I had my ‚Äúbig dick damage‚Äù ability that everyone has, my ‚Äúspend points to heal‚Äù ability that everyone has, and my ‚ÄúAoE now‚Äù ability. And my ‚Äúsprint‚Äù that everyone has came in handy too. 
---
Just as you can‚Äôt compare modern WoW to Classic, you can‚Äôt compare the new versions of the classes to the older ones. I‚Äôm so stoked to play a Pally again, as I leveled one in BC.
---
Why so many kegs for a race that doesn't really eat/drink
---
+1
---
DPS/Tank druid are only viable if you farm manual crowd pummeler (google it)
---
And generally alliance only bring 1 or 2 druids for resto
---
In PvP druids are specialists. Tanks/Feral not viable. Only Resto. 
---
WSG you flag carry, AB you defend caps with instant spam and stealth
---
True, but having one or even two of them as a healer or tank makes groups super easy.
---
Nah
---
i freaking love these Office meemz. keep em coming and when classic is out too.
---
Because you want to level fast and be a powerhouse in BG's with little reliance on raid gear.
---
Yeah, that's pretty much what I figured.  I'll probably start as deep feral making sure I'm able to tank ok for 5mans starting out.  As the expansion goes on maybe I'll respec into HotW for raiding/organized pvp
---
I don't mean to direct this at you, more at people who push that narrative. But is that a criticism unless it's something Tips is claiming? Who gives a fuck how many boars he killed nearly 15 years ago. If the man is lying for 'street cred' yeah then roast him. Otherwise it's fucking sad that people gatekeep this ancient ass video game. Fuck Tips look to be about my age and I was 12 when WoW released.
---
Accidental Radiohead reference? Hope you get your OK Computer, my dude!
---
Why though? There's like no reason for us to go there other than Uldaman. Wtf were they doing there?
---
Yeah, I think it was really between the 11/34(?)/5 build which gives me cat/bear capabilities, or HotW 30/21 which means I'm either healing or tanking.
---
Where's the dog, though!?!
---
I think most people will be generally against arenas... that's the sense I have gotten anyways. I've seen some put it in the category of "mistakes" along with flying, LFD, LFR.
---
I think I am with them (and you?) for at least these initial phases. After 3 years... let's see where we're at and where we go next. I am hesitantly more open about changes then and only then.
---
Why I don't want is for Classic to become just a progression server. That will kill it fast.
---
Cata was the big downhill tumble for the game in 80% of the people here‚Äôs eyes. Pallies got the most fuckled up though, even if we did have the most OP AoE heal... and had flash of light turn into a mana dump. I thought being the best single target healer was what made us special.
---
People don't build guilds with palns to wipe on 13 year old content
---
If I didn't want a resto shaman I would take a viable meta option off my bench, most obvious being a fury warrior
---
The fact enhancement shamans aren't in the raid says some one has done that math and fury warrior is better.
---
Your dog doesn't look so well.
---
My favorite place to hang out in downtown Brill. Can't wait to hear that fabulous  music once again.
---
That fireplace looks comfy for long Winter nights.
---
I do.
---
Yes, they would. And should.
---
Hi, /u/Pcktfltr123
---
I feel where you're coming from. But as a man who's never cared about PvP, I could care less about pvp
---
It‚Äôs also really fun alt tabbing to watch sweet girl on girl action mid fight. (I kid, I‚Äôm rolling Pally)
---
Yep, so that's pretty much the spec I was debating vs. the standard HotW spec.  I think like you said I'll just focus on dps or tank, and not worry about healing.  Maybe after some time has passed I'll get bored and want to spec into HotW for more raiding/organized pvp stuff, but initially on launch I'll probably just be focusing on open world stuff or small group content.
---
Nope! Arena ruined pvp!
---
then become a streamer
---
That sounds great, but not in this game
---
Oh Brother. . .
---
It's a game, do whatever you think will make it the most fun. I will personally be leveling as a Mage/Warlock/Paladin Trio.
---
Certain comps will increase the speed in which you can perform tasks -- Our AOE damage works well with our Paladins ability to AOE tank.
---
But there will likely be more DPS warriors in a raid than prot warriors.
---
If it's not more vanilla like than all vanilla private servers then there wouldn't be a point in classic WoW.
---
No thanks. Go find a private BC server if you care so much. I also think BC Arena was fantastic, but I don't want them inserting it into Classic. Classic is Classic. Save for *very* small alterations (like standardizing classes around a particular patch or providing graphics updates for new systems, both of which they've already done), it should remain as it was.
---
Considering its being downgraded from modern wow, I would expect the file size to be significantly larger like in the 30GB range is my guess.
---
It‚Äôll probably be around the same size as BFA. The game is completely different than it was before, so the file size should be much smaller.
---
Except it doesn't die and a lot of twitch streamers would love to have his 2k subs. Not to mention the 10k-20k when WoW expacs launch.
---
He was never against it. He likes and supported it always. What he doesn't support is the lies that Classic is all magic and rainbows. It has and will most likely have glaring issues that people blindly ignored.
---
&gt;Why was he going to alienate his audience by shitting on the only version of the game that he could stream? It doesn't feel honest to call a streamer hypocritical because they are mercurial according to their audience.
---
He was trashtalking classic (he trashtalks ANYTHING that is popular to be trashtalked). He didnt have to do that. He could just talk about BfA. 
---
But every time this guy gets a little bit more viewers he goes into ego-overdrive and feels invincible, and then he says a lot of things that make him a hypocrite.
---
&gt;Why bother subjecting them to purity tests like what bandwagon they jump on or when they jump?
---
Because they are nobody special? If i see a guy on reddit with a hot take and i know hes wrong, im gonna tell it to him. same goes for toweliee, just that he shows his "hot takes" to a large audience. 
---
stop acting as if streamers are some untouchable celebrities.
---
Well to be fair the probelm with the mechanic of totem is that their usefulness is directly correlated to your opponents skill
---
SO much counter play there
---
Totems were never a great idea
---
Jokes on you, he‚Äôs rolling shammy.
---
Ahh yes, this thread is reminding me why I never got into Classic. Everything is so damn grindy and everyone is so worried about efficient gains that people don't even want to party up between dungeons. If a friend plays more than you at all, then you won't even be able to join them due to no scaling.
---
Nice collection. Honestly all my favs. MoP I only did PvP tho I gave up PvE in that one.
---
because then how else would you feel smug and superior?
---
Well, because the changes they've made it's gonna be bigger than the original, but we won't know by how much until they've stripped out all the modern components still in the client and the new stuff added. However, I imagine they'll be able to compress it down a bit and possibly make it smaller than the original.
---
I've been practicing on private realms since the announcement of classic. I've spent hundreds or hours on vanilla databases, looked at vanilla guides, created spreadsheets and requested two weeks off work at an undisclosed time. On private servers I get to 60 in 5-7 days of in game played time. On a fresh vanilla server with 500 people starting at level 1 it took 9 days due to people taking kills and waiting for respawns. I think it's very doable for people who have spent time practicing and know what to expect.
---
U know bfa is about 80go?
---
It makes perfect sense, especially since we're talking about the client-side code here, and not the server side.. You don't put out code that you aren't intending on anyone accessing/using. That's foolish. You add the code in when you're ready for it.
---
This is true any guild worth its weight  knows to bring only fury warriors over any other shit tier dps /s

&lt;The Oran'Thul&gt; - Horde | NA | PvP | Hardcore
---
The Oran'Thul is a dedicated, goal-oriented group of hardcore gamers seeking raiders and PvPers for Classic WoW. We host an exclusive guild Classic WoW server designed to eliminate gear and consumable farming, allowing members to practice raid mechanics with unlimited resets.
---
Our plans for Classic WoW include being top guild on our server while still providing an atmosphere that also welcomes more casual players. We intend to have two 40 player raid groups totaling 80 hardcore raider slots. We have a ranking system that provides raid slot and loot priority to those that align with the hardcore play style and plan to show up to MOST raids. For more information, please review a detailed breakdown on our website: https://www.oranthul.com/home/m/49064920/article/4842852
---
UPDATE: PHASE 2 OF OUR CLASSIC WOW PRIVATE SERVER HAS BEGUN! We have started with Phase 1 content(MC, Ony, Kazzak/Azuregos) and are focusing on teaching new players how to tackle this content. With the success of Phase 1 and the clearing of all content, we are now ready to begin again starting with Molten Core and progressing through ALL content once more. NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME TO JOIN AND LEARN ALL CONTENT PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH!
---
While most of this post focuses on the PvE aspect of Classic WoW, we are equally as dedicated to PvP and greatly enjoy crushing the skulls of the Alliance. We have multiple Rank 14 experienced players and will allocate time for premade battlegrounds.
---
Our core members are extremely knowledgeable of all Classic WoW content and provide an environment where you can learn your class, ask questions and improve your skill set. We have cleared all content in Classic WoW including all world bosses and 15/15 Naxx. Furthermore, we have achieved world-best standing in past MMOs, most notably ArcheAge.
---
If you strive to be the best you can be, know what it means to put the organization first, and want a guild and community to call home from day one, then perhaps this is the place for you. With 15+ years of activity and an absolute 0% chance that we will quit Classic WoW or disband‚Äîas commonly witnessed with many other guilds‚Äîwe offer you unparalleled stability and a place to call home! JOIN US!
---
One of the many projects that The Oran'Thul has painstakingly worked on includes a list of loot from all raid bosses including loot council priorities. An example page can be found here: https://www.oranthul.com/raidloot-raid-mc
---
In addition to this project, The Oran'Thul is creating a complete list of pre-BiS and BiS gear for all dungeon and raid content. This list is organized by class and role allowing each player to see the gear that only pertains to their needs. An example page can be found here: https://www.oranthul.com/raidloot-pr-warrior-prot

Oh lol I didn‚Äôt know it was that big. Oh well, time to make room on my HD.
---
Retail is about 60gb by now so i'd prepare for that size if i were you since i doubt they'll have completely separate versions of Wow.
---
Haha, looking at your history, ignorant dink is a fitting term ^^
---
&gt; Warriors will put out 1000% times the work a rogue will need to just to succeed 
---
Think it depends on the level of play, for raids 100% agree but to the people just running a few dungeons now and then I would say its about the same % of work
---
Bruh, I don't know you, but your gifs are so funny that I want you to play with my crew when we start Classic. You are amazingly entertaining, thank you. Also, as a warrior, I have no fucking clue what spell batching is.
---
You 100% could run it off a usb stick.
---
HYPE!?
---
Complete and utter bullshit.
---
Classic will not be that big for the simple reason that there's no expansion.
---
MM/Surv is far better in both pvp and pve.
---
Hunter loot
---
Which weapon is that?
---
I‚Äôm happy *someone* enjoys the badlands.
---
The demo client was an entirely different download, so I'm anticipating it will be a separate version.
---
Why people are posting images eith doggos init?
---
I just remember questing in Badlands and all the sudden getting eaten by Zaricotl. This fucking overleveled elite bird.
---
¬´PTSD intensifies¬ª We did this..for fun..17year old me had a dark sense of humour
---
All of this Alliance fanboy-isms and horde hate is just going to make it so much better when my Orc is destroying people in open world PvP. 
---
Jk I‚Äôll probably die 3 times in the starting zone and /quit.
---
Yeah, I know panda always gets bashed and joked on but honestly that was the last expansion I had any fun with and atleast as a warrior I had a good time in PVP. Same story though, my buddies and I were full time pvpers and stopped all raiding after Cata.
---
I know. I thought the mounts were automatically put into the mount tab since it was released (wotlk I'm sure). And what now its the 7. expansion on the way. Its werid to see mounts in the bags :)
---
Yeah, but OP never mentioned him
---
The problem is lock in open world pvp, you won't always have your voidwalker out.
---
What happens if you get ganked with fellhunter?
---
can you fear and summon a void?
---
Other than the matchmaking mechanics I want nothing to do with any of that
---
Plebs on retail can't play objective PvP, lol
---
The only game genre on the planet where death match (arena) is important is tab targeting MMO's
---
If you think capture the flag in WSG isn't complex enough you're probably just bad. There is so much complexity there outside a very structured premade.
---
&gt; My concern with classic is that warlocks have no way to handle melee if they get tanked with a fellhunter out.
---
So I'm also a multi-Gladiator and played a Mage since Vanilla. You will easily crush 95% of players as a Mage simply because you have so many ways to kite melee. Against Hunters you can deadzone them. My favorite general-PvP build is just 0/24/27 because you get the perks of fire and frost (you don't get Ice Barrier but it's OK). Impact stun is no joke.
---
Keep pots on you at all times as either the Mage or Warlock - Fire/Frost/Shadow absorption, Swiftness and Swim Speed pots, regen pots, etc. Play like a utility machine - have an answer for every scenario you're up against. First Aid has Anti-Venom so you can use them to remove Crippling Poison and Mind-Numbing Poison at the same time, and I highly recommend carrying several stacks of them always. It's also amazing to remove Viper Sting when you're fighting Hunters. Expect every player you're up against to have potions and you'll rarely lose.
---
That said, you will 100% lose to any SL/SL Warlock as a Mage - even if the guy is AFK. Warlocks do exceptionally well in PvP, even against Rogues. Save Death Coil for when a Rogue pops Sprint so it'll fear him away quickly and then Fear him until Sprint is either gone or use a Swiftness pot to keep your distance. If you're carrying pots like I suggested, just keep a Catseye Elixir up since it'll increase your stealth detection by 2 levels. Having a Felhunter gives you another 6 levels of detection, and if you're Human and use Perception that'll give you another 10 levels. Basically a level 60 Rogue without stealth talents will effectively be a level 42 in stealth - so you'll see him from like 80 yards away easily, so you might feel safer overall if you just play with a Voidwalker out in the world. 
---
Warriors will still be your toughest fight since they can easily stay on top of you, so save Death Coil for when they've used Berserker Rage and Intercept. It's only a 30s cooldown for them, so you have to kill them fast.
---
I just want to join OPs guild if he starts one.. that‚Äôs all I want.
---
And a release date.  :)
---
Dagger are barely viable even in t3, due to the insane amount of crit they need
---
Yeah Paladin used to have a better balance of magic/spells and being a melee class. Now it feels just like a ‚Äúlight warrior‚Äù. Once legion hit and they got rid of exorcism, that seemed to be the last bastion of paladin being the ‚ÄúMelee caster‚Äù, at least for me.
---
I approve of this. :D
---
Arena in a game that 2 shotting people and almost no balance whatsoever. You sure you was playing PvP back then? A singe arms warrior with a pocket paladin will devastate 99% of the competition. In fact for this combo alone you will need WAR/PALA vs 5 mode.
---
You can't have competitive pvp in vanilla. It's not how the game worked. It was the closest thing to Rock/paper/ scissors. Except certain combos were god mode.
---
Good luck implementing it.
---
I guess 17 out of 24 qualifies as "seldom" in his mind
---
The trick was to drag your ass too Rhodos, Greece for 2weeks, was quite tan for playing all day every day back then
---
My last character I leveled to 60 was a horde, I did not experience any difference when it comes to quests while leveling, in fact I would say leveling as horde is faster, because much more convenient flight paths while leveling than alliance.
---
I hadn't seen that before. Love it
---
I'm not disagreeing with you but I see this statement a lot, how did it ruin PvP?
---
I feel you. I am actually the problematic friend usually, the one who pushes  farther and farther ahead because I am determined to play more hardcore than my friends are. I am determined now to prevent this from happening. I have seen my friends lose interest enough times to know that if I go too far, at least one will become disinterested and it's all downhill after that.
---
K.
---
I just hope I can land the name I want on launch day
---
No it's not. It's literally the opposite. Some builds have the edge in terms of mobility, dps, cc, survivability, a combination of both, which depends in differebt scenarios etc etc. No one is saying the margin is massive, to the extent of something being useless, *but*, if you have 2 people on the skill ceiling duel, you're insanely likely to see the better spec win
---
Skill matters more, you shouldnt minmax if you dont wanna, but minmaxing and being an autist is *always* more efficient than not. Dont shy away from the fact
---
I've never seen...

I wish i had 4 other friends to party up. Hahahaha
---
What happens when rogues gets ganked out of stealth and with no cds? Or mages with no ice block and cold snap? No matter what class you play you won‚Äôt always be ready for a fight! You‚Äôll just have to learn and adapt to each fight in whatever class you‚Äôll play! It‚Äôs the beauty of vanilla. No class wins all the time.
---
Norwegian unfortunately üòä
---
Remember that 1.12 is world of warriorcraft.  I would base my decision with that in mind.
---
Mages are far better vs warriors than locks because of the availability of fear immunity.
---
Wrath was the pinnacle of Ret for sure. Some would say we were too good
---
If you look at the retail client right now you'll see there are some common files and a _retail_ subdirectory for retail client.
---
It's reasonable to think classic will have its own subdir in the WoW game directory but it won't be completely separated from retail.
---
You won't have to download retail to have Classic ofc but some files will be common between the 2.
---
And yes! I‚Äôve had locks summon a void while they feared me... last time I won‚Äôt have my PvP trinket on haha.
---
Nah, the general feeling I get around this subreddit is apathy and weariness, not much hype or excitement.
---
Oh god they're asking the ret paladin what they should do with our tier gear
---
FUCK YOU ESFAND YOU FAT PERSIAN FUCK
---
/moo
---
well private servers are a thing but fresh servers are awesome indeed.
---
Farming what, runecloth?
---
You can farm anything lower pretty easily even in a holy spec; just pull groups and AoE with holy nova.
---
Just team up with some people for orb/farm runs, and use the gold you make to buy runecloth.
---
Making an alt *just* for farming cloth is pretty ridiculous. It's going to take you 10x longer to level an alt than it would to grind the gold/mats to go 1-300 tailoring/enchanting, at an absolute minimum. That being said, if I go priest, I'll probably make a mage/hunter alt *eventually*. But I probably won't get them to 60 until sometime after DM releases, so it's not going to help me anytime around release.
---
Yes!!!! Man I‚Äôm dying waiting to hear a release date. Is it so much to ask for next week?
---
I think you mean you couldn‚Äôt care less about PvP
---
Not playing WoW at all is still better than playing Alliance.
---
Yup.
---
Greysfordays also advocates for changes to a system he has literally never even tried. Greysfordays should be removed from the planet.
---
shots fired !
---
lol did he do that?
---
You mean he liked a game and promoted it? GEE GO FIGURE! Honestly it's like children on this sub. Suddenly someone likes what they don't like and they're the devil.
---
And that fanboy comment by Wumbolojizzt.
---
Didn't realize shutting down false info was considered "fanboy". You do you pal. Just keep hanging around this echo chamber called a subreddit.
---
I also need a release date so I can be such a great husband and send my wife on a nice vacation to see her family up north for a week after release. I think she‚Äôs caught on that I‚Äôm trying to get rid of her....but with love.
---
When was it ever looking down?
---
Yeah I agree.
---
Huge/Major/Catastrophic news next week. Release date or beta
---
Not really. I may wait a couple of months after launch to start playing just so there‚Äôs people to sell stuff to.
---
Everyone meets up at 60! :D
---
None, but it does sound good, doesn't it? There are so many people on this subreddit that just like the sound of their keyboard.
---
Except for the years leading up to the release he was constantly stating it would never happen while telling people who wanted classic servers to fuck off. 
---
But yeah, supporting it....
---
Well, the demo is after all a demo, just like the retail PTR is separate from actual retail.
---
what helps a little is to sort on 'new' whenever you visit, and not the standard 'hot.'    That avoids many of the popular meme posts with 0 content.  you won't find  any old topics this way , but at least you won;t miss any recent ones, no matter if they got up or downvoted.
---
so a skilled player can't make a poor build perform well and a crappy player will excel no matter what if they're given a well-built character?
---
nah, didn't think so
---
&gt; I think many people (mostly casual players) 
---
I don't think casual players are the majority of the complainers I see. In fact, I'd hazard to guess (from my time as a filthy casual) they almost never visit forums or a Subreddit.
---
Hell, I didn't even read official WOW forums until sometime in late TBC looking for Sunwell strats and more effective DPS guides. By then I was raiding, which is nearly the antithesis of "casual".

Get all the ones you want asap then just delete them and turn them over w/e you want

Nope. Will take it to 60 for sure. My second class, however, will be hunter which was my second love in WoW and will be a nice change of pace after the pally
---
It doesn't matter if I watch boxing on TV or watch E-Sports. I just love the competition.
---
I wish that would have been a career option for me in the 90s.
---
If my nephew wants to become a Pro-Gamer, I'm going to buy him all the things. Tomorrow I'm going to watch MSI, I will watch people play video games in a huge arena and I know if EU does well, I'm going to be super hyped.
---
It's as exciting as the superbowl. At least for me it is.
---
Haha good point.
---
I think most people (especially those who would like to request time off from work) are frustrated by the lack of release date.
---
You are brilliant.
---
&gt;  Am I less worthy of participating in classic hype because my actual experience of classic was different than yours?
---
There's a difference between participating in classic hype and thinking you are a know-it-all.
---
That's why people joke on him, but not on you.
---
Yeah, I can see that happening in a loot council, but DKP is not loot council. In loot council, they basically make the decision to distribute loot in such a way that is beneficial to the entire guild, so those who don‚Äôt get the loot are sacrificing it for the good of the guild in hope that later on they will also be rewarded. 
---
But in a DKP system, you earn DKP by doing things that are beneficial to the entire guild, so having DKP means you already made sacrifices for the guild knowing they‚Äôll come through when you need something, so when you spend DKP, you essentially call in the favor that the guild owes you, and you should only be denied if someone calls in a bigger favor than you.
---
We have a baby due mid August... I fear the release date will be after......   :*(
---
+1 for posting an actual unpopular opinion
---
I hate TipsOut so much.
---
There is that.
---
There's only one name im worried about though. For my rogue I will be maining.
---
Hopefully and releases their new cpus/gpu's so I csn roll into classic with that new pc hotness.(im waiting for the new chips to launch so I can buy a ryzen 7 2700x on the cheap)
---
Keep in mind the file size of the modern game also includes data for  Outland, Northrend, Cata's new zones, Pandaria, Draenor, and new zones added by Legion and BFA. I would be surprised (and seriously have to wonder wtf is going on with the client bloat) if it comes anywhere near that.
---
sorry no idea what you're talking about
---
There is DR in vanilla. It's just not as fine tuned as later versions
---
Classic won't be bloated by files for Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, Draenor, and other new lands added by Cata, Legion, and BFA. There's no reason to think it'll be the same size as the current game.
---
Just say the name im sure no one on this sub would try to steal it huehueheu
---
Imo, things were better ‚Äòunbalanced‚Äô Strengths and weaknesses beat the hell out of everything being the homogenized pile of garabage live is
---
Maybe I am just jaded but while I have some faith in the content being developed that very much seems like the sort of stuff that would rank "not cost effective" at Blizzard-Activision.
---
\^\^ this guy.
---
This is bad to the bone. I really like her other art too. Does she have an IG?
---
Lol no way - grounding, tremor, earth bind are so useful.  Even if they are skilled they have to adapt to the totems you use.  Also, for PvE WF totem is pretty much the strongest melee buff in the game.  Totems are huuuuuge in vanilla.
---
I was thinking that same thing.  I've been apart of 2 private server launches and it was a great time.
---
So basically the server moves in ticks and once in a while the ticks line up maybe you charge a mage but his sheep spell goes off at the exact same tick. That's spell batching, supposedly it still exists in retail but the ticks are so much faster the chances this happens is much much lower. That my understanding anyways.
---
Nice try buddy!
---
bruh you high on donating to millionaires or something? why the hell are you getting angry at the behalf of others? are you like a member of his club or something?
---
I think that TBC made huge strides in class viability and spec viability.  Probably one of the best times for character balance if you ignore arenas.  I would say they absolutely nailed those aspects of TBC.
---
TBC had good raids too and I think the move from 20/40 man to 10/25 was good.
---
At the same time, I think they failed, miserably, on most every other level.  Smaller world, flying mounts, daily quests, etc.
---
I personally think that they could change things some time after Naxx if it kept the same "spirit" of Vanilla.  That is: don't change anything for the purpose of convenience or accessibility. 
---
If you look at the changes that really hurt, it was all convenience based and accessibility based. 
---
I think I'm in the majority of my views on this sub, but, I would love more content that a) doesn't increase the level cap; b) doesn't overly inflate item levels or make any old content irrelevant.  I also would love some balance and itemization challenges as well.  
---
On the other hand some of the stuff holding classes back *can't* be changed without fundamentally altering the game.  So it's clearly tough.
---
Regardless, in vanilla every class felt pretty unique still, even if they weren't that balanced.
---
Yeah let's rather get the 100th office meme on the frontpage instead of one min/maxing guide...
---
Correct.  Horde live and work in mud huts.
---
REEEEEEE
---
Because Blizzard literally said it would never happen. Him and many other streamers copied what Blizzard said. When it comes to info they decide what can and can't happen. People starting drama over that need to be told to fuck off. It's unwarranted for any chatroom to cause drama for the sake of making someone look bad.Hell they all told the private server community to fuck off cause they're so goddamn annoying. Esspecially since most of those streamers, Towelliee, asmongold, Nixxiom, Rektful and so on all supported the idea of vintage servers.
---
Blizzard changed their stance on their statement because they saw a profit once WoW finally died down after 13+ years of extremely insane revenue. When they said that the streamers STILL tell the people to fuck off because of their toxic attitude like MOST people here are showing WHILE supporting the idea of Classic.
---
You will have to kill 5x the amount of mobs, yes....but the extra mobs killed helps make up for the xp hit and can actually mean less grinding down the road.  A group of 5 players playing together constantly, will also most likely be able to do dungeons much more efficiently for their dungeon quests (no taking time to form groups and also used to playing together so more efficient than a group of pugs, plus easier to make sure loot is distributed in a way that benefits the party as a whole).
---
I'm not sure what IG is?
---
Keep doing what you're doing, I subbed after your videos covering Blizzcon 2005. Good stuff.
---
I replied to a few comments but thought I'd just mention in my own comment.
---
Retail contains data for several additional continents as well as additional zones added to EK and Kalimdor over the years. That is not a small amount of data. We aren't talking about a 60 gb client with \~10-20gb of extra data. Each expansion's assets are higher  quality, including an increasing number of additional sound files for voiced cutscenes and the like. Zones have increasingly more clutter and objects and features, etc. Each expansion increased the client size.
---
I would be shocked if the classic client, stripped of Outland, Northrend, Hyjal, Twilight Highlands, Pandaria, Draenor, Broken Isles, Kul Tiras, etc was even close to approaching the size of the modern client.
---
Sorry, Instagram. I don't use twitter much but I wanna follow her.
---
Nice.  I started buying digital with Cata.  Cool to see the boxes.
---
yeah, will be interesting to see what kind of fresh launch blizzard will give us with wow classic
---
realtive to a paladin kit which has no counter play? 
---
Like bubble?
---
lol no it's terrible if the people you're playing against are as good or better than you.
---
Others gave you some solid advice about better time-management (I.e. farm gold instead and buy cloth, if it‚Äôs more efficient)
---
But if you are dead set on a farming alt, I think mages are the best AOE grinders of the game.
---
brutal, savage, rekt
---
&gt; Apprentice Plumber
---
&gt; Money isn‚Äôt great
---
Bide your time friend, you‚Äôll reap the rewards when you qualify
---
Will be wierd. Imagine finding an BoE epic while you level up. First you get happy because you think you will be rich. But there is no gold on the server. And everyones priority will be to save gold for epic mount.
---
You get less XP sure but you can clear entire areas with just your group faster than a solo or two person group can so it moreless evens out. Plus many quests in vanilla require at least a two person group and you won't have to spend time lfm. Blizzard designed vanilla to be played with groups.
---
Why do your gifs keep losing quality halfway through? What program are you using?
---
There is some sort of ethereal satisfaction that strengthens the soul when you get to be 100% smug and you have every reason to be. I envy him right now.
---
They called it faceroll for using an FCFS priority system. But apparently the FCFS priority classes on retail like enhancement are alright.
---
Whatever. I loved WotLK ret too. Divine storm in rotation was great, and the t10 DS reset on autos was brilliant for the gameplay.
---
&gt; My favorite, off hand, comment is when he said wotf (will of the forsaken) breaks polymorph.
---
Not only that, he even calls the undead player a noob lol
---
Inb4 someone saying it was sarcasm
---
You think you do, but you don‚Äòt
---
I totally hear you. I‚Äôm in the same boat. Work till 5-6pm, come home &amp; play with the kids, have dinner, kids to bed....then pretend to be interested in what the wife is watching as I play WoW. Hoping I can get a good solid 2-3hrs a week night and maybe 4hrs at the weekend. 
---
Still undecided on whether to go hunter again (was my Main from vanilla to wrath) or go shammy which I loved in vanilla /tBC.
---
This subreddit's peak performance right now.
---
Merry Cakeversary
---
If you get paternity leave you should have some good play time!
---
As a parent myself, I‚Äôd tell my wife to go rest and I‚Äôd look after the baby when she slept in her cradle as I played a few games. They SLEEP A TON when they are a new born.
---
That thread is the source of the "shadow priests melt faces" meme.  It is the inception.
---
It's Reddit, not my program. They've got some problems. Gotta watch em in Direct link
---
Because everyone is going to be playing a rogue or warrior.
---
I hope they take 1.12 and make improvements that hardware restrictions wouldn‚Äôt allow for back when it released. I believe Blizzard won‚Äôt just release the exact rendition of vanilla without making improvements to gameplay. 
---
The ‚Äòno changes‚Äô group will not keep this afloat, we need minor changes as you‚Äôve stated.
---
 I've noticed a lot of complaints about paladins lately, with regard to their low dps and limited combat options. But what players are forgetting is the main reason Blizzard programmed Paladins. Paladins were not designed to be hybrid Tanks/Healers, as many claim. Instead, paladins were designed to be played while downloading pornography.  
---
Paladins have roughly zero combat interaction, thus making them the perfect character to play while downloading massive amounts of hardcore pornography. Simply target a monster, hit "1", and minimize your window. Then sit back and enjoy the amazing girl on girl action.  
---
Because a Paladin takes about one full minute to kill any monster, you can leisurely browse the erotic and pornographic fruits of the internet without much concern over your Paladin's welfare. After a minute, I go back to WoW, and usually my Paladin is alive and ready to loot the corpse. This is what makes grinding so pleasurable and convenient for me; the ability to simultaneously watch girls have sex with each other and level up at the same time. I doubt any other class has such an elegantly designed system, and I applaud Blizzard for their foresight in crafting a character that I can play with while playing with myself.  
---
DPS? Who needs it? The quicker I kill something, the less time I have to watch boobies. Combat Interactivity? Overrated. I'd much rather interact with the girls writhing on my computer screen. Yes, a paladin was created for the sole purpose of surviving a fight while you stream hot pornography directly to your computer. That is why we have the high armor class, healing abilities, and the low, low DPS.  
---
As for PvP, nothing is better than getting into Battlegrounds and soaking up the honor points while I watch girls take their clothes off for money. Only the minimum interaction is necessary for a Paladin to perform, and it is this very quality that I love the most about my Paladin. I doubt Rogues get any time to watch pornography while trying to vanish and rack up combo points, and I bet Shamans haven't seen a single naked breast while figuring out which totem to throw down before choosing which shock they are going to cast next.  
---
In addition to grinding, we have several defensive options during combat that also allow us the flexibility of downloading pornography. Hammer of Justice allows a quick 6 second glimpse at a naked lady while our opponent is stunned, and Divine Shield allows a leisurely 8 seconds of quality right-hand time. Indeed, Paladins have cornered the market on the pornography during playtime of World of Warcraft gameplay.  
---
It saddens me that many Paladins do not take advantage of the main functionality of your character, and are in fact lobbying for increased DPS, or more combat options. These are all unnecessary frivolities that would only harm our pornography downloading efficiency. Instead, we should thank the fine programmers at Blizzard for crafting a character that is great to grind with while grinding your loins.
---
She had that before, but don't like how work that platform and after she delete her IG. She had only Twitter, Artstation and Patreon
---
Well, it wouldn't be too hard I'd imagine if a group of people work together to farm and boost one player to make the wands.
---
He's a starcraft fan so we know he plays blizzard games.
---
Or until Classic releases, which ever comes first!
---
Well then pick a meta class
---
Don't whine about the symettry of it then pick the terrible spec lol
---
Both Ret paladins and hunters are held back by mana as their resource. They get no extra stats on their gear to make up for it. And Ret unlike hunter brings nothing valuable a holy paladin doesn't. Soooooo ret pala sucks
---
You like the asymmetry? Then pick a good class
---
Well, some of the things I think could use tuning is for AB for example. Maybe you get bonus honor for defending objectives as well as attacking. The proximity of graveyards (alliance stables was so hard to capture... remember wiping the entire alliance stables defenders just to have them respawn the moment you touch the flag? Horde's farm gy was out in pluto if I remember correctly. Yeah. Not compelling. Not competitive.
---
I think a lot of us are married to the *idea* of vanilla, which tends to make us forget everything that was utter bullshit about it. Was it fun to faceroll smash noobs in WSG premades? Of course it was. But after 100+ hours of it, the only reason why I'm queuing up is for r13/r14. There were a couple of times that we'd stay in game and play premade vs premade because cross-faction shit talking became a thing, and yeah those were fun but it accounted for maybe .5% of the total games that were played.
---
You're off by 1. For signed integers, the range is 
---
\-(2\^(n-1)) through 2\^(n-1)-1
---
Remember, there's a total of 2\^n possible values and 0 is considered a value.
---
Just do what you like
---
Every class is the same
---
And the balance is still awful
---
Rofl
---
I for one am excited to play a holy Paladin and wear a pretty dress t b h and do some dank flash of light heals 
---
Ret mains don‚Äôt @ me
---
Oh my gosh I didn‚Äôt think about using npcs to help kill it!! What a great tip!
---
I was just laid off after over 4 years at a job... so In a way it‚Äôs paternity leave... also why I‚Äôm wishing thy released the damn thing now haha
---
Easy fix to that, make em more the same
---
Only true balance is direct mirrors
---
&gt;But man, it could be so much better.
---
I think a lot of people agree with you. The problem is that no one is going to agree on what "better" is and how we get there.
---
People aren't calling for no changes because Vanilla was the perfect game. They're calling for no changes because Vanilla was a good game and its the game they want to play.
---
Fresh is always fun
---
Yes, they were all there already though.
---
I assume for classic we don't need the newest expansion?
---
Fear Ward is great for a handful of situations (Ony is a big one) but the main benefit of being Dwarf is Stoneform being so awesome. If you time it correctly you'll piss off a lot of Rogues since you'll be immune to Blind. 
---
That said, play for the game fantasy - any decent healer regardless of race will be invited to a group/raid.
---
64GB USB sticks are not exactly expensive these days and I think you'd be safe with one of those. Otherwise, no one here can really answer that question - the only way to know the file size is to wait for release.
---
thx this makes my day every time I come home from work  !
---
Meh... Bad Edit.
---
you will walk back to the quest givers multiple times and LIKE IT
---
Yeah no doubt your average raids are suddenly much harder since you can't just stack so many buffs.
---
Anyone with any brain who played original had the same thoughts, don't build yourself up so much, your ego might not be able to handle it.
---
The physical copy is the reason I played cata. Was in line with some frieinds at the release and got a free copy
---
I remember when I first discovered Badlands. I was questing in Loch Modak, saw the desert, and thought ‚Äúwhy is durotar over here?‚Äù When the zone name popped up, my lag had subsided to reveal a faction war. Dead instantly.
---
I only think its controversial on the internet and even then, only between a tiny minority. My retail guild has players that started from Vanilla to Legion and all of us have basically the same attitude; We are going to try it out and see how it goes but it looks like it will be a lot of fun at least for a while. Small sample size but im willing to bet that is 95% of the player base who just dont care enough to fight on reddit.
---
It was more about the resilience i think, something i hated with passion (was over 2k rating in TBC). Resilience forced people to grind that gear, or face certain death. That being one of the factors, the other is that it was YET another deterrent for going outside, just another "queue" type of addition rather than being out in the world.
---
At the time it wasn't so bad but i can see this as an issue as well. The concept of "join LFG and wait on the roof of some building in stormwind" is widely hatted, mostly because it stacked over the years as a concept and reduction in the "World" par of warcraft. I personally didn't mind that aspect back in TBC, but i understand why this shouldn't be a part of Classic. You can even see people hate on the fact that  Battlemaster  were introduced, According to some "it was the first step towards LFG tool". Let alone introducing an Arena system, especially in classic.
---
Uh, yeah. I'm pretty sure I was playing pvp back then. I'm well aware of 2 shotting since I was one of the first double trinket mages on my server. Obviously you can tune the mechanics to the arena to only "work" in the arena or normalized gear that can only be worn in the "arena". I think you might be making a lot of assumptions. This wouldn't be for gear or rewards other than epeen and fun. It's not introducing new items to the game, but rather a game "mode". I guess I should have clarified that.
---
Of course you were well over 2k in tbc. Everyone was on reddit, right?
---
Like I said the only thing I would add is matchmaking so the pvp scenes don't just die on the vine. 
---
Other than that.....Nope
---
I've played on p servers. I like mroe than the idea of it
---
I can't.  I've never played in rogue and I know nothing about them...I only play the hybrid healer classes.
---
Rogues with morals eh?  Interesting concept.
---
Just shutting down the false info this echo chamber of a subreddit loves to spew.
---
Warlocks with an early 60 can also sell Dreadsteed quest runs to other warlocks. Charge 100g per person, it's still \~150g cheaper for them and you recoup the cost of the quest originally.
---
tfw you rock up to Duskwood and can start using Exorcism. the catacombs at Raven Hill as a Paladin is so fucking cool. class fantasy to the max.
---
So they could do this on a normal RP server then? I don't see why this is why they need to make an RPPvP server.
---
Look at this guy, having a job, wife and food. Pfffffff.
---
You're able to directly view v.reddit clips? It always redirects me to New Reddit and plays embedded in the page.
---
As an Alliance player - fack you, the Horde, and this post. Why would you need to hearth from a Horde non-contested zone? 
---
You don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be ganked. You only had a taste of it in Tauren Mill, but you don‚Äôt TRULY know what it‚Äôs like to get ganked until you level in Redridge!
---
*cries in Alliance
---
Got any actual source or evidence for this? I played vanilla before bwl and this is the first time I hear about this.
---
Indeed I am.  Exp interrupted by ambush ganks is time wasted.
---
We've got a a weird kinda "memeception" goin' on over here don't we?
---
I mean, you've just been given proof and you have been obtuse about it, clearly not using your head that if something isn't in the 1.12 patch it, in all likelihood (like 90%+), will not be in the final version.
---
You're just being an ass at this point refusing to understand a basic concept.
---
Hey man, I understand.  You should let everyone streaming on Twitch know that they have to kneel down and kiss the ring.
---
iS AnYoNe ElSe ExItEd To Do X tHiNg In WoRlD oF wArCrAfT cLaSsIc?

yes. yes we are. YES. YES! HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO SAY IT! Y E S
---
True.  Might have to go to Desolace or Arathi instead.  STV is packed on PvP or PvE.
---
Do you watch football? Do you watch NBA? Do you watch the Olympics?

but why

These are amazing! üòÄ

Meh... bad edit

Is this why you want the date so badly, so you know how much longer you can save for your PC? ;)
---
That summer i grinded my ass off to get rank 13 but when school started i was like 90% into rank 12 ans never was able to get rank 13 FeelsBadMan
---
This is true
---
I‚Äôm so confused as to what your argument is. I‚Äôm not whining about symmetry or balance or anything about the class as it was in Classic, my only complaint is Ret on LIVE has been homogenized to be like every other dps class and plays nothing like how the class originated with seals, blessings, etc.
---
I‚Äôm aware Ret is not a viable endgame PVE option. I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôm excited to play Paladin, level as ret, and I‚Äôll play holy at endgame
---
This might sound crazy but some people play what they want to play not because of Meta status but because they enjoy it
---
Bless you for all your content. I haven't laughed this hard since I was a little girl.
---
Hey, the game isn‚Äôt released yet. The sub will change over time, but you gotta deal with the hype and excitement/nothing to talk about for a few more months.
---
weary of being H Y P E
---
and apathy about answering the same Google-able questions over and over
---
You guys will realize pretty quickly that this is a terrible idea. Just level up at your own pace. If you're on the same quests, that's all fine and dandy, complete them together. Same goes for instances. But don't live in the illusion that you 5 will level together most of the time. That won't happen.
---
Obviously, it will be over 9000.
---
Yeah lol, that whole bit made me be like, this dudes a idiot
---
Im not allowed to hate something i was a part of? therefore im a liar... Anyway, so you pretty much suggested scaling. Well, good luck explaining not only arenas, but putting them in with scaling on gear. Because nothing says fun like grinding to rank 14 or whatever that arena gear would be, to end up with "normalized", gear.
---
You didn't ask for anything game changing in your OP but the moment the hard facts about PvP came, you deviated from your initial suggestion. Lets agree to disagree.
---
Agree. Ret is DoA without Crusader Strike.
---
People defending Towelie and this sub? Jesus man. Please just gtfo
---
Meh ...
---
"Toxic" is just a buzzword for "negative opinion I disagree with".
---
If a shaman is dying and running from you, you can dispell Ghost Wolf :D
---
There is a clear lack of Starbucks here.
---
I suspect they simply went with "int". Didn't take into consideration unsigned simply because they thought that no one would ever reach the limit and overflow. And considering that it took about 3 years for someone to do so, I suspect their assumption was fairly accurate. Additionally, math on mixed signed and unsigned integers does tend to be surprising from time to time. Because of this, compilers will typically issue warning messages when mixed signed/unsigned math is being done and since the default for integers constants is signed, it would make sense to just get rid of all those warnings and leave the gold as a signed integer.
---
Now the current gold cap for retail is totally arbitrary since it's quite likely they're using signed long integers (range =  -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) and the limit of 99,999,990,000 copper is quite a bit lower.
---
make a bank alt and send the BoE to them if you cant use it. sell it on Auction House when the market is ready. the AH market will be a shitshow for a few months. be smart and wait.
---
I always solve this by having a toon that is that group‚Äôs toon. I play that toon when everyone else is on and it‚Äôs our time to play, be that 3-5 times a week or once every other week. If I want to play on my own, I have another.
---
Ret in 1.12 is fucking terrible and not viable in any context outside a 30 second fight pvp or pve???????????
---
You prefer that?
---
Hey it‚Äôs a gilded retriever!
---
There are world arenas in the game.  All you need is a website and people to sign up.
---
MAna Burn is a "direct damage" spell, impossible to dispell. Maybe you tought about interrupt?
---
Moar!!!üòä
---
Yea I don‚Äôt understand the Blizz logic either as FCFS still exists among many classes today and it‚Äôs a perfectly fine system. However, now every class HAS to have a generator/spender system
---
Go rogue! They are fun for PvP and PvE!
---
Love it.
---
Resilience completely changed pvp from being dynamic and bursty into a grind fest of who could wear the other team down. This was done, at least in part, so it could be more palatable as an e-sport thing.
---
It made pvp more boring and predictable.
---
Yep, gold/yellow themed warriors.
---
The only thing i can say is this, i want to see a quest named "Rude Awakening". Been waiting for 15 years for this moment. Didn't touch a Pserver even once.
---
Meh
---
/facepalm
---
Most people had outdated gear because quests rarely gave upgrades for your spec and the AH was too expensive for low levels to buy new gear constantly. 
---
Did you have a list of the quests that had your upgrades, or were you just lucky?
---
You can ofensive dispell magic buff effects on foes with shaman, priest and warlock (felhunter).
---
You can defensivelly dispell magic debuff effects on friends with priest, paladin, warlock (felhunter)
---
You can defensivelly dispell curse debuffs on friends with mages and druids
---
you can defensivelly dispell disease debuffs with shaman and priests
---
you can defensivelly dispell poison debuffs with shaman, druids and paladins
---
I gotchu bruh post your address I'll buy your house.
---
Ok bud.
---
Please accept this gold star for winning an argument within an opinion piece. Don't hurt your hand patting yourself on the back.
---
That coyote in the lower right corner looks diseased. It should be killed.
---
Bad edit.
---
Astranaar was under attack a lot whenever I played.
---
You guys should have your own server so your sycophantic fans can carry you to 60 and give you gold for your mount and all the other nonsense that you‚Äôve come to rely on in Retail.
---
You're right, the perfect word is 'weird'. A lot of things you expect won't actually be there. Rolling up into Stormwind and there's like no level 60s anywhere... creeeepppyyyyyy....
---
Youre probably thinking, "these fuckers even have a lighting crew...?". Sure its the apocalypse but light some torches or firepits ffs
---
Love it Haha good job. This is the meme replays that we deserve
---
So glad you found the show and that you‚Äôre enjoying it! Thanks so much for listening :)
---
My english is bad and i always seem like im the bad guy, gotta live with this i guess.
---
Im not looking at this as a win or lose, i want to be sure that both of us can see further into an argument rather than declaring winners. Im not asking you to change your opinion, just making sure if a suggestion like this could bring potential problems and eventually deviate to something bigger.
---
Same thing as hunter focus.
---
&gt;downloading pornography

You know I've read this pasta a million times and I somehow only just noticed how much these two words date it lol

I wouldn't trust Blizzard to actually change it and fiddle around with the specifics, but obviously classic isn't the perfect "ideal" for anything other than nostalgia. graphics changes, balance changes, an increase to class complexity etc are all things that could **theoretically** be implemented without taking away anything that made vanilla as great as it was, further improving upon the game.
---
if Naxx was teased in vanilla but never actually came out because TBC release was rushed, there'd be threads right now saying "I'd really like to see what Naxx would have been like" and people here would be saying "NO CHANGES! NO NAXX!"
---
and they'd probably right as a matter of principle, but it doesn't change that vanilla+naxx is better than vanilla without it. similarly, there are probably plenty of things blizzard considered implementing back in the day that would've been seen as iconic vanilla elements if they did - arena possibly being one of them
---
If I was to have a warlock/spriest char that ill be mostly doing world pvp with, and created an alt that i used strictly for pve/raiding, would you recommend a hunter or a warrior? Id like to tank or just chill as a hunter but I hear a lot of people saying that trying to tank raids itll be tough to get in a group for it
---
Laughed my ass off the entire video in public. Ppl looking at and avoiding me like im Stitches or something...
---
indeed, massive if factual
---
Yep, it escalated so bad over the years that it completely drove me off PvP. I can take only SO much arenas with 20-30 min length.
---
but just adding arena to vanilla doesn't mean resilience has to be added too, right?
---
Same here man. With weekly responsibilities and such and the fiance not letting me take time off work, I'd be lucky to be able to play 20 hours a week. Gonna take me most of phase 1 just to hit 60 :(
---
i mean the dudes literally saying he doesnt do shit when theres video evidence to the contrary lul. i saw them kill wow once already, dont want that to be twice xD
---
Hahaha this is so fucking good
---
Rose tinted glasses generally imply a feeling of nostalgia. The issue with this is that this view is silly. Most of us have played the game within the last 5 years. It's not nostalgia that drives our love for the game. It's the fact it's a far superior and distinct product to the current retail wow.
---
In fact despite what you are claiming here. It's retail wow that makes it bread and butter on rose tinted glasses. The game would have failed a long time ago. If echo's of it's previous greatness didn't have millions coming back to enjoy a game they can't accept blizzard killed long ago.
---
This gifs are the only thing keeping me sane right now
---
Oh boy, another "PvP video" that is just a compilation of crits and trinket procs.
---
Nobody hates Starwars like Starwars fans.
---
I just started a new Bachelor course. While working 3 days a week besides that. With WoW coming up this summer. Wtf am I doing?  
---
Good luck with your final month mate! You can do it!
---
If you call your wife "the wife" yeah I dont think that's a good thing
---
Well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. A large number of us are going to grind the shit out of it and then burn ourselves out all over again exactly as we did in 04-06. I would like a little something "extra" that wasn't there before that can supplement the fun while not being game-breaking. It's a pipe dream in this environment.
---
Glad you got that fine guldmedalj
---
Ok, that makes sense. Thanks man!
---
Sadly true! I recently played to 120 in retail. Playing to 60 was fun because I could join friends very easily with the level scaling as it was. 60 - 80 was quite a grind. And everyone being locked off in 20 level sections from that point on made it to where we all just planned on meeting up at 120.
---
BFA was a disaster. Literally every single one of us stopped playing. Now my friend wants me to play WoW Classic, claiming it will be better. But I don't have time to raid or anything hardcore like that. I'm pretty casual. I can REMEMBER as kids when I wanted to play with him and he explained that it wouldnt be worth it because of xp loss to both of us, but that I could meet up with him at the next dungeon. By the time I got there, he said the same thing about the NEXT dungeon. I stopped playing.
---
20 years later, he expects me to try again?! :) :P
---
I think I'm the only idiot who misses back when paladins had Holy Strike and Crusader Strike.
---
Spearmint - the guy who removes my posts!
---
Might be a high rank guy, but he hurts those feels üò≠.
---
Big if big
---
He contributes to your server firsts via decreasing your trash ttk, it's why you beat \[rival guild\] by just 30 seconds on server first KT!
---
What are some PvP videos that you like?
---
I hope they remember you
---
Barman shanker op
---
I'm gonna snag that sweet burnt leather set off the AH for a steal.
---
Is that goldshire?
---
I played Ally once at launch, jumped to Horde ever since
---
That's kind of you. On the other side of the table, I really don't want to hold my friend back. I want him to go as hard on wow classic as his heart desires, without my casual ass holding him back. But without friends, this game doesn't actually do it for me. (don't hate!!) Maybe I can convince him to just make an alt that he only plays when I'm on or something...
---
???
---
Seems viable. I will likely try to do this, but this also requires **cooperation** between disparate groups.
---
As you are well aware, the people of the internet are not always the most cooperative bunch.
---
Hmmm where have I seen the inside of this inn before.....
---
The fresh part I‚Äôm meh about. Permanent, official servers.. that has me excited. Can‚Äôt. Fucking. Wait.
---
Are you going Human Male paladin again? What‚Äôs your leveling build going to look like?
---
Nah there's almost no items that work like this in Vanilla. Only one I can think of is the Green Whelp Armor which says on the description of the item that it wont work against level 50+
---
Ignore the idiot who either is or was influenced by idiots who destroyed their own world and started an unprovoked war on another world and lost said war and then started crying "But you gotta share your world with us!"
---
Perhaps we should set up a few nature preserves for the Orcs since they are an endangered species.... On the other hand, fuck 'em.
---
Similar, except me and the girlfriend have agreed that I would spend an hour a day on the days I work and then 3 on my days off. :P
---
If you only goal is to do dungeons and not raid. I would agree. That being said I would also say. If that is the case you should pick a druid. As warriors suck in every aspect of the game except tanking dungeons until they get raid gear. 
---
They suck at farming, they suck at pvp, and they suck at leveling (at least on pvp servers). Why pick one if you aren't going to raid? Not saying that last part as a put down. Just asking a genuine question. Because I honestly can't wrap my head around picking a warrior if you don't plan to raid.
---
Yeah, from my basic understanding the 'tick window' in Classic is much bigger, so more spells are sent in one batch (casting at once). 
---
Nowadays the tick window is smaller so the polymorph is sent before the charge. Back in the day the polymorph and charge would be in the same 'spell batch' so they happen at the same time.
---
More info here https://www.wowhead.com/news=290910/spell-batching-in-classic-wow
---
No worries dude. I want an authentic experience, too. I'd just like a few new things to *supplement* the fun that isn't entirely a game-breaking deviation from the experience. I'll see you in Azeroth homie.
---
I haven't been able to find any, because every PvP video I find is just a compilation of crits and trinket procs.
---
Why did you ruin the final joke with your title?
---
&gt;Also the enchant isn't even out at release.
---
Ofcourse not, but thats besides the point.
---
30 Spellpower is the only enchant that does anything for your AoE threat. It's also pretty close to Lifesteal for single target threat. Really no reason not to use it.
---
Is this what we have become....with out a release date we are nothing.
---
The majority of guilds, even rather high "ranked" ones, are not constantly optimizing setups. Warrior is the most popular class and they're not all going to tank, but I'm quite sure most will still get their raid spot.
---
Can't wait to run BRD again. I still remember my first ever BRD run. None of us knew wtf we were doing. We spent 5 hours in there and didn't even finish it.
---
Hey! I like TipsOut, baby!
---
Literally highlight stickied post on the top of the subreddit.
---
Could never get that hunter pet to spawn.
---
One of the comments is no longer viewable. I assume thats the one you were pointing to here.
---
Bad edit
---
Axe smith gets nightfall, mace smith gets sulfron hammer. And armor smith gets the fire resist gear and lion heart helm. 
---
Armor smith is the best choice.
---
You typical classic fanboys. You're all hilariously pathetic. It's one thing to be like most of the population and be excited to play it again. It's another to think it's going to be what most of you think it'll be. A few months after it comes out, you're all going to complain about how the game is because the people like me who try to warn you all and you all won't listen. Luckily you're only the 1% of the Classic WoW potential population otherwise Blizzard would be absolutely screwed with this project.
---
Huh? Holy power was a wrath thing.
---
Thanks dude, more is coming!
---
I‚Äôm going for a gaming laptop so I can sit on the sofa and play while pretending to watch what she‚Äôs got on the tv.
---
This man deserves a special title for his contributions
---
This is awsome! xD Just keep making more, this is best hype I seen my life :D
---
Hey, you're that guy I was talking with in one of my posts! Thanks for talking with me btw.
---
I definitely learned quickly that the front page was a meme-fest so I've been sorting by New pretty much the whole time I've been here, but still, coming from other subs, it's a bit annoying to see people downvoting stuff that can lead to interesting discussion just because they personally don't like it, especially if they don't take the time to explain what it is about the suggestion/comment/thing they don't like/agree with.
---
That's pretty much just the Lion's Pride Inn, tho. But owned by the Undead
---
Level 10
---
Level 14
---
Level 8
---
And highest level 16.
---
This is a disaster in the making.
---
I love how "Shaman (heal spec)" and "Resto Shaman" are two different things here =p
---
Hey Geno,
---
It's one of the main highlights listed by Blizzard for phase 1.
---
Teeb
---
Fan of parks and rec at all? Something with Jerry/gerry/Larry would be so good.
---
This season is garbage
---
You'll wanna bind rank 1 of a trash blessing
---
And rank 1 of a seal 
---
I do rank 1 seal of righteousness and rank1 blessing of wisdom (although i rarely use the trash blessing)
---
There will be times shamans chase you around purging you over and over again, if you keep putting up a 30 mana seal they can rarely resist. And paladin doens't have much to do while moving anyway beyond cleanse and big cds.
---
&gt;Paladin really died in my eyes when holy power was introduced
---
I mained pally from vanilla to wrath.  the holy power thing killed it for me..
---
Recently on a private test realm I got Krol Blade on my lvl 56 Warrior. Amazing day that was.
---
Im not entirely sure but dont you gotta be out of combat to use your traps? Or is that wrong?
---
I mean the clip ain't wrong
---
Holy power more like
---
Bump
---
I‚Äôm a bit worried that I‚Äôll pick an unbalanced server. I know it‚Äôll be tough if there is a 70/30 alliance split to stay on that server, but the fact that leveling is so slow is going to make that decision even worse.
---
you are right, in classic you cannot tame plainstriders
---
Cool, thank you for your input!
---
Windfury totem is better than salv though
---
Thanks for the input dude, much appreciated.
---
People tend to pick apart specifics when it comes to ideas, which for the sake of a generalized discussion they should be left out to prevent a perpetual proposition/rebuttal. That is why I didn't go there.
---
Assistant to the raid leader
---
Ah, the Borderlands method.
---
I've been thinking about it, got some drafts with Parks and recs aswell. Stay tuned ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëå
---
I mostly excited for the first 2-3 years of WoW. However, I am wary once the content runs out....Blizzard execs might swoop in and try to bleed us dry for our money with micros-transactions.
---
Meh... Bad edit.
---
Uh, I think you replied to the wrong person lol
---
You have way too much time on your hands. I‚Äôm jealous.
---
and you gotta deal with my mocking you for titling your post with "Is Anyone..." for a few more months.
---
Sincerely, Anyone
---
P.S. I'm excited too.
---
No it's not lol
---
And it's certainly not better than all the blessings combined
---
Salv alone &gt; all shaman buffs
---
If you feel different you have no idea what your'e talking about...Only place in the game you're gonna get that sorta buff is from pala
---
Alliance is teh superior faction by miles because Paladin &gt; Shaman by miles outside AB
---
Cheapshotlol
---
Idts because you‚Äôre limited to one spec in raids..
---
Hi I actually played Vanilla who wants to group up?
---
Easy, human warlock. If my friends roll horde instead, orc warlock. Profs is my hard question. Herb/Alch or Tailor/Chanter.
---
Do it for Lost in Battle.
---
Read the whole topic. Arena without at least some balance can't exist. Vanilla has neither a class balance, nor it has good itemization, it was mostly an RPG (all three of these being pillars of why vanilla is so loved). Warrior and healer will annihilate everything else. A game of rock/paper/scissors and full of oneshots. Why even put arena? If world PvP is fun, and BG is something to test how big your peepee has become, an arena will only bring endless rage. Warriors and pompyro mages everywhere... trust me, you don't want to see the backlash when only 1 combo in the game can reliably destroy everyone else.
---
That‚Äôs exactly where i stopped buying physical copies as wel. Always thought they were really well made though
---
prepare to run Blackrock Depths. a LOT.
---
That's exactly what I have, however I'm not able to really focus on the game and engage in meaningful conversation, so we set limits. :P 
---
The nights where she works and I don't it's FFA for me though. XD
---
Paladin died even before that to me.  Retribution Paladin in WotLK was basically a Warrior who also heals people.  As much as people hated the old seal and judgment system, it's what made the class unique.  I feel that uniqueness could have been spared while still fixing the "boring" rotation.
---
Arena saved PVP.
---
But the Barrens is a Horde zone and you're safe there unless you flag?
---
I am considering playing retail for the first time for classic wow.
---
I started playing WoW as a teenager on private servers. I started with TBC, and moved onto WoTLK servers shortly after where I have spend most of my time. I played all professions in most of the specs (preferred dps or tank) and I've done semi-hardcore raiding, pushing for progression when new raids released and hardcore pvp (think 2300+ rating arenas and day long marathons of battle grounds).
---
My experience with classic is limited to a private server where I leveled a ret paladin (whoops!) which I then respecced to holy. I did only dungeon runs without getting too much into it. I quit the game few years ago, for no particular reason.
---
I am in my early 20s now and very busy with big life goals and focusing on my career. Thus - my real life will take absolute priority over gaming. I am however going to give classic a shot. See if it's something I can play to take a break from busy life.
---
**I am going to play a night elf restoration druid on EU server (anything but rp)**. My offspect will most likely be feral since moonkin is trash, but I wouldnt mind speccing moonkin for the buff. My goal will be casual/semi-hardcore raiding. I like to put in the effort and get things done, but I am not sacrifing my life for it. I am aiming to play a healthy time daily (max 2-3 hrs most of days, there are days where I could play all day long too if I feel like it). I will be able to raid few times a week. I don't mind giving up the loot **sometimes**. There are people more dedicated to raiding than I am, gearing them will benefit the group the most - and I get it. Just aiming to chill few evenings a week.
---
If you are thinking of doing dungeons while leveling, or you are looking for a healer to do dungeons at lvl 60 - you can send me a PM through reddit.
---
See ya.
---
I fucking love you, man
---
Until they have to level them. lol
---
Holy shit! Stop flooding the feed with this crap. Make your own subreddit if you want the attention that bad
---
this is the freshest content we've had in months, your work fills my heart with good feelings, thank you op &lt;333
---
The game hasn't failed because it keeps making content for people to play. They adapt to the current MMO setting to stay competitive in order to survive. Rose tinted glasses have next to nothing to do with retail.
---
And did you say old vanilla WoW is better than current? Long ass waybacks from death, ammo system, pet happiness system, repetition that's far worse than it is now, 2-4 loot drops for 40 man raids, the god awful attunement quests, the time it takes to make a group for a dungeon, the mindless mob grinding for rep, leveling up weapon skills, dishonorable kills, high end guilds literally controlling who raids, all the bugs, useless specs and classes (tank pally? Lolno), upgrading skills with gold like an apple product and that's just the tip of the ice berg. The amount of issues classic had were outrageous, but most of us didn't know any better back then. MMO's were still considered new and WoW made it mainstream. Not to mention the eventual of stale content since there will be no new updates to classic. Oh lets not forget that you have to pay for it which a lot of the private server community has beef with.
---
If you think that's better and that most people agree with you then i'm calling you ignorant. Very different market audience than it was in 2004-2006. Classic would be lucky if it carried two financial reports before it falls under the radar due to people leaving it from anger, boredom or both.
---
Im no faction atm.
---
This is awsome xD I mean office is for me classic office, it's like they are waiting with us when classic get release :D I LOVE your work!
---
Or, you know, compare it to your actual experience on vanilla. Which would tell you that vanilla was harder.
---
I‚Äôm going for a female dwarf priest named chad. I‚Äôve memorized my character creation choices so that I have the best odds of getting it.
---
I'm so tired of not playing rn
---
Lol a female priest named Chad?
---
I 100% thought you meant like a stone tablet and I upvoted you for troll.  Then I reread and wanted to give you two upvotes because it's probably easier to GIF with a stone tablet than an iPad.
---
i want
---
The shared data folder for WoW is around 60 GB, the Classic specific stuff won't be super large so a 70 GB stick should suffice.
---
I'm not the most hardcore #nochanges person I've ever met (the graphics stuff suggested in this thread seems fine to me) but I am pretty far down that spectrum. I've explained my position 50 times so I'm just going to copy/paste from a comment I made yesterday:
---
&gt;There is also a lot of history involved here [that is being overlooked].
---
&gt;1. This community is predominately made up of people who spent 5-10 years watching WoW slowly morph from something they loved into something they hated. This change was not immediate, it was a death by a thousand cuts. Casual players and people who wanted easier more accessible content spouted "this one change won't make a difference" and they were right. But they did it over, and over again until we got BFA. While this doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the quality of the changes being proposed now, it does explain the communities hesitation to allow changes on principle, and their sometimes aggressive defense of #nochanges.
---
&gt;2. There are thousands of people in this community, and most people have 1-2 things they would change about vanilla WoW. However what those things are varies from person to person. If I like flying mounts, and you like RDF, and Tim the Mage likes sharding, and we all make our "one tiny change" we suddenly legitimately do wind up far closer to BFA than anyone is comfortable with.
---
/invite
---
üì∑ Looks like he made it happen.
---
Yep
---
Get ready for alliance hiding int eh zeppelin 
---
Hahaha
---
One of my favorite thing to do on pservers was log on out the zeppelin and leave a stealth logged in. Watching the enemies. He would tell us if we could beat the gruop that got on, and if they had aoe fears (bugs on teh zeppelin if they catch you in one you just rubberband hundreds of meters away). So you'd kill the aoe fears first then mop em up. Go back down and hide again.
---
Rinse repeat
---
&gt; There are still imports for Appearance, Faction and Race changes however, 
---
Sure there's people who won't be happy about this, but I think it's kinda expected they'd have MTX in the form of character services. Much rather this than an in game store.

---
Towelliee is the type of person that when you learn about him, you wonder how such a terrible human being can exist.
---
I'm going to post an unpopular opinion here:  out of every specialization in every build of the game, my absolute favorite was the Mists of Pandaria Holy Paladin.  Which is funny because ever since Holy Power was introduced, I've hated every other version of the Holy Paladin.
---
I liked it because of the depth it had:
---
* Mana was still kind of important, as you had to prioritize your non-mana abilities and you could go OOM from constantly spamming Holy Radiance or Flash of Light
---
* You had multiple ways to generate Holy Power (Holy Shock, Holy Radiance, or directly healing Beacon of Light), so it didn't feel like you were shoe-horned into using only one ability.
---
* Speaking of Beacon of Light, there was more strategy into whether or not to heal the Beacon target than in WotLK
---
* There were also multiple ways of spending Holy Power.  I only wish that Eternal Flame was an addition instead of a replacement to Word of Glory (or whatever the name of that one was)
---
* The cooldowns.  Oh, the cooldowns.  I don't remember exactly how many there were, but you had about 6-8 cooldowns (including trinkets), and they did different things.  Boosts to raw healing, haste and crit, holy power generation, reduction in mana cost.  You could chain them together for an extended boost to your heals, or hit a "oh crap" button to shoot your healing up by about 300% for a quick burst to get through tough times.
---
Nothing else in the Holy Power era has come close to this, and a big part is because they got rid of most of the cooldowns and dumbed down the rotation.
---
You‚Äôre really underestimating how much dps windfury totem adds to a raid.
---
I mean its a 15 year old game, most people know what leveling a rogue and warrior is like. There's a reason why warriors and rogues are some of the most played classes on private servers.
---
I would expect anywhere from 8-16GB. It's based off of the retail client, but they are stripping away a lot of what makes retail so large. It will be significantly smaller than retail, but also a decent bit larger than vanilla private servers.
---
It doesn't add as much as salv tho
---
Because in a good raid fury warriors will be capped by threat
---
Same with someof your casters if they crit'
---
\*mind blown\*
---
They would still be threat capped if they had windfury
---
WF &gt; Salv for shitters, yes, not anyone who has any idea how to PvE in vanilla.
---
If your tank's skill &gt; your whole raid. Yea you don't need salv. But that's not a good raid. Why is that tank even playing with you plebs?
---
&gt; If you think that's better and that most people agree with you then i'm calling you ignorant.
---
Hey man that is what makes the world wonderful. Everyone sees things differently. Truth is we won't know who is right for sure until it drops. People like you keep trying to tell me "the culture has changed". I would say it has and, that culture change has alienated millions. Again though. We won't know until release.
---
huh?
---
No it wasn't.
---
Very true. Embrace these times though, because one day this sub will be taken over with ‚ÄúI cleared Naxx and I‚Äôm bored. Blizzard better create new content! F‚Äô this game!‚Äù
---
Should be ‚Äúsince Azeroths‚Äô been turning ‚Äú lol.
---
I always find these request for changes to come from a place of extreme arrogance. People who think they know how to make a better MMORPG than everyone else, including the original WoW developers.  
---
Well if you think you can make a better WoW, then go make one. We all know that many have tried and all have failed.
---
In terms of content, I‚Äôm not too worried, as I‚Äôll be a casual and will still have plenty to do in 2-3 years. I am among those who would like to see side-content added, where new loot doesn‚Äôt invalidate old, but that‚Äôs something to worry about 1-2 years from now and depends entirely on classic‚Äôs monetary value at that stage.
---
I guess I‚Äôm not too worried about micro transactions. I‚Äôm pretty sure they know it would kill Classic.
---
It was added in the cata pre-patch
---
We r in the same boat my friend, but nothing can stop us from classic!!!!!!
---
I remember farming the barman on my rogue solo for days.
---
Arenas are indeed minor changes. Can't you atleast not destroy your point within your own statement? We are talking about the nature of this thread i hope?
---
Yes, they are the best in PvP and PvE as both the only tanks and the top DPS. That is what I mean, and it is fucking horrible for the state of game balance.
---
Solo PvP is their only weakness, and only in some matchups, and that isn't a thing that actually matters in classic because grouping is so much better.
---
alright, what's up with the dog pic
---
edit: oh shit never I get it lul
---
- Troll
---
- Priest
---
- PvP (although possibly RP-PvP if such ends up existing)
---
- Tailoring/Enchanting
---
- Hybrid Holy spec for leveling, Holy at 60
---
- Casual guild with friends. I'm a fan of "Friends and Family" type of guilds.
---
If this is during the start of the server
---
You get your ass over there and defend your home! FOR THE HORDE!
---
r/wowservers
---
Lol what? Who shit in your cereal this morning bro? Why are you so mad
---
\+1
---
Arena saved pvp, then the arena-specific gear grind as essential itemization killed pvp. It could have been implemented and balanced in so many different ways other than itemization.
---
Exactly, /y FOR THE HORDE!!
---
If only this group of heroes knew how to pose for a picture.
---
Loved fighting the giant drakes
---
Hi, /u/Hawkzer
---
haha and I miss old new ret. new new ret is just a lit up warrior. I miss ice skating around with my judgement sprint and playing as support outside of wings.
---
You will not have shoulder pads at level 16!!!
---
Fear ward needs to be precast and dwarf priests will be way less prominent than undeads in total. \~40% of the horde are undead, roughly 8-9% of alliance players will be dwarf priests according to  [https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/](https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/)  .
---
not everybody, that's one of the great parts, some people will choose to equip that boe epic, or give it to a friend
---
I, for one, welcome our fury warrior overlords! I'll be proudly spamming Curse of Recklessness and making my raid use Annihilator!
---
What episode is this?
---
What? Retail literally hands you gear without stepping into raids, offers FOUR difficulty settings for raids that literally make the raid easy to the point of boredom, THREE difficulties for dungeons, allows you to solo old raids and even has a queue system for just about everything to avoid making one yourself.
---
It literally caters to the casual audience.
---
There are several quests there for ally. One gives a trinket lucky pocketwaych or something. Also a fiery enchant item thats pretty cool
---
You do realize shamans have something called ‚Äútranquil air totem‚Äù also, right?
---
*mind blown*
---
If tank specs fury to tank, you can pretty much ignore threat.
---
*mind further blown*
---
Yes, they implemented these things and called them expansions. I hear its in a pretty good state now. Don't use that old excuse "it evolved back then, therefore more changes are fine". You need to draw a line somewhere, or the "Classic" part loses it's meaning. That line was drawn the day TBC came. Would you say the same if TBC was called WoW 2? Then why call it classic. Not attacking just wondering what's the deal with your example... 
---
If blizzard didn't add Naxx before TBC, then it wasn't part of classic. By this logic we would eventually have ended up with LFR/LFG, so lets add them too.
---
This situation is highly improbable. I don't think you have anything to worry about.
---
They are plebs who got sucked into a game for the mass market
---
Who cares what they think?
---
No one who likes that soulless shit in retail has any taste anyway.
---
dude I'm not even gonna be looking at this sub when the game is released. I'll be too busy, you know, playing THE FUCK out of the game?
---
anyone still left posting here after release day will be clearly NOT PLAYING THE FUCK OUT OF THE GAME HARD ENOUGH!
---
&gt;In terms of content, I‚Äôm not too worried, as I‚Äôll be a casual and will still have plenty to do in 2-3 years.
---
This is what I‚Äôm mostly excited about. I played WoW at release, but didn‚Äôt get past level 20 until I had to step away until mid 2006. I felt like I was trying to rush before BC came out and ended up playing non-stop for 8 months.
---
This time I will be able to take my time and work through all the content at my own pace, because there is no imminent threat that I won‚Äôt have time to get through everything.
---
No the person you‚Äôre responding to is just a massive douche lol
---
You can't be killed in the barrens as a horde unless you attack them first
---
Thank the maker! I was worried I would have to start collecting animals in pairs...
---
&gt;Enjoy the ride, folks!
---
the ride for some people is min/maxing.  that's fun to some people.
---
This is the thing I‚Äôm most hyped for.
---
The majority of memes in this sub don't make sense.
---
Better than ‚Äòmy old lady‚Äô lmao
---
The beta is around ~12gb.
---
You can make a one button macro to do everything for affliction
---
real fkin original m8
---
We found the Warlock who will act as a pedestal for the Warrior Army! HEIL!
---
I mean, did you play during vanilla? What were some of your favorite vids from back in the day if so? World of roguecraft is a good mix of funny and impressive because he just stunlocks geared people to death with nothing but a worn dagger if you haven‚Äôt seen that.
---
Haha! My favorite part is when ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE! This is the one place where I don't mind wiping at all. It's hilarious.
---
Hey, same here! Let's unite in this struggle.
---
this shit is so entertaining xD
---
People also generally don't appriciate how much of an impact some of the proposed "minor changes" can actually have on practical gameplay.
---
lol tranquil air totem? Hahahaha
---
how is that working out for your casters?
---
Gl finding that useful as you engage
---
Horde plebs christ....No buddy horde sucks this is vanilla not retail. '
---
Light of elune and paladins, nuf said
---
I definitely see both sides,  but being a more casual and new player my first time around it seriously sucked finding out that it raised each time lol. 
---
I remember it having diminishing returns,  but maybe that was later
---
I've been trying to figure this one out.  I know you have to be OOC to lay the trap, and I know it's usually used with FD to drop said combat, but does the pet keep you in it?  Does your pet have to be put on passive for this?
---
Sure you‚Äôll get less exp per mob and collection quests will take more kills, but your time to kill and downtime will be so low it‚Äôll easily make up for it. On top of that you‚Äôll have a significantly reduced risk of ever dying which further makes up for the reduced mob xp.
---
Plus it‚Äôs more fun, which is the most important part IMO.
---
Group of travellers*
---
I see the 13 year olds are out in force today.
---
cook em in a pot like gumbo
---
When I was like 12 I made a UD rogue named ‚Äòoneshotu‚Äô lol
---
Of course a good mage would cast counterspell on the warrior first so he enters combat and can no longer charge. On of my finest memories in WoW was kiting my guilds main tank, that was in full T2 around the entrance to Onyxias lair hitting him with level one frostbolts for 20 minutes waiting for the group to assemble. Can't wait for this shit again
---
I will and it will go better than on the pserver were I tried him last. Mobs with pets don't work properly there...
---
I get that. I just hope those same people aren't also saying, "there's nothing to do" and "we need more content" in 2 months. ;)
---
Anybody got the links or clips related to this
---
Yoink- my plan now
---
**Weeks, guys.**
---
EU bro
---
I'd say druid if you wanna maximize the amount of fun in BG/pvp while still getting an easy raid spot due to your utility. Also there's much less competition for druid gear VS priest gear in raids so that's a nice perk as well.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why you explained LC to me but sure. I‚Äôve raided under all the loot systems. I‚Äôd be annoyed by someone who raided just to pvp. I‚Äôm a raider. I don‚Äôt pvp hardly at all. One thing about loot council is we knew which items were pvp and which were pve. I‚Äôm not saying anyone should tell you how to spend your dkp.
---
SERIOUSLY! Not even should be, he IS the gold standard. He's not flashy, he doesn't use shitty thumbnails or titles, his videos are reasonably content-ful when they are long. 
---
I am glad to hear all of this, in general, but them not inviting MadSeason would be disappointing (no idea if they did.)
---
It doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôve played enough vanilla to know what the fuck you are talking about at all, let alone played with any top hardcore guilds.
---
You probably should just shut the fuck up because you‚Äôre in over your head here bud.
---
Like I was saying, the ONLY benefit that paladins allow is a more flexible raid comp. That‚Äôs it. A fully min maxed horde raid will blow a fully min maxed alliance raid out of the water, due to windfury totem.
---
I was reading into this thread to find some shaman info but can't find much about it.
---
I was wondering how they are in both PVP and PVE, is enhance actually viable/good in PVE? What is the general playstyle?
---
I personally am totally fine with keeping the launch version of WoW classic as close to the original product as realistically possible, however I also feel that, knowing what we know now about the consequences of some of these changes, we can manage to refine WoW Classic to a better version of what it is without eliminating why we loved it the first time around.
---
As many people have said, Vanilla WoW was far from perfect, so for a large population of people to just blindly spout "#nochanges" over and over ad nauseum is just as bad for the game's health as making massive sweeping changes without thinking of the consequences. 
---
Out of curiosity. Once the Classic WoW servers have "run their course" and players have once again expended all of the content it has to offer, what do you think should happen? Should the servers just restart? Or do you think that eventually, in order for WoW Classic to remain fresh and enjoyable, Blizzard will have to eventually make changes? If Blizzard decides to release progression servers, how do you think they should be handled? Should TBC, WotLC, Etc also have #nochanges? Or at that point should Blizzard only make "good" changes and not "bad" changes?
---
Basically, what I am trying to say is that at some point, for the health of WoW Classic, changes **WILL** need to be made. Maybe not at release. Maybe not right after all of the vanilla content has been patched in. But eventually, WoW Classic will need to change or it will die.
---
Ha, jabroni.
---
lol brah i played on a p server where i literally never got capped on in a BG in teh premade...
---
I'm better than the paladins monkey newz and the best guild on the p server scene plays wtih, there are a handful of players in his guild as good as me. 
---
You have no idea what you're talking about Go get on the big p server and learn your place.
---
Anything approaching equal skill Alliance &gt; Horde, always outside AB
---
Agreed. dwarf priests are 1/4 as popular as undead, and have 4x the immunity opportunity (30 sec cd, precast sure, vs 2 min wotf cd)
---
Downvote and move on. It's fun and there's nothing better to do here anyways, at the moment.
---
Not sure if it's the patch notes somewhere. Maybe someone will come along who had a similar experience.
---
Edit: Found this http://classicdb.ch/?npc=5862#comments
---
Classic will be the first "new" MMO that I have played in years, and the only one I've been even a little bit hyped about since, well, I can't remember when.
---
And starting fresh when everyone else is starting fresh as well is the biggest reason I'm hyped for it. Add that to the fact that this "fresh start" server is reviving a game that has a built in base of millions of adoring fans who loved it and long ago left, many of whom are likely to return at least for a bit to check it out and relive their early days.
---
It's going to be an MMO event the like of which has never been seen, and a moment in gaming history that is not likely to be equaled again any time soon. This will be big, and I'm glad I'll be there to see it.
---
I heard that a certain continuation of a certain game tackled that issue very well.
---
The methods they used were the following.
---
Gutted itemization.
---
Removed RPG aspect of the game.
---
Mass homogenization.
---
Extreme prunning.
---
Turned into an Esport rather than MMO.
---
Guess the game and the developers.
---
On a side note, you watch too much propaganda on forums and Pservers. Also warriors are our friends, if they don't tank for us, they can go cry about their unused potential since there isn't enough space for all of them.
---
Top tier content.
---
I think he wanted to give mizkif his own day of streaming so viewer numbers would be better
---
There comes a time in every tips life where they need to break a NDA for the greater good. Is that time now?
---
I'm just worried about the Koala's! WHAT IF THEY DROWN IN OUR TEARS???? D: D: D:
---
Got it, thanks so much!
---
HFC with set bonuses and trinkets was the best place Rets ever been as far as I'm concerned. So many different equally viable choices for talents depending on your comp. 3 wings. God.
---
Who said he was a joke? I didn‚Äôt see personal attacks, I saw reasons why they dislike his content (e.g. 10+ minute with very little content).
---
My account was activated November 24, 2004 but I only got to lvl 40 because I was in highschool and playing two sports and had a life. That doesn't make me any less of a WoW Vanilla fanboy and I like to talk about Vanilla.
---
This is the correct comment
---
We were talking about PvE here not PvP. Lmfao.
---
Also most ‚Äúbig‚Äù private servers were shit because they weren‚Äôt blizz like in raid mechanics or population sizes.
---
You REALLY have no fucking idea what you are talking about. Like. At all.
---
I my money is beta being live by June 4th. Why? That‚Äôs when eso‚Äôs next xpack drops that adds dragons as world bosses, a new map, some dungeons, and a new class. 
---
And Blizzard loves swinging their dick around when it comes to parrying release dates with other MMOs. Also Im speculating that someone at blizzard is getting off to the idea that a beta for a decade old product will out perform a modern game.
---
That's good to know. Somehow I didn't think of PPM here when I know it exists on others like fiery weapon and whatnot.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you just replied to the wrong person or if you‚Äôre just a colossal dick face. Lol
---
Not everyone is spreading false stories, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to label everyone as toxic.
---
Regurgitating text which disabled people can't read isn't "content creation". Nor is someone playing a game with their face in the corner. They are not creating anything of value or substance. Just call them "streamers"
---
The best pve guilds are always the pvp guilds in vanilla
---
Can't really compete with a bunch of guys with vastly better weapons and gear than you
---
Welcome to vanilla, lol
---
Ranking as a 10 man in the same guild guarantees you're gonna be the best raiding guild. And if you're not the PvErs are gonna have to be taking their autism to a next level to come close to your times. And never your parses
---
"It literally caters to the casual audience."
---
I think you may be confusing casual and, does not have time. Casuals as a general rule aren't gear obsessed. So giving them gear for free. Makes them feel happy for about 2 seconds before they go back to being bored.
---
Instead the conception of casual I am talking about. Is the player that raids to go on an adventure with friends. You know he was the shaman in your raid back in classic. You would hear tearing into bong hits before the pull. It would be the person who shows up in the wrong gear. Doing the wrong thing. Or the Donk who is perfectly happy not being a T1 player. Casuals are around to have fun. Not clear content and get gear.
---
If you are this kind of player. New wow holds nothing for you. All you did by stream lining the game. Was give HC players a reason and a way to leave those donks behind. Truth was though even though they were a pain in the ass. They also used to be what brought laughter and happiness to raids. I miss my donks. I miss having a raid of 15 HC monsters and our bag of 25 deplorables.
---
Babies sleep a lot on the first year. I was going to be a good dad and after a week i realised she can sleep just as well on my lap when im playing :)
---
WAT THEN!?
---
Same. I had those trip runner pants on my rogue for a long ass time. Like 20 something levels.  Usually you‚Äôd get a decent piece of gear and it would be a massive upgrade and you‚Äôd keep that for 15 levels until your next massive upgrade
---
I'm sorry, I feel like our wires got crossed here. What warning are you trying to give?
---
Except when you had to escort Marshall Sprintthroughsixpacks McFuckface.  Not that I still have lingering residual anger.
---
I've wondered this too, OP. Never before have I seen such an outspoken negative response to a videogame, what with all the crying and shitposting of:
---
&gt;"it's just nostalgia, the game sucks"
---
&gt;"it will be dead in X months"
---
&gt;"everyone will quit when they remember how BAD it is"
---
&gt;"you don't like the game you just want to relive your childhood"
---
&gt;"lol why do you want to play a 15 year old game you've already played??"
---
Like...I've never seen this level of whining and shitposting and doomsaying about an upcoming videogame before.
---
Thank you for posting this
---
Keep them coming. I love watching these. I upvote all of them.
---
The best pve guilds we‚Äôre alliance in vanilla because nobody min-maxed full raids in vanilla like they do on private servers.
---
Again, no idea what the Fuck you are talking about.
---
That was the summer before I started university - man I‚Äôd kill to go back somehow. Such feels, much nostalgia!
---
burn haha
---
I think the Paladin (and enhancement shaman too) design in vanilla is really clever. Your main ‚Äúattack‚Äù is a proc from your seal/windfury, which let‚Äôs you buff and cleanse and do other things while still doing nearly your maximum melee dps. 
---
In raids there‚Äôs only a few times where this really shines, but it‚Äôs very cool. Chrommaggus in BWL for example. Ret paladins can do their full dps, while also having more dispels than any of the healers.
---
Wheres the doggo?
---
Edit" LOL NVM
---
I think this is a good plan. You don't really need add-ons until you start trying to be competitive in end game. I might get questie because I simply don't see any added benefited of having to run around forever trying to find stuff, alternatively look up online.
---
Buff on 2, caught the clicker
---
I just fail to see how his response had anything to do with what I said. If anything I was criticizing that part of the game lol.
---
I got few barbeques stocked up, heard they are pretty delicious. Though, considering how often i saw rogues back then (pretty prevalent class), id wager that the ones crying will be warriors themselves. The drama on leather gear between warriors and rogues are 30% of the reason i will play classic.
---
Then why are you playing an MMORPG? The whole point is to get gear and do content. If you don't like doing the content the game has then why bother playing at all? Classic is literally that.
---
Man you really did describe rose tinted glasses to the letter. That's exactly what it means by what you're saying.
---
I think arena also led to homogenization... which is BAD.
---
In vanilla isn't releavnt
---
In vanilla reckoning paladins could one shot bosses for half the patches, so up until they patched that yea alliance was best for very different reasons.
---
We're talking 1.12. And 1.12 Alliance is vastly superior
---
And of course you don't. You've never been in a good guild in vanilla. lol
---
Again the cap is threat, and salvation makes it much easier. Not gonna have warlocks randomly critting and being forced to lip or wipe ur raid. lol
---
Even in that scenario, paladin has BoP and can save the raid. So vastly superior to shaman it's crazy you could imagine otherwise.
---
Primary healer on alliance, primary buffer, best oh shit buttons, only reliable way to lower threat (no your totem is not reliable)
---
Combat rogues are perfectly fine at leveling and people need to stop spreading misinformation.
---
3 hours a day?  Yeah he's going to look the same for weeks bro lmao!
---
So May 15 beta confirmed?
---
Bless your content.
---
play... which... ever... faction... you... want... stop... stressing... out... about... the... past... of... the... Horde... and... take... it... easy... on... the.. ellipsis... there... bud...
---
No one in this thread called him a joke? stop being a fucking snowflake
---
Focus on MM and go only to Intimidating at BM ... you will do less dmg than pure MM but you will have more utility and CC ... passive healing is too weak ... unfortunately because I love the idea :P 
---
Surv build is viable late LLAATTEE game when you have lots ot AGI on gear and you go into Surv only for those fatty agi +% ... and rest you put into MM up to scatter shot ... end game such hybrid is also viable because you have good dmg and survivability from Detterance and other passives 
---
During leveling BM is a beast ... seriously sometimes it is crazy unfair ...
---
Tips just letting it all hang out lol.
---
I don‚Äôt mean classic players, I mean ‚Äúcontent crea...‚Äù
---
Sorry, I can‚Äôt even type it. It‚Äôs just too silly. People who play WoW on a webcam.
---
oh i didnt know that WF procs generated rage, that seems pretty OP actually.  is that right??
---
if you ever see a troll tanking in classic you let me know haha, they're like 99% taurens on horde for the HP
---
Shaft and balls out
---
But first, let me take a selfie
---
I like to feel my character ... I want to have the whole experience ... the story telling ... RPG :)
---
I think that for a lot of us dealing with that question is simply getting massively ahead of ourselves. We need a stable, working version of Vanilla first. Then, we need it to be successful enough to show Blizzard its worth investing time and energy into, even as a side project. Finally, we need the Vanilla community at large to grow bored of the current content. That's a lot of steps that need to happen before what you're talking about becomes a concern, especially when you realize that the most vocal portion of the Vanilla community has been playing the same content for a decade and hasn't tired of it yet. 
---
But jumping the gun and talking about all the ways you can "fix" Classic before it's even launched can easily be perceived as a potential threat the the stability I mentioned earlier. It's all fine and well to say "oh we'll get it right this time" but to a lot of us these musings and changes sound eerily familiar, like an abusive ex-lover who has promised they've changed their ways, but keeps repeating the same patterns. 
---
For the record, my opinion on the aFteR NaXx meme is that I'm happy with vertical progression (servers moving into TBC/Wotlk), in which case I would prefer them to stay as true to the original patches as possible. I also think that eventual horizontal progression (1.13, 1.14 etc) has potential to be absolutely mindblowing if executed well. But again, I think its far to early to be worried about these questions, I would rather we focused on getting the healthiest iteration of 1.12 that we can.
---
i spent a lot of time here solo running this for barman shanker  
---
then they nerfed the way attack speed worked with backstab or whatever (capped it at 1.8 speed or something?) and it became worthless.  cry
---
I'm frustrated by the lack of video or something playable. Sure we're getting blue posts confirming various details, but ever since the demo 6 months ago, we haven't seen any actual gameplay footage or anything.
---
So end of next week? poggers
---
&gt; The whole point is to get gear and do content. 
---
That line right there. They are going to carve it into retails tomb stone. It's okay you feel that way. That being said for a vast majority of us we don't agree.
---
As far as rose tinted glasses. I was describing my raid experience on Nost. Not exactly 2005. Again you are entitled to your opinion. However what you are describing isn't rose tinted glasses. It's me enjoying a game that was crafted to be completely different then the modern experience.
---
If you accept that they are different. Then you have to accept people are going to prefer one. I am saying they will prefer Classic. You are saying they will prefer retail. The truth is only time will answer this.
---
To me gear is an after thought. Getting new gear means almost nothing. It's a short dopamine hit. That compares as nothing to my adventure with friends.
---

"You have not tasted servitude. There is no land beyond us and even the sea is no safe refuge when we are threatened by the Roman fleet....We are the last people on earth, and the last to be free: our very remoteness in a land known only to rumor has protected us up till this day. Today the furthest bounds of Britain lie open‚Äîand everything unknown is given an inflated worth. But now there is no people beyond us, nothing but tides and rocks and, more deadly than these, the Romans. It is no use trying to escape their arrogance by submission or good behavior. They have pillaged the world: when the land has nothing left for men who ravage everything, they scour the sea. If an enemy is rich, they are greedy, if he is poor, they crave glory. Neither East nor West can sate their appetite. They are the only people on earth to covet wealth and poverty with equal craving. They plunder, they butcher, they ravish, and call it by the lying name of 'empire'. They make a desolation and call it 'peace'" - Tacitus
---
If you clear beforehand it‚Äôs not that bad. Finding him in storm wind is more of a pain tbh. Especially when everybody else is doing it at release.
---
Nah man you're spreading the correct information lol
---
See you next tuesday
---
man i love the hodge-podge retarded gear that you end up wearing in vanilla.  it has a real charm to it
---
No solid news. My guess is August.

do you want to be a former villain/child of villains/possibly current borderline villain/threw in your allegiance to former villains, who tries to be good but struggles to keep away the demons of the past

then yes, roll Horde
---
Yea it comes out June 25th. My uncle works at Nintendo.
---
I swear to god
---
hes a towelie buttboi
---
Holy power was annoying but what made it even worse was the stupid ass inquisition upkeep buff you had to waste it on every 20 seconds. It felt like shit i just want to hit the target.

Who is this guy

I hear ya, but every day we get one day closer!

You must be new here.

The boats out of Menethil would occasionally despawn right at the exit point &amp; drop everyone in the ocean to die from fatigue before you could swim back... so Blizzard temporarily replaced the boats with Captain Placeholder who would teleport you directly to the other side, while they rewrote the code for the boats... man I miss the buggy old WoW, when we were all struggling along with Blizzard to keep up with the bugs and overloaded servers
---
One of my fav episodes
---
The best wand for it's you get from wetlands. I cant remember what its called, but when I'm doing classic leveling experiments I always get that one and it increases my leveling speed incredibly. In the past 6 months I've leveled a priest to 60 3 times doing all wand, no wand, holy dungeons. So far I've found that wand is the fastest to level by all. Go wand damage in disc spec and you have 2-4 seconds downtime in between mobs. I also outpace my mage friend in his downtime.
---
Found Bryan Adams account
---
fresh is a lot of fun but within like 1 month there's plenty of 60s and things calm down a bit.  people get there so fast these days
---
Good perspective ... is it a narration used when playing Horde ?
---
I look forward to the grind and slower pace of the game. I want minor changes like improved UI that can be toggled on/off, maybe auto loot and certain mailbox features. Nothing that takes away from the community as a whole. I don‚Äôt like arena and never did. It excludes so many classes after a certain tier ranking.
---
Headline of the article vs actual article.
---
Ruined Marksman hunter as well. Went from a measured spec where you did a lot of resource management and timing to SPAM SPAM SPAM. So awful.
---
may 20th? nice
---
You've done everyone a great service, Esfand. Keep it up.
---
Wtf is goldenshire schmeltz?
---
The two elite quests outside the deadmines where you‚Äòre never sure if you find some other people doing the quests as well.
---
May 14 beta confirmed
---
Looks like the prediction of next Tuesday/Wednesday is looking quite good right now. I'm more excited to be able to watch classic on twitch than getting my hopes up on actually getting into the beta.
---
I was expecting at least 90 days notice before launch. That would put us at August 13 or later now.
---
Edgy
---
They've been internal alpha testing but i'm really confused as to why you would think anyone on here would know if you can't find it anywhere else on the internet.
---
He is a streamer. One of the ones that blizz apparently invited to Irvine recently, presumably for something classic related.
---
It's been 6 years already for osrs buddy, people were saying it will die since day 1. Keep on hating mate.
---
Which is "we know nothing"
---
And in the end they got exactly what they wanted, clicks.  That's some bush league shit
---
I'm not knocking the Horde one, just that if he hasn't experienced the Alliance one, it's really good, and starts way sooner than you realize until after the fact.
---
I think this is something a lot of us are still wondering. It'll be interesting how they approach it because there's so many factors.
---
Server cap, amount of servers, potential replace for sharding, all of them play a factor in one another. I very much enjoyed the higher population of Private servers, but it doesn't work without some sort of system to counter-balance the higher pop. Dynamic respawn is probably not the solution to that because of all all the other problems with it in terms of people being able to capitalize on it for different leveling and farming methods.
---
The fuck is this even supposed to be about? Viability? How difficult they are to play? Because specs are all over the place from any metric I try to think of.
---
&gt;blizz is incompetent in stopping gold buying in vanilla
---
That was 15 years ago. They've gotten alot better.
---
Are you fucking sorry?! 20th may im not home....im at my sisters wedding...delay the wedding....
---
The personality of the person who plays them
---
It‚Äôs a term of endearment in some parts of middle America,  and a neutral term at worst in most of the US.   Idk if ‚Äòthe wife‚Äô is used outside the US and I can understand why people may hear it negatively.   But I hear it used positively all the time,  example: ‚Äòme and the wife went to this fantastic restaurant over the weekend, you gotta try it‚Äô
---
That whole scene is a masterclass in painful, gut wrenching, cringe humor. 100x worse than scott's totts imo.
---
Mud huts with spikes
---
Best guess at the moment is July 16th.  [https://wowclassiccountdown.com](https://wowclassiccountdown.com)
---
Other than that the only thing we know is Q3 of this year.
---
I'm worried that you think people don't know this.
---
This is epic. Don't know why it doesn't have more attention
---
I like this theory.
---
Not sure about those Kingdom Hearts names tho
---
Lmfao same for me. First wedding I ever attend and it coincides with this smh
---
It‚Äôs also used more when the people you are talking to don‚Äôt know your wife personally.
---
So if we accept this new info as true and extrapolate from past releases:
---
May 14 Beta PTR announced and goes live, limited access
---
~2 months of testing, last few weeks being an open beta
---
July 16 release üéâ
---
and its been worse and worse since 6 year ! its so bad i dont use update anymore !
---
Lmao got me to
---
Theyre doing an internal alpha. We get 1 blue post a week about the game and generally it's worthless information. If you want a release date you're better off buying a ouija board at this point.
---
I mean. We know about climate change but aren't really doing anything actively to prevent it. I weep for our world when it's our community that is the one that ultimately decides the worlds fate. REeeee ;=;
---
I'll do the same, but with my GF :D
---
Will they be able to stream it if it's a closed beta though??
---
yikes
---
I‚Äôm loving these classic wow x office memes
---
Yup, what he said.  It's a nice, charming way to mention your wife where I live.
---
The fact that you personally aren't going to grind r14 is not convincing evidence for predicting the death of the pvp scene on entire servers, and suggesting changes based on crap like that is exactly what I mean by "poorly thought out."
---
What name is that?
---
a random guy?
---
What do you use to make these?
---
There needs to be a bot that translates twitch speak.
---
You should stop spreading misinformation
---
Your random....
---
Expired again.
---
I agree !!!
---
... exactly my point of view :)
---
5/7 perfect score
---
Yeah I will, something along the lines of this. I really like improved ret aura while leveling but think it's pretty bad at max level

I thank you for this. Well done. 
---
The dev comments are my favorite part, ngl.
---
My goal is to do every dungeon at-level on my way up. I never did finish BRD or Uldaman when I wasn‚Äôt just rofflestomping everything in my path.

I wish my warriors many swings as I give them my windfury and strength of earth totem. I am but a vessel for them to hard carry

I would probably say Heroes of Might and Magic 3. The fantasy universe has orcs, undead, death knights, humans, elves, dwarves, gnolls, ogres, elementals, and demons, and the various towns and armies have very similar influences to those seen in WoW. The Elves have a Japanese and natural aesthetic to them (with a tree army), the Orc town is carved out of the mountain and includes little goblin huts, the Human city has a medieval Stormwind feel to it and an army of griffins. The Tower Town feels like Dalaran with tall spires, magical libraries, wizards, and cobblestone streets. It‚Äôs a turn-based strategy war game with lots of magic and high fantasy. 
---
If you haven‚Äôt played it yet I would download the HD version on steam and let that tide you over a little, while you wait for Classic. Immensely deep lore, incredible soundtrack, and extremely addictive.
---
At least it wasn't a 10 minute youtube from a 'community figure' that says absolutely nothing new.
---
oh yes. overused, some might say.
---
I agree with this
---
I‚Äôm gonna name my guy badasslemons before you!!!
---
Love when people generalize the entire player base
---
WTF is that x/7? What number is that?! Why 7?!  Is you name Brandon Sullivan?
---
But the flightmaster and all the quest givers would be dead üòÉ
---
I changed my mind. I predict May 14
---
I've been doing lvl 60 experiments on vanilla realms since classic was announced. So far I've got it down to about 120-160 hours played time to get to 60. On a fresh sever with 500 people fighting for spawns on day 1 of the server it took me 2 hours to get through elwynn. That lvl 60 too over 200 hours of fighting for spawns.
---
We both know it will be soon. "And lastly to conclude my 10:01 video we have a statement from pcgamers.com saying that there is no known release date yet." With the click baity title "CLASSIC WOW RELEASE DATE IS..."
---
I don't think it's an unpopular opinion to want the game to be out...
---
the speed levelers are the ones posting all the "wHaT dO wE dO aFtEr NaXx GuYS?" shit.
---
In these comments: wooooosh
---
Should have included /s, OP
---
Amen brother
---
The only reason im excited/waiting for the beta is because that means were getting closer to launch :D
---
I had to share a server with the guy back in like BC/Wrath uhhg.
---
Neither way should be considered a "wrong" way to play. You do your thing and they will do theirs and there's no need to tell others what and what not to do. Stop with these posts.
---
This, right now there's no real end in sight except "Summer" (if that even holds true).   Beta basically puts a date on release even if they don't outright state it.  This can also lead to a lot of the unanswered questions finally being addressed - sharding, servers, addons, etc.
---
Be patient young padawan.
---
Towelliee hinted that we won't be seeing the release until after the next retail raid has been cleared by the top guilds, meaning the beta is going to last at least 1-2 months with the release coming late July/early August. The beta is more for us being able to enjoy watching classic on twitch while the rest of us practice on undocumented servers.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to be threat capped if the main tank is also fury speccd. No dps is going to outhreat a fury specd tank with raid buffs who knows what they are doing. Dps can go full out on pull.
---
What in the actual fuck are you talking about. You are literally beyond fucking clueless!
---
Just. Stop. Posting.
---
Arena is not a minor change..what are you talking about? It‚Äôs not something like a change to the original PvP process, it is a whole new process and isolated PvP system.
---
I'm excited that it means we are closer to a release date
---
I'm excited that we're going to get access to the game in advance, which means we'll have a less buggy game
---
I'm excited that they are stress testing the servers
---
I'm excited that addon devs will get to see the game, meaning we'll likely have addons at launch
---
I'm not going crazy about it, but I'm definitely more hyped if we have a demo than if we don't.
---
I figured that but it seems like everyone is losing it over the beta. I rather they stress test it and just launch and fix bugs as we go lol
---
This is correct. Classic will have it's own directory and client. This will allow it to have it's own interface and config files. I can almost guarantee you can have either or installed independently.
---
With all the "Futanaaru" inside it on MG, they may as well have called it the Loin's Pride Inn, am I right?
---
Level 11 and more abilities than a current level 120 :)
---
Swap to spirit gear between mobs to regen health, hello?
---
This does not happen for me.
---
Not an unpopular opinion.  
---
But people would prefer 2 month beta and July release to 2 week stress test now and July release, I think. 
---
I personally hope its a 4-5 day stress test (Thursday-Monday), and then release the following Tueday (As unrealistic as that is).
---
shitpost
---
Are you okay? Have you had too much [dark iron ale] or too little? I can never tell with dwarves
---
I was 4th in line for Cata. I miss the crazy release nights at the store.
---
It's al true
---
Go onto a private server or just wait for classic, lol
---
We know how threat, damage, party comp works in vanilla
---
You'll find out soon. I'm eminently qualified to tell you
---
Please stop
---
To poison the prisoner in the basement
---
Ahmfuarkenzeprah
---
Yeah, you might call it "the tauren fallacy" - for tanking later raids, mitigation is not the issue most of the time, but threat is. People roll Tauren for tanks, but in AQ and Naxx, tanks are (on some bosses) running Fury+Prot build without a shield, because they need more threat (to allow the DPS to kill the boss quicker, therefore taking less damage). Why would you need a 5% hp ^^
---
Damn straight. I wanna relive the lore and story and the amazement that I felt going through the world the first time. Taking it slow enough to enjoy but fast enough to start raiding in 4-6 weeks.
---
Yes they will, because they will be in DPS gear
---
And crits are random
---
40 man raid, only takes one of them above the tank to fuck everything up. Constant loss of DPS unless your tank is vastly better than your other warriors. And there is nothinga tank can do about a warlock just critting shadow bolt. Never had a chance to hold agro
---
source: clearly palyed this version of the game much more than you.
---
I am personally not interested in higher population caps than we had in original vanilla, but I can see why some would want that.
---
If they did decide to up the cap, I can't think of a good solution for the issues that come as a result. Dynamic respawns as you say is one option, but I think we both agree that it is too big of a change.
---
What else could they do though, introduce further sharding? That kind of defeats the point of bigger servers.
---
Private servers have gone for the dynamic respawn option, with varied success. I suppose that's the only example we have.
---
Oh look, the daily post telling others they should enjoy the game the same way you do or they're doing it wrong. Thank you, very informative.
---
Her?  Mankrik's Wife?
---
No kidding. It's totally distracting us from all the information about Classic that Blizz has been giving us. /s
---
Yeah, horde Pallys were boss in TBC with seal of blood. It was actually comical how much better they were versus their Alliance counterparts
---
Oh man the ganking is going to be glorious. I will enjoy every second of a fresh server release and take my sweet time leveling and ganking.
---
God damn you.
---
OH SHIT it‚Äôs Esfand!!! Did you just get banned or something? Heard Asmon talking about it. Either way Pally Power bro! Can‚Äôt wait for Classic, love your content!
---
I think the point was: videos of more than 10 but less than 11 minutes in length.
---
Clearly, you haven‚Äôt because you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
And you‚Äôve clearly never had a fury specd tank in your raid, because they also tank with dps gear. Lmao. Therefore, you‚Äôve clearly never been in a hardcore guild.
---
Beyond fucking clueless.
---
I need my fix lol and my fix without it being wiped out at end of the beta
---
Armor Smith for gold.
---
Tell em man. I dig your content. Let the haters hate
---
"What the fuck are you guys doing on Reddit? We launched last night!"
---
Oh man, just last weekend we had a lv 60 helping us finish up the Dun'Gorak quests in Hillsbrad. Afterwards, he asked us: "need anything before i go?" in a heavy Russian accent. To which I said: "Let's get revenge on South Shore." (Since Alliance been ganking us since we first entered Hillsbrad)
---
Spent a good 20 minutes watching South Shore face Justice. We decided to get the fuck outta there before any retaliation could be had.
---
I left a message in /3 Global Defense:
---
\*\*"We just ganked the shit out of South Shore so be careful, my Horde Dudes."\*\* as we flew out to Undercity on course for Scarlet Monestary.
---
15 minutes later, I get a whisper:
---
\*\*"You mind coming back to help defend since you started this bullshit?"\*\*
---
It was great. Except I didn't start it. I was just paying them back (Which hopefully should have ended it.
---
I love Vanilla.
---
Great choice, hope you get and get to keep it.
---
I am okay with minor bugs like weird pathing on a random mob or something minor being wrong if we can get a release lol
---
I‚Äôm gonna do both!!
---
Assistant to the Regional Class Leader
---
It's simple, I see Towelliee, I downvote :\^)
---
EVEN IN FURY SPEC THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME GEAR
---
8K HP IN BWL IS A GOOD SIGN THEY'RE NOT GONNA MATCH THREAT OF ALL 10 OF THE FURY WAR
---
not that complicated
---
And alliance again is vastly better suited for this sort of tanking. Between kings and single target gods paladins or chain heal? Who would u rather have
---
I was sarcastic answering to your "blizzard should make improvements to the gameplay". It was in context with the OP.
---
I agree, I very much like the judge/seal system. Now we don‚Äôt even have auras and we barely kept blessings ;(
---
Fking RAPERIDGE.
---
Yeh, if you liked being one a few specific classes that fit into the composition meta of the arena game. Other than that it was a garbage fire.
---
True, if people aren't shitting themselves constantly then the game is dead on arrival.
---
/r/buildapc
---
Dark Iron quarter master here is great, some may find it an inconvenience but I find it adds more value to the dungeon, makes it feel like a hostile city not just a linear dungeon to power through
---
I got baited as well.
---
You can play arena in STV already dude, it's in the game.
---
&gt; paladins could use their exorcism spell on undead players
---
Oh man, I remember that! Does someone know if it got removed after 1.12 or before?
---
We know what gameplay footage looks like though so not really important
---
And yet this thread is sitting at ~40% upvoted.
---
Classic will be the 5 min buffs though, am I wrong?
---
Where I'm from it has been summer since February, climate is broken.
---

---
I don‚Äôt get it. Am I old?
---
Teenagers get out
---
When you sub and download the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client, it will download the whole client and all updates which is the retail install, which is everything through Legion that you get free to download with sub.  I just resubbed a week or so ago and it downloaded like 40-50gb if I remember right.  So the current retail sub download + whatever files they will have to give us to play on Classic servers.
---
the past two expansions released in august but nice try.
---
Yea, I was thinking along those lines the other day when I looked up the release of the next retail content. The data I saw said late June or July. So was curious if they'd really release classic as well during that time frame. 
---
Maybe reduce the initial server load because fewer sightseers would be on it early until the new content is stale. But at the same time could see why they would wait. Use the release as filler. In which case it sounds like we'd be talking Aug/Sept  :(
---
Casual scrub detected.
---
Yeah if the next mob was a 5 minute walk away
---
these are so good
---
Or, in this case, un-"grow into it".
---
Pug Pug?
---
there will always be people looking for tanks, for raiding I would go tank or dps warrior.

---
More ominous info from people milking the situation, out with it please
---
We know what the demo looks like, yes. But IIRC the final game is using the 8.x client instead of the 7.3.5 one, and will have lots of fixes compared to the blizzcon demo.
---
He probably isn't allowed to say that.
---
If your worried about 1v1 pvp, having stoneform and fear ward will save your live multiple times
---
This everyone, is an incel, but instead of studying the blade, he studied wow.
---
You aren't. You're literally on here just stroking alliance dick? Nothing you say is without bias and misinformation.
---
I mean what if they all really went to Irvine and he can't tell. Aslong this ominous stuff ain't on YouTube i am fine with it
---
Wdym?
---
except theres legit evidence that content creators are in Irvine.
---
I don't disagree, but I'd rather not be strung along
---
owls or carrion bird, believe me
---
Well everyone wants the game to be out already but most people would prefer it not to be a buggy mess to start with.
---
I'll play my way. I don't think I could manage to reach 26 days without being logged in but not playing for the majority of my sessions.
---
Playing extremely inefficiently the most I ever got up to was 13 days
---
oh bby...
---
Hunter or mage.. I really can't decide. I have no preference for micro, but the easier leveling of hunters does seem  nice considering I won't have much time. However mage seems to be overall the better class..
---
Too bad you can't spell steal it.
---
He is probably under some sort of NDA after meeting Blizzard. A thread that was posted about 10-15 minutes ago had screens from his Discord about him revealing that info.
---
It was very quickly deleted and locked.
---
What's the fire for?
---
&gt;BWL 
---
There‚Äôs your problem. Lmfao.
---
Literally braindead and clueless.
---
lol which one of you showed Towelliee's mom how to reddit?
---
Indeed.
---
Play Warcraft 3 and you'll understand.
---
Just curious, do you remember which chat channel you used? The idea of a bunch of people meeting up and the talking in /g anyways sounds hilariously fun to me.
---
Did you Screenshot it lmao?
---
You say that but would you? It's all ready taken enough time that If the game isn't well polished on release then everyone would loose their s**t. After already waiting as long as we have we may as well wait a little while longer if it means that everything has been thought through properly and the mechanics are solid.
---
Baiters gonna bait.
---
Dark Spear Trolls 4 life!
---
The main version of the classic game was already ahead of the Blizzcon demo at the time of Blizzcon.
---
Vertical slices/demos are almost always outdated versions, for stability/familiarity purposes mostly.
---
This tweet is a diversion from the previous screenies we saw for a split second. Real beta is next week.  
---
Orrrrr streamer beta is next week then invites go out to public for closed beta.
---
Deathcoil + fear is pretty good way to deal with melee. Drain life is another (especially as affliction).
---
I like the May 24th theory a lot better than the May 15th theory we heard earlier today.
---
Yeah, I'll PM you, don't want to get in trouble or anything.
---
I still have the images open
---
Different leaders lead differently. For instance, the USA has a vastly different leadership than it did 4 years ago. 
---
One of the philosophical problems I have with WoW's 2 party system is that after you're locked into the side you choose at character start no matter what new content brings.
---
Gimme gimme
---
yo could u pm me aswell? &lt;3
---
Thanks a lot
---
I see you don't frequent /r/HighQualityGifs
---
If he can't say everything he should say nothing. What's the point of this ominous crap?
---
I was confused and had to read the title several times before I realize they are not actual changes to Classic but ways to manipulate current technology to do stuff away from the keyboard
---
For some reason southshore and stv is just expected to have tons of 60s constantly running amuck. It's freaking aids when u are trying to level.
---
Noone on this subreddit is claiming that you won't have the time of your life if you don't speed-level.
---
Overwatch was released on the 24th of May. :-O
---
I need more
---
We need to have a gif battle like r/Collegebasketball during the playoffs. That was amazing.
---
Dude it's vanilla, more specifically 1.12
---
They don't have the same classes
---
One is a hybrid one is pure support (as pure as comes in vanilla anyway), it's not a debate lol
---
That's why tehy stopped having faction specific classes. It made teh game very unbalanced
---
Shamans pay the hybrid tax much heavier than paladin in 1.12. They originally designed paladins to be shittier support than shamans. Greater blessings fixed all that
---
Paladins have the least offensive options....Game compensates tehm with the best support kit
---
This is gold.
---
Hi friend, share?
---
Regardless, he was probably told not to tell anyone. Not a good look for him if he spills the beans earlier than Blizz wanted.
---
Can you have ass in the name?
---
Could you PM that to me aswell ? Thanks!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sticking it in my bank until later because I have a high tendency of panic clicking stuff while leveling lol.
---
For a guy who apparently can't say much he sure is saying much...
---
True, but who cares what happens to him. I am nobody and I get info from this so it's a win for me.
---
Whatever you got to do to get those Revenue clicks. Hopefully blizzard just permabanned him from classic LOL
---
TIL there's a wod private server
---
Wow I can't wait for my favorite e-friend from youtube/twitch telling me what to think about game! So hyped!
---
Makes sense
---
Could you PM that to me please ?
---
Ain't vanilla thing mon'
---
I wouldn't call this worried lmao that's a stretch
---
Hunter weapon anyway
---
pm me please
---
5 hours a night and at least 8 on the weekends. Sound better?
---
Hi would you be so kind to send me those images? &lt;3
---
He also majorly hinted (basically straight up spilled it) that beta would be out before the end of next week, so who the fuck knows anymore.
---
username does not check out
---
Sure, and while I don't care much at all for Tips myself he's hurting his credibility with Blizzard. That was entirely my point.
---
Olympic level mental gymnastics to get to that conclusion lmao
---
Druid.
---
Druid druid druid.
---
DRUID.
---
As someone who mains druid and is "that furry @#$hole who is covered in butter" GO DRUID.
---
Yes there is a build something around these lines: https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0zL0hZx0xoZVvcoxqMo
---
With nature's swiftness, feral charge, reduction in shapeshifting costs you should be pretty solid. There are some points people can play around with, but instant cast heals should make you solid.
---
Paladin is chaincasting the same rank heal on a tank forever. Really stale really fast.
---
This clip is nothing like the title of this post.
---
Who cares
---
Did his posts get deleted from the discord too?
---
What exactly makes you say that it was bad news?
---
"...My medal..." LMFAO golden
---
well if he received good news he would atleast have a smile, thats the tips i know!
---
+
---
Please :)
---
It was fine the first time with my guildies.  For alts, doing it with randos...I'd rather slam my junk in a car door.
---
Could you send it to me please
---
More like worried Blizzard going to come and bend him over after possible leaking info :P
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
For raiding will a Warlock be easier to gear than a Rogue? And how do their skill caps in PVP compare
---
Engineering + X, pick your poison.
---
Do not level resto, you'll hate yourself. Switch endgame. You can heal leveling dungeons fine, just need to play smart.
---
It doesn't seem worried. He seems like he has additional information that he cannot share because of blizzards non-disclosure agreement
---
Big true
---
Me also if you don't mind bro
---
where was he worried? looks to me hes playin it cool what with the NDA
---
Mages can‚Äôt dispel curses man, obviously if that were true they would do it more often 
---
/s for salty
---
Gimme Dat pic
---
Something like the, ‚Äúupgrade, upgrade, go back, FUCK go back, ffuuuuuuu-‚Äú
---
Why would you build a new PC for a game that you could literally run on a 2006 PC? üòÇ
---
I paid ¬£1200 for my PC two years ago and it's ridiculously over specced for vanilla WoW. It annoys me that I paid all that money for my PC and all I really play on it is WoW. üòÇ
---
Do you think the mechanics of teh game change when you get to naxx? lol
---
Threat works the same in MC too
---
You use BWL because that's the point your DPS get their pvp weapons. Pleb, granted your tank could rank too, the GM legs are very nice. There will never be a point where your DPS are more geared relative to teh rest of your raid.
---
You're such a pleb hahaha
---
Hybrid shamans &gt; pure support paladin. Wut? This is a trinity MMO, yea you pay the hybrid tax dipshit. 
---
The only good things shaman have is chain lighting spam and purge both of which are next to useless in vanilla PvE. Paladin has no offensive options, they're compensated with support options. Which is why alliance is superior in PvE
---
I'd appreciate a PM as well please!
---
You realize the developers have already mentioned how hard it is for them to resist wanting to go back and change everything to make it better? Knowing and admitting how it wasn't some pinnacle of perfection, but understanding the desire to keep things how it was, rough edges and all. The extreme arrogance is with people like you who put Vanilla on a pedestal and regard it as a symphonic harmony and lash out at anyone who thinks that a few things here and there might improve the game. Just ask the people who made it how they think of it, and they'll regal you with their lamenting about the technical and time limitations they were under back then and how if they had the opportunity, they would tweak and do things differently. The only reason they aren't is for the sake of preserving the experience as it was, and to not get hit by a tidal wave of pimple-faced backlash from the torch and pitchfork wielding \#NoChanges mob.
---
Get over yourself.
---
Oh, you know them?
---
pm too please?
---
Vanilla Ret is really bad dude. It doesn‚Äôt have a single on demand attack based on weapon damage. It‚Äôs absolutely atrocious design for a ‚Äòmelee‚Äô class. You‚Äôll learn LOL.
---
help a brother out?
---
Absolutely. I always join Path of Exile for a different leagues. I love to start at point 0, when everything is fresh.
---
Going to enjoy this fresh shiny new server in Classic.
---
You‚Äôre a wall of text
---
Read my comment again. A good player will excel *more* with a good spec, than a good player with a bad spec. 10 + 1 is more than 10 + (-1), if you will. If you minmax you will *always* have an edge over someone who doesnt, granted both players are of equal skill
---
Making consecration baseline and adding crusader strike would make the class bearable.
---
"Don't play your way, play my way!" -too many people on this subreddit
---
I joined during TBC and Astranaar was ALWAYS under attack. Some of my most fun times killing them night elves :)
---
Would appreciate a PM if you can. Thank you.
---
I just want to avoid playing on the same server as the big streamers if possible. I don't dislike them at all in any personal way, but too many of their "fans" or whatever are really annoying. My worry is that the atmosphere on the server will be about them and their achievements. I fear it will be like Twitch chat in WoW. When i played Classic, little server celebrities would pop up over time due to a lot of factors, be it trolls, ninjas, badass PvPers etc ... I dunno, maybe i'm just an old jaded douche bag now, but i want to focus on the World of Warcraft, not the world of Twitch.
---
Could you PM me the screenshot please? It would literally make my shitty day
---
What?
---
No idea, but we need to check with him before changing anything about the Secure Trade UI.
---
It's the current WoW engine btw, not the engine from 2006, in case you didn't know, so it certainly won't run the same as it did then
---
Same here mate. I hand in my thesis on the 1st of July.
---
Do and exhaustion set of pullups, push ups, or crunches during your login and again during each flight. You'll have a great time and you'll sleep like an angel

Warriors are already the top DPS in the NBA

Who could stand against me?

They're a tips alt account after all

You should be able to make a default character real fast and delete it later and add the actual character you want with that name.
---
All I know is... if you‚Äôre trying to get to max level quickly and efficiently... buy vendor gear and weapons!!
---
Why? Because he just explained he gets 21 fps on LoL so why would he get higher fps In Wow? 
---
It's not that hard to figure out.
---
PM plox
---
Wow man, your mind is making up things...
---
Wheres the dog i cant find him
---
Classic.
---
lol just make anything at all as fast as you can and name *it* Chad. Then log out and do some practice runs before you delete and recreate Chad :P
---
Maybe the NDA runs out on May 24th and by that date they can give us everything I know
---
Your gifs are awesome!
---
can i get a pm with it please?
---
1.12
---
So there will be greater blessing as soon as you level
---
Talents/skills will be as vanilla ended. Not as it began
---
tidE daB... heM
---
Jealousy will lead people to look for any reason to hate in someone, truth or lie. Don't let people saying negative things (especially false shit) get to you, love the content and can't wait for the classic streams my man.
---
1. Pserver Meta is going to be different than the classic Meta.
---
2. Mages/rogues will be top DPS until bwl comes out and warriors get full geared fury, which will be a while.
---
Probably got bullied for thinkin wotf breaks polly
---
Oh come off it you did like a 15 min video about the AV post. Don't lie to yourself.
---
It didn't seem quite right, but it did seem quite fun.
---
I would also add fall-through conditions.  Mine would Do mouseover+help, then fall-through to target+help, then targetoftarget+help.
---
Then you can add a modifier like Shift = focus target
---
Jesus Christ lol.  Some of you guys need to go find something to do
---
It does if you want to, and feel like it sure. Especially if you're likely to make friends. It happens naturally. Shaming people for looking out for themselves, or demanding help is exactly the shitty attitude that doesn't foster mutual respect and appreciation for this. That's partly what happened to retail, and I'd very much like to contain it there thank you very much
---
Lol of course, my mistake =P
---
Great! Been looking for that
---
New here and haven't been following the Classic news but I've played WoW since TBC and can't wait to try classic. Is this the Classic beta? Is there an official release date?
---
Without BGs to distract me I‚Äôll be one of those hitting 60 quick but not power leveler quick
---
Where did I ever mention ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù? Jesus fucking Christ you are a retard. I feel sorry for any guild you join and for your entire family to have to converse with you on a daily basis.
---
You are so fucking stupid I just can‚Äôt believe that you learned how to breathe properly when you were born.
---
It‚Äôs literally a freak of nature accident. I am astounded.
---
If you had any decent reading comprehension you‚Äôd realize that I agreed with you on an average alliance raid comp being superior. My point was that when it comes to min-maxing the raid (do you know what that means??) horde blows alliance out of the water.
---
Do you understand you braindead imbecile???
---
I think you're greatly underestimating Warrior. Pserver meta vs Classic meta means Melee on average should deal roughly 4% more damage. Pserver meta is already melee focused. Classic should be even more so with the DPS boost compared to say the Nost core.
---
Yup looks pretty desperate. Good way to lose your Blizzard benefits program access.
---
Some of my most fun was killing Horde in Stonetalon. The Astranaar stuff I just got killed during.
---
Sad that this comment has been the highlight of my day lol
---
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MENTION IT
---
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SHAMANS
---
THEY'RE HYBRIDS, THE MOST HYBRID CLASS IN THE FUCKING GAME IRRELEVANT OF SPEC
---
WHOOOOOOOOSH
---
You're clearly a pleb who has never done anything in any tab targeting MMO, much less vanilla. Know your place and go away, lol
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people can watch this dude. He‚Äôs fucking disgusting.
---
you can play with the wowhead dressing room and see the different animations/combinations

why use your phone when you can just have two monitors?
---
Any chance you could send it my way?
---
This guy writes "the" as teh. Obviously a moron. And he might of capped out on BWL where allys excel because salv is OP when the only mechanics are threat reduction.
---
Why would I look something up on my phone when I can alt tab instantly to a browser and use a proper keyboard.
---
same here, would appreciate a pm
---
The CURRENT developers want to make changes. The developers who gave us BFA...
---
I also understand that some OG developers, like John Stats, who did work on the game would make it differently today. He is still wrong. Genius can happen by mistake. That's his arrogance as well.
---
IDK why people think Vanilla was broken in any way. It clearly wasn't. It was a gaming and cultural revolution.
---
But again, if you, or John Stats, think you can make a better WoW - then you should go make one. I'll be sitting here with my popcorn watching you fail - username checks out.
---
Hey, here is one that should work. If it doesn't add Khoopa#1365 on discord.

---
Deleted Reddit posts can still be found elsewhere on the internet. There are sites dedicated to preserving them.
---
Explain how you came to the conclusion that melee will deal 4% more damage? I'm very curious.
---
Link to survey?
---
Pm pls
---
You underestimate the power of a full set of spirit gear and Outfitter switching scripts for reducing downtime (and food budget).
---
PM me the screen too please
---
I think he was unwell hence the monotone voice.
---
Paladin basically doesn‚Äôt exist as we knew it - also super excited to play my paladin again! 
---
Did something similar started leveling protection and then a friend told me to get seal of command and showed me the verigan fist quest! It was a game changer!
---
Reposting this because it got removed last night but all these other dog ones haven't been (and I at least went to the effort of making it a relevant hunter picture where he is feeding pet!..I'd really appreciate some input on why the others are ok and this isn't if its removed again, thanks)
---
He said during his stream back that he was out of town that day. There are definitely some shenanigans afoot.
---
Actually druids are the most hybrid class. My god you are clueless and retarded.
---
WHOOOOSH is the sound the air makes when it travels through that fucking desolate cavern between your ears.
---
Lol it sounded like he was maybe disappointed that he **didn't know anything about classic?**
---
Yeah this guy has no idea what he's talking about
---
Tipsout is a fraud. I don‚Äôt care if he posts here. I‚Äôll talk shit to his face.
---
I think most people will follow this advice which might make it easier to find a $20 on the sidewalk.
---
On the one hand it would give their servers a chance to survive the initial wave but with how contested the race to 60 will be, some people might be miffed if they aren't able to jump right in at launch time.
---
they would never ever do that.
---
so many ppl would hate them cause they are looking forward to celebrating this release with their old friends from vanilla and wanna just enjoy time on lanpartys and stuff.
---
they will give us the date, sooner or later
---
With the exception of one pserver, the Nost core's armor values are higher than Vanilla's.
---
Meh...bad edit.
---
Why?
---
Well, at least now I know the source of this copypasta that I keep seeing everywhere.
---
lol they all are the other ones are just smaller
---
My first server &lt;3
---
Beta is gonna be before that, he is going to organize some dueling tournament or city raid or w/e during the beta. I think thats why he can drop a date regardless of any NDA
---
saying you put effort in this but didnt even change the portrait-picture of your "dog".
---
damn boy, all you want is upvotes ;)
---
Uh, chaos, rage, drama. It would be a total shitshow.
---
Show me to
---
But why keep your calendars open? We don't need a day off to read about when it will launch. If May 24th is anything other than Beta launch or legit launch this tweet doesn't make much sense.
---
Esoteric discussions of what "quality" means aside, he works to provide entertainment and many people choose to watch him.
---
Too much anger.
---
Survey to link?
---
An extra 10 minutes on buff timers ‚Äúfixed‚Äù paladins being worse than shamans? Hooooooly fuck I swear I am losing IQ reading your nonsensical retardation.
---
https://youtu.be/VUT_vywXHqI
---
yeah sounds goood
---
Well they either could've made them unable to use plate, or add pieces of gear to dungeons and raids that were only useful to a single spec.
---
Go fuck yourself OP chrsit
---
WHat the fuck?
---
is this even a troll? Give me my minute back
---
This just reeks of jealousy.
---
So I play rogue and Ret and inquisition felt like an immensely less satisfying version of slice and dice upkeep
---
I don't even know what portrait-picture is, haha, my bad
---
No, not the CURRENT ones, I'm talking people who were on the team back in 2002-2004 and are coming back to work on it for Classic. I guess you don't watch Blizzcon.

Higher armor values... Ok. Now what about correct proc rates, resistances, and a plethora of other things that were inaccurate on Pservers, you can't directly compare the two versions of the game yet and say there's a 4% difference. There are so many variables that effect DPS on bossfights, you can't say for sure that it's an exact 4%. We honestly don't know at this point.

"here's everything we know so far"
---
First question...
---
"We don't know"
---
You can tell it's not because it's informative.
---
you're online
---
Yep, so we know Resistances were higher as well in Vanilla vs Pservers 15 Res. That is a DPS decrease for casters from Pserver to Classic.
---
You're asking... if someone has prepared a texture pack... for an online game run by a company that regularly bans people for modifying any game files including textures?
---
This isn't Morrowind. Blizzard doesn't look so kindly upon game file alterations as Bethesda does.
---
Just wanted to leave this here: Youtube hasn't had the "more ads if your video is 10 minutes" rule for years now. How many ads you get is based on way more than that. I get people railing on Youtubers for stretching out their videos, but being hyper focused on the 10 minute mark is meaningless.

Yeah it's been all over the place.
---
Heh, this old post.
---
No thanks I'll play the game the way I have fun :)
---
He's a problem for playing a class in the game that he enjoys? Get a life dude. IDK why you care so much about what other people play. It's not like you're forced to play with anyone.
---
talk about fiending for attention
---
I will never understand why people bring up video lengths for content creators. I feel like it isn't unreasonable for the guy to get paid for his work. If it means that he can continue being a content creator full time and giving me videos to watch, I'm totally cool with him making the video whatever length. At any rate, it's free, people need to stop complaining.
---
His 'entertainment' is a source of information, and can only ever be as good as the information he presents. Which, in a lot of cases is completely wrong.
---
Sorry if you think that someone spreading misinformation is simply entertainment, but that explains why your IQ appears to be lower than your vanilla character level.
---
Will it be done by summer?
---
I‚Äôm almost sure bliZZ will use an updated texture pack ( maybe the WOTLK texture update )
---
But nobody knows at this moment 
---
Also yeah I don‚Äôt wanna be that guy but that was a dumb question to ask
---
Who needs to use a phone or alt+tab when you have addons?
---
He's whining about blizzard balancing for his shitty choices
---
Then he wants to go play the shit spec in vanilla?
---
You ahve to pick one lol, can't do both. Blizzard makes classes so the same so everyone can do as you suggest, whatever they want. Or they have flavor and you only pick from the viable builds
---
You're asking the impossible from the devs. Fuck off retard
---
you the best
---
Vanilla wow is a game made for the mass market... especially when you compare it to other mmos that existed at the time
---
Does it stand for "the feeling when" because I thought it was "the fact when"
---
Damn I think you just broke the game. Grats m8.
---
How is he a fraud
---
I literally responded to that as well. I guess you don't read.
---
Masters of AFK games long before smartphone games were even a thing
---
I explained it because you brought up an example of how you did it in a loot council guild when we were discussing DKP - I wasn‚Äôt explaining it as a way to undermine your knowledge, I‚Äôm sure you know what it is, I was explaining specifically the portions where DKP differs to drive home a point... it just seems unfair to me that if I have the DKP to spend on said dagger, why should the guild tell me I‚Äôm not allowed to and have to yield to someone with less DKP? That seems like a loot council/DKP hybrid. If we have a pure DKP system, nobody should be counseling on who gets the loot.
---
PM PLOX
---
Downloading is soooo 2005
---
This is the future old man we stream 8K porn
---
IIRC Blizz doesn't like you remote desktopping to play WoW and may ban you for it, unless you meant checking the auctions via desktop TSM once that inevitably gets updated for classic.
---
Id no doubt help out. But I need a link m8.
---
At the same time though, they are getting hit% that wasn't available at the beginning of Pservers. This is my point. There are a lot of unknowns and as fun as it is to speculate it's just sort of pointless. Melee will most likely need to wear resistance gear, unlike pservers, that will reduce their DPS as well.
---
This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
So it wasn't arenas as an event that ruined it, it was the gear.
---
I would cackle maniacally at the several hundred or several thousand players who would then flock to wowservers, frothing-at-the-mouth as They begged for when the next fresh server releases because they missed their chance at experiencing freshy fresh in blizzard classic.
---
WTB PM PLOX
---
He's not whining at all you idiot. Get some reading comprehension. He's saying he wants to play ret while leveling and go holy for raiding.
---
I use to just have thottbot up on my laptopü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Maybe you‚Äôre right.
---
I just don‚Äôt like the idea of watching server pops decline because of no new content, and I don‚Äôt think that retail can be salvaged at this point.
---
Pretty obvious, people would be pissed.
---
There is a high res texure addon for 1.12.1. But I assume it just uses textures from a later patch of the game.
---
Blows my mind how people can justify shaming you for video lengths when you do this full time and we watch it for FREE. Whether you need to or not, I would want you to make money for the time you put into giving us videos. Keep it up dude.
---
I would certainly hook up with a fun having group who planned on doing that just for the hell of it
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm planning to main chad I won‚Äôt wanna wait
---
There were three arenas in Vanilla.
---
Understanding what they do and don't have is all easily SimCrafted. Why would melee need to wear resistance gear? It's not like pservers didn't know how much attacks did from mobs where resistances were an issue. Greater Fire Protection Potion on CD goes a very long way in MC.
---
Said this to the other dude but I‚Äôm planning to main chad so I won‚Äôt want to wait
---
Or Alliance side... "Astranaar is under attack!" and you just know that the flightmaster's already dead.
---
You have not played a rogue in vanilla.
---
The gear and the fact that only a few of the classes were really competitive  as well.
---
Surely you are asking for a link to survey?
---
 [https://vanillafriends.com/](https://vanillafriends.com/)  is what you want!
---
Rust is a game that emulates this feeling of excitement for a fresh start, although WoW is a bit more nerve racking because it has taken 15 years and it‚Äôll probably be the last shot at a fresh WoW server we get. The servers on Rust wipe weekly or every other week, so you kinda get used to the pressure. But it‚Äôs still a blast, when everyone is equal for a short period of time.
---
BWL is when you get pvp MH's you pleb...lol
---
There will never be a point your DPS will be mroe geared
---
The mechanics to threat do not change it's all patch 1.12 talents and mechanics
---
COuld use MC as an example...It's just that your DPS will not be very geared at the start of MC relative to the MASSIVE increase that will happen when people starting hitting GM
---
So many shitters who don't know their place
---
There‚Äôs a web page for that
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com/
---
Pretty sure here‚Äôs more than one
---
Ripped off Lion's Pride Inn. Try Again!
---
So what you're saying is that you know better than the developers, which is what you're trying to say that other people are claiming. Weird twist of hypocrisy there..
---
All the people waiting to plan their vacations would riot.
---
&lt;3 that battered chest loot table for the 1-10 zones is where the real treasure lies
---
I never did arena.  I'm a BG Hero.
---
Did you tho? A backstab non crit is a disaster
---
Can't wait to be back here
---
Considering CHT should be an offhand slotted dagger, until he main hands perdition's, and daggers don't effect sword procs. Obviously dagger rogue gets it.
---
Yes eh is
---
He's bitching at blizzard to catering to plebs like him
---
You want unique classes? Be prepared to give up your class and go with a role. Ranged DPS, tank, healer whatever. Otherwise if you wanan just ret pala, blizzard will let you by homogenizing all the classes
---
If he's gonna play that spec, blizzard has to make it viable to maek sure he stays subbed\*
---
What the fuck.
---
New to game. Looking for NA group to take me in.
---
I‚Äôll most likely be a shadow priest for alliance.
---
Playing most nights 9-12pm PST.
---
AoE farm spec is 5/6 degen, eh?
---
Holy fuck that game. That game is straight cancer. I sadly have like 1500 hours in that game and resent every second of it.
---
Sorry, but that community can go to deepest level of hell.
---
Edit: I do understand what you mean about wipe day though.
---
Anything that makes things harder for people sounds so appealing to me. I don‚Äôt know why. Get your calculators out boys.
---
Only about active subscribers, and over 3/4 of this sub don't have active subscriptions (based on the mega survey a few months ago). Kinda pointless on here...
---
Big servers are ugly
---
true LMAO
---
This similar to how in the Argent Tournament jousting you can (still) charge and throw at the same time if you do them close enough together, but if you delay at all between them you're stuck with a cooldown between them?
---
Such an awesome song.
---
I played priest a ton. Shadow is different but not half bad but the changes to snapshotting and DoT clipping really turned me away from the class. I liked to play disc in PVP, even through Warlords of Draenor it was fun, but I feel that it got completely gutted in so many ways it isn't anywhere near the same class.
---
Edit: almost forgot that in BfA (i think, it's been a while) shadow priest basically lost all of their survivability making leveling unbearably bad and pvp impossible until you unlocked some specific things.
---
That's awesome! Sounds like a good story!
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done. I now transcend space and time
---
This is entirely false. In pre bis blue gear you have nearly 25% crit +backstab talents... Non crit disaster... Man you are clueless about rogues and it's adorable. I've been playing a combat daggers rogue for the last 2 years. Please tell me how much I don't crit lmao.
---
Exactly what I needed. Thank you!
---
&gt; Obviously you can tune the mechanics to the arena to only "work" in the arena or normalized gear that can only be worn in the "arena"
---
If you want a fair system, where everyone gets the same and is the same, go play some CoD or CS:GO.
---
This is Classic. It was classic before, and will stay classic. No, there will not be an arena. And now kindly take this garbage idea, and beat it.
---
Awesome
---
But that's the meme
---
People are only focused on offense. But defense is something to seriously consider. A good hunter who is willing to camp flag offers a huge benefit. With traps you can take 2 up to 3 people if you‚Äôre exceptionally skilled.
---
I guess you misread that he was talking about the 1.12.1 client, so he's probably asking for one to use when playing a private server where Blizzard isn't going to be banning shit.
---
Also, he's talking about using this to make an HD texture pack (for the old WoW client): https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-neural-networks-being-used-to-generate-hq-textures-for-older-games-you-can-do-it-yourself.88272/
---
Esfand is my hero
---
So I take it this sub is just The Office gifs now? 
---
Everyday we stray further from God's light.
---
I will add that a pet will actually hurt you about as much as it helps you in some fights.  
---
Vs Warr it feeds them some rage by doing damage and can be a target for them if they're kited to just get some weapon swings to build rage.  Does very little damage because of plate armor
---
Vs Paladin it can generate reckoning stacks from random crits, and does very little damage because of plate armor.  Also will never really generate pushback because most paladins in PVP have conc aura and the pushback immunity from talents
---
OH NO!
---
A multiplayer game that requires cooperation and talking to people? What a crazy idea!
---
Not as crazy as your opening post, but still...
---
Yeah this might be a pretty decent spec when you have shit gear and are trying to rank up, extremely tanky and hard to kill and good for group engagements to just sit back, help your allies, and get some aimed/multi combos when you can.
---
What‚Äôs your Master‚Äôs program for?
---
The ending lmao
---
Pservers had no use for resistance gear because it didn't even work correctly (mc/bwl for example). It wasnt properly scripted and all my years of Pserver raiding nobody ever wore res gear except AQ.
---
 Assuming the boss fights will work like they did in vanilla, melee WILL NEED to wear resistance gear on certain fights, a dead DPS does 0 DPS.
---
Making horde ret better than alliance was such a fucking slap in the face.
---
*"Ohh, you hated that loladins were trash for all vanilla? Well now you can suck compared to our beloved horde!"*
---
Oh to be fair I don't care about the length either. He just claimed to seldom have videos over 10 minutes in length, which is just bullshit.
---
I mentioned in my comment I like most his videos even. I'm not part of the "I hate Tips" crowd. But I do take issue with a lie/misinformation about his video lengths, especially when it is coming from his own mouth.
---
‚ÄúThe info I need,‚Äù did you know WotF breaks sheep? ‚Äî TipsOut.
---
RBGs and arena are great. Both are possible to play.
---
There is a small community who do premade vs premade currently, Ohh Gee on YouTube advertises it. Would be hard to develop the skillet and join but it is certainly there. As for Arena, you will have to go to gadgetzan or STV. Hoping both things blow up come Classic, somehow.
---
I did this with 3 friends. 
---
We played Prot Pally, Mage, Priest, Hunter. From 1 to 50. 
---
It honestly felt a lot better than playing solo because we could control entire areas and mow everything down with Consecrate and Blizzard. Exp penalty didnt matter because everything was always an AoE pull. Doing quests that required drops wasnt an issue because killing everything was so easy  because we often pulled more than you needed to.
---
If you can play this with friends I highly recommend it. The only slow part was getting our NE hunter to 10, doing her pet stuff and walking her to Westfall to group with our Human party.
---
The part you‚Äôre criticizing isn‚Äôt a part of the game. Upgrades are quite regular when leveling.
---
You're not alone in feeling this way. Hang in there brother, this too shall pass.
---
With almost nobody playing on it, yeah.
---
And just like that, for no particular reason at all, people just all rolled paladins.
---
Lol what? So you think the resistance check formula is incorrect? How....? Lol...
---
r/classicwowcirclejerk
---
How
---
Ahhh thottbot, the only thott I ever really loved.
---
I don't want to read. Summarise it in one word!
---
I fully expect tokens, boosts or a cash shop to be in classic within 2 years
---
1 backstab crit out of 4 is horrendous. To be efficient, all of them must be crit. Of course, it's impossible, but you want as much crit as u can get. If your rp thing is to play dagger rogue, it's cool. Just don't come here and say it's opti
---
Oooo forgot that‚Äôs what old forums looked like! Hit me in the nostalgias
---
Create a classic-separate token market?
---
Hope they don't do that, but that's totally not impossible to do
---
Walljumping and general exploration is by far the most fun glitch from Vanilla that is sadly already confirmed to be gone. Dozens of unfinished zones you could find with clever walljumping. Especially when you ran into an instance like ZF and walljumped outside of the portal and got to explore an entire unfinished Tanaris. So awesome. No pserver has this either, so if you didn't experience it in 2006, you never can again.
---
Moonwalking is another glitch I will really miss but I'm still holding out hope that they might re-implement.
---
They're big gamers though
---
Good luck weaving melee attacks into your rotation in any other situations besides being solo or in a 5 man
---
&lt;3
---
It will be easier to get Kingdom Hearts names in Classic now that there's 2 versions of almost every character.
---
I'm gonna use up all my characters slots in a few servers to get some good names just in case
---
When people call you slow just /wave at them when you pass them on your free mount
---
As other comments mentioned, druid would be probably the least ideal due to cooldown on rez.  But if you are really feeling druid, do not let that be the reason you don't play it. As for the other 2 classes, it depends what your end goals are (pvp vs pve vs a little of both). Shaman will be your warriors best friend with windfury totem if you focus on pve while priest could really help your warrior with dispelling roots in pvp. Plus if you go shaman, you and the hunter might compete a little bit for gear if you end up doing dungeon runs.
---
I love how the bread and water are in their starting slot. And 4:3 aspects ratio looks surprisingly good, better than I remembered.
---
Dude thinks Wotf breaks sheep ffs
---
Not just them, it's also the fools who think everyone will end up in full T3 Rank 14.
---
&gt;That was such an oddly melancholy thing to read. You are sadly correct. What hope i do have is from developements like Belgiums suing of EA and refusal to accept lootboxes. Industry covers like Jim Sterling give me some as well. All in all tho, the realistic thing is definitely that we are screwed, and like to remain screwed for a long time. There will always be good games, thankfully, but a large part of the industry will be making filth
---
Because Arena required balancing. Originally, people could get 2shot in PvP (no one had a problem with that) under the right circumstances. That's not good in an Arena setting, so something had to be done.
---
That "something" was first resilience (which in its original form impacted PvE as well), destroying many fun ways to play the game. Suddenly we had unkillable druids and disc priests, and permastun combos, etc. While that makes PvP more interesting for the comparatively small group of Arena players, it ruined it for everyone else.
---
And it didn't even work. Because, the game was not balanced. Certain Comps (cough, Druid Warrior, cough) dominated, other, in theory fun ways to play suffered. The game wasn't balanced, it was just shifted from one FotM to the next along the patch cycle.
---
Furthermore, since all PvP balancing was handled by verious stats on various pieces of gear, you now had a barrier of entry into PvP. Wanted to get started? Have fun getting literally raped from all sides, and yelled at by yourteam, for several weeks until you farmed up enough gear.
---
And last but not least, Arenas also required REWARDS. Which couldn't be as hard to get as Rank14 gear, because Arena were an individual thing. So suddenly, we had a whole new source of high end gear, in a game that was already slowly drifting towards a massive gear inflation.
---
We do not deserve this... Sometimes it's hard to... It's just nice to win one.
---
https://i.redd.it/ch5zsdpnep421.gif
---
Solid idea. There's only three I need to have.
---
Rogue, paladin, and female caster(mage or lock)
---
You don't know how math works pre-bis rogues have  50%+ crit chance. In t1 rogues have a 60%+ crit chance.  Where are you getting 1in 4? You are very misinformed.
---
I was just thinking about his latest series but you are right about the older one.
---
Aaaaand it‚Äôs nerfed!
---
These memes are peak, after this it's downhill till Beta.
---
I remember being just over 20 days played on my main. Definitely participated in many shenanigans that slowed me down. Worth it. To each their own tho.
---
Playing undead rogue IRL, I see.
---
I played gnome in real life back then. 
---
But now I'm an adult.
---
I'm a bald gnome.
---
Not anymore
---
You can do it dude! Good luck, thanks for the content :)
---
I miss aspects for hunters
---
Yeah, I did overlook that. If it's being done on a pserver, I'm not surprised that someone has made one or is in the process of making one. For the record, the AI upscaling mod I *do* use for Morrowind is fantastic.
---
If you right click a repair bot, simultaneously jump backwards and try to spawn the repair bot in a location much too far from you... you can get the purple warlock summoning graphics around your character. It is client-side only so others won‚Äôt see it. 
---

---
Because Nano, the lead dev for Nostalrius said it was mostly guess work and was figured out by watching old 240p videos and doing the best he could do with the available data. Have you ever done rag on a fresh Pserver? You don't need any resistances whatsoever, this was not the case in vanilla at all (I've done both). Also, how do you know its correct on pservers? Where's your Blizzard reference client with 100% correct data?
---
This would be so fundamentally against everything classic is being made for. I don‚Äôt see it ever happening. Maybe mounts, not boosts.
---
Lmao rogues are the original group finders.
---
How is undead rogue? I started playing the day that TBC launched, so I mained a Belf holy pally for years, took a small break with a worgen rogue during cata, and then played a death knight from then on until now. Did a brief stint on an unofficial server as an UD rogue up to about level 50. I enjoyed it, but I know there's a lot more to the game, and I'm wondering what some people who experienced it think.
---
I don't get how "mutual respect" means "try to play the AH to become rich at others expense".  In fact, that seems like the *opposite* of the values everyone is talking about.  To put it another ay "demanding help" should be exactly what a community does.
---
I guess that's what I'm not understanding here.  All the talk about community, but suddenly looking out for yourself is okay?  Isn't that the anthesis of "community"?  Or did I just miss something along the way?

no feels here
---
I really do hope that there is a huge backlash if that does happen. These devs need to realize that MMOs are becoming unpopular because we don‚Äôt want micro-transactions.
---
I want to walk around in T2 on my scarab mount to show people that I‚Äôve invested my time into the game, not that I threw down $25.
---
I saw an analysis for Asian vs. American MMOs on a post on reddit (take with a grain of salt) and it came to the conclusion that Asian communities are EXTREMELY fast to use micro-transactions. In their culture money is a huge status symbol and cheating to get ahead is extremely normal. While cheating is shunned in the American culture and micro-transactions are not as popular. I feel like MMOs see how popular micro-transactions are for Asian communities, while not understanding that cultural factors come into play.
---
I‚Äôm totally fine with paying $15 a month if they don‚Äôt re-introduce micro-transactions. Hell, I‚Äôd pay $20-25.
---
Chances are they will fix that, sadly. They managed a way to prevent wall jumping all together some years ago, and i seem to recall a bluepost saying they wouldn't allow it in classic.
---
Seriously, who the fuck would willingly play Wod?

---
Oh boy. So, to clean up some of this. I worked with Nano at one point, I'm well aware of the guess work we had to do to get things "right" or as close as possible. A lot of this was for the more obscure mechanics or trying to nail down the exact figure. Instead, ranges were often utilized in this instance but we never deliberately exceeded or undervalued the damage which could be generated by XYZ.  
---
Resisting spells and how that damage is mitigated is very well documented from 2006 and that is what is utilized on the Nost core. So, to say that the core has it grossly wrong is not a very tact or accurate statement. In 2006, resistances were deemed a necessity due to the structure of raids. In 2019, you melt through everything because we're all a bunch of OCD tool bags that need to clear everything the instant we engage the boss lol

As I mentioned. GFPP goes a long way on CD, especially when you chain them in a fight like Ragnaros.

You should do a weekly the office gif to remain fresh until classic comes out. Then with enough fanbase you can report every post trying to copy your idea.

I think having too much hype for too long will lead to more disappointing than if they did a silent release.
---
Greatly appreciated bro!
---
Omg I forgot about the gurubashi arena. Hype level +1
---
Yeah this is annoying as hell. The Office is one of the worst shows ever.
---
Not going to have a conversation with someone who thinks private server data is 100% correct and accurate. You're delusional..
---
I remember doing this with a group of rogues in TBC. We attempted to stealth through SW to get to Stockades at like lvl 40. We died a lot.
---
Yes before the update where they added extra flightpaths it was good, there were not so many flightpaths and this is a real central point for the horde. You can go anywhere from there.
---
It's not 100% accurate. Where did I ever claim that?
---
That's the charm, taking something that isn't supposed to work and making it work the best you can :)
---
I don't watch tips.
---
55 dmg shadow bolts really hurt. At least his HP isn't ridiculous.
---
I am saying the proof is in the pudding. I am not the one claiming to know how to make a good MMORPG. All I know is that WoW Vanilla, as it was, was the greatest MMO the world has ever seen. And there are lots of idiots who don't know what they are talking about who want to change it for some reason.

Hi, /u/FrumunduhCheese

Wut?

Maybe get on p servers and find out how classic is. I have, anyone who disagrees clearly has no idea about how classic will play out

lol, horde is dogshit unless u wanna roll shaman don't go horde. Any objective view of the game at 1.12 will tell you that.

Unless you just love to spam AB all day which one be released until everyone is done ranking

I hope you all go horde, i like short ques adn killing people in the world. That doesn't change the reality of who is the better faction tho

He lied about having leaked information from inside Blizzard and begged for money claiming he lost his job, but then that story mysteriously went away once he pocketed the cash. He's a lying scam artist.
---
The fact he never had a 60 in vanilla and that he makes really obvious and major mistakes doesn't help, but to me the bottom line is that he is scamming slime and should have been run out of the Classic community with extreme prejudice long ago. He's a worthless leech.
---
And you are fedora wearing nerd on his period

Very!

The best WoW experience I had was rerolling on a fresh server.  It's really fun being a part of the community as it forms and being a part of the servers history!

Me too I got her a mid level build and its next to mine.  I started her on private servers to learn the ropes which is/was super frustrating and will hopefully have her not bad by classic release.

The response to every situation is the same. Pop one ability, pop the other, repeat. Pop the AoE ability if more than one mob, otherwise pop the single target ability, repeat.

There's no "optimal" way of tanking because there is just the one way of tanking, *in the entire game*.  
---
Tanking is about as exciting as raiding as frost mage in vanilla, when it used to be the most thrilling experience in the game. Honestly that's perhaps giving it too much credit.
---
I'd be pissed off

I wanna be the temp Ryan who starts a fire in the toaster oven because min/maxers dont level cooking early on

i managed to avoid the entire STV as an ally boi  on private server the moment i considered to perhaps step inside that hell hole i  got kidney shot from a rouge and in 2 sec i died
---
But that won't reset your cooldowns like queued arena does. I agree with OP it would be great to have a skirmish-only arena implemented down the line. 
---
The premade PVP Vanilla private server I see people play on Twitch already has one of these and some of the matches are actually quite exciting. Not really the "imbalanced 2 shot fest" like everyone here is describing.

How did the demo look 6 months ago? In theory the final version will only be as bad as that demo. This is Blizzard though, you know it's gonna be polished and working well eventually(/s?). 
---
I'm dying for more info too but I think gameplay footage would be just like "yep, that looks about right". I also played a lot on private servers recently, maybe those who haven't would be more interested?

That's actually the date they're announcing that they will be scrapping the project due to lack of hype (blizzard will cite this sub specifically as not being hype enough).

I wasn't insinuating that just because I **personally** am not going to grind r14 doesn't mean other people will. I'm not sure how you extrapolated that. I am pointing out *the methods* *how people made the grind to r14, it was not competitive and prevented an enjoyment that could have been had if it were*.
---
The pvp system itself is poorly thought out. The only reason why people bothered to enter AV was to rep grind to exalted. Change my mind. I don't need a magic 8-ball to predict 2 months after AV is released and the majority of the population reaches exalted on their main chars AV will be dead, a fucking ghost town BG.
---
that‚Äôs terrible lmao
---
&gt; I thought Towelliee hated classic
---
I thought it was stupid too.... Until I fired up a private server one day and 7 hours later I was still sitting there.
---
I think we should cut people some slack on this. Believe it or not, some folks can't imagine the game they already played was THAT good after so many years. But once you play it again, there's no denying it.
---
Ill be the first to admit though, I don't KNOW the guy we are talking about. He could just be an opportunist

I‚Äôd say rogues scale with gear slightly better just because warlocks don‚Äôt get hit gear they need till BWL... as far as what‚Äôs easier to gear up.. I‚Äôd say lock but it really just depends on raid composition and such! Skill cap is high for both.
---
Where‚Äôs that link boi
---
What was the 40 man raid called
---
A lot of mad fanboys that didn‚Äôt schedule vacation calling in sick.
---
Are you kidding? TBC S2 / S3 / S4 in 3v3 were really balanced. There were tons of comps you could play. The only class that you could make an argument for being slightly OP would be Druid. Everyone else was on a level playing field.
---
Basically if an item was out in release and it gets updated in later patches the 1.12 stats are used.  This means there will be quite a bit of very optimized spellpower items that shouldn't be there.
---
Why was towliee invited? He's a retail shill and a super toxic and awful person
---
If MadSeason didn't get invited I'm gonna be insulted for him
---
We are the first settlers. The pioneers.
---
Dear god. The storms are dark indeed.
---
regardless he's a shitty person and Blizz shouldn't be giving him any spotlight at all
---
Afaik there will be several spell hit items in game since they are using 1.12 stats.
---
I‚Äôll play the beta just so I can start testing addons etc and if they allow us to test raids I want to get in Mc make sure I‚Äôm ready for release c
---
I started playing about 8 months before TBC launched. I‚Äôm excited to start on a fresh server for the first time.
---
Who is this Tips and why should I trust him
---
I mean... FFS.
---
"Keep the 24th open in your calanders" I don't read this as something playable on the 24th, I read this is there will be an announcement of something on the 24th. He's just saying be excited and using slightly misleading phrasing.
---
Linksur the veyto
---
The context here is somebody saying he didn't play in Vanilla, he chimes in saying he did in fact play in vanilla and apparently has proof. No need for "but not all of us"
---
Where did he say that? And do you think Tips has some info nobody else outside of Blizzard has?
---
&gt; having too much hype
---
I think that ship's sailed.
---
He's a shitty toxic retail shill who has shit on classic forever now
---
Dying mercilessly and often in Durotar is but one step on the path towards dominating the Alliance with superior skills and grit.
---
Take it how you want, anything at this point is exciting.
---
This might be what I am mostly looking forward to TBH. After getting my swift zulian tiger and swift spectral tiger on retail I kind of got anything I ever wanted in this game... So I look forward to a new start and try to relive all the nostalgia I have from this game from what I think was my best time playing wow in vanilla.
---
he‚Äôs been a classic enthusiast for years and ever since the classic wow announcement he‚Äôs been a liable source of info. check him out on youtube. lots of videos.
---
But I love having the same gear lvl 1-120! Heirlooms are so much better than finding and upgrading your gear! /s
---
I use toxic to refer to trolls or people spreading false info on purpose. In gaming it's those who constantly drop n bombs and talk shit poorly in chat. I think that's the more common usage of the word but I may be wrong.
---
He said it in Kargoz's stream chat. I posted about this already and the mods removed my post and locked it. They're removing every post about this and his twitter post despite it being reasonable information.
---
I definitely dont wanna play the beta. All progress will be reset for launch anyway
---
Adding monks was a horrible idea
---
From the Discord, and if you have been paying any attention at all today, you would know there is a rumor that a bunch of content creators were invited to Blizzard.

Why does anyone support him?  I don't find him any good at the game to begin with.

I've learned in my many years online that you can't argue with brick walls impervious to all but their own ego-driven fanaticism. Best to just move along and save some of my free time. If you want to count that as a win, just remember, no one cares or is keeping score. So be my guest.
---
I think this was from Kargoz's stream chat.
---
LOL. I'm at 3,100 hours. I fucking love the game but it's not good for social/work life. Very difficult to balance. Overall I tolerated the community. In game it was easy, especially if you're dominating the server. Nothing beats taking some toxic af dudes hard work away from them.
---
&gt;26 days played
---
Know how much BIS progression, gold, networkign connections, etc. I can make in 21 days /played
---
&gt; I guess you misread that he was talking about the 1.12.1 client, so he's probably asking for one to use when playing a private server where Blizzard isn't going to be banning shit.
---
Then they're in the wrong sub-reddit.
---
***Rule 1.  Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers or current World of Warcraft.***
---
I‚Äôm assuming the OP meant one of their first vanilla screenshots. The beta is not announced yet (people expect it will be soon) and no, there is not a release date.
---
Would it be the best choice for all the phases of content? I know that fire resist gear isn‚Äôt super necessary after BWL
---
Or maybe you just suck at arguing because all you know how to do is use ad-hominem attacks against your opponent (which is what you started and ended with). Ta!
---
"Had to delete the 24th tweet due to scheduling conflicts. Looks like the event Im planning (thats what the date is focused on) might be delayed a few days. I'll keep you posted as I get the info."
---
&gt;Honestly, I probably won't do it again if it comes exactly as it did in vanilla and thus pvp for the most part will die, 
---
Yea I musta pulled that outta thin air.... 
---
&gt;it was not competitive and prevented an enjoyment that could have been had if it were.
---
You are still talking about reworking a very major mechanic of vanilla on the basis that you won't like it. Plenty of people, *myself* included, enjoyed the PvP grind for what it was. 
---
&gt; 2 months after AV is released and the majority of the population reaches exalted on their main chars AV will be dead, a fucking ghost town BG.
---
This goes against all evidence we have seen from every classic server. Provided the population remains healthy, there are always new people filtering in to the grind. The only time BGs have become a "ghost town" is when the server in general becomes a ghost town. This whole conversation is silly, your ideas are silly, your evidence is nonexistant beyond "I don't like it" and now as I type I realize I'm not sure why I'm still engaging you. Have a nice day and I hope to see you in classic.

The Classic demo was like a microcosm of everything you just said and the streamers were there. I think they actually added to the experience. There were annoying groupies chasing them around, but I met a group of old school Vanilla players that knew what real Wow is and it was just like we never left. The server community felt like a guild by the end of the demo. I'm considering a Streamer server just for the extra world pvp activities, but I plan on being in a different guild.
---

Yeah let's just ignore pve lol
---
I once climbed over the wall of Zul'Gurub (from outside the instance) and fell off the world. Fun times.
---
Kind of related, but I remember during BC there was a WoW podcast that I believe was quite popular at a time when podcasts weren't as common as they are now. He had (iirc) the largest guild in the game and I remember being excited to roll an alt on their server and join up. I think it was Alea Iacta Est? The veterans will know who I'm talking about.
---
Point is I think you might be on to something, however there are a lot more streamers/gaming celebrities now so I doubt any one in particular will rise to dominance to the point of negatively impacting the server. It also helps that WoW is not free so that cuts out a lot of people who just want to cause problems.
---
Woo
---
Pls no more
---
It hurts
---
Has to be good for both to be a good class, lol
---
Why would you think it working in PvE excuses it's terrible quality in PvP?
---
It makes for a class with a high skill ceiling that is punished by the enemy having high skill ceiling. Interesting but not going to be strong. It should have never had that identity to begin with
---
Yeah, we dominated a rustafied server for a while with about 15 of us, but holy crap I couldn‚Äôt balance my normal life with that game. It requires you to always be grinding.
---
The changes to the game and cancerous community made me finally leave.
---
**How important is gold in Classic WoW?** \- eh I was terrible at gold farming and it was never really a hindrance; as soon as I got my epic mount it was really just repairs, enchants, and respecs which might be like 50g max and enchants may be 100g for crusader. Like I said I was terrible at farming - so i got my epic mount because i got lucky twice with a krol blade and a brightwood staff or w/e its called.
---
**Were gold sellers a prominent thing back in the old days of WoW (will they be in Classic WoW)?** \- Not that I recall (on my server), blizzard was good about banning. That being said Blizzard has become MUCH better about banning. It's my hope anyone who buys gold will be banned on their first offense.
---
**Is it possible for a player to "buy" their way to the top by purchasing gold from third party sites?** \- I'd imagine you would be banned fairly fast. Other than that I think mathematically carries were easier with 40 people so I personally often saw lots of free carries. 2 reasons - not as many alts and everyone generally stuck to one specs. So if you were farming for your tank to get TF and everyone was 90% geared; why not bring along a new guild member to funnel gear for.
---
**Is this not a huge concern?** WoW was incredibly, 10000% more social. People buy gold nowadays because there's no social aspect to the game. Back then you just became friends with people and as long as the core of 40 ppl knew what they were doing you could just tag along - honestly you'd waste more time buying gold and paying for carries.
---
**Does Blizzard have an active way to prevent these issues?** 2019 Blizzard will probably be all over this and easily. I believe they are going to be leveraging their more modern infrastructure for security purposes.
---
Also - back in the day it was $10 for 100g on my server. 100g was a lot but is it worth spending $10 to get an enchant on a weapon that you may replace a day later? Not really. Mounts were also per mount priced - so $90 per 900g mount aint worth it since youre locked to your race's mount unless you farm rep for like night elves.. which was suuuuuuuuper time consuming and you cant "p2w" this farm - it requires you walking your character around the world
---
I guess if you have gold you can raid and if something drops - you can try to buy it from other people.. but in a guild that uses a point system you'd have to be raiding regularly anyway; unless you got carried
---
Yes there will be. But unlike other classes, warlocks receive 0 hit from talents. This results in lots of dmg loss considering the amount for shadow bolts are rendered useless from misses.
---
Boy I bet you were pretty upset about Kingdom Hearts 3.
---
Ah I see, thanks!
---
Parks and rec would be a good follow up. I don‚Äôt have the skill to do such things sadly.
---
I said YOU not ME.  dummy
---
On the bright side you‚Äôll be done with your masters degree before classic launches.
---
It's kinda like the offseason in sports subs. lots of shitposting with the occasional big news story. This too shall pass.
---
And all too often, I see people throw around "toxic" at anyone who has a complaint or criticism.
---
Has everyone forgotten about the FR farm before Onyxia and MC? And that drops were random back then? It's not like they can collect some badges and then go buy what they need. 
---
But sure, I wish them all good luck and hope that they won't have to suffer through 100 runs with ONLY Magister's Crown and Helm of Valor drops. (Btw, I really hope Classic comes with the original 8 piece crit bonuses.)
---
Wouldn't beta testing be a time for feedback/changes? Or is that alpha. I'm not sure how they are developing this one.

Me neither. I'd bombard the sub reddit with gifs of peep show or simpsons or malcolm in the middle if I had any talent at all. But alas....
---
oh no
---
As somebody who loves the American Office, I am suddenly straight up having the best time on this sub reddit...
---
They already said in their earnings statement for Q1 that classic would be a Q3 release. So no earlier than August. Sorry.
---
r/whoooosh
---
Why would you attach any importance to their movements?
---
It's the digital age they don't need to call them out and give them a release date early lol
---
God help us if they're asking Esfand about how paladin gear should look
---
Everyone was in TeamSpeak, the GM and officers did the talking and everyone else spammed gchat. The only time gchat wasn‚Äôt being spammed was during a raid, in which case the spam moved to raidchat
---
I can't remember the last time they launched a beta on a friday, mid week is better for them in case the servers run into any issues etc. and considering tips' hints next week is most likely for it aswell. Maybe we get an announcement tomorrow for the beta date but we will see.
---
Jesus christ this sub is lit
---
&gt; you've just been given proof
---
Hmm.
---
&gt; in all likelihood (like 90%+)
---
Okay, so not proof then, just an assumption based on available information.
---
&gt;You're just being an ass at this point refusing to understand a basic concept.
---
I don't think I'm the one who doesn't understand the basic concept of "proof."
---
I'll cut people some slack but not a douche nozzle like toweliee.

---
Blizz did confirm on their Earnings Call that Classic will release in Q3 2019. The third quarter starts in July, so May release is not an option. 2x of May however seems believable as a Beta release, though.
---
3 hours? Fuck off mate. You will be playing a mininum of 7 every night.
---
Paladins are great, people who say they're slow and boring are themselves slow and boring.
---
Yeah, I guess we will just have to wait and find out.
---
Pcgamer does this all the time about any new game coming out and its always way before a release date is mentioned. So many times i find these articles with less release date info that we have on this one.
---
I actually don't want them to do a beta at all.
---
I lead raids because I needed to, not because I'm sociable. Might want to put a little more elbow grease into this; you're gunning for C+ territory as is.

---
You do know what you're talking about
---
Except when it comes to playing paladin properly on 1.12\*, lol. The theorycrafting the numbers I trust tho
---
How to raid ret? Go to IF and respec holy then come back. How to pvp ret? Go respec holy unless you're gonna fight for under 30 seconds. And then you should be reckoning
---
No1 would talk shit about you if you didn't play that terrible fuckng spec with your retard shitter NA friends who make our whole fucking nation look incompetent. You PvE as ret well. But that doesn't mean anything to anyone. No one has time for you to sit around and fucking drink for ur shit DPS. And ur certainly not getting gear in any competent guild
---
Your pvp leaves a lot to be desired even as ret...Which is again part of the reason people shit on you.
---
You bring this on yourself. Look in the mirror.
---
It's 2019 not 2006, ret paladins are never gonna get respect. There is no 1.13 that's gonna save ret DPS, and we ain't going back.
---
Such a likeable guy just go play warrior, so people can stop shitting on you. Including me, i'd bet you'd pvp a warrior well.
---
But where are the DOGS?!?
---
Cost decay was in vanilla, it decayed something like 5g/month down to a set amount I can't remember. It still means that even if you respec once a month it won't decay.
---
IMO Pallies in BC and Wrath were great.  Agree, after that they were made dogshit and just another clone dpser with different spell effects.
---
Wrath ret was if anything somewhat OP, imo BC ret was prolly the best incarnation.  Not op, but not dogshit either, you still did seals and judging but had crusader strike too and some talented spellpower so your ret heals weren't dogshit.
---
Rogues are ranked 2nd worst class in level and it‚Äôs definitely true... On top of that, it‚Äôs said a skilled warrior will actually lvl faster than rogues due to warriors kiting ability. All of this is for horde ofc... Pallies are worst to lvl on ally.
---
You do realize the IF they have a beta you WONT be invited unless you have XXX numbers of stream followers? This has nothing to do with testing, it's an advertisment. Why else would they invite a bunch of scrubs like the ClassiCast members who don't know jack shit about Classic?
---
arguably ret in wrath was OP tbh.  People just didn't notice so much because DKs were so OP so most of the nerfbat focus was on them.
---
Don't forget, ADSL was taking the world by storm during that time. Before ADSL was widespread game devs had to assume the majority of players could not sustain an online presence over long periods. 
---
That said, WoW undeniably had quite a few other things going for it.   
---
A massive and rich world, for instance. People were in genuine disbelief a game could actually be that big, and without having to load anything for an entire continent even.    
---
WoW also came from one of, if not *the* most respected developer at the time. Early 2000 Blizzard was a studio with nothing but wild successes in their portfolio.
---
Which is to say, I think you're right about non-game factors played a large part in the success of WoW, but I don't agree luck and coincidence are those factors (with the exception of DSL availability.)
---
Everyone makes mistakes, but that's a pretty damning one to make. 
---
To not know something so basic, and then try to represent yourself as a source of Classic knowledge... I totally get why people would just dismiss him from that mistake alone.
---
Personally, I've seen him do 60 PvP and that was all I needed to form my opinion about him as a content creator.
---
But why?
---
Mine was in the Stadium... The tank wasn't AFK though, I was the tank.  The healer sure was AFK though!
---
Part 2 is out, check my profile. Part 3 is in the works.
---
It would be a shit show, obviously!
---
This is great.
---
We used to kill him in the ramp nearby, did the strat change?
---
negative
---
No problem on my end they‚Äôre just fine
---
Hence why I said they have no reason to handle Classic with a "Traditional Blizzard" approach. I think they're gonna just do what they want, when they want.
---
Keep them coming!!
---
Unless he was leaked information he has just been hyping it since the employee alpha was known.  No offense just saying.
---
Well he does get Reddit gold for every posts which is a start!
---
So was there a reason why cross server battleground queuing was introduced, or no? Could it have been the 10-45 minute queue times I wonder? Which is indicative of what, exactly?
---
Riddle me that. And yes--largely, **for the most part (i.e., only the people grinding, not people steadily queuing for fun, competitive pvp) pvp will die.**
---
My evidence is experience. What makes you think that a game that has a community hellbent on having a 100% replica that the game is going to be *different*. Aren't you #NoChanges against cross-realm queuing? Have fun in your 45 minute queue.
---
You can always drop it and re level blacksmithing
---
They wont launch a beta on a Friday
---
And they kept pretending all expansion that seal of vengeance was just as good.
---
Well for starters, I would like to imagine Blizzard would give their older audience more time than that to request time off.
---
That's a good place to get your ass kicked. 
---
Tread carefully there.
---
Plans, intentions, all illusions to the truth! Just look here through my illuminate 3rd eye pinnacle. You'll see. Lol
---
this is one of my faves
---
But you probably didn't pay them back. You most likely killed other people and not the ones that killed you. 
---
So then they wanted revenge and killed people that weren't you. And so the cycle continues.
---
I remember a meeting at the Westfall lighthouse one time. Those were fun little get togethers.
---
lol share a server what guild were you in.
---
explain i feel like I am a nice guy
---
Tough to get a raid spot as enhance and if you do you‚Äôll just be swinging nightfall so it‚Äôs not very engaging.
---
Don't tell me how to play, I don't tell you how to play.
---
People can discuss whatever the hell classic related they want to.
---
Why is there this notion that I TRIED IT and now I like it.  I said since day 1 if they made legacy server OFFICIAL i'd play them.  I PLAYED VANILLA.  I WAS THERE.  I would even bet I played more and accomplished more then the majority of the people in here.
---
What is your basis of this belief?
---
Yes it was.
---
It's odd. Some of us are having problems, and it's happening in the exact same spot for me no matter how many times I view it, but I know it's not a problem with my connection, and I've also never encountered this issue with v.redd.it videos anywhere else on the site.
---
Alas.
---
Because Green Jesus. That's why.
---
Are you on your phone?
---
ok this is probably the least likely reason lol
---
Paying subscribers are the bottom line. Are they gonna wait till I'm ready?
---
Bro I don't even know who you are. I was just accepting their premise and giving a plausible explanation for why someone might change their mind.
---
&gt; Why was towliee invited? He's a ***retail shill*** and a super toxic and awful person
---
=)
---
All apart of your process
---
People seem to not understand what summer means. (June 21st - Sept 23rd)
---
Which is virtually all of Q3. Really am not understanding why people are expecting launch within the next 2 months.
---
No. It wasn't. Seal of Blood/Martyr never existed along side holy power. On top of that holy power was added with Templars Verdict, which came in Cata. Go home now before you embarrass yourself further.
---
I have never streamed.
---
I have been in every Beta with the exception of Cataclysm. 
---
I believe it is random. Once selected depending on how much time you invest and what kind of feedback you provide they weight your odds and previous good testers get in more often.
---
Can you tell me a little more about what the strikes were/what they did? I've never heard anything about pre-vanilla pallies.
---
lmao
---
Mages are a great class, they scale great with gear and are among the best in PvP output and PvE. Hunters are great at PvP as well but become outclassed in later patches due to their gear not scaling as well as other classes! Hunters are also decent in PvE.
---
I don't hate him, because this comment chain is the first I've heard of him. Who the hell is towelliee?
---
I love this close minded community.  You should be THANKING the content creators that are gonna be blasting Classic with 500k-1M+ viewers probably more on day 1.  FUCK ME I'm a retail shill but the hate I see for the content creators who will make sure your fucking servers are full are insane.  They are exposing to hundreds of thousands of new people old and new Classic WoW.  This community would be dead without those youtube videos, or streamers and content creators who have relationships with Blizzard giving feedback and RELAYING YOUR feedback to them.
---
If not for them on Twitch, Social Media, YouTube, then you would have the shitty 6k servers you have now in private.
---
Also PSA I'm going on a PVE server.  Suck it.
---
No, I'm on a gaming desktop with comical processing power and a completely functional internet connection that can stream at least 1080p without a hiccup. There's no reason to suspect that it's a problem on my end, unless it's a bug with Firefox (though given the Firefox fiasco last week, I wouldn't be entirely surprised if that's the case).

Hmmm odd, you should try another browser just to see if you can replicate the same. I‚Äôm using chrome on a gaming desktop, no issues.
---
Edit: chromium.
---
Than*
---
People would rage. Then start playing.
---
Well undead looks great in leather gear etc. imo.  The truth is that rogues are in their weakest state in the game in patch 1.12 - that being said - in pvp they are cooldown based.  With CD's up they are very strong and great in 1v1.  In pve they are solid dps and they scale very well into the late game.  They are a solid class choice.  Their biggest weakness imo is their numbers.  They are probably THE most popular class next to mages and warriors.
---
Yes. I would even go as far as saying that most of the gear should be crafted. Direct BoP loot should be exception for specific iconic pieces to tell a story and not the default.
---
This is nothing compared to what is probably happening in the private Ventrilo channel during this
---
Night elf hunter perhaps?
---
There's a Chrome addon that shows the emote instead of the text on sites like Reddit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/global-twitch-emotes/pgniedifoejifjkndekolimjeclnokkb?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon
---
Yes that was my race and class.
---
&gt; Justify this because I don't see it at all or see how it has changed. Raiding requires consumables but it's not strictly required. PVP requires consumables but it's not strictly required. Consumables are a socially required but they aren't required for entry. I don't see how the economy is relevant outside of this.
---
It is extremely relevant. Some specific consumables are straight up mandatory for certain fights and others are basically always mandatory, such as mana potions. If you want to perform anywhere near the better half of the playerbase you are using consumables. They are extremely powerful. An average raiding consumable is usually stronger than a full tier item upgrade. In PvP they are sometimes mandatory to win a BG. A good example would be breaking a hard-turtle in WSG with FAP. Also you are usually using mana/health potions constantly and pretty much every serious PvPer is using grenades on top of that.
---
On top of that the economy is not just consumable based. There is also a ton of gear being traded and crafting materials in general. There are also BoEs that trickle down from raiders to the casual or catchup player. There are enchants that are relevant throughout the game. Also there is usually a constant allthough diminishing stream of new 60's that aquire pre-bis crafted gear and so on.
---
&gt; You can gear up for raiding and raid or PVP without even touching the auction house. WOW is very Diablo in that you loot gear directly from corpses rather than looting crafting materials that can then be converted into gear from a person with the relevant skills.
---
I would say this is a big weakness of WoW. But it is not entirely true. There is quite a bunch of crafted gear that is BiS for long periods in different tiers. But I agree it *should* be much more crafting based than it was.
---
&gt; I'd say WOW is a game that actually downplayed economy compared to older MMO games. Then we have soulbound items which goes directly against economy.
---
Fully agreed. Nontheless it holds true. The reason why WoW was still a MMORP was partly because of the economy which  constantly rewarded interaction especially in the open world.
---
For fun?
---
So, what's up with all the doggos on WoW screenshots?
---
I think could be considered #changes.
---
Alert the #No-Changes mob!
---
**Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee^eeeeeeeeeeee^eeeeeeee^eeee^eee^ee^e**
---
I wouldn't expect anything beyond bug fixing.
---
Game's not even out and the furries are ERPing in Goldshire
---
I've read a bunch about shamans and in PVE you will 99% of the time be resto.
---
There are some posts which state that some guilds will use enhance shamans to wield Nightfall, but apparently warriors are better nightfall wielders than shamans. Enhance's isn't viable with standard weapons because it's DPS is a bit too low. Elemental has decent DPS but will go oom too early into most bosses to maintain it.
---
In PVP all 3 specs are viable and quite good. Elemental bursts people down quickly and enhance is supposed to be really fun due to potentially 1 hitting people with windfury procs.
---
I'll drink to that
---
we're gonna have to agree to disagree on this one, clearly we're going around in circles here. I find earning loot upgrades as part of the reward of dungeons, to include BoEs that are legit upgrades and will be equipped. You argue they should go to everyone purely for gold value which to me takes something away from the game and dungeons.
---
I think it's going to be something like this, honestly. Classic info/beta/release is not going to be "Traditional Blizzard" style. They're not trying to sell anyone new on classic. They know where the starting market is.
---
Same damn it
---
Don't tell me how to play, I'll have just as fun speed leveling
---
And I care how? I'm not the one that posted it, just clarifying for the other commentor. Go throw some bold quoted rules at someone else.
---
nope, it was cata
---
Still really undecided on warrior race, horde or alliance. Can you sell me on your choice? I've considered them all honestly...
---
paging /r/Wallstreetbets..

I think we‚Äôre witnessing a subreddit hijacking.

---
Yeah, I'm confused as well. I think a lot of people here apply what they know about retail to the game 12 years ago. I guess it could be argued that the 2's bracket wasn't balanced as it was only a couple of different options (burst comps or dps+heal) but still nearly every class was represented. Even though I played a cookie-cutter warrior/druid, it wasn't uncommon to see off-meta comps like ret pally/rogue or even shadow priest/warlock (mana burn+mana drain and dots hurt).
---
fuc\* sake.. i'm here looking for dogs in these posts.. took me a while to realise that there were no dog in this post :( #Disappointed
---
That‚Äôs a dumb reason to be frustrated. I‚Äôd rather them work their balls off and give us like a 30 day heads up when they‚Äôre sure than try and hit some stupid date and release crap.
---
Sounds fun, go for it!
---
oh definitely, i am aware of that. Some classes are good at those stages tho. Played shaman with my friend running a druid, i was doing twice the dmg with half the mana cost till lvl 10. Could be a private server thing tbh, dont recall it being that bad, but it could have been.
---
Always sunny is wotlk
---
This post is bad and you should feel bad.
---
go on...
---
For a beta? I dont think so...
---
Epic
---
Best Horde race for Hunter?
---
In Vanilla I was Tauren but feel like I should probably pick a sensible race for the class in Classic lol.
---
Mesmerizing
---
The thing is that can be used as a downside to totems to argue they should be quite powerful.  For example imagine if old school grounding totem was just a buff the shaman cast on themselves, it would be way overpowered compared to the totem version which allows a visual queue for the skillful opponent to take advantage of and negate at the slight expense of changing targets.
---
Breathtaking
---
**\*Legendary\***  
---
One of the things I'm secretly looking forward to is creating characters the moment Classic is available. I want to take all the names that are impossible to get in retail.   
---
"Bob," "David," "Bullcosby" etc.
---
Abit hyped. I quit retail wow in wrath of the lick king didn't like the way the game was going at the time. Anyway a chance to start over with everyone else doing the same thing.
---
It's arguably better than salv, but it's not better than Bom + Salv.
---
Gut em all!
---
Was it Ctr Alt WoW? I remember listening to that one! 
---
I do hope I'm wrong and everything will work out well, and I think that the majority of streamers themselves genuinely want a positive experience for everyone interested in playing. They certainly don't promote toxic behavior, but that's never stopped the bad apples from doing what they do best. 
---
I think that, like most of us, I haven't been this excited about WoW in a LONG time so naturally I get a bit wary of how the internet has changed since the early 2000's and how it will affect the return to one of my favorite games. 
---
But hey, maybe they will have a very positive effect on the servers they play on and I will be proven to be a grumpy old jaded fool haha. I hope so at least. I just want everyone to have fun like we used to.
---
Yep absolutely that should be fine. Its a worrying situation how many think like that Mok66 guy atm though. Good gameplay, engaging story, community etc - what does any of it matter if you aren't #1 competitive player? Its a shame, (and i say that being a 2500 retail player and sc2 masters 1, i love competitive games, but there is more to our hobby than that) and one i hope they don't pollute classic with.
---
That's not what he said or implied at all.  But ok bud. üëç
---
But if all 5 players are contributing to killing the mob then you're going to be less efficient.
---
Overkill damage and wasting cast time on mobs that die. More running between enemies. More dependent on number of enemies to fight - some areas can run out. Etc.
---
Reality is you're going to spend far too much time running between enemies to consider it efficient.
---
Holy shit you‚Äôre exactly the kind of asshole that would ruin classic. I‚Äôm starting to feel much happier that it‚Äôs them and not people like you. You sound like a 2 year old berating him for playing the game the way he likes to. Jesus Christ
---
That's what I hear retail has turned into. I don't really know, I stopped playing after wrath. If arenas were the cause, then that would explain the contempt towards it. I really can't put a finger on the pulse of this community, I only have the perspective of a veteran pre-cata.
---
gamer dad confirmed
---
Yes intimidate scatter hunter is a very viable PVP spec, it's a bit of a bullshit 1v1 spec.
---
I actually like the curated instanced dungeon content. It is still a shared space but just more controlled.
---
When everything is just "massive" then the RPG elements go to shit as well as we can see in the attempts to create such games. Usually what happens in those is that people just stack up in these massive guilds that just swarm over content. IMO open world objectives that incentivise this are great, but not if they are the norm.
---
Blizzard failed to create open world content outside of the occasional world bosses that draws the masses out, which is a bummer, especially regarding PvP. But my personal favorite moments are actually from long 5man dungeon runs like BRD. Even though I like PvP and raiding alot, the adventurous "Fellowship of the Ring"-kind of feel of clearing 5mans is just fantastic.
---
Not sure you understand. I don't know what the fuck half of the emotes on Twitch are trying to represent, let alone the clusterfuck of green frogs.
---
I kinda wanted to say that while reading this, I think you may have your choice backwards. But this is only my opinion! 
---
People will always need tanks and I can promise you you'll get dungeon groups and a raid that needs a tank. We can't get enough tanks tbh. If you do go warrior for PvE you must understand that this will take a lot of time... Raids are twice a week and can last up to 4 hours depending on your guild. You will also need to farm consumes! There isn't really such a thing as a warrior tank alt unless you already have a geared character in the same guild. 
---
You may think that hunter is the way to go now but you still do have to farm some consumes and make raid times. Hunters do really well in PvP so thats nice. 
---
Between warlock or spriest id say they're both pretty equal in early PvP terms just depends the player. But Warlock will have the ability to get better gear easily but you'll have to raid. PvP rewards will not come out for the first 3 months of classic I believe so spriest will be stuck with prebis dmg gear for a long time. You could raid on spriest but guilds only except 1 per raid composition even and you'll still be rolling against warlocks and mages for offset pieces.... 
---
I think what you should do is have a warrior tank as your main because thats what it would take tbh. Then as alt PvP dps I would either go spriest or hunter! Its all your preference this is only my opinion! :D
---
Don't you guys have two monitors?!
---
You're a streamer. By definition you're a narcissistic windbag.
---
Lol ok sure.
---
He's been on private servers
---
He's leading you all down the primrose path to wipes and wasting weeks of your lives
---
He knows how shit it is from a numbers perspective in PvE. He plays his fucking ret like he's a warrior lol it's like he doesn't even have raid frames
---
WIping on 13 year old content is cute until you want to clear it the next week, then it kills guilds. Things hsouldn't be too easy. But better than that it just falling apart at AQ like most guilds will who let ret paladins in
---
I honestly don't know anymore, I was on a few servers during that time. Onyxia, Anub'Arak, Spinebreaker.
---
Either it was you or someone who was using your name who was in some big guild on one of those servers who played a Blood Elf Paladin.
---
So you didn't even know me. And this was years before I started streaming. Gotcha
---
Just downloaded Neverwinter Nights EE from GoG and it was 4G and that game is huge. I expect Classic will be 8-10G tops.
---
Also Blizzard will have to keep in mind players having retail and wanting to download Classic too. They‚Äôll need to keep it low.
---
Orc is the master race, the 25% stun resistance is honestly so good for PvP. But if not PvPing Id say orc or Tauren! Orc also helps in PvE with the AP bonus racial.
---
Agree on all counts. MadSeason is number 1. All the rest aren't even close.
---
The question remains, how the fuck do i make sure i get in this closed beta.
---
What usually happens is all my friends who don't give a fuck and don't even play the game any more get in to the closed betas and I'm left standing around holding my dick.
---
I'm worried I'll pick a server that a bunch of streamers are on... I hope there's a list posted so I know which ones to avoid.
---
I dunno why i thought Greater Bless came post BC.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Fair enough. I appreciate the sincere reply.
---
You're a fucking genius. Been loving the last 24 hours.
---
That‚Äôs only gonna take 2-3 mins tops.
---
I guess not. But you (or whomever it was) stuck out in my memory all of these years, and not in the most positive of ways.
---
He didn't know it, but that's what he said
---
They wanna keep him happy, he plays ret
---
Ret being viable effects their bottom line. Ret becomes viable. Or any other popular spec lol
---
How do you balance all that crap and keep people subbed cuz their class isn't crap this expansion? Homogeneity
---
Welcome to game design 101 which you should have learned just playing. YOu have idiot players? You have to cater to them
---
Read the OP. He's insinuating only 2 weeks of beta before release.
---
New non existant thing to worry about
---
I can't. I don't publicly brag about grabbing pussys on tv, so i have no future in america.

Man I love the old goblin models so much
---
Yea you could buff them, but then they would just be an ever higher prio to remove. At a certain point you'd just be laying down totems and getting them wanded as the highest prio thing going on in the fight lol
---
They could remove the ability to kill them and weaken them as well.
---
Very difficult to imagine them getting that right.
---
I‚Äôve been leveling each class for lols on PS and I can say by far the worst class to level is Rogue.
---
I will start by saying that I am a fan of your guide/lore videos/content creation and have been subbed to you since the beginning. However Tips, please don't try and spin some nonsense about a handful of "beta" screenshots or a small blue post on the changing of loot trading warranting 10-15 minute videos.
---
? Well, If your interrupt and the ennemy spell are in the same batch, u would have interrupted him therefore locking his magic school BUT his spell would have also been Launched
---
Pvp servers suck.  Randoms running around ganking people trying to level cause they are too trash for structured pvp. PASS

WHAT DO YOU EXPECT YOU GODDAMN ***********
---
Use your fucking brain dumbass
---
I'm blocking you, you're so fucking dumb
---
You con children into spending their allowance money so that you'll say their name. How is that not an asshole thing? Streamers are the next generation of "game journalist" and have the exact same scum baggery  except you also take tips like a fucking barista for playing video games.

If you don't know, you are good people.
---
(It's when you use the keyboard arrows to run around, and use abilities by clicking with your mouse. It's also how you reserve a place in the lowest pits of hell.)
---
you should be thanking the idiots that fund your drinking and gambling addiction.
---
Not sure if your tanking or dps but for horde you should go orc for dps and Tauren for tanking. But either will work both ways. I would go orc. 
---
For alliance I would say humans because they generate the most threat due to the +5 sword &amp; mace skill.
---
Night elf have the most avoidance while tanking. Also have +10 Nature resistance which helps in AQ.
---
Dwarfs have stone form which can be helpful. Also have +10 frost resistance which is only good for Naxxramas..
---
Gnomes have escape artist which can come in handy.
---
Daaaang how you know?!
---
It did come later in the patches, not sure which
---
At a certain point they seemed to have given up on Paladins being hybrids and embraced them being pure support. T3 is the first time they give paladin a true pure holy set with relatively rational stat allocation, compared to say a rogue who always had good stat allocation.
---
I should have been clear, I was stating actually 10 minutes exactly. The meme is that youtubers make 10:01 videos etc. What I was referring to is that I never shoot for the 10 minute mark and stop there. I have long discussion style videos, which often go much longer than that.
---
This is amazing!
---
No, leveling as a 5 is a lot slower than solo.
---
Even duoing is slower, although barely and depending on which classes can actually be faster.  For example Warrior/Paladin duo is a LOT faster than solo warrior and solo paladin simply because on their own they have significant downtime in grinding but together they have almost zero downtime.  As a result the drop in xp is negated entirely by the reduction in downtime.
---
However if you were to take two very good grinding classes, with extremely low/zero downtime such as druid and hunter.  That duo would not increase their grinding speed by much, and therefore almost certainly be better off alone.
---
Now there are exceptions, for example when doing kill X number quests or named mob quests where all in the party get credit then it's almost always better to group up to max with people in the area because 1) reduces your chance of a tag steal 2) it's not about the xp per kill and more about completing the quest and 3) there's likely to be, at least at launch, competition for mobs so grouping means more chances for a tag.

(I've never played WoW but planning on playing Classic)

If combat rogues are great for PvE but bad for leveling, what kind of things does leveling require from a class that isn't required for PvE?
---
Meh

Bad Edit
---
What is the most fun healer in Horde ? I only played healer, a priest, once a while back till lvl 40. It was fun. Most of the time I played between a rouge and a hunter. . Any recommandation ?
---
Mystery solved.
---
I can't recall a raid where zooming in and out *wasn't* essential to get the right view of the fight as it progressed.
---
Welp, I was mentioned in a GIF. My life has peaked.
---
That was moved a long time before 1.12. I think it was deemed overpowered way back when WSG was the only BG in the game, and was taken out shortly after. Could be wrong, because I was barely playing then, and I can‚Äôt remember exactly when it was removed tbh
---
Pat high warlord, unbreakable, and I think drakedog has some vanilla videos. Kennion the rogue is dope too

How about no

So, it's impossible to stop a spell from being cast?

Says who? You? I clearly remember a raiding enh shaman back in vanilla. His freaking name was something like Manalcolic because even then that shit was understood and perfected. I remember a freaking tankadin back in vanilla with full AQ tanking gear and a freaking Thunderfury. It keeps on happening on private servers =&gt; https://youtu.be/hC_2iJNFgZU
---
There isn't a huge different of dps between a spinal and a sulfuras. Besides an axe for an orc would much more suited as most of your dps would come from AA. That's a 15% extra dmg on 40% crushing blows. 
---
&gt; Not using Windfury totem, using agi totem to pad their own meters instead
---
3% crit is not going to make a huge change, besides you can totem twist.
---
&gt; Not using Nightfall
---
That's for cucks, no real human being would be okay with playing a cheerleader. You'd have to have the self confidence of a caged hamster to be okay with only using that weapon for the rest of wow vanilla experience.
---
&gt; Fully consumed up and flasked, as well as having full optimal debuffs on the target
---
That's completely wrong, he's missing many. 
---
There's no need to flask up every raid. It's not even that big of a deal. Earth shock only uses 50% spell power, it's not required. It's only a small buff. Most of your dps would come from your melee.
---
And I'm not entitled to anything, I'm just saying it is viable. I explained why many times already.
---
Using cucked in a sentence is so 2018. Don‚Äôt do it, by Toutatis!
---
The reason you hope this will happen is that we haven't yet gotten a release date, and a silent release could happen at any time. It will not happen. WoW Classic will be heavily advertised before launch. Most people who know about WoW Classic are the ones who currently play WoW. They want to get the attention of those who quit the game years ago. Those people who fell in love with vanilla have no idea what's going on. They will give a release date, giving themselves plenty of time to get the word out.
---
How about just play how you want to play?  Guess what, some people like to rush and that's okay.  Some people don't, and that's okay too.  Stop telling people how they should or shouldn't be having fun.
---
So this is what envy smells like.  Good to know. Also youre barking up the wrong stream. If you even seen my community they are known for being adult oriented.  Kids don't get my stream. Tune in.

I have the original manual too. I want to buy another one just to frame it.

Yes it is.

This exactly. No changes is a safe ground where we get a product which is at least as good as vanilla wow. And thats the best we can get from Blizzard in 2019.
---
I personally loved arenas (the only thing kept me playing wow) but I hope they wont be in Classic. Else, I would do nothing but just stand in the capital city waiting for arena q pop in my entire gaming time.
---
All part of the fun.
---
Except for when its late and you just wanna finish up and log off for the night. Or you only logged in out of boredom and are ganked instantly.

Grim, Perklunt, Niar for rogues.

I liked Gegon's movies (gnome mage).

Where is this?  Played a lot of classic but never saw this.

What melee classes are good at farming? Looking for a melee class I can reliably grind and farm currency with in end game

26 days, sounds scrubtastic.

Accurate (elemental mage)
---
Except not really though, like factually not.  Look at any top end parse data on the subject, alliance warriors can pull significantly higher numbers simply because their threat ceiling is higher than on horde.
---
I prefer these over the same recycled post about time off or how private server people are wrong about everything, or how streamers are evil

What if you could get a 2-day head start, BUT you get turned into a stapler!

isnt that place still there though?

Beta - May 24th

Release - July 16th.

Neither one offers any cool gear and you can't get quests either since it's the opposite faction.  Fun is the only answer.

It's almost like people have different opinions on the same things...

You got a link?

Was coming in here to type Gegon, beat me to it!

Oh god. You poor bastard.

No. If your interrupt is in the batch before the cast is meant to be finished, it will interrupt the spell.
---
Why would I be envious of playing video games for a job? I still enjoy playing them when I want and feel no pressure from them. But yeah, sure buddy, you're living the dream by being chained to the computer all the time. Only 12 year olds dream of playing video games for a job. Once again a streamer acting narcissistic. ü§£ü§£ü§£

Holy Shield doesn't add any block value. It adds block chance. That 30% chance to block on 4 attacks every 10 seconds is never going to be the difference between life and death. Not even close.
---
Threat and control are more important than mitigation for tanks. Especially in 5 mans when stuff doesn't even hit that hard. 31 points in Holy gets you a way to pull from range, while 21 points in Ret gets you Sanctity Aura for 10% extra holy damage. IMO, both of those are going to be more useful than Holy Shield for tanking 5 mans.

It's nowhere near as bad as you think, people get rejected once and go on a tirade about how elitist and toxic the community is, are there some bad apples? Sure but that is true of every group of people in anything ever.
---
I'm not trying to argue with you in any way here, but to me it was always this way and I played every single iteration of WoW at high level, I dare say. 
---
Your goal as a tank was always to keep mobs on you and do damage to them, nothing else. Want to prevent damage, that's what mitigation spells are for, with some having higher cooldown than others. Some classes also can do different things and their tanking style differs because of that. This, then, directly affects your experience in a dungeon.
---
So, I'm not entirely following what you're trying to say. I'd have to be more specific.
---
No it's not, you just have to interrupt in time. This scenario where an interrupt and spell get in the same batch is really rare, unless you for some reason try to interrupt your enemy in the very last second each time they cast something.
---
Hmm..I don't think so although it looks like they've been doing that one forever. Only time will tell how it shakes out. I think it's gonna be fun either way
---

There are going to be so many people "rushing wand" that you'll be better off just buying one from the AH for 10 silver rather than "spending" 40 silver skilling up and making one yourself.

I feel like class identity died with rebuilding the WoW lore - which technically started in TBC, but really began affecting class design in Cata. Then as expansions moved further and further from original Warcraft lore, the identity of more than just classes was lost. The whole game took on an entirely new persona. Some people like it. Good for them. For me, I can‚Äôt stand pandas. I‚Äôll never play retail with monks or pandas. F**k pandas. Hell, f**k Draenei - you stupid space-goats. Where tf did those @$$hats come from?? Who made them all so d@~# special?? F**k them both. Give me classic or give me real life. I don‚Äôt need this stupid panda sh*t ruining my WoW experience.
---
Dunno. Maybe a stretch. But... seems that way to me anyhow.
---
P.S. pandas are stupid.
---
P.P.S. I hate pandas.
---
P.P.P.S. If I had a panda rug, I‚Äôd burn it. Then bury the ashes. Make the world a better place.
---
It's almost like you know nothing about the history of this company.  If they were to turn you into any office supply it would obviously be a 3-hole punch.  Personally I'm keeping my hopes up for highlighter 8-pack, but we'll see.
---
Baby due first week of August here...first one too lol
---
Pat was the reason I abandoned my level 15 rogue and re-rolled warrior back in the day.
---
This is exactly what I want. The cut BG's, Emerald Dream, Hyjal, whatever that gated portal in SW went to. No BC or anything like that.
---
Dang, I should have prefaced this with that usually all of my premonitions turn out to be wrong haha.. I was honestly just hoping they wouldn't do a beta or at least keep it closed and there's no way they don't have a 99% complete client by now. I can live with July.
---
Laintime, Maydie, Pat. Great warrior vids.
---
My first experience with a toxic community was on an RP server.  
---
Assholes are assholes, and you're not gonna avoid them by playing a specific server type.
---
I mean I still had camera bound to ctrl mousewheel when I needed it, which came a pretty natural bind after a while, but for instant cast spells. especially reaction ones available on the neutral mousewheel definitely improved my game
---
I am excited to finally be able to play WoW as it was when I was 10 years old and seeing the ads online. I remember for my 12th birthday I asked for a WoW subscription but my parents thought putting your credit card info online wasn't safe. I know it isn't going to be the same experience but I feel that as a fresh player I will get an experience similar to the one I would've had as a child.
---
Wouldn't really achieve anything, everyone would just resub before the cutoff point and the "headstart" would just become the defaco release date.
---
Yeah. Tanks stood in the archway, raid in a little triangle space on the left side.
---
I quit a week into Cata. The only thing I was excited for was Troll Druids, I could finally play a Horde Druid and not be a damn cow.
---
But there were just too many sweeping changes that I did not like.
---
Drakedog, an UD lock he has 10 videos on youtube as a destro lock pvp. Each video for each xpa.
---
I thought they smelled bad on the outside.
---
from the classic community? Not really sure that this is accurate. Also pservers def will take a hit when classic is out.
---
Thanks dude, got more coming‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It's, "okay," not, "okey."

Tbc
---
Ah, you're Russian. I was wondering why you used, "okey," instead of the proper English, "okay."
---
If I see another one of these posts, I'm gonna punch myself square in the nuts.
---
No, there are plenty of good  and chill people around. The retards always scream loudest tho, remember that.
---
Step back boys, this guy has *comical* processing power
---
Anyone still playing retail literally get classic as a free bonus. 
---
Commenting on classic before you try it in a situation like that is just close minded.
---
No God, please no. No! NOOOOOO!
---
Betas are important for feedback and add-on development, among other things. I get what you mean though
---
Ability to sustain their own health would be the main difference, things like being ranged, having slows, pets and or self heal help immensly with this.
---
I have been in every Beta with the exception of Vanilla Closed (was in Open).
---
In Vanilla I had 3 GMs raiding with me on their off hours (we were Oceanic, and they worked till 1am so would finish work and play till morning), and they got me on the Friends and Family list.  I don't know for sure, but I think I'm still on the list, cause I keep getting Alpha invites.

He never even played that lock anyways

It's a regular laugh riot.

Last time, they gave out the release date, 3 days later was Open Beta, then 16 days later was release (back in 2004).
---
The things that make you laugh. I respect you, gamer dad. I used to have a gamer dad. We played WoW all the time in the vanilla days. He's not dead. He just doesn't play WoW because it sucks now.

Better leave this sub before you get testicular torsion. It's only gonna get worse from here.

You probably shouldn't be playing online games in general if this is a serious post
---
Agreed. I'm all for taking your time, but what I want is to raid. So my main concern is getting to level 60 asap and getting geared for raids.
---
Realistically, Zimbabwe will invade Florida. America will put on a show, pretending they've suffered a great loss and will surrender, but will actually be super happy that Florida is finally gone.
---
Less realistically, 1000 more copies of this post followed by either original content following the classic blueprint, or TBC.
---
Damn, I would love to have this for classic, however my computer probably can't even handle such HQ textures...
---
People will wipe. Only the guys who have playing this game on private server for years won't wipe. That's not most people. 
---
Respectfully you're the one who doesn't get it. We're talking about an easy game, a very very easy game. I had a harder time beating Sonic the Hedgehog then understanding anything in World of Warcraft. 12 years later, I'm pretty sure the difficult dropped to negative 2. This shit is unbelievably simple. All it really takes is experience, coordination and time. Experience because sometimes you need to actually see what's happening so that you can react to it and that often means wiping. Coordination depends mostly on the raid leader. If a raid leader is incapable of getting anything done with his group, the fault is entirely his. The time it takes to do anything is not going to change regardless of what's happening. 
---
It's not about healers, it's about efficiency around raid composition. You don't need 8 resto shamans but their totems provide HUGE buffs for any group. Even if a warrior is better than an enh shaman, the replacement would cost the whole melee group a strength totem, a resistance totem in some encounters, a totem twist of windfury/agility/tranquility. A 20% minus aggro on a Vael encounter? An improved extra attack out of 5 for the whole raid duration? Those are not trivial. 
---
Having a shaman in a melee group would easily boost the dps of a warrior by at least 20%. So why complain about having a dps who would only do 70%, when clearly his presence alone would be enough to justify his raid spot. 
---
After that I'm not saying it's the most efficient why of structuring a raid composition but it's an option, a viable one.
---
I have this exact dilemma, I‚Äôm trying to not focus on the hunters levelling prowess as once you are levelled it‚Äôs not a thing anymore. The play styles are both fun but I can‚Äôt decide!

Nobody even knows what spell batching is

&gt;We generally don't look at the current state of cars and say: "Gee, these cause a lot of waste, pollution and congestions - let's ditch them, go back to riding horses and then figure out how to create a better mode of transportation based on THAT." This would neither be efficient nor practical, especially in a material world, limited mostly by time and resources.
---
That's because where Retail is at, we hit in the 1970s.  Big cars, massive engines, lots of pollution, leading to a gas crisis and the fall of industry.

We're well into the "Let's be more careful and more organized" phase of cars.

Early gold farming won't be dependent on the auction house. You'll be vendoring items to make your gold. So you don't have to worry too much about market saturation when it comes to gold farming. 
---
Let's say cloth is 1g per stack and you can gather 3 stacks in an hour.
---
If you can make 5g per hour selling grey items to a vendor then you're better off doing that rather than farming cloth. (Assuming people are selling cloth and not hoarding it)
---
Mine are packed in a box 11,000 kms away, right next to my 10 year anniversary statue.

An example is my dad. He was a huge WoW gamer back in the Vanilla days. He has no idea what's about to hit him and I'm not going to tell him until the release date is announced.

Due to the anonymity of the internet, all server types will be toxic to some extent. Every single server will have tryhards/elitists. If you want to roll PvP, then roll PvP and find a nice chill guild or something. It's the same concept IRL really; shitty people are everywhere, you just have to make an effort to surround yourself with the good ones and ignore the bad ones.
---
Why would that happen? What's with people coming up with illogical gotchas they think this real world company will throw at its consumers smh
---
You just said youre sure they will use wotlk features in classic... Not to be that guy, but yeah.
---
That‚Äôs amazing!
---
Your a good son for waiting to put that voodoo on him till after we get a date
---
Naw im gonna tell um
---
I assumed OP meant subbed to BfA. Which would upset me, as I have no intention of buying that shit hole.
---
But they wouldn't do that either. They've already said there plans are to just shard until the game naturally stablizies.
---
Yeah, opening up certain things like more classes per race, and arguably, the weapon skill system, weren‚Äôt bad game design choices in 2011. But as you said, the changes were sweeping, so much that it virtually became WoW 2. If Mists‚Äô talent change happened in Cata, there wouldn‚Äôt even be a question bag Cata was WoW 2.
---
No they aren't
---
Seems like yall really like arena, and don't actually remember certain classes dominating. Warriors and druids to name a few.

Any person who plays video games in any capacity and has not yet learned that Classic WoW is coming would have to be living *so far* under Khaz Modan that they turned to crystal and started talking to the planet.

This is actually the one thing that I am truly concerned about. Unbalanced servers aren't too bad, I don't mind having more people to kill in WPVP. I plan on getting most of my gear through PvP so I am not as concerned about world bosses. But streamers have the power to truly screw up a server, including crashing it on a regular basis. I don't want to risk harassment because I accidentally "wronged" a streamer or I was called out for any reason.
---
well that was an interesting thread
---
It's been hard to play private servers lately because it's hard to invest into characters that you'll abandon in a few months. To me, the feeling on private servers is like vanilla WoW after TBC was announced. Most people just took it easy, few were leveling alts, even hardcore raiders took their foot off the gas pedal because their gear will reset in a few months anyway.
---
It‚Äôs almost...like reading...a Star Trek...script...with... Kirk monologue.
---
It was always burning since the World (of Warcraft)'s been turning
---
Firstly of all I think it's true, I'm like 99% sure Tips himself has confirmed he never hit 60 during Vanilla. That being said just because you didn't hit 60 during vanilla doesn't mean you can't know about the content or research/learn/teach it. I mean I'm pretty sure a huge number of people didn't even play Vanilla, have been private server fans and spout tons of knowledge about Vanilla based on private servers.
---
I don't discredit Tips because he didn't hit 60 in Vanilla, in fact I don't discredit Tips at all. I DID play Vanilla since Open Beta, I killed almost all bosses during Vanilla (Except C'Thun and all but 2 Naxx bosses) and I'm 100% sure Tips knows more about Vanilla than I do at this point. So yes the fact I mentioned is valid, but it doesn't really mean shit all.
---
You know how not to make a really good RPG? Balancing it entirely around pvp.
---
If you want classic hero DnD style aesthetics and feel go Alliance, if you want to be part of ragtag group of monstrous misfits coming together for survival, ya play Horde.
---
Ya trade in forests for deserts, and ya trade in well structured cities with stone buildings for chaos and huts.
---
Because they would have to pay OT to employees to monitor over weekend.. prob cost them like an extra 1600 dollars for that.
---
There are a few people like this for sure, but really if they're fallen so far out of the WoW/MMORPG/Gaming community that they haven't heard about Classic it's very unlikely they will play it regularly enough that marketing to them would be worthwhile.     
---
Sure a lot might log on for shiggles if it's just $15, but you don't go from not playing any games/reading about games/visiting forums about games for years to suddenly deciding you're going to play a very time hungry MMORPG for months and years.
---
What do you mean exactly? If you get juked nothing happens other than you just used your interrupt on nothing..
---
The sub is the same, it makes no difference.
---
Seriously, play this game the way that makes you happy. If you want a slow burn go for it. Classic and TBC were games where I actually enjoyed the journey. True, my dwarf priest will be 60 as quickly as possible and that's going to be pretty damn quick. With that said, my primary alt...yeah I went there, will be a sightseer. Granted, trying to be an ele shammy main and raiding isnt going to work. Classic WoW is like that but you can still have fun as long as you accept the nuances of your choices
---
I wish I hadn't heard about it before we got the release date. I don't want him to have to refresh the Classic forums every hour too lol
---
Unlikely
---
Lol I'm confused

The world ends, you somehow survive and have a generator with your computer. And then you accidentally break your glasses.

That's what I mean. U gotta make sure they are wanting to cast the full spell. Also gives you some hack time on them while you pushback the cast and wait 2-3 seconds.
---
Really you gotta decide at the time. Is this really what they want to cast.
---
Wait, where was the dickbutt?
---
I‚Äôve been practicing dad jokes all my life too.
---
The Barrens is a Horde zone. You won't be flagged for Pvp.
---
Just don't AOE or attack the horde and you're good.
---
 f r e s h
---
I don't know if I'd say *no one knows what it is,* but it is difficult to understand or really say how it will effect gameplay seeing as no one has played it in over 10 years. Private servers have had some dodgy version implemented but you can be sure vanilla was different and Classic will be different again in exact implementation.   
---
The fact that Blizzard is doing spell batching when it's really a super niche thing shows they're confident that 1. it is an improvement, or at least a very minor change to gameplay, and 2. it can easily be tweaked or disabled down the line if necessary.  
---
So yeah, pretty much, let's wait and see.
---
Idk about that. I play games all the time and I haven't heard of Classic anywhere other than Blizzcon and this subreddit (which nobody knows about unless they already know the game is coming)
---
I did not know about the elemental invasion one what was that for?
---
Eh, I'm okay wit it. There isn't much of anything to talk about so at least it's some OC my dude.
---
I remember Pat videos
---
Nice.
---
I keep flitting around. On one hand, I like Tauren and undead animations best, but there are arguably overshadowed by orc in terms of performance. 
---
On the other hand, I prefer Aliance zones and story, but dislike most of their animations. One thing in particular which bothers me, is how out of place orcs and Tauren feel to places like plaguelands and SM.
---
This technique is nonsense nowadays. Get two screens, that way you will not need to minimize your window.
---
First and foremost, I'm simply making a bad Warcraft lore joke.
---
Second, I'm sure there are many people who don't know yet. But people who specifically played WoW for any appreciable fraction of time are more likely than not to have heard about it through the grapevine after two years. I'm not faulting those who don't know yet by any means, and I'm happy to think about how they'll learn soon, but I'm not so sure it's that big a group.
---
While not classic, being able to bug out the netherwing ledge fel orc skin thing so you kept it and the mount buff then fly to hellfire peninsula and go through the portal and fly in azeroth early was 10/10.   
---
I also miss the swifty hand spell effect glitch, that was pretty fun.
---
It's melee attack power only so has no benefit for a hunter. Troll is 'technically' the best pve hunter but it is pretty minor either way.
---
Honestly amazed they've not been removed.
---
He doesn't know shit, literally the worst streamer out there
---
Also negative
---
I do that no matter what class I'm playing.
---
I remember the first time I ran into them and died one shot lol
---
i want to play druid but couple things that make it iffy is
---
1. farming crowd pummelers for eternity
---
2. Lack of gear that isnt resto in raids, so less motivation(could be wrong)
---
3. Respecing, respec cost is crazy, for pve its either resto or feral off tank and then if i want to pvp i would probably switch to balance/resto, maybe feral?, but i heard you should only go balance once you get some spell gear come AQ
---
Minus that. the class has crazy outplay and 1vX potential, 
---
They arnt top tier farmers but they can do whatever for money, farm mobs aoe, or  go into dungeons stealth, or whatever (not sure how else to make money)
---
Carry BGs with flag running/healing
---
Id say top wpvp class
---
what else is there?
---
(this is coming from a guy who played BFA for 2 months but has been doing some quick research)
---
Oh. Right.
---
You should consider a fundraiser for the good work on those memes who keep up our mood! ;)
---
Holy power for ret in MoP was fucking glorious and nobody can tell me otherwise. Pinnacle of the spec's design imo.
---
That being said i'd still rather vanilla pally in vanilla over any other iteration, it just suits it so well.
---
Ahh yes ofc thank you for that. I forgot about troll for some reason! I would probably still go orc for 25% stun resistance. But it really all is minor differences.
---
Hey man, Paladins 1-60 are a grind but I have to admit they basically run the battlefield in the 60s. 
---
They are efficient healers, who can't really be burst down in DPS. In group PVP the main target is usually the healer, and in the case of the priest, shaman, and druid they are relatively burstable due to low armor.
---
Paladin just sits there soaking hits, or if you choose to ignore him completely renders your DPS inadequate with their heals. Try to burst them down too fast, and they have 2 friggin shields that just stall you out.
---
My first character in retail vanilla was a Paladin. I took it all the way to level 52, completely burned out. Leveled a hunter 1-60, and then finished off the Paladin to 60.  
---
I really gained a lot of respect for Paladins while playing as a Hunter as a main. They are rock solid, and I want them on my team.
---
They're slow at levelling, definitely bottom 3 classes. They have probably the slowest starting 25 levels out of any class. They are boring to play, it's very rarely worth it to open with stealth -  you basically just going mob to mob spamming SS.  
---
You have fun cooldowns in evasion/bladeflurry/adren rush, but outside of that it's not the most enticing class to be levelling with. Is it fine at levelling? Yes. But there's a good reason people complain about the spec.
---
Nah best is hunter class. With the right macros you can play entirely one-handed and without looking.
---
I bought gold the entire way through vanilla and never ever got banned and many of my guildies did too.
---
!remind me 2 days
---
Yeah I know it was a lore joke, but I don't get it because I'm a noob. I'm sure if they really liked the game back then and still read about the game or have friends who still play they would likely have heard about it by now but I'm talking about the people who used to play 5-10 years ago and then just lost interest.
---
I'd prefer office gifs over the usual spam  
---
HeLp Me ChOoSe DwArF Or GnOmE  
---
DAE WANT A PHYSICAL COPY  
---
RELEASE DATE WHEN
---
Again I think they can find something that is a little bit better in both lol
---
It's a problem only because they ever gave it to you...Not because taking it away in a vacuum and replacing it with something more conventional is a bad idea
---
Thanks for reminding me. Pally grinding in the 50s isn't so bad. So many anti-undead spells for grinding those mobs.
---
Yes I can't wait
---
He's kind of right, and the fact that you're about to try get in on the Classic hype train after shitting on it shows the character. 
---
You're going to make videos and stream it while it's hot, and when it's just the actual Classic fans playing it, you're going to abandon the community.
---
As someone who played alliance back in the day this photo more than most makes me understand the draw of the horde
---
You will have more competition on mage gear, since there are 3 cloth classes.
---
Ughh okay...?
---
Nobody ever really talks about this, but Blizzard leverages the power of Twitch better than any other developer. They treat their content creators like gold because they realize the massive potential that streamers have for promoting a positive image for Blizzard. It's hard to explain, but it should be really evident to people who follow Hearthstone. Blizzard regularly sends streamers pretty expensive stuff, the developers actually appear and interact with streams, and the vast majority of hype going into new expansion sets is generated by Twitch streamers, not Blizzard itself.
---
"Ironically," the events that Blizzard actually host themselves on Twitch are subject to a lot more scrutiny. I put ironically in quotes because it actually makes sense. People are a lot more likely to be distrustful and generally unimpressed by a corporate entity. People are a lot more likely to trust their favorite streamer that they watch every day.
---
So yeah, I can totally see Blizzard flying out some prominent classic WoW content creators even if it's just for a basic meet and greet with the developers, because they understand how important these relationships can be. Streamers have the ability to connect with the average joe gamer on a level that Blizzard the company can never achieve, and I think that they get that.
---
I'm down for necessary farming, but one free spec wouldn't be the worst imo. 
---
It's stupid,  but if you really wanted me to spend gold then make it 2 once you get 60 and like 500g to respec.
---
Wait, was sharding confirmed? Are there details around it?
---
Nooo guides are good
---
Retail players if they take it seriously can do just the same
---
It's just about getting 40 competent people together with one person who understands the mechanics to lead. Once you have that all the content is easy assuming you do the prep
---
Maybe some of these retail guys will find it difficult cuz they don't know how to make gold as easy, and thus prep is longer. But other than that....It's pretty easy
---
It's just about maintaing standards.
---
And yea you don't bring the enhance shaman you just bring more fury warriors. Fury warriors &gt; everything in vanilla especially early.
---
Wore the pants from the Gnomer quest from like 30-60 lmao
---
&gt;Who's going to enjog Classic the most? That's right, the people who used to play Vanilla but stopped because it sucked or for some other reason
---
If they stopped playing Vnilla because they thought it sucked then why would they enjoy Classic?
---
Well they still got your click that's 5 cents or so.
---
i love that my two fav subs are combining lately
---
And you've been saving them for when you became a dad?
---
I know its just anecdotal, but my mister and my mother played wow a lot more than me and they dont know yet
---
They are competing. The reason why we haven't had Classic until now, is because developers dont want to cannibalize  there play base, and that's what's happening here.
---
People only have so much time. There aren't many people who can invest the time to play both games, especially not in serious nolife hardcore way. 
---
Just because the games are different,  doesnt mean they aren't competing for the same player base.
---
This is neither unpopular nor opinion.
---
Try, and probably mined BTC while I was on there 0_0
---
Classic realms should not share names with retail realms in order to minimize confusion. Here are a few possible naming themes for Classic servers - 
---
 Theme: Ores &amp; Herbs
---
-	Mageroyal
---
-	Briarthorn

-	Arcanite

---
Yea but if they did so what?
---
The only thing we care about is a classic date
---
And they're not gonna get that they have cell phones to tell them so no one leaks it.
---
Lol what's an actual classic fan. I played vanilla did you play it too?
---
I would be ok with TBC style systems being added, like sockets. But no level caps.
---
yes my problem is I want to play horde, but I also want to level in elwynn, westfall. but then if I go ally I sacrifice the barrens, halp
---
They played Vanilla and then quit when it was no longer vanilla. After every expansion, many players complain that the game suddenly sucks.
---
Ragefire Chasm isn't something I'd exactly call fun.
---
Now that I think about it I've never step foot into Stockade
---
Hunter or Warlock is probably the one you want leaning more towards Hunter
---
You're worried about being exalted with every faction and having completed every quest?
---
That's at least ten years of content for an old casual like me.
---
Maybe I need to read through all this hate to understand what warranted your post Towel. I always considered it a plus when content creators a like are invited out for alleged type events. I mean sure some could argue that one content creator would be better suited over another but at the end of the day we're all gamers and we all want the best experience Classic could possibly be. No need for the hate. Be happy because if those these is unconfirmed news its still news and while it may not be in the form of a Blue post its evidence that our dream is getting closer and closer to reality.
---
You're just starting out. There is no beginner class. Every class can be played by a new player so don't get roped into this mentality that some classes are so hard you can't do it. 
---
I recommend avoiding this place like the plague.
---
Magni Bronzebeard was the king of Khaz Modan who became petrified in a crystalline structure in the Old Ironforge ruins beneath the city, after enacting a ritual to protect his people from the emergence of Deathwing during the Cataclysm. Later he awoke from his petrification and revealed that he had become psychically attuned to Azeroth herself, and from then on was referred to as the Speaker [of Azeroth].
---
It's a longwinded way of saying they're living under a rock.
---
But yeah, there are some fun months ahead of us as a community, that's for sure.
---
I just played Keeshan's quest line in retail.  He's basically Rambo.
---
It‚Äôs been confirmed either through Ian‚Äôs tweets or somewhere else but the development team has addressed the issue and said they only want to implement in the starting zones during launch.
---
Obviously. You get 140% of the xp.
---
Don‚Äôt worry Tips. I‚Äôll sub it up and stick around.
---
I feel like you're right i shouldn't think about those classes and just play !
---
He doesn't hate classic he's just neutral, except he tries to be neutral so hard he sounds like he's salty/hating. 
---
His attitude is basically a reverse of what a classic fan would say if he wanted to get his friend to play wow.
---
Instead of "There's this amazing game and when you've done everything you can also pop in and play retail it's WoW too, just worse" he's like "there's this amazing game called WoW AND they're adding classic, which you can do when there's nothing going on on retail and it's fun, but grindy, it's WoW too, just old"
---
You're in the machine now man.
---
How would that work? If the best gear required crafting materials from raid bosses, that might not be that different from the BoP items dropping directly. I am interested to hear how you would set up such a system.
---
Apparently not obvious, cause the guy above me is being downvoted
---
Right, well in vanilla you kinda have to learn to decide that before there's less than a second left on a spell, becasue vanilla is weird like that, with spell batching being a thing. And tbh, its kinda situational but most of the time you should be able to tell when your enemy wants to fakecast, so waiting untill the last second to interrupt is kinda greedy. This is another talk tho, my point is just that, this scenario with spell batching wont/shouldn't happen too much.
---
You can't go wrong man, azeroth is your apple and you can do whatever you want to do in it. My first ever character was an orc shaman, I ended as a human paladin in vanilla.
---
 All the way through WOD.
---
Seriously this is pure gold
---
that makes 3 of us
---
You underestimate SOON^TM
---
We also used to kill him at the ramp. God I hated that fight. It was like 20 minutes long (obviously didn‚Äôt help that we weren‚Äôt that good at the game back then). Spent so much time as a rogue just sitting out of LOS waiting to have the debuffs removed...him and Firemaw just bored the snot out of me in BWL.
---
Yeah just play what class looks fun and whatever race looks good to you.
---
I can help you with a class. That being said. What do you want to do in the game? For instance a Hunter is a great beginner class. Unless you like pvp. For pvp it's one of the least forgiving classes. So what you want to do here matters.
---
That being said. The best overall beginner class is mage. The reason being is that mages are a T1 competitor for every possible thing you want to do in the game. This I would say makes them good for beginners because if you find yourself enjoying a part of the game you didn't think you would. You don't have to worry about your class not being viable for it. Other then tanking and healing for obvious reasons.
---
you chose the correct hairstyle for Troll Male
---
Yeah I think it was 5g honestly.  Maybe 10.
---
If that's the case I can live,  but it would be nice. 
---
Kinda like Arena..I really liked Arena
---
You got me scared, rebooting my VM.
---
So I'll try to help answer your questions by going down the list in order: 1) farming Gnomer is going to be a complete non-issue in regards to "wasting time", it's honestly kind of therapeutic to just end your night with some chill music and Gnomer. 2) Once you get to AQ 40 (I know long-term but w.e) there's a lot of gear that literally nobody except a feral druid would want, in fact I think druid is one of the easier classes to gear in regards to lack of gear competition in raids. 3) Once you get into the PVP phases there's actually some decent options for specs: 31 resto with feral charge is a solid flag carrying spec and you won't be missing much when it comes to raids, it's the spec I would play during phase 2 / phase 3 pvp. As for feral off tank spec, if you're truly "off tanking" you could honestly do that in resto early on because a lot of the content is tauntable. And finally part of Classic is going to be farming gold for respec and you're just gonna have to accept that part of the game.
---
Yah you are right. I actually never ran into that scenario very often. Sometimes with sheep.
---
&gt;It's a longwinded way of saying they're living under a rock.
---
This is one of the metaphors I've heard in my life. Is this a common joke or did you make it up?
---
great Twilight Zone episode
---
"Living under a rock"? It's a very common idiom. I was just making a Warcraft-specific joke about it.
---
#KHHAAAAAAAANNNNNN!!!!
---
The Vanilla game client is roughly 5.5GB uncompressed.
---
The Samsung EVO 960 M.2 Solid State Drive has a read speed of roughly 3.5GBps
---
It feels good to know Solid State Drives will no longer be a bottleneck on most modern systems. Even with slower SSDs :D
---
Ret Paladin super strong? What retail do you play lol
---
I hope not. Unless he wants to move onto GoT wow memes. I would accept this.
---
Why are you so concerned with the right to feel bad about dying virtually? 
---
I'm more concerned that you want to limit other people's free will to fight on a server specifically designed to simulate a war between 2 factions...
---
I do not know yet but raiding seems to be awesome. PvP seems to be fun aswell !
---
Rogues. Pickpocketing BRD is a great way to make gold.
---
You learn by playing and researching. You gauge your performance with a combination of I don't compare your performance to the performance of other players, and listening to other players who makes suggestions on your performance. Can't really comment on hypothetical performance
---
Aww, save him from the wait. That's wholesome as fuck.
---
Damn Towelliee, normally I only use my Twitch Prime. But that sermon got me coming in with regular sub on auto renew. Well said. I hope they brought an umbrella, it‚Äôs raining cold hard facts up in here.
---
I've heard "living under a rock"... I haven't been living under a rock after all... get it?
---
Wow servers don't shut down for the weekend... Are they paying overtime to employees every weekend?
---
priests. they are the staple horde healer, they've got the biggest toolkit, great in PvP and PvE. shamans are also kinda fun but mostly limited to using chain heal in raids and dropping totems.
---
Spell batching is the single most important issue for me with classic. It's vitally important for PvP.
---
I was so blown away when I heard the news. I thought they would fuck PvPers again for sure, but they actually pulled through for us once.
---
Not really on the level of HQG's these memes are more like r/gaming
---
trolls for pve, orc for pvp
---
berserking + rapidfire is a crazy CD combo.
---
hardiness is great for PvP since stuns will be the bane of your existence.
---
You can't be as toxic in game as you can be on here, there's actual consequences to being a douche in classic
---
My point was included in the post. This is an advertising tactic to generate hype and maximize subscriptions to their game.
---
If you work 8-10 hours a day, workout/cook, and/or have young children, then yes, 2-3 hours is a lot to spend doing a personal hobby on a weekday.
---
Sell office memes, buy dog memes
---
Ah, I saw "okey" and "isk" at the end of your name, and figured it was something Eastern European; didn't realize it was also common in Norway.
---
This not only feels like a survey for all of WoW, not just classic, but it also feels like it's for active subs. I don't get it.
---
orc for dps, tauren for tank
---
human on ally
---
If you aren't sure what you want to do. I would go with mage then. They are very easy to pick up and play, while allowing for deep mastery. Also as long as you are okay being a dps. They can do anything effectively.
---
If you want to be a melee I would go rogue. Warrior will be plowed over with try hards.
---
If you want to be a healer, then play priest. Don't fall into the hybrid trap. It sucks unless you just really like working way harder then everyone else.
---
As I said though. I would go mage. You really can't go wrong with mage. They are the silk slipper wearing class of classic wow.
---
Plenty of games offer head start incentives and it would help with the initial zerg rush on the servers. Wasn't suggesting it as a gotcha
---
you're missing the /# of members
---
In a group of 5, a mob gives 28% the XP it would give to a solo player.
---
At level 11, killing a 11 mob, a player will get 100xp.
---
A group of 5 11s killing that mob will get 28xp ea.
---
At the end of the day, a group of 5 needs to be 4x more effecient (speed, kill time, everything) to break even vs solo, and that's just not possible. A solo player can kill 2 mobs a minute reliably, a group of 5 cannot maintain 8 per minute.
---
It'll be slower, but with friends it can be fun.
---
I would like Classic to be in a different sub, just to show how many more viewers it gets than retail.
---
Nobody is being forced, the people who are doing this apparently have time to do it and decided to go for it.
---
Yeah, nobody wants to know about a game several months before its release.
---
I want the beta so other people can iron out the bugs. That being said. I have no interest in playing the beta.
---
No. You just have to get your interrupt in before the batch when his spell cast is finished. Batches are in small windows. By today's standards they seem quite large but they are still narrow compared to a 2 second cast. 
---
This is why the most memorable batching is double sheep or warrior charge. 
---
Most of the time batching wasn't noticeable for things like interupts because you either hit your interrupt with plenty of time left or you were so close to the end of the cast it was assumed that you were just a millisecond late.
---
I'm not even sure people remember 'batching' back in the day. It was just the game. It was more of an, 'oh shit, they both cast poly at the same time!' deal. The people who knew about batching were not the average player.
---
and everything else i said is about right?
---
Leveling isn't really hard, just time consuming. Doing it "optimally" is the challenge, and on the flip side you'd have to be doing something very very wrong to do it bad.
---
You're going to spend a lot of time leveling a character to 60 so you will be learning their mechanics fairly well. Hunters and warlocks have the easiest time leveling, but you should be playing the class that sounds most interesting to you and fits your playstyle. There are plenty of videos online that will give you a quick break down of each class and what they offer that can help point you in the right direction.
---
If you're competent and have done some research raiding shouldn't be an issue. Healers are going to have the easiest time finding a raid. There are a few specs that will be very hard to find a raid in, and a small handful that are a no go under any situation.
---
Just play. You'll learn your class as your leveling and if you do a little due diligence in that time you'll know plenty of about the game to set you off right once you hit 60!
---
I spend far too much time on reddit and haven't really noticed these issues on any other gifs.
---
i am complete opposite :D naxx came out this week on my server so after clearing it on my main, i started levelling a warrior today since im thinking about playing it in classic, not sure if im rolling mage or fury warrior/off tank :D
---
 I can‚Äôt wait to find my first green item and feel like a god
---
