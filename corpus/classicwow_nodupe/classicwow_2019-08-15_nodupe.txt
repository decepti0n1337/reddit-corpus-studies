Oh raids have locks farm shards to summon many of the members. A lot of comments and guides like to quote 40 shards per raid.
---
---
---
I think so to., I think the crowds will be be big At least until 8.3 .I’m sure a ton of the retail crowd will play. The 8.2 content is dry and complete at this point. 
---
Even semi casual players will have their heart at 65 in a few weeks  then it’s just Raid and log for maybe 4 months.
---
  Don't forget that your main tank 75% of the time will leave the guild or stop playing almost immediately after acquiring it.
---
Backlash is why we have Classic WoW in the first place.
---
One of your axes isn’t labelled.
---
this fucking guy, you do realize most people who plan to raid somewhat seriously are already in guilds, there are already hundreds of guilds with over a hundred players out there, and no matter how many servers are released now, the guilds are locked to the first server they picked.
---
did u ever actually play vanilla? how is it fun to invest countless hours into one character just to get combo'd by a rogue with a lv1 weapon? The game is too buggy and griefy to consider it, even on a PVE server imo.
---
I tell you what, seems it is completely irrelevant, as it would run on both, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and spend time replying to the debate you're so desperately trying to have.
---
Yeah. My concern was mostly with questing sepparated. I doubt there will ever be a big level difference so we can still run dungeons with no issue, and that will probably be the main focus regarding group play.
---
[Samwise Didier](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Samwise_Didier)
---
Okay lmao, i thought you were serious about this but the last sentence is just too funny for this to be real.
---

---
Have a good one, almost got me.
---
Thats why you would create a character at 60 so you don’t invest time to level lol
---
It has its benefits!
---
In order to get the full effect of a large heal, you need to let your group members get to risky health levels. Safer to just downrank.
---
I really dig that progression, lvling into dungeons into raids. Didnt know theres a cap on killing the raid boss each week, so i assume guilds tend to clear all the raids if they can once a week. And possibly bust your ass off during the regular days to upgrade your gear and farm some gold for misc. Stuff that can help the raid
---
That's true, but I won't be able to manage 5 alts, I really want to push at least one main to 60.
---
No
---
The tank doesn't have to be the leader. In my guild in vanilla the GM was a resto druid. The gm of my guild since tbc has been a rogue. The gm of the most successful guild on my vanilla server was a holy paladin. The gm of the most successful guild on my server since TBC plays a resto druid. I understand why the myth that the MT needs to take charge is so commonly believed, but it's just not the case at all. I think anyone who wants to tank in classic and is afraid because they're not the type of person to want all the attention should understand this and go ahead with rolling a tank.
---
Can't players create characters on multiple servers? That might be a big problem because we won't really know if the population in Herod is decreasing if people make one character in each server.
---
Diablo 3 was the worst day 1 launch of any Triple A game I've ever seen.
---
Literally vanilla launch when they were kind of a "little (very successful) indie publisher" and got way more attention for WoW than expected was a much smoother experience than Diablo 3.
---
So including that massive failure and other minor failures I have no idea how you think they've been "doing great"
---
I do believe Classic won't be that horrendous of a launch but it won't be smooth as butter either somewhere in the middle.
---
Name reservation was already a mess booting you offline, booting you to a server you didn't pick, lagging to create your character.  I put my name in hit create, 10 seconds I'm still staring at the char so I try again "name unavailable" oh ok I'll try a dif name... But no it was unavailable  because I made the character but it never kicked me out of character creartion to even see that, I created 2 characters with barely different names and exact same class and looks because I literally just made a dupe char from the lag.
---
Also I made a horde and alliance on the same PvP realm (Herod) due to the lag it seems to have allowed it.  I deleted one because I certainly wasn't trying to exploit that lag for a cross faction advantage.
---
So no they aren't doing a great job server wise.  They're doing a serviceable job and that's fine.  Just stop licking their balls as if it's perfect.
---
Cause that's usually what happens when you're outnumbered haha
---
why would you change from whitemane to this server? whitemane is a west coast server. change to fairbanks.
---
&gt; but nobody really knows the real number of people returning on launch 
---
nobody can look into the future, but theyre pretty good at estimating by now.
---
It’s possible especially if you have a consistent group to run with. If your constantly searching for a group then it will go super slow.
---
Totems are a very big deal for shamans. Maybe you'll grow to like it?
---
Whitemane is just Nazi Germany basically
---
You realize with just prepaid bid mc is a cake walk?
---
They just announced a new server for eastern pvp that you can reserve a character on now.
---
Well this is about the coolest idea for an Addon ive seen a long time.
---
I can tell it’s accurate because he has a graph.
---
Allows you to setup an alliance and horde char on a pvp server. Create char, delete, create char of opposite factor, restore previous.
---
Ew
---
imo its kinda implied in "beta" "alpha" "stress test" etc...
---
Yeah, all guides tell you to avoid west fall for leveling efficiency, but it’s so good!
---
It's an English language server designated by Blizzard, not a multi-language one.
---
What you do is flip a coin for the decision, and then when it's in the air you realize which side you want it to land on and go with that.
---
Implied is one thing, but it should be stated SOMEWHERE. And it's not. So that's why I asked.
---
We'll probably play the most we can in a group when the game comes out and end up going our own ways until 60 yes. We'll obviously still meet and do dungeons, but questing only if our quests match. Waiting for everyone to be on the same quest will be really hard to manage since we're a group of 5.
---
Genius idea. This post is going to get 1 birrion upvotes.
---
It's the smart move. It's not a coincidence we got to reserve names before launch. This allows Blizzard to see the populations and adjust accordingly before everyone starts becoming too invested to move.
---
you and I have different definitions of limited time. 21+ hours a week is a part time job.  
---
  
---
That being said , how would anyone know yet?
---
reckoning?
---
And they say ret palas are not worth it.
---
Yea, very interesting. 
---
I heard it yea. That is why, a guy moved out and I have an open bin on other side of the room to throw it in. 
---
Hahhah
---
fairbanks is not full. play on that.
---
But they do wear cloaks.
---
quick guestimate for if you were to buy nearly everything minus getting the eye from scratch
---
9k for ingots
---
1k for dark iron
---
1.5k for arcanites
---
100g for fire essence
---
1k for blood of mountains
---
lava/fiery core vary greatly but more likely than not guild will provide them, even so you're looking at about 12.600 gold worth in mats.
---
by avg gold/hour from classic farming you're looking at about 18 days playtime
---
Fairbanks was still low pop when I checked last night, has that changed?
---
Meet we shall, Threxican
---
Is hamstring kiting going to be a thing in classic? If so the warrior has a huge advantage. They can kite between their long ass weapon swings while rogues are forced to face tank every mob they fight, while wearing leather.
---
The backdoor was added in Cata. Side door to the barrens always existed, though.
---
Stalagg (PVP) -   Kappa and Trihard
---
Sounds really cool, hope it works out well! I'll probablly go between modest-hard. Depends on how much the PvP will slow me down.
---
Have the name "Insane" on stalagg reserved anyone want it?
---
200 iq right there
---
I'm playing a human and specifically running to do all those quests again.
---
So you have never levelled a character from 57 to 60 in classic, i see.
---
Cause that takes also ages.
---
Id rather have a pve server with perma death for propper iron man challanges
---
Blues?  Sphh, if you don't have an artifact and a few legendaries, then you are scrub nowadays.
---
You misspelled Herod.
---
I am in the exact same situation as you! My one addition add on question to this is i am doing it in world pvp and was wondering what world pvp is like as a holy paladin.
---
I don't even understand your info graphic
---
Dude if you love shaman, roll shaman. Raids always need shamans for totems and I'm sure you can find a spot somewhere if you've got a good head on your shoulders.
---
There will be a lot of Warriors / Hunters / Mages / Rogues
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stalagg
---
know your lore kid
---
But they could get a second chance at the name they didn’t get
---
Got some new names on Stalagg. Fire  Red  and  Pyro [https://i.imgur.com/ssGkkiR.png](https://i.imgur.com/ssGkkiR.png)
---
I have.  It could just be 60 then.  Just for you.  Big baby
---
Layering == Good  ??
---
Cool
---
Yep!
---
I don't know what a Thex is, but the other day I learned the six demon bag in Wow was named after something from Big Trouble in Little China.
---
You fuckers. I logged in instantly and all 10 of the names I wanted were taken.
---
well you should definitely write a bug report on the forums! :)
---
They are on a Beta Server. Blizzard has released the names of the servers at launch. Beta is not one of them. They will be wiped.
---
Ya, you can only be logged on one character at a time anyways
---
I'm committing to Herod but threw a guy on there too just in case.
---
There's three main cities for each faction and no dalaran/expansion hubs. Even on a low pop server you'll be tripping over other players on your way to an auction house, don't worry.
---
Got it on my Paladin, but I farmed it at level 80 where you basically pull everything into the last room and spend a few minutes killing dozens of mobs and the boss.  Takes roughly 15 min and it still took me weeks of farming to finally get it.
---
Aight, that makes sense! Cheers.
---
Its full
---
Says who?
---
Hunter pre-pet without a group is incredibly painful at times.
---
You forgot about the Biggest 2 Swedish thing ppl on NA know, Ikea and NiP

F0rest is love

f0rest is life

In today's culture I can hardly say I'm surprised that English speakers expressing their wishes for people to speak English on an English speaking server would get interpreted as, "we are all a bunch of racists and we hate x country."
---
Look. Nobody cares where you are from as long as you speak English in public channels. It's really that simple.
---
This whole thing is getting over-blown like mad.
---
Facts
---
That is the proto indoeuropean word for both heart and army if you pronounce it like ker.
---
Man, I was playing WoW before they added the raid shortcut but wasn’t max level to raid but my friend was. There was something so cool seeing a raid of 40 people storming the fuck out of BRD to get to the instance portal! My friend and a couple of people were steam rolling the Emp room while waiting for the rest of the raid to arrive

Well that pally is wearing high rank pvp gear.
---
I know why you asked, but i disagree that i should be stated somewhere. Stop acting like they need to communicate every little Detail about everything.
---
They dont have to state that you can download the client beforehand, its self-explanatory.
---
oh ok, Thanks i was worries because ive heard stuff about launch being at 1.12 :)
---
Yeah. Every server is going to be Tichondrius / Kil'Jaeden kinds of big. My favorite part of the original wow was server community! Played on a medium pop server the last two expacs and you can't even tell the difference any more though..
---
Cool, thanks. I knew they were beta servers but didn't know they had released a separate list of launch servers.
---
Was a bit surprising too. Initially I thought it was overblown, joined discord. Saw a bit of shitposting... no big deal. But then after an hour of a never-ending stream of it from mostly the same people I realised that the community was not going to be easy to work with pre-launch.
---
Got the names Eric, Good, and Incredible.
---
Lenin was not against all industrialization, btw. He was against it for it's own sake especially when owned by a ruling/capitalist class. He actually was hopeful to turn the entire rail network into electrical rail.
---
I disagree. It's literally 2 weeks of gametime for a name in an MMORPG for a character that you might play for years. 2 weeks is not "way early" for something as important to people as a name they'll use for a long time.
---
Playing alliance... 4 days played that’s 20 hours faster that Joanna’s best good luck with that!
---
One additional EST pvp server
---
&gt;Her: “What’s your schedule looking like t
---
Joanna also wasn't competing with half a million people during games launch when that record was set.
---
I got ya fam https://imgur.com/39nAm0H
---
My god you just gave me a flashback. I played on Alleria and every time I was close to getting the chest this undead rogue named Math would gank me. It happened so often that my friends and I actually got friendly with him outside of the arena, even made horde toons to chat sometimes.
---
&gt; You can even set it to always start/stop recording whenever you launch/quit the game  
---
How do you do that? I couldn't find it from the settings when I looked quickly. I'd love to do this actually!
---
Thanks for doing this.
---
What's to convince? You can't even play yet how are you making such commitments aside from possibly some guild alliances?
---
Makes total sense. Thanks for the answer.
---
Can we get a huge chad gamer to fix/create PallyPower?
---
it hurts every time i see stuff like this
---
Rapid fire just like Quick Shots does not retro actively affect an in-process Auto Shot swingtimer. By popping RF after an AS you waste 1/5 of the buff in most situations
---
oh so your a patriot i see :)
---
thats the issue... your trying to make your language heard if not then just go play classic
---
and/or to pass time
---
The mad lads did it!
---
&gt; I thought you were just saying I was as dumb as a vegan and you had something against vegans. My bad.
---
Yeah I see what you mean. No, every vegan I know is chill.
---
&gt; I'll see you in 4-6 months. Historically Rppvp servers have had some of the longest living active wpvp scenes and mature, consistent playerbases. There's no good reason to believe grobb won't have a healthy player count besides stupidity or unsubstantiated cynicism.
---
Yep, this is actually all true, so, you got me.
---
 
---
&gt;Mega servers won't be the only alive ones you know :^)
---
Got me here also. It was thoughtless not to consider that a lot of people probably prefer low pop servers.
---
An addict.
---
Or, consider this, they already had servers prepared to release as they fill up so that we don't end up with dead realms.
---
I played every day of vanilla and TBC on rp servers and RP'd 0 times.
---
100% recommend,
---
If you aren't an asswipe you will be welcome, 90% of an RP servers pop never or almost never RP's.
---
You have to go out of your way to harass and annoy people to be a problem.
---
It's just a better class of player because mst of the *chan kiddies are scared off by ERP meme's and the stricter name rules are to complex to grasp for the rest.
---
I like what you've done, but it reall bothers me youre writing is going vertical when the paper gives you horizontal lines. This just shows determination though, so I must applaud you.
---
Same... actually got my top 3 reserved. Stallag it is for me :D
---
Yep
---
Hype got 9 names I wanteD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
That's true, I thought you meant that it was mandatory or something.
---
Plus he can dual wield daggers WITH ONE HAND. No one is gonna fuck with his swamp this time around.
---
Dropping loot on death would be a better feature.  Played on pservers with this feature and holy shit was every minute intense.
---
Shh, don't tell them about us.
---
Was able to actually get my name this time around, so that seals the deal.  I'm rolling on Stalagg for sure.
---
In the beginning the Universe was created.
---
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
---
Any guild that kicks a mage out for playing as a Human doesn't deserve to have mages.
---
Sounds awesome. If you can think of a way to be able to sort them by popularity (e.g., score, number of users, etc.), that would be useful.
---
Theres free pservers with admin commands, go test it out and post the results.
---
Warlock actually looks sick, reminds me a bit of the Lich from Adventure Time.
---
You’re assuming 100% of the player base is going to be playing 24/7 when it’s normally around 5% on pservers.
---
:)

---
I am kind of thinking of it like this because of layering there is what at least 50k on each PVP server? Even if 75% leave that is still a healthy vanilla server without layering right. Idk just what I'm thinking
---
Im so ready, got a couple veteran mates that im playing with. Names registered. Day of leave put in for the 27th, lets go!!!!
---
I got Zugzug and Dabu if anyone wants
---
Willing to trade my Stalagg names for Herod too.
---
Actually the opposite. You are charged a deposit for goods you place on the AH, you get it back if the item sells, minus a 5% AH cut. If your item doesnt sell you get your item back and lose the initial deposit.
---
Is there a way to set up addons in Classic right now?  I didn't get invited to Closed Beta.
---
&gt;I only have one month to play before I have to go to a school for 3 months, and I'm fucking determined to try and hit at least lvl45 in that month so I'm not too far behind when I get back.
---
So your answer to this is to play on the highest populated server?
---
Would be really awesome to see one scandie country vs another (as each faction) on one server, dunno what the populations are like though.

---
Don’t worry I just reserved blorgensplor
---
I got Zugzug and Dabu lol
---
No. If their populations become too small, you merge them.
---
Stalagg is for the Bois! Herod is alone in Scarlet Armory. Faerlina is a lonely widow. Stalagg is hangin with Feugen and Thaddy Daddy! Count me and my friends in. For the Horde
---
If your the first online you better grind quests hard to stay ahead of the mob
---
Just to clarify some things from my own perspective, trying to figure out where to land our 40ish Danes on a server. The "Coalition" is 90% Swedes from the beginning. They do not speak for the Nordic players at all. Lots of Danes and Norwegians, Icelandic, Finns are staying put on Shazz. They rushed to Gehennas without conferring with many of the Nordic countries. 
---
I would love to play with Swedes but this all seems very prematurely. 
---
The Shazz disc is super toxic, cause it had no mods. There is a new one which is very pleasant. Can't find link as I'm on mobile. 
---
I look forward to play with people from many countries, but I won't say Gehennas isn't a better choice, but right now headlines are being made by a small group of people and I think it's best if everyone cools down a bit. Also, the hate for the Spanish is confusing. They're a good bunch and it won't matter on a 30k server.
---
Have: "Xo" and "Slow" on Stalagg
---
Wanting: "Snow" on Stalagg/Herod or willing to sell these names for retail gold.
---
Troll druid kek
---
Classic was on the drop down list for me before I subbed.
---
Make sure your battle.net client is updated, restart it etc. Make sure you have retail WoW highlighted on the left side, then just above your launch button there should be a dropdown to select classic, you can install the game from there and launch once done.
---
You'll need a sub in order to log in though.
---
In high school when WoW first dropped I had to work and go to school.   
---
So most of the time I wasn't able to play that much.  
---
Now though.
---
I got a job where I have like 6 hours of doing nothing, and 2 hours total of actual work.   
---
I sit in front of a computer, that is capable of running WoW Classic smoothly.   
---
And we are heading into our slow season soon.   
---
Realistically I think I am going to be able to play at least 12 hours a day, while working, through the winter.  
---
I think I might be able to do raiding this time.
---
Generally every class has their counter, but there are a few specs that are just stupidly strong when played well, which are warlock/mage/rogue. All of which have access to a lot of tools, a lot of control and a lot of burst.
---
Do you need exalted with Thorium Brotherhood to buy the plans?
---
If they intend to keep their promise about removing layers, in that scenario I have no clue how they intend to handle 50k(low end) number of people. Nost alleviated the problems by making your view distance something about 5 yards.
---
Imagine 20k people in Kargath getting to Blackrock for their MC raid.
---
Because when Rule 7 wasn't enforced the sub went to shit.
---
We are talking about something months away, how do you know what it needs?
---
Oh I'm aware. It's reverse min-maxing. He's not my main.
---
Your trolling is bad and you should feel bad.
---
You are definitely overthinking the impact streamers will have on your day.
---
Brazilians don’t say jaja. That’s Spanish lango
---
I agree. Servers will be so busy that you're basically going to be leveling AND pvping constantly
---
You spelled Whoa wrong.
---
Instances all have these giant runestones out front to designate them as instances. They were used as a means to summon people to the instance. I honestly don't remember if they existed just as inert stones outside the instances before Summoning Stones were implemented.
---
Kek
---
Wait what does she have to do with WoW or does she make decisions for people?  I don't get this reference help!
---
Yea, never again.
---
Even if there was only 10k people, Vanilla servers had a cap of around 2500-3000 I think? Although I know many people will end up leaving a few months down the line, I can't imagine it ever being a problem for any NA PVP realms.
---
Here's how I like to look at it. As a caster, you're generally at range. Well at range you can't really get stunned anyway (not counting rogues sneaking up to you here) but you can get feared/charmed at a range! Plus the armor looks so much better on undead lol
---
I’ve been out of school for damn near a decade and I still feel attacked by this.
---
Wait a minute? This seems familiar, have i seen this post before?
---
I've got about 20 guys switching from Faerlina
---
I installed it towards the end of the test and seemed to be working! I'll definitely be using it once we are live.

Reddit Hemingway 8/14/19 +1
---
They have been adding new servers. Catch up with what is going on if you want to comment on it.
---
Guilty, just because i got some sick names and made them look perfect before they were taken
---
You have to envy Germany, France, Russia and Korea. Just one  Server of each type in mid- to full range each.
---
Answer E! “What happens after classic?!?!”
---
What class pairs well with Herb &amp; Alchemy? My main will be a Mage with Tailoring &amp; Enchanting, but I want an alt that can make pots &amp; flasks. I'm kind of leaning toward Warrior or Druid so I can tank Scholo runs for the table.
---
How does one setup push notifications for a specific channel?
---
I'd at least like the original barbershop where it was only hair, jewelry, and marking modifications. I want it more for the fact that it gave us more hair options. Would have been cool if Blizz added all those hair options to the original CC creator.
---
No no this is not the post you’ve seen before.Move along.
---
I got hit with a downvote bot. One minute after posting, instant downvotes.

I upvoted your comment to support pissing off the idiots of this thread.

World pvp agaisnt shit players doesn't prove anything
---
Yeah I think I have to go with Dwight as my Mage.
---
meme spec? LMFAO you'll find out in 2 weeks.  PoM Pyro a meme HAHAHA!!!!!!!!
---
That's a bad assumption.  Lots of BFA players already had their sub and got names on server but probably won't last in classic.
---
Lots of people who haven't given Blizzard a dime in a decade who played pservers are waiting for day of because most of us don't really give a fuck about what name we got.  I mean for fucks sake I just made simple not real word names in the first place to get intot he game I didn't spend hours trying popular stuff anyways.  I can do without being Thex.
---
I know they exist, but do they work?
---
Oh wow he got his name, I really thought he wouldn't get it, good for him
---
little late to the party here
---
You need to make your own groups (guild) if you want a guaranteed raid spot as a tank. That's just how it goes. Established guilds have tanks. If they didn't, then they wouldn't have a guild.
---
Even if you do decide to DPS, you should tank your dungeon farm. Changing talents once or twice is cheap. It only becomes expensive when you do it constantly.
---
Exactly. I don't want to schedule my login times around how long of a queue I think there will be before my raids start.
---
Stalagg - PvP  -   Kappa and Trihard
---
That's why we have shamans, they can spawn wood.
---
Orc on a technical level is superior, the stun resist is actually a biggish deal.
---
That said it's not like undead are obsolete, nobody is going to really care unless you are playing at a higher level.
---
Damn dude that’s really good.
---
[I drew Grobbulus yesterday](https://i.imgur.com/nGX0rOy.jpg) and got inspired to draw another server's namesake. Thalnos came out a lot better.
---
Just reserved 3 of my Horde character names on Pagle because I wanted a high pop west coast server. So of course it’ll definitely be an Alliance server - lol.
---
Rad

A. Where you usually get them

B. Our Lord and Savior

D. No. You're a disappointment.

Copy and paste for expedient question answering!
---
I’m sorry about the lines. My wow classic preparation book is in A3 format and I wanted to write it there with everything else. Thought it would be hard to make it all fit in one page writing horizontally. But thanks you!
---
French and Russian are medium so I'd expect them to fill up on release day. German ones already full. I expect new servers will come out on day 1 and that everyone who reserved a name may end up queuing more than new players.
---
However there is another thing to consider and that is players registering on multiple realms. I did in case my first choice was too full and I am sure others did likewise.
---
Nah, he just gave quests. It was you saps that did the killing.
---
Druid
---
I got Bobster, looking for Matt lol
---
I'm going to be that person.. expect to log in one day with a forced rename for Healslut.

If you're choosing to play mage solely for gold farming, you should consider what professions you want play instead. Herb/Alch is going to be a good source of income. Both classes are going to be strong but the biggest things for me are going to be the WPvP until Phase 3. I'm going to be playing SL Warlock and challenging people in the open while farming mats.
---
Ebbnflow said that resto druids were trash.
---
3 warriors? That's a fun life.
---
I hope you have fun buddy but this isn’t going to be WoW when it launched in 2004. That ship sailed about 15 years ago.
---
We are Legion, for we are Thex.
---
\#Wifemane
---
I mean.. yeah
---
Yeah I never cared about my server names though some fo the others were more fun.
---
OG Magtheridon on release.  Rerolled Alliance when Chromaggus opened (server 2nd lvl 60 priest woo).  Then played out my final vanilla days on Balnazzar when all my friends reconnected onto one server and stuck there until Cata exodus.
---
MoP was a lovely expansion visually with some great stories. I'm on the fence about playable pandas even if they are cute, but I did enjoy Monk and having that farm place. It was the dailies and reps gating access to other reps that killed it for me.
---
That one hand looks like its facing the wrong way.
---
I know, that’s why I’m sad.
---
I'm not in any sort of software anything (a humble electrician), and I assumed based on everything I've read/heard from Blizz about server capacity/capability, that the only reason we'd have queues would be bottlenecks on login/authentication servers.  With layering enabled, and presumably an infinite number of n population layers feasible on every server, there shouldn't be any sort of hold up on actually getting onto the server once you're logged in.
---
But hey, what do I know, I'm just an electrician, not a data wrangler.
---
LF Howl on whitemane or any other pvp server
---
terrible idea, if you havnt noticed, this game isnt exactly fair. It is all situational. Rogue can keep you in stun lock and auto win if you dont have a free action potion. And if you do, they are useless and you took everything from their class. It's a I win button to the I win.
---
What is TSM mate?
---
If it's fun and you enjoy it, who cares?
---
Agree 100%. Probably half the people I know who will be playing classic didn't bother burning a half month's sub for the chance at reserving the name they want. Stalagg will be high pop, Herod will be ultra-high pop.
---
Exercise restraint
---
Yeah I checked out the Mankrik discord and it's very horde dominant, so thats a good sign. A high pop server thats 80% horde will have more people to play with than a full server thats 50/50
---
Gang gang
---
Watching Asmon vanilla tank or PvP physically hurts me 😂
---
Plural...
---
Those names are definitely familiar sounding for sure
---
And yes we are Chris and Cory from Arthas! We're excited to play classic again
---
Don't for get allakhazam, or allahkazam, idk i was 12
---
Did you go to an alternate universe for those comments? Those are 100% accurate haha.
---
Fascinating, cheers for the write up and the link!
---
If you want huge pulls you need to be in a spell cleave group, because tanks can't handle huge pulls
---
As if it's going to go to a Shaman, why would a healer need it?
---
U Got to love this Community
---
Nah
---
I seem to be in the minority here, but I feel much the same way about this.  My first character was a huntard that I screwed up so badly, I literally couldn’t progress anymore.  That caused me to try other classes that I knew nothing about.  A couple of weeks later, I got the cat form on a druid, and after that first kill, I didn’t play another character for eight months.
---
I can remember the first time I saw a tauren druid in cat form (those horns, omg I must have that!!).  So many of those memories will be unachievable this time, and they were the things that kept me enthralled.
---
But I’m playing for a different reason this time.  I miss the talent trees that felt like I was making a consequential decision for my character.  I miss the role playing, working for a goal instead of having it handed to me.  I miss the strategy in dungeons, marking, cc, pausing for a breath (or hopefully longer) between pulls.
---
I won’t be min maxing, though.  I won’t be pushing to do end game content as fast as possible, or even at all.  I won’t be pushing to be a dominant pvp’er.  I don’t want the optimal profession, and the bis gear.
---
I’m going to take my time, do it my way, and enjoy the scenery while chewing on mobs (yes, feral for life).  I’m going to take skinning and leatherworking, because I like making my own gear.  I’m going to take cooking, and make campfires, and sit beside them for too long so my character can take a break it doesn’t need, while I enjoy the sounds and the rain.
---
It won’t be the same vanilla I logged into a long time ago.  It won’t be better, or worse.  It’ll be different.  But it will be the best game that I can play right now.  I’m not really excited to play it again.  I’m really excited to play it.
---
I have never played wow.  What am I in for boys?
---
DONT LOOK AT THAT ARM. I CANT DRAW HANDS.
---
Damn you spelled it right?
---
I think a lot of the concern is, what if people don't quit like they expect them to? Then we have 3 or 4 layers on a server, and if you get rid of the layering then now you're stuck with massive queues.
---
Just an example, but I think this is the biggest thing people are concerned about.
---
Not a huge deal. From what I've heard the data center is in Chicago.
---
Yeaaaaa that just isn't true, but to each their own.
---
Oof this one is even worse.
---
Intravenous tendies, just puree them up before hand. Much quicker to reheat as well.
---
[deleted]
---
have you dated a lot a dudes to get this info?
---
Damnit now I don't know what to do... Herod's overpopulation has me worried and I know my casual friends are not waiting in the queue...
---
Fuck it I might bite the bullet and switch
---
Spoiler: the queues will really be that outrageous.
---
Super missing out on the keys b and n. Super easily reachable. Should be one of the first keys used. At least b. Because your whole movement still works fine. I usually have instant casts like moonfire, bear stun and stuff alike on those keys.
---
Still quite good overall though.
---
and toilet paper, wet wipes, water and a towel. also a can of gas.
---
Peak off season
---
If you are in a pre-made guild, stay put.  But if you are going solo and hoping to find a home once the game goes live I'd consider Stalagg.  You'll likely avoid queue times at the start and have a nice launch experience.
---
I'm going boomchicken.  Play what you like.
---
HELLO
---
The Y axis isn’t labeled.
---
No. I want high pop for gameplay reasons. Lvling wont be much different regardless of the server. I'm going to be AOE farming all the way to 60 anywho while maxing tailoring and enchanting before 60.
---
Yeah makes sense. I really like good passive effects more than 1 time use long cooldowns but yeah, an Orc as a Rogue feels a bit weird.
---
I just want to heal with Healing Touch, is that so wrong?
---
Yeah I think to fully recapture the experience every player would need their mind wiped and the internet would need to be deleted. Looking forward to levelling to 60 but not totally sure if I will bother raiding or not since everyone knows how to do everything now. Part of the fun was the trial and error.
---
&gt; I mean, if they used VM's and cloud servers why would they charge us for server transfers?
---
Because people pay for it? Think of a paid name change. All blizzard are doing is updating a table in a database, takes milliseconds, yet people pay, and pay a lot, for it.
---
15 day cool down.
---
cries in perception
---
You actually think he's serious. Wow.
---
^(ily2)
---
Orcs and trolls dont resemble humans at all, especially trolls, they have tusks and war paint and 2 toes and are much much taller. Gnomes, dwarves and humans really are just humans of different height
---
Any mage or warlock worth their salt will shit all over a hunter. It's not even close.
---
My advice would be, don't discouraged playing a class that is overpopulated. I always played healers, because I felt like I wouldn't get a group as dps... yet there were always 3 dps in my group 🤔
---
Will we see Kralnor vs Thex?!!
---
Bad trolling, sry man you still have a long way to go
---
Thank you.
---
Thanks. My OG name was Lunarfury, but I was never good at being a Boomkin.
---
Have “Mu” on Mankirk, looking for something good on Herod with two to four characters. I would especially like something starting with “K”.
---
&gt;Will that alone be enough to kick me out of mid-tier raiding guilds?
---
This will never happen. No one gives a fuck about the extra 500 mana a gnome mage will have.
---
I just want to become a rich farming god.
---
https://discord.gg/8ufX6B
---
Stalagg server with hundreds of users already.
---
I don't care, I don't like Twitch culture in general, and that is bound to have an effect on the server. Having people respond to something uplifting with, "Dude, that's really a peepoSmile (or just "peepoSmile")" or something dumb with "That's a straight pepega, not gonna lie" is something I want to keep to an absolute and unwavering minimum.
---
Even if the streamers stay to themselves and don't have cross-faction blacklists, a pervasive and detrimental impact on the faction/server community, or something else that people think streamers may do that sucks, I don't want to risk it. That's my decision, and that's part of the reason why I feel stuck on Herod.
---
I may have inferred that the "stuck on Herod" was bad by using "stuck", but I mostly see pros. I wanted chaos, but not chaos spurred by streamers and their followings (whether or not it's likely to happen, as I said, I don't want to risk it). I want large clans, but not ones headed by public figures from Twitch.
---
Is that 5% number something you know about WoW over the years, other online games, or just pulled out of your ass?
---
Legitimately curious.

Yeah I figured... Probably going to switch in the next 30 mins

Orc is just flat out better in PvP and PvE from what I understand. WotF is nice, but you dont run into manyy Alliance locks and you already doo doo on Priests anyways, so you don't really need WotF, but it's still nice to have to "win more" vs fear classes. Cannibalize is pretty sick in 1vX situations though.
---
I and my ppl moved tonight. We don't have all our friends on Herod yet and we fear it may get locked by Monday at the latest. I don't want to not play with my friends for sure! Hopefully the realm fills up. I'm pretty confident it will!
---
You can keep denying it, kid, but I've proven I'm the very best. The numbers in my link are right in you're face, and not a single thing you say can change it. Get with it, you lost this one. I'm not going to nurse you're broken ego, and neither will anyone else. That's just the way of life, kid. Better learn to accept you're losses, or else it's gonna kick you're wimpy backside until your nothing but a pile of broken dreams.

Didn't you look at the schedule? The sooner he can hit 60 the sooner he can relax!
---
Oblivion Minotaurs scare the heck out of me, always will.
---
It's going to be bad, but not nearly as bad as it was on private servers. I guess it will depend on the amount of layers.
---
Fat Doinks

I completed all the quests in there on my priest and only ran for my corpse once.

Thunderfury actually makes tanks better though, so it's worth it.
---
PAT!

Quest chains that you have to do to even enter certain content. Some can be very very long.
---
As an RPer, this sounds brilliant. I wonder is it possible to make this work with GHI items? That would add a lot of nice value.
---
I am using it to play the opposite faction
---
I got it bro. And my buddy’s
---
Does that make Herod our Super Weenie Hut Jr.?
---
Can someone give me the background here
---
Got Pain. Not sure if I would switch since I'm PST.
---
It was the NA PvP realm in the last stress test, so someone rightly guessed it would be added as a launch realm.
---
I reserved my name on different servers. In case my friends didn't listen
---
I'll be rolling there, my plans for Classic launch week do not include sitting in queue. Snagged some fucking DOPE names, too
---
Mograine and Fordragon... and Kittens
---
Ok, repeat after me:
---
"bLizZaRd KnOwS mOrE tHaN yOu, ThE gAmE dOeS nOt NeEd MoRe SeRvErS"
---
I mean after all Blizzard did all their research and came up with scientific FACTS and they did the math and it mathed out.
---
Can we please ban that guy for making that stupid post two days ago? He has been proven wrong twice now and before that by the fact that Blizzard caving in to make Classic at all and introducing RP-PvP.
---
If it were for people like that who just take everything without ever criticizing anything even if it is absolutely justified we'd never get anywhere. We wouldn't even be able to play this game soon.
---
They hurt the game and the community more than anything ever could.

The Dal'Rend weapons.

As a former and returning fury warrior, I just love those things. Mainly because of their looks.

Got Main, Bull, and Glass. Looking for Ew. Welcome to trades.

---
He's amazingly generous, especially to new players! He hates watching newbies have to quest so hard without a moment of respite. If you're Alliance and ever tired, just come to Tarren Mill. He'll be there handing out free dirt naps.
---
That makes sense.
---
Spriest vs warlock
---
Spriest sound like a lot of fun in WPvP and 1v1s. I main one on live and enjoy the spooky boi lifestyle. However endgame raid spots/dps, WPvP, and the dreaded Mana issues scare me into playing a warlock instead. I wouldn't mind healing to be competitive in Pve but the spec swapping tax deters me from doing this. 
---
Warlocks are the king of Pvp (late vanilla which also worries me), great in WPvP, and appreciated in pve enough to be taken in raids. The aesthetic of warlock is close to spooky Bois, but not as cool. Free mounts are nice. Leveling doesnt matter either are easy, except for the added bonus of healing as a priest. 
---
Tldr: spriest for melting face in 1v1, warlock for wiser end game enjoyment... Probably?
---
[removed]
---
Nobody pronounces the N anyway but I get what you mean.
---
Dam, I overestimated you then
---
Oh, now I get it. Yeah, I used some to time to acquire it too. Awesome item and quest-chain though :)
---
What do you guys recommend rolling (alliance side)? I'm the most flexible and willing to play anything except Main-Tank.
---
My friends are already going Human Warlock and Night Elf Druid (probably healing at 60). We want to mostly focus on getting to 60 and not hating our lives and then PvP. Semi-casual raiding, mainly to get items for PvP. We all did heavy raiding in BC+ so we know the limiting factor isn't really class/spec when it comes to 40 mans.
---
Can’t wait to get my asscandy
---
No point in running server clusters without players. So ye, layering will be removed
---
**Looking For name's!**
---
*Faerlina* \- **NA PvP Server**
---
***Clever*** and ***neat*** name(s) for a **Gnome warrior**! All my OG name's I had from 03 beta/04 launch, are now gone and taken, unfortunately
---
Please offer your name(s) down below if you're willing to work out a decent deal. I have Hideandseek I'm willing to trade :)
---
I so but I'm always worried about ending up hating world pvp in classic as much as I do in bfa. And everyone I know is rolling over/rp.
---
While it can get you to 60 faster than questing, you will not have 100% uptime on dungeons. You'll need to walk to your dungeons, and not always gaurenteed to have the full group to dive in. However if travelling is no issue, and you have consistent groupings, you will get to 60 much faster than questing (if you take in consideration of dungeon quests/quest chains)
---
no they wont
---
i almost full cleared deadmines with a group of level 15s in the stress test lmao
---
Won't have time to raid, plan to take up engineering
---
Don't have friends to peel off me 
---
Want priest cuz I spent tons of time LF healers and I liked healing in ffxi lol
---
Want mage cuz I no life mained a mage in vanilla
---
thinking mage is gear dependent especially if i go frost?

I seriously doubt you specifically will have any issues.  You have silky smooth English, at least what you’ve shown here has been, and any problem you would have would likely be language barrier related, which you clearly don’t have.  Don’t let a few jackasses run you off from classic.
---
I got one that was previously taken on Herod, and I didn't reserve the name until about an hour after the server came online. I bet even now there's less names taken than the first 20 minutes of Herod being open

You have my sword, let's hunt some orcs

I love how the die hard classic fanboysbar like this game is so much harder than retail. 
---
It's not and it never will be
---
Classic elitists are the same kind of people who fail at retail like Esfand.
---
idk. 12 days seems shorter in my mind than 270 hours
---
But who do warlocks beat then?   They prob beat pineapple on pizza.
---
Let us know if you live through the experience.
---
Yeah, pretty much seems to be the general consensus but most people agree unless you're playing at a very high end level it's not a big deal. I just feel that Orc Rogues look/feel weird. For min/maxing at a high level though, Orc wins.
---
My guild is most likely moving to avoid the queues. Based on past experience, most players will stay with Herod.
---
Lol, I'm not playing a healer, I want to enjoy dungeons.  Healing and tanking is too much stress for me these days.
---
Is CC as important for 5 man dungeons as it was in BC heroics? I remember many times seeing LF3 dps 2 mages and a rogue. Do fury warrs get group invites or are you relegated to tanking to collect your dps gear? Thanks
---
I googled it.  You’re right.  It wasn’t added until Wotlk.
---
I was more worried about the increased damage from crit rate, but thanks it's a relief to hear.
---
Diapers? You still don't have a loo installed in front of your pc?
---
Who's Thex?
---
try both but go lock first cuz it'll be a more enjoyable leveling xp
---
Yeah horde are definitely worse mate, hacking and slashing forests and desecrating ancient night elf ruins.  Orcs are like the Bolsonaros of WoW.
---
Hot damn! I don't remember when they were added, but I always saw them as a good thing. Was it just two people to summon?
---
I just rolled a toon over there as a backup just in case Herod is stupid launch day.  My mates are doing the same.  I have a strong feeling Herod is going to be toxic as hell compared to the late coming servers that fill up.
---
thats my plan as well
---
hmmm, if I can ret to level and just toss on healing gear to dungeon all the way up to 50, that doesn't seem too bad.
---
Emerald dream was like the least RP realm available lol
---
Got the names I wanted on Stalagg. Might as well roll.
---
Everyone keeps saying this, but I don't think I've seen any real confirmation.
---
I paid for my guilds server so I could control the codec.  I had a mac, and could only use one of the codecs.  Before that, I had a PC next to my Mac that I had PTT on.   Sucked when I had to do shit, and try to PTT at the same time.
---
It’s the only rppvp server so timezones will be mixed. I am est and going to grobb
---
Saving this! Twitch app wasn't great. I got some of my addons from WoWinterface too, could that be added to your addon in addition to Curse and Github?
---
Grinding or PVP = my tunes
---
Questing or dungeons = WoW ambience
---
Honestly, if you want to enjoy quality time, dungeon grinding might not be the best idea. If you sincerely wanna go 15-60 as holy only in dungeons, you’re going to be doing the same ones over and over and over and over and over. Might get old super fucking quick
---
The nelf zones are amazing as well.
---
Goldbond bro. The old spice isn't going to cut it.
---
Linkin Park's album Meteora was probably one of the best I remember farming to. Also Gorillaz's album Demon Days came out in 2005 while farming my last few levels to 60 listening to it.
---
maybe
---
I will miss those Holiday mounts. I got the ram on my Tauren and it was THE BEST THING EVER.
---
I'm possibly interested in Disturb or Multiply!
---
I created a character on a server i might never log into.
---
i no life mained a gnome mage in vanilla and loved it

escape artist plays well with blink and frost nova, you'll be a greased pig kiting melee

There's no reason to hide your nationality. No one sane would avoid you because you're Italian, man. Just behave normally and the few people who are actually fueling this whole circus might realize that they're not making any sense.
---
A few issues with the Horde Warrior recommended weapons, although I note you didn't make these.
---
Ice Barbed Spear won't be available until Phase 3 when battlegrounds are added to Classic. Doomulus Prime also won't be available until Phase 4 when AQ 20 is available (and the other half of the quest requires ZG, which is Phase 2).
---
I believe everything else is available in Phase 1. Additionally, I'm not really sure if some warriors actually take Crescent Staff from the Wailing Caverns Quest, but I don't really keep track of what the speed leveling warrior plan is for weapons.
---
Baby don't hurt me no moar (no idea what is thex but it rymes)
---
Fuck them anyway. They want to be alone anyway. They can drift with their precious Britain in the middle of the Atlantic and sink.
---
I used to play on an East Coast server for years living in California, and honestly its not a huge deal. I am sure we can find SOME PST raiding guilds.
---
Got the names I wanted. Super pumped.
---
&gt; yet there were always 3 dps in my group
---
how long did that dps look for you? dps don't get many tells
---
healers are celebs of the dungeon quester
---
One problem you didnt mention is that layering will go away.  This would be like going from an all you can consume data plan to a 800 megabyte cap.  Just throwing out some numbers. So it is actually in blizzard interest to have soft caps on servers so that as phase 2 hits. Some realms have 3 hr login queues like illidan and malganis from 2005.
---
All I can think of is Mike Tyson trying to say sex.
---
Some low level dungeons will cause a few more wipes than is usual, mostly due to a few overpulls or PATs mixed with the smaller toolbox healers and tanks have at that level, and especially healer mana being much more finite.  
---
Deadmines isn’t heroic shattered halls though man, don’t over exaggerate.
---
Oh boy, here I go seizing the means of production again.
---
&gt;Also, Shazzrah is not just mostly swedes, it's whole of Scandinavia.
---
I never said it was mostly swedes and it certainly isn't. The "whole of Scandinavia" still only makes the server \~11% Scandanavian (Gole, by contrast is STILL roughly 8% so we aren't even talking a large difference here). Also by every poll done today, Gole STILL has more spanish people. Not sure what you're on about, lol. I somewhat agree with your last point, *I literally live in Umeå* at the moment. Scandanavians CAN speak English, very well actually  (many better than me) however they violently prefer their own language and will tend to always use it unless completely necessary. So it's not very charitable to just lump them in with English speakers. A lot of Spanish players will be able to speak English as well, but the issue with them (at least this is my main issue, and none other) is that it crowds trade/general/etc with shit most people can't understand because that's what they obviously prefer in spite of everything. It's difficult to measure in any relative sense since I would obviously prefer being on a Swedish server than a Scandanavian one, but both are suboptimal.
---
Yeah, you might ding the first few runs but once the mobs reach green level, it will be painfully slow. Especially if you arnt in a tryhard group running them 10+ hours a day. Idk how fast you intend to reach 60 but if you want that quality nostalgic leveling, might be better off leveling shadow, questing, and simply heal as shadow for dungeons when you’ve gathered quests for them
---
It was also in the list of leaked NA servers (all the stress test servers were).
---
honestly the Sulfuron hammer doesnt look bad on its own. I would imagine a loot council would give the eye to anyone who already crafts the hammer out of their own pocket.   but man would it suck if they didnt lol
---
I really hope this is a joke.
---
Haha damn.  Horde or Alliance?  Not often you run into another dunelawler.
---
Not always around in Vanilla, I remember them being added but not when they were added. I wonder how everyone on the PTR/Beta missed the summoning stones with how venomous everyone here is about LFG insta-porting people to instances..
---
you need some food with high fiber.  Those MRE's block you up dude.

Blizzard?

squishy cloth caster is easy prey for a rogue so the human racial is nice
---

---
do what you want dont let the haters breathe
---
I was only going to roll there if I got my name, didn't happen.
---
As an RPPVP player, I look forward to seeing future releases of this
---
Oh man. It's gonna be bad. If they issue warnings now, more than week before launch. Not even half of the characters are created atm.
---
Imagine haha. Would be a hell of a story!
---
Ok go fix blizzard auction houses on sargeras illidan and tochondrius mr server administrator.
---
I liked leveling with some Bob Marley.
---
I’m rolling on Stalagg! Got all the names I wanted. See you gents there!
---
I'm fairly sure there are no fly out buttons in classic. 
---
Hunters definitely don't have one. Maybe locks and mages do but I dont recall.
---
 Tracking spells are all separate icons. And for pets you can only have 1 active at a time so there is 1 ability for calling your pet. You can have up to 3 pets but 2 must be stabled at the stable master which is an npc you talk to to switch out pets. Think of them like a pet bank.
---
That's cus you are not a pro streamer 😂
---
Do it!  You're a star my man.
---
Haha in vanilla I had that much at like lvl 30, cared way more about exploring and talking to people than actually leveling up haha
---
The same way it's "humor".

It’s made up, along with every other comment in this comment chain.
---
Hmm. Agree to disagree then!
---
I believe there is a whole realm deemed the “Dad realm” I would go check that out
---
Without much time, a priest would be a good way to get into groups on short notice, or even make your own. :)
---
i was there a couple weeks ago, told me i could not play for 7 days, so i just logged onto another account
---
That's a lot of work for one level!
---
See that's funny. Because imo, every single raid tier in MoP was better than Dragon Soul. The class design was fucking fantastic, probably the pinnacle of all expansions. I didnt care for the story, but that's hardly why I play. Heart of Fear, Throne of Thunder and Siege of Orgrimmar were all so fun as current content (Throne is in my all time top 5 raids), the challenge mode dungeons made you care about 5 mans past month 1 of the expansion, and the fact that every class was both fun and viable made for a really fun expansion. I've gone back and played Mists on a private realm and it really does hold up still.
---
Just crunched some numbers and I'm not sure I can afford it. We will see, though!
---
I even felt that way in Cata for a good chunk of it too. Problem was that everyone but the final bosses felt like an absolute nobody that I had no connection to.
---
I must read about this, it will help my shitty day go better. Got a link?
---
Are you basing feral leveling on pserver or vanilla?
---
Unplayable lag for first week. Auction houses couldn't even be used for over a month.
---
Have a character specific for solo play and one for group play. When not with your friends for lvling, do activities that don't give exp like farming mats, lvling professions, or fishing.
---
Damn, now I wana watch lotr. ლ(▀̿̿益▀̿̿ヽ)ლ

Full servers are not what you think there are some full servers on retail, they are not so over poped at all
---
&lt;POWER&gt; would be all over this
---
There's a huge thread on it:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cq6c6s/addon_devs_i_will_test_your_addon_and_help_find/
---
I'm pretty sure BRE is better than Ashkandi. The proc is nuts.
---
You didnt play on a popular server. Where was your main
---
omfg no it's a killer... even if it's cheap but what fucking ever
---
burst damage is the mage job and pom pyro is that, you'll be bringing down flag carriers with the quickness. if you play it right and guard as a mage you save your cooldowns and then burst the rogue whom has been hiding behind the flag waiting for your runner to get close.. it's fun
---
Why stop there? I have heard that bath water sells particularly well.
---
You should consider Mankirk then. Your queue times are going to be astronomical as Ally on Pagle.
---
I got TJ and Biggie. Debating which one to make my main.
---
I think the takeaway should be adjust your expectations. I enjoy the versatility and class fantasy druids have to offer and I value that above what a dps or hps meter tells me. Also try to remember no matter what the try hards try to tell you Classic isn’t some crazy hard game where everyone needs to be min/maxing everything just to succeed.  Most everyone made it through the majority of raids(with the exception of Naxx and AQ 40) back in the day barely knowing what they were doing.
---
4Chan is irrelevant. There's talk of them "taking over" the server, but in all honesty, they'll just congregate to one guild. It won't be nearly as many as you think.
---
Nobody gives a damn except the less than 1% tryhards. The rest of us plebs will roll with whatever race/class combo we want!
---
There's a mega thread about guild recruitment that would receive this better
---
THE TIME WIZARD
---
What class are you playing?  Usually what you are asking for falls more within guides for specific classes.
---
Dunk and Noobs would be a cool WPvP duo.
---
Better to add more as needed than delete and merge others my dude.
---
You know what they say: once you go troll
---
you gotta reroll
---
I guess at this stage they've had what, 15 years or so to sort it out? Surely by now they know what they're doing. They're not a brand new startup still figuring out how to scale, they've operated at a massive scale for more than a decade.
---
There's a guild for every kind of player. And if you can't find it you can make it.
---
*The Earthmother wants to know your location*
---
How do you pronounce it with the n?
---
Back in classic probably Ashkandi on my Paladin.
---
Flight paths
---
Huehuehuehuehuehue
---
Go make your own post with blackjack and hookers then!
---
DNS is the problem, as always
---
True!!!!
---
You'll level faster outside of dungeons. Dungeons in classic are more for the gear, and if you're not a class that is very gear dependant then it's kind of a waste of time to run lots of dungeons.
---
Don't think of yourself as a *holy* priest. That's not quite how classes work in vanilla. You're a priest. Period. The ideal leveling build is 20/0/31 and you can 100% heal dungeons with this build. 
---
What makes you able to effectively heal leveling dungeons is not the talent tree you choose to focus on, but what gear you have on.
---
So keep a set of +Healing/mp5 gear to heal dungeons.
---
Link me one then bud. Or try it responding to any of the points I made instead of whatever that was.
---
Lol, MC is literally easier than the normal modes of current expansions once you have the appropriate gear for both, classic PvE isn't mechanically difficult. The harder part is getting to max and getting the gear to do so.
---
i never rolled an hunter but it sounds like you know you won't have the commitment to play it like you would. I don't like hunter PVE either but if you're good your utilities will carry you through. 
---
good hunters destroy people and you get the bow that won't be replaced until BWL so if you['re casual like me with kids you have the soloable char
---
i'm not rolling a hunter cuz i just dig casters too much
---
Properly/efficiently based on your subjective criteria.
---
Live, Love, Thex.
---
Yes and no? It has its uses. Your ability to legitimately delete one person ever 3ish minutes makes you pretty useful in certain situations. For example, returning a flag in WSG. Yeah, you're useless until your cooldowns are back up (or like, mediocre again, not really useless), but if it scored your team a point, you proved yourself an invaluable member of the team.
---

okay, thank you so very much :)
---
Maybe you have been subbed for years without knowing it :o
---
Oh snap, where would i find this info. i would love to check it out.
---
&gt; It's like no one wants Classic to fail more than its own fans
---
"No one hates starwars more than starwars fan"
---
Thanks for taking the time to remind me. Definitely have been upset about about the server and now name spamming posts lately. Like its taken a lot away from how this sub used to be.
---
Well, it's definitely more of an involved role in classic for sure.
---
The servers have a population limit by design, that's not a limitation of the infrastructure which is what OP is talking about.
---
Sent you a DM. Go look

---
Sorry did I mention mechanics?
---
Yeah... I mean, even when Im leveling a hunter, hit level 11, have a strong pet, lots of food, great bow damage from a lucky level 6 bow drop and more, I still **never do this quest**. It's doable. But Jesus Christ.
---
How do they do in PVP? I know priests casting makes them stand still a lot and get taken out quickly.
---
MP5 means? Also could you link to the 20/0/31 build?
---
Every weapon is a hunter weapon. ;)

I remember when the WoTLK prepatch hit I was in my main raiding days as the second best equipped Ret on the server. I never was a great PvP player but we made it to Gladiator ranks with 3 Rets.
---
That's just how imbalanced thngs were back then. (and I'll be honest, I enjoyed paying back SL warlocks)
---
It's very easy to add servers later. It's very hard to remove already established servers.

That's basically it.

---
Rogues do way more damage 1-12 because they get a spammable instant attack and hard-hitting finisher at lvl 1, while Warriors are stuck with next-swing Heroic Strike that's barely better than an auto-attack (that also deprives them of more Rage) and a terrible bleed at lvl 4.  Getting a sword early on isn't difficult.  Humans get a quest for one at lvl 2.
---
Stalagg will fill up completely, do not worry about that.  When classic releases the remaining people returning will join the other servers.  Even the RP servers will fill up.
---
VPN time
---
Yeah. The internet is a scam from Micro$oft. I only use Chrome. It is way better.

He can make a character whenever he subs, either before launch or at/after

I don't believe these were part of the vanilla stock UI. However, there will almost certainly be addons to recreate this functionality.

This guy has spent tons of time making videos about the positives and perks of druids and how much fun they are.  All this video was is a back down to earth reminder than druids pay the hybrid tax in spades because we truly are THE hybrid class.  With Druid you do have to try a bit harder, and if you know that, love the class, and are willing to do it, you will shine and have a wonderful time and will find a guild that appreciates the effort.   You can heal the 5 mans perfectly fine, and there will be raid spots for druids.
---
Hybrid tax.
---
I will bring healing candy.
---
Why stop there?! Skip straight to BFA!
---
I got Za Slam and Vice so I'm definitely rolling stalagg
---
There is an add on for warlock
---
but it was really new!
---
[Like this](https://youtu.be/7l4r2ktVY9w?t=25)
---
No.
---
Same for Tanaris
---
I dont think they should include spell batching.
---
It doesnt feel good, or at the very least, maybe it just needs some tweaking?
---
Looting also feels awful since they inplemented spell batching, not sure if the two are related.
---
It breaks the fluidity of the game.
---
Looks like it's working to me, lol.
---
Is this new server east or west coast?
---
Yeah, and this time around you know you can work on it for as long as you can find raid groups.  I truly intend to have a 60 twink, maybe even two.
---
What about those of us who fail at both? Not that I fail at both, asking for a friend ^((it's me))
---
I was/am still named ‘bigmeatball’ during legion. Stopped playing retail after that but am 110 :)
---
Just cause they have the extra gold from repairing  mail armor from raid nights instead of plate armor. Allowing them to afford the arcanite transmuted. Also they can use 2h swords, which for the most part are great for pve.
---
I'll do you one better, why is Thex?
---
Nope, you simply need to bring a Sulfuron Ingot to the Thorium Brotherhood rep vendor. Having one in your inventory will unlock the dialogue to get the plans.
---
Want that on my shamz
---
Thanks for picking me up a bit!
---
For someone with NO interest in PvP whatsoever, it really makes no difference. But in vanilla even the PvE servers had open world PvP, via manual flagging and such. For players that want a bit of everything without the hassle of ganks some semblance of server balance matters.
---
When it comes to getting PvE content done, we have until Classic closes, so faction size barely matters for that either. I guess it depends on how long people intend to play Classic and how fast they intend to burn through content.
---
Thanks to the stress test I now know what place to completely avoid! Thanks Omar!
---
Big True!!!!
---
Ah cool, so if a server is classified as "Full" you could still join it, right?

You wanted an expanation and i gave you one....They Will just have a shit ton of layers. A server could be the size of 10 retail servers or more we dont really know. also where are u getting 2 servers from? This is not true.
---
Oh boy.
---
Ha, I just realised Finland and Sweden look like a flaccid dick.
---
Whitemane is going to be insane. I can’t wait.
---
Its Government,  would not surprise me tbh.
---
I have 3 characters all on different servers.
---
I wish DiscordActionBars were ported to Classic.. they're the most versatile and powerful action bar addon that exists
---
Based off private server data. Nostalrius for example had 150,000 active players at closing and around 5,000-8,000 players online concurrently.
---
I'm really happy you got it :)
---
I honestly think the only people who will enjoy classic are the people who played vanilla or tbc. 
---
The game is so drastically different from WoTLK up. 
---
People want that instant gratification these days
---
They just... *sniffle* they grow up so fast
---
right-click the disc server icon and select notification settings

Store-brand vs name-brand
---
A legitimate question? Sure maybe in 1990 or whenever betas for games were first introduced.
---
We were alot of french Canadian on arthas, Do you remember wich guild you were on?
---
What was your comp? I found it almost impossible to kill the shredder boss with a paly tank / healer, two rogues, and a warlock. Healer went OOM before we got the guy to half HP.
---
Full just means that based off how many people created characters so far, expect there to be a queue to log in to that server at launch before you can play the game. Anyone can still reserve names on it and create more later... its mostly there as a warning so someone who is picking knows what they are getting into.
---
 that sounds awful, thank god I am single
---
BC and WotLK isn't classic though.
---
Are you saying that Blizzard will just release the same expansions over classic until we get to BfA?
---
Lol...
---
Them: What race you gonna be?
---
Me: Eddie
---
Stalagg is the mini boss in naxxramas who you must kill with his partner Fuegen during the Thaddius boss fight
---
Your comment adds no value to this conversation. Get fucked.
---
Yes, thank you, I did see that thread.  Although I read it as one guys talking to devs saying that he will test addons, not as requests for addons that we users would like Devs to work on.
---
You could get another 75 minutes of grinding in if you invested in an exercise bike that compliments you desk setup.
---
I'm misguided when you're the one claiming Classic is a bigger money printer than the cash shop?  Really?
---
Blizzard's gone on record that BfA is the most profitable expansion ever and has less then a 3rd of WoW's peak numbers.
---
And at what point did I claim there was a "shadow cabal?"  The fuck is that even supposed to mean?  Activision bought out Blizzard and made the company in charge of everything into Activision-Blizzard.  And every subsidiary is beholden to that company.  That company has made it clear that profit through extra transactions is their standard, and thus the standard of every subsidiary.
---
In any dungeon, cave, or maze really if you stick to one wall and follow the perimeter of it (go always left or always right at any doorway) you'll make your way out. Picked that up in my diablo 2 days.
---
Yea it's just letting you know to expect a queue
---
Full just means there will be a queue.
---
Lol yeah honestly it just looks and sounds weird without the 'n'. It's not fow-ten. it's pronounced just like "found" without the 'd'.
---
I still remember dinging my first 60 to the lumber mill northwest of Light's Hope. I plan on dinging there again if I can.
---
I know they have announced what is in each phase but do we have any idea how far out av and warsong are from launch? Not a fan of wpvp but I do like bgs.
---
Seems like you should just play on Stalagg if you want that name so much.
---
Have you ever played a beta and been able to keep everything before?
---
I cleared wc at like 8 years old, I think they'll manage.
---
Got some names I wanted.  Sealed the deal for sure.
---
I got Life and Armor which is pretty neat.
---
I also played on Stormrage and no, 6 hour queues were not fine.
---
Kind of a "persona" in the store"
---
These dungeons are easier on classic than pservers. Blizz nerfed the 2-shot big boi boss in WC to compensate streamers.
---
He's one of the Wight Abominations in the Thaddius encounter in Naxx.
---
Will server transfers be available right away?
---
Glad to help!
---
Oh awesome thanks! Only did Naxx post-wrath for the achievements so probably didn’t even notice the name when i was doing it
---
I did middle of the day. Chances are you are probably good.

When they are waiting in queue for 4-10 hours maybe their minds might change
---
It’s honestly a retarded meme. Was never funny. Don’t waste your time

And that's how baby dwarves are made.

---
Oh yeah already got a did that chain quest on the stress test and inmediately thought: This is Classic
---
The youtube video description helps:
---
&gt; **Maybe I'll stream it?** Or at least make some videos about it.  Been psyched for World of Warcraft Classic for a LONG time. I used to play WOW way back in the day (until WOTLK), but haven't really played much since then. Classic makes me want to come back...  But I'm supposed to be making YouTube videos about Japanese and stuff... I will keep making those too, don't worry! 
---
It is pretty funny when he is trying to click slowfall after he gets hit by blue dragon lol.
---
Also I clicked his link for earring in the video description and although I dont wear earrings I think those are pretty interesting artistically.
---
I think classic is better for people who just want to go slow and enjoy themselves.

How does it feel to be a real WoW celebrity?

I don't understand why everyone was so eager to say there wouldn't be queues. I mean it's assuming it's the login servers that are congested and causing queues in the first place and not the realms themselves. If they could just scale the realms infinitely (lol at removing layering at some point) we'd just have single megarealms of every type instead of multiple ones.

My friend was wondering why ret pallies were so weak in vanilla.
---
Best time I've ever had gaming was classic up to BC, as a hunter. A well played hunter is really useful in classic and rewarding to play. No room for mistakes though; play perfect you rock the house, screw up once and you are a huntard.
---
All the regions are getting new server, and here I'm worried Oceania servers are all still on Low pop.
---
ashkandi actually is a hunter weapon, though. they're the only class that will use it in pve. it's a pvp weapon otherwise

Tons of people are coming from private servers where everyone from US to China played together. You’ll be fine. Maybe some hazing here or there, the ruskies might camp you, but it’s basically nothing special. Most people made international friends.

Jokes on you, im playing a paladin so I can start auto attack and get 30 second power naps in every mob.  No sleep needed till 60.

9% does feel pretty low, but that's what classic.wowhead cites. This old revision for the page in 2006 cites an estimated drop rate of 12%, which is still pretty low: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Sulfuron_Ingot?oldid=279691
---
That's something you can already do with plenty of different programs
---
A few issues that is only slightly longer then world record, which was not done straight (rested time and logging out for hearthstones).  He also had people feeding him gold for mounts, Alts with stuff to send over like gold. Also you are competing with everyone at launch for mobs, bugs, lag, and anyone who powers faster will do victory ganking laps. So 132 hours may not be possible without rested logging out on hearth CD etc.  I’m with you playing hard week one but expect it to be a lot longer due to all these factors. I do wish you best of luck, you would be a god.

You don't want to end up at 60 with a spec nobody wants to play with.
---
That being said - there will be plenty of people (more, even) that wont care what spec you are and will play with you anyway.
---
So it's up to what you want out of endgame? Hardcore raiding? Hardcore pvp? Casual? 
---
If you aren't sure, then don't worry about it and just roll a character - wont matter what class or faction just pick one and run with it :)
---
Have fun!

Cool. Got the name I wanted in Stalagg. Goodbye overpopulated Herod.

I have a friend who's going to start playing classic because they started getting interested a few expansions ago but were put off from all the time and experience they missed before that.
---
Honestly it doesn't matter, classic is our home now, everything is fine.

Def interested in this. Gonna keep an eye on it's progress!

Nah man, it's much better to spend thousands of gold prematurely, and then after six months of fruitless farming to give up and sell it all at a steep loss.

You claim I'm being subjective about the same thing you're being subjective about.

You also told someone they were wrong for telling people how to play the game when you're doing the same thing.

How about you actually propose an argument to support your case instead of just being hypocritical and ignoring my points.

Some say they were the brave willing to do what was necessary to achieve the ultimate goal.

You say that, but how many times have you heard the name of the lowest pop NA non RP server?
---
He can find different friends, but he'll never be Book on Herod
---
I'm glad you've got a bud, that's even better. All the best dude.
---
So fucking amazing. THATS an epic quesr chain
---
It's because they know that you (yes, you) always make the noise aloud yourself, and they realize it didn't make sense for the noise to occur twice.
---
Shit sorry man didn’t see the direct message. I’m gonna have to pass, Herod is my PvP realm but I would 100% buy it if I had a human character. Happy winnings to your friend!
---
This is a great idea! Please post it whenever it’s finished I’d download immediately haha
---
Imagine trying to farm downvotes in a thread about gaming.
---
"Relative realm population will be visible in-game to help in choosing a realm so you will see Low, Medium, or High in the realm selection screen. If there are high numbers of players congregating on individual realms during name reservation and character creation, we will post warnings about the potential for queues on those realms, giving you time to choose alternate realms."
---
Meh. Sayin dumb shit and getting downvoted isn't hard, just lame.
---
Stalagg memes when?
---
It is I, Cato Sicarius!
---
I agree with you there, flying and LFG especially were game changers (ruiners really) for world pvp. The kind of wpvp I'm interested in only really seems possible in a Classic environment
---
You had bagnon working in the beta? Got a link to a working version?
---
Sounds like the only thing hurt here is you bud.
---
Honestly, I kind of really like the idea of it, I just don't think it's gonna take the place of the auction house. Considering I'd have to wait for someone to click on me.... and may not even make a sale, I'd rather chance getting undercut on the auction house. At least items have a chance of selling while I'm; farming, doing a dungeon, questing, grinding, pvping, etc. The only chance I'm making a sale with this addon is IF I get clicked on, IF I have the item someone is looking for, and IF I am in a place where I'm interacting with a ton of players, like a major city. 
---
Auction house is convenience. This, although is a neat idea means it's gonna take a lot longer to sell my items. I'm not gonna be surrounded by a dozen people at a time looking at my items. The auction house allows for tons of people regardless of what city they're in (unless we're only getting one AH to start,) to look for an item I have up. Instead of having to be in the same place at the same time. AND my items don't sell if I go offline. 
---
Sorry, it's a no go from me. It just doesn't make sense.
---
5 maybe 6
---
Won't matter.  For every person who has reserved a name there are likely 5 others who are thinking of playing but don't want to get a subscription just yet.
---
I mean... If they don't give u the name, then they get a best friend.....
---
looks like hes in org
---
or just come to Thalnos? its EST PvP and medium pop
---
No need to get salty dude. Just move on.
---
Swapped with my cousin and my friend, possibly my cousins friend but apparently he’s racist against greenskins and hunchbacks
---
You know you could’ve found the answer faster by just googling it?
---
I'd say uldaman or mauradon.
---
Holy Pallies want Healing, Int, and Crit.  Dmg\Healing works too, of course (tho the stat budget for pure healing is better if you can get it).  Spirit and MP5 are better than melee stats, but not needed.
---
The main point of conflict in Classic is that Holy Pallies benefit MUCH more from Int than Spirit, unlike the other healers.  What type of armor it comes on is irrelevant, as Blizz didn't put enough healing plate\mail in the game... Especially at low levels.
---
It's unfortunate for other classes that use Int, but yes a Holy Pally who knows their class will be rolling against you (still remember the arguments in MC over the Mageblade - BIS for Holy Pallies for ages).
---
I honestly doubt I have seen more than 10 people speak Danish in general/party chat during the entire time I played wow, obviously outside of people realize the entire group is Danish or it is premade with Danes. 
---
The notion of "I refuse to speak English but I will only speak Danish" is hilarious, I wonder how much Danes account for compared to the entire playerbase.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-MhIZ8qEZU
---
Just do it now. I've remade all of my characters multiple times and have highly desirable names on all.
---
"btw here is a shameless plug of me doing a fake reaction that is so cringey it might rub off on you and make you unable to converse normally to people ever again"
---
I was being a jackass and kept changing it back to Sockfullapoo, so they eventually force name changed.
---
I'm for no changes, except for this one.
---
Classic was classic only once.  And i didnt play vanilla until pservers.  By then i already had a working knowledge of all things vanilla but classic "unknowns" are not why im playing.  Im playing so i can put all the working knowledge to use and play as strongly as possible.  I admit the magic and wonder is gone but the game is so damn engrained into me that i cant not play it for any reason other than the patina.
---
I didnt like it.
---
Idk man, someone might want to be loved.
---
What does that mean?
---
It took me forever to get mine made back in the day.  It ended up being the first on the horde side, which lead to a lot of problems.  We (my guild) only had four sulfuron ingots up to that point (and it was more that we were unlucky with ingot drops rather than lucky with the Eye).  And given that no one else had one made yet, getting other guilds who also wanted to get Sulfuras made to part with their ingots was nearly impossible.  And you have to realize that putting Sulfuras on an enhancement shaman isn't going to suddenly trivialize content, so you are a bit on your own.
---
My guild ended up having to get two ingots from the alliance side, and two off another guild that was transferring over, and then we ended up getting lucky with another drop to buy the plans with.   The guild was also willing to give me the cores needed, so that was a relief as well.  But as for everything else, it was sort of on me to gather.  50 arcanite bars is no joke, and even with a friend who had like 20 of them saved up, it was still quite a lot of gold.  Blood of the mountain doesn't grow on trees either.  I ended up spending more gold on sulfuras than my epic mount.
---
On top of all that, you have to be that guy.  I was lucky, because the person ahead of me had just recently hit high warlord and had that weapon and was kind enough to pass on it.
---
So it's 2.5k~3k on each faction right?
---
Female trolls and female orc's are pretty much re-skinned humans.
---
If you ever do a lot of PVP, its bound to happen eventually. Someone will get angry enough.
---
?
---
It does not save names for low level characters apparently. I forget where the cap is but it definitely won't save it for a level 1.
---
Lots of us not resubbing for the stupid name thing. 100% going to play on the most populated server aka Herod.
---
I've got a 4, 2, 1 year old and run my own business. I feel you. 
---
7 - 8 AM: Wake up and do emails, spreadsheets/whatever is mandatory for work
---
8 - 11 AM: Spend time with kids/wife, chores and generally family time
---
11 - 3 PM: Wow
---
3 - 8 PM: Work and pretend that I'm not completely exhausted or thinking about how I'm gonna spend my time in Classic
---
8 - 9 PM: Put kids to bed, fuck my wife, explain to her how important Classic is to my happiness
---
9 - 2 AM: Relive my childhood in Classic Wow, possibly spending a few of those hours on an RP server with my wife. We've got HappyHubby and Happywife names locked on the RP server so life's good.
---
Forever
---
all good IT departments do. Its the only way to make sure that the issue that youre having on the exchange server has been within the last 3 years vs from 2010 with no resolution. 
---
Also, Reddit is better at product reviews than anything else. There's still some shilling. but they're rarely paid for it like on review sites or other forums. Good for pricing out IT solutions like cloud storage or NGAV+EDR.
---
The starter zones weren't bad on fresh private servers (with dynamic respawn active at least, not sure how many actually did this), you could literally just sit at a mob's spawn point, kill it, and wait a second for it to respawn. Once you got around level 10 though the population spread out and the respawns were horrible again
---
I find it only shows if they encounter Danes though :D
---
I'm not going to Mankrik when it'll likely have the same issues when this goes live.
---
K
---
For me, personally, I didn't play Classic and I will be avoiding mix-maxing guides because I just want to bum around and have some fun. I guess my experience will be hindered by a massively knowledgeable community and the fact that all the answers are a google search away, but I think I will have a fairly good experience nonetheless. 
---
I can definitely see where you are coming from though. I guess for those who played a ton of classic it won't be an 'authentic' classic experience (i.e. experiencing it for the first time), but I still think they will have a classic experience re gameplay. I think it is what people make of it. There are people who are scheduling their level grind, others who just want to have some fun reliving old adventures, and people who are experiencing an old world that they have been in before, but never got to completely explore.
---
If there were only 6 servers you would know them all
---
Jebus, at least wait till level 7 or 8...!
---
I too would like to know.
---
Definitely curious to see Stalagg survey, since that's where I'm going.
---
It’s not actually a bot per sae, it’s a script that just continuously presses enter and create character, that is if someone wants the name you have bad enough
---
If you’re not listening to 2000’s nu-metal you’re playing classic wrong
---
A lot of the bigger spells require you to have a certain item in your inventory. Reincarnation requires ankhs, mage ports require runes (for both teleporting and portals), druids require seeds for their rebirth. Fortunately they're pretty much all available from the generic reagent vendor present in every city and some towns/outposts, the hardest part if remembering to stock up lol, especially for everyone thats coming from retail!
---
Absolutely no way to tell.
---
Curious if there’s a vast faction imbalance on Herod...
---
I understand the Auth servers, unlike the rest of the computers involved with being a realms, aren't that redundant.  There are a lot of weird really bad edge cases that crop up that have to do with simultaneous login, all of which is eliminated if you have serial login by one machine.
---
They were the only 2 EU PVP realms until Gehennas was created today. Many people have their names reserved etc so don’t want to move
---
&gt; I won't become what I've sought to destroy.
---
Seems like someone once said that, and then did the opposite.
---
But he killed younglings.
---
If you don't kill the younglings, then...I might sub your stream.
---
Think of it as a spectrum. On one end you have an RP server like Moonguard where RP is taken super seriously. The other end of the spectrum is Emerald dream where PVP was the main focus of that server with guilds like division 7 and warsong battalion. I’ve been with ED since Cata and I can count on 1 hand the amount of rping I’ve seen naturally
---
no raids
---
grob mob!
---
Need the name TB on it if anyone reserved PM me
---
Uh excuse me... Front-flipping humans.
---
Yue and Shamed on Herod wtt
---
Me and my friend are going Horde.  
---
I originally wanted to main Priest. However, after some discussion, since we're duo leveling, I go Warrior and he'll go Priest for optimal efficiency (he doesn't like tanking).  
---
I've never played Warrior before, but I do like tanking (tanked on Paladin, DK and Druid in Retail). What I'm worried about is the number of Warriors at 60.  
---
I'm aware that Warrior is normally the most played class (every survey shows this too). A 40-man raid only needs 2 tanks. Therefore I fear that even if I hit 60, I won't be able to find a raid spot as a casual - semi-hardcore player.
---
Our whole guild (about 20ish players atm) just decided to switch to Stalagg. Yall are welcome to join up with us! Let me know and I can shoot you the discord.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/3052001050513--500253000232121
---
I think that's part of why they implemented the name reservation system. They can get a good estimate of how many people they'll have on launch two weeks in advance and plan around that.
---
I’m going to have to do this if they don’t end up adding it!! :D
---
Problem is I play WoW at a gaming cafe so I’m going to embarrass myself making the sound effects... worth it though!
---
Mine shockingly looked amazing, had the right race and class. Found that out today when I went in to fix her up.
---
The ping only matters for high end arenas in modern WoW. Remember that the server spell batching is quite long compared to modern equipment's capabilities, so where you are matters basically zero.
---
Yup!! It’s amazing!
---
Blizz already said that they expect severe queue times.
---
I think it will be a shitshow for anyone that picked the highest pop server
---
Hello? Muse and Linkin Park are essential. Obviously.
---
[Its a fake!](https://imgur.com/a/CaXHi36)
---
My autist abilities will happily test your theory, mate
---
Ah... that makes more sense.
---
Kind of sad that we haven't seen a CST default realm.
---
Thanks for reminding me to reserve the name "Kindly"
---
Sorry our dicks are so heavy.
---
Two e's, quick delete this post!
---
Stop giving away our secrets. Groblins unite
---
Use chrome remote viewer to remote into your pc and check the queue
---
Open world pvp is part of the wow experience. Sometimes you get dicks who camp your corpse but usually there are people on your faction roaming around looking for a fight that will come help you out. I understand some people just flat out dont like pvp though which is completely fine because this game has PLENTY to do with pve but if you are on the fence then id suggest you dive into the open world pvp experience... its a huge dose of adrenaline when you run into other players your level when youre not expecting a fight
---
Man stalag is looking good to me... I’ve deleted 2 of my Herod guys. Got raegar and seifer, so it’s already a plus for me.
---
It was the best day of posting this sub has had in months. There was actually more than 1 post every 10 minutes
---
Or opening new servers with free transfers
---
That cringe push to talk feedback
---
That would get you permabanned if caught, no?
---
thats the first time i see someone ask what class to pick for a profession
---
Super nice dude, like ragnarok merchant, I would love it.
---
The original wow servers had about 3k and did just fine.

Stalagg might be full by release, who knows.

😯 a Thex Podcast, a fascinating idea!

I'm going to roll a dwarf pally thanks.  My last name is actually leroy sooo
---
Do you have any video of this?
---
Grobby looking to be almost perfectly balanced factionwise based off initial discord and forum polls
---
Depends how affected i am when layering drops. If I'm annoyed my party is  near but not visible often....say goodbye
---
&gt; How do we know there are 50k on each server
---
That's a conservative estimate. There's what, 8 servers? Presumably everyone would agree that at least 500k people will be playing Classic.
---
I was wondering this too. Even just something that lets me know when non quest items are also used for a quest would be handy.
---
Careful now, Thex.  Your name will get swooped.
---
ye thats my initial build do you think its better ?
---
I LOVE MY WIFE ACK
---
Did you edit out your original post explaining how you got the name? I can't find it. I remember it had something to do with where you live.
---
Its not only tightly packed with mobs, long and linear and with branching paths, but at level 8 NE has all the worst leveling classes.
---
Druids and Hunters are awful until they get bear form and pet respectively. Rogues dont have DW yet and Warriors very likely dont have even a halfway decent weapin because they cant afford/havent accessed a weapon trainer yet.
---
They sure did.  
---
But More, MORE!
---
From what I’ve seen on Discord/Reddit, Grobb’s gonna be somewhere in the middle.
---
3k each faction?
---
Humans are weird and I would imagine that one of the reasons Herod blew up during Name Day, was because it had a high population during name reservations. 
---
Most other servers were medium to low. 
---
The High population enticed ***more*** people to go there because of the chance to have a packed server. 
---
I am betting that a lot of people will still refuse to go to any other server because they want a 100% packed server, even if it means they have to wait in line.
---
here from r/all. Haven't played WoW since WoD. Cam someone explain the context?
---
Are complaints of "timegating" what led to DLC and purchased add-ons, first as a means to skip the "timegate" and then we sorta just lost the progression of games altogether?
---
I thoroughly tested spillover rep for Alliance quests during the Beta. Very few quests levels 1-10 gave spillover rep. After you reach the level 10+ quests, most Alliance faction quests gave 25% spillover rep to the other three factions, but there were a few exceptions (The Tower of Althalaxx questline, some Ashenvale/Stonetalon quests, and a few others). On the other hand, I also found three quests that gave 200 rep to all four factions, usually at the end of a long quest chain (Reception from Tyrande, Bride of the Embalmer, and The Missing Diplomat).
---
You can see spillover rep values (with the human 10% bonus calculated in) for every single Alliance quest up through level 36 quests in my Alliance Quest Completionist Guide:

There are 11.  I mean, on this forum.  I've heard of every single one except for one server.

Vanilla mages would like to talk to you.

It's wonderful &lt;3

It won't matter almost at all due to spell batching

That’s perfect! Knowing the amounts would be nice, but honestly not really necessary. Thanks!

Let'th talk about all the good thingth

and the bad thingth that may be

Let'th talk about Thex

Split the servers? How would that work?

Yeah man. Was all Herod till this announcement. Gonna switch over.
---
Silkroad Online as well
---
Nope. It doesn't. Just a random name. You're thinking of those other people who came up with it using Texas or something.
---
This is actually quite good. Well played.
---
I totally dig the people who RP.  It's like extra NPCs.  Adds an extra flair to the server.  And I used to love an RP-PVP guild on a regular PvP server (Ironwolf Clan) They were incredible and always down for a wpvp party.
---
Stalagg crush you!

Stay flagged. All the stress and all the glory!

While I will not be playing on grob, they are clearly winning the meme war

Only one way to find out.

I may make a NElf hunter to try and kill people in neutral towns the way I did in BC.

If you are horde they will farm you’re guild in BRM
---
LF Inori on Thalnos
---
It's the opposite for me. The Horde aesthetic always bored me but I loved the Alliance. In the end we'll all be covered in armor anyways but the zones will stay the same. I prefer castles and giant tree cities over some spikes and red cloth/tiles lol
---
Hybrid class healers will be valuable to a raid due to utility. I've never seen anyone turn down resto druids in a group. That video is just a reality check on what druids can and cannot do.  At the end of the day play what you want.
---
I'm maining a druid in Classic on a PVP server because I think it's utility will be great in that environment and I'm eager to see what kind of tricks I can use to survive.
---
Oddly enough, I didn't really care about getting Quel'serrar when the book incidentally dropped for me during a DM run on Nostalrius. I eventually did the quest just for the sake of having a solid tanking weapon (as fury, you'll end up offtanking in raids a bunch), but it didn't really excite me much. I never got around to getting Ironfoe or my Dal'rend set, both of which I really wanted.
---
Lucky you. I just wasted 20 minutes explaining to my wife why I was sitting at the computer, at the edge of tears, fist pumping and saying "Good on you, Blizzard....fucking good on you.....Blackbear is a goddamn legend now...." over and over.

GROBB MOB

Boom-cha-ca-laca!
---
Now this is a fuckin playlist I can get behind
---
Warriors are going to make up about 18%-20% of the server. Warriors are still really good dps so you will get spots in raids regardless. The problem is that they require a lot of gear to get going. You'll have fun if you put the work in though. Play what you want to play. All classes are fun, you just might be forced into a certain role.
---
No surprise, you could guess Pagle would be Alliance and Mankrik for Horde. Working as intended for a PvE server.
---
You keep his memory alive and that is what matters.
---
So essentially, original vanilla wow had a baked in delay on spellcasts due to hardware limitations. This allowed things such as two mages sheeping one another, or a rogue to gouge a mage who just used their blink ability. This functionality was implemented into classic to give a similar gameplay experience. It basically emulates a bit of server lag. This delay will effect your perceived ping more than your actual connection to blizzards servers. As a note, I was getting 65ms on blizzards PST server and 40 on their EST (I’m east coast). It’s a negligible difference between pings
---
Effects are updated in 400ms windows. So when you cast a spell, it will apply at the end of each of these "spell batching" sections. 
---
This is recreating the original system that compensated for lag on bad PCs and internet in 2004.
---
If they actually reduce/remove layering the queues will get way worse. But honestly I doubt they ever will.
---
I am leaning towards being a dwarf priest as I want to play a healer, but now I have two young kids and probably only 1-2 hours a day to play.  
---
Also, I don't know anyone who will be playing Classic WoW.
---
All this to say that I will be probably soloing a lot and I am concerned that as a priest I won't be very effective at that.
---
**Questions**
---
1. Should I stick with a priest?
---
2. Which profession combo would provide a better source of income, tailoring and herbalism or alchemy and herbalism?
---
I want it to be populated. Hopefully that changes
---
&gt;  leather drops with int and spirit on it are rare
---
and you also share it with shamans and paladins. hell most paladins wear cloth im sure they would welcome a piece of leather.
---
It’s a safe bet that the popularity will die off within a few weeks. Completely fine with queue times #nochanges
---
Rolled a mage with the name Hydrohomie. I know my role on the team.

Haha, very similar discussion except I'm in bed on my phone "Uh...ok.... you should sleep and it's not that special".  I told her it's more special than her now shes not talking to me.  Oh well...
---
Cool, cool, thanks for the replies everyone.
---
I had a feeling that these modern QOL changes were introduced a bit later. I definitely recall the shaman totems being merged into Fire, Earth, etc fly-outs in a much later patch; and also rogues got one for their Poisons eventually ... but I couldn't trust my memory on all of this other stuff.
---
Hunter. I’ll take a look for class guides then, thanks for the tip.
---
In all honesty, all I did was be me. It was you guys who made it magical
---
It can be played for fun, and if you really love it, you’ll enjoy it all the way through. 
---
Warriors have a long grind, leveling and gearing. You only play Prot if you’re in end game raids as a tank. You can tank as a fury warrior in dungeons. 
---
Source: I just leveled 1-60 as a fury warrior on Silver Hand priv serv

It is, and it isn't.
---
OG Blizzard was always really good at putting RL references into the game. They weren't always new or fresh, but they were there. Blizz putting Thex into PTR (even if he never makes it to live retail) is a sign that the pulse of old Blizzard still beats, and they are in fact listening to the community.
---
I for one see this as a good sign.
---
Yes it will be mostly Horde, it's a Barrens Chat meme.
---
Oh, god.
---
I like the tribal elements of classic horde. despire having played alliance since cata there is something about stuff like the crossroads that just warms my heart. then again.. alliance has dwarves. nuff said. master race.

For once....yes. Yes we did.

Can someone explain to me I am out of the loop
---
I did it in vanilla and intend on doing so again it's the reason I do not even want to start raiding for a few months.
---
Oh wait, that was the thread I saw, that was a guy joking then?
---
It wasn’t even OG brewfest. OG you could get tickets and then the rare ram mount and epic ram mount. The next year they took away the ability to get the rare mount. So we’re in at least iteration 3.
---
Yes, it is possible.
---
Nothing is stopping them from removing layering and forcing people to deal with the queues.
---
At the end of the day, if people are choosing to pile onto a specific server despite having alternatives, Blizzard doesn't have to coddle them forever.
---
Concurrent
---
Yup. All part of the meme in afraid.
---
And I need to brawl for the skill points!
---
Ha ha ha, fucking nerd loser.
---
Just came across that song haha, beautiful paul stanley icon staring at me
---
well, i meant my discord group, which is quite large tbh.
---
This should easily get him to 50 I would say.
---
Wait, horde can have the same name as alliance on a pvp server? I dont think they can which is why it's always open.
---
Just buy your gold from China or Venezuela or wherever gold comes from nowadays. If you can afford the Sulfuron Hammer, your guild will probably give you the eye once it drops.
---
Oh.
---
Oh wow, I only saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ckdfhe/new_wow_class_name_generator/) and thought that was the origin of the joke and didn't look further. lol. Cheers!
---
I believe you could get scammed.  I purchased a name.  It was a few dollars - not like the $200 some idiots want - they're begging to be ripped off.  I got the name, the dude got the cash.  I supposed I could dispute the transaction and get my $25 back but seems like a lot of effort to be a douche.
---
For sure, my main is going to be Warlock, I'm looking forward to whatever dungeon shenanigans I'll be able to pull off
---
"Uh...ok.... you should sleep and it's not that special"
---
:D
---
dwarf or gnome. sdwarves are the master race but who doesnt love a gnome in full plate swinging a big dick. i mean sword
---
He wanted it, and the name personally meant nothing to me.
---
I'm just glad he got it in the end. Would have been disappointing if he didn't. I'm lucky to have been able to give it to him. The out poor of positive comments has been very nice.
---
Human racial Perception is great for PVP too since rogues can really fuck you up if they get the first hit in.
---
My plan is to just use Questie while approximately following a leveling guide online.
---
If Night Elves are tall humans then Orcs are Green humans with under-bites.
---
I'll admit I'm reaching a bit with troll males but they still have mostly humanoid features.
---
Agreed. I switched
---
according to blizzard 50k
---
There are two ways to make a payment in PayPal, only one of them the sender can refund. Look up which one and make sure they pay you the other way. I believe it's services/gift it something similar. It's fine if you don't accept the refundable payment.
---
&gt; hugely unpopular... due to racials
---
You realize beserking is the best dps racial for casters in the game, right? Min-Maxing raiders will pick Troll, die-hard PvPers will pick UD, everyone else will pick which aesthetic they like. UD is, by far, the more played; what that definitively says is anyone's guess, but imo the simplest answer is that more people prefer the more human-looking model.
---
You had my upvote until the last line.
---
Pet Battles. Yes I am serious.
---
Isn’t there a book in Tenaris where you can just unlearn gnomosh engineering? That way you don’t have to start completely over.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen Sulfuron Hammer go for less on the AH, but it might have been later on in the server's progression.
---
That's so awesome, thanks Blizzard!  Can't wait to play Classic!
---
: )
---
Gnome and undead racials are by far better pvp abilities than their counterparts. But if you want to play human it won’t have too big of an impact. I would say as long as you know how to play mage correctly for pvp, you will do just fine
---
I have one on my shaman on pserver, thanks to months of guild effort. It's awesome, but kind of trash for DPS lol. I've seen it being used as a Tanking weapon on Ragnaros before, since Rag does no physical damage and 100% Fire damage, the tank only needed Fire res and stam, no armor (or shield) necessary. It's a great way to make threat, spamming sunder armor in defensive stance with this weapon haha.
---
You rebel you
---
Im not 15 anymore. So I am staying on a PVE server. Don't have the time to burn being sat on by some kid with nothing to do with himself.
---
&gt;WOW! bring me back to Everquest where you actually did this. You entered the ''Bazaar'' and turned into an NPC selling your stuff. Had to let computer run 24/24 because you couldn't sell offline.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I'm old.
---
Yep.  First thing I thought of.  Fond memories of AFKing my halfling druid in the bazaar.  SoW plz.
---
they opened a new east coast PvP server a few hours ago
---
What makes you think he's employable?
---
Yup, I edited the post. I just realized that Stalagg was indeed a new EST server. Seeing as it wasn't on the list of eastern realms I was looking at yesterday, I just assumed it was a west coast server I overlooked.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
There absolutely WILL be a boom and a dip, but I agree... I don't think it will be as drastic as they think. Classic has a lot more long term potential and can addict a lot easier than the patch cycle style of gameplay that is retail.
---
Attrition is going to be worse than pservers...
---
  "I need it for pvp bros!"
---
Thanks everyone, you conviced me to roll a human mage! But maybe i'll have a second thought a few days before the release date, since undead mage was my main for a long time, (bc to bfa) ! But I didn't liked too much the armor skin aswell, sooo.... we'll see, but i'm 90% sure i'll roll human for now :)
---
This is so accurate....its makes me want to cry
---
Honestly idk either, I won't sell them if it is. I just saw the name selling tab in the server discord and threw my names in there not expecting to get a message but someone did.
---
and they did
---
Thalnos is de facto Brazil server from what I've heard

Wow. I'm not going to say this is *wrong*, I'm sure it's been theorycrafted to death on private servers and a collective of min-maxers have determined it's 'the fastest', buuuuuuut...I feel like it was written based on some private server with skewed values and a get-to-60-as-fast-as-possible-no-fun-allowed mentality. I have my doubts that it's actually faster if you're playing properly and not just skipping half the fucking class. A few major points-
---
- Dark Pact is a horrible 31pt talent, *horrible*, easily one of the worst in the game. You have Life Tap for regenerating mana, and when you're so deep in Aff, more semi-passive life regen than you know what to do with. I leveled and played as Aff, [TWICE](https://i.imgur.com/qDds4Z9.jpg), first during Vanilla and then as a BElf at the launch of TBC, and that was my experience. I actually wrote my own addon because of it, and [later published it](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info14569-Shaankylock.html) ^(once I learned I could get beta keys that way.)
---
- Spirit over stamina?!? This ties in with the Dark Pact nonsense. You have incredible health regen mechanics as Aff, you don't need to waste time on spirit. Maybe that's why the author thinks Dark Pact is great? If somehow the Aff health regen isn't enough, go down Demo instead to Demonic Sacrifice and sac a Voidwalker (but probably don't really).
---
- *Skip Felhunter until Lv60 because the quest is too out-of-the-way* :\ This is when I knew this is a get-to-60-as-fast-as-possible-no-fun-allowed build, probably on a PvE server. Felhunter is best boy, an absolutely amazing pet. Makes it harder for a Rogue to get the jump on you in a fair fight, hell you may even jump *them*. Other casters become snacks. Level 30 is personally a major leveling highlight *because* of how good a Felhunter is.
---
- Nightfall optional. As Affliction. *Optional.* That's like saying Bane and Ruin are *optional* for Destro. Absolutely mind-boggling stuff.
---
- Skips half the skills. I won't argue that Vanilla Warlock had a lot of fluff in the spellbook, but there's nothing in there that's *completely* useless. Having such a varied and versatile toolkit makes the class fun! Why would you want to limit yourself? Oh right, because it's probably faster :|
---
I'm not gonna say the drain tanking method is bad, because it's not (for Aff). This guide though...yeah no thanks. The guide mentions 'fun' several times, while simultaneously sucking all of it out of the leveling experience. Try drain tanking sure, [but-](https://i.imgur.com/vgCm7W5.mp4)
---
Just sold a name yesterday. Its nice having 2 years of wow paid for :)
---
Honestly epic.
---
Yeah. If its 3 months from now, and theres layering... I'd rather have the options of 5 hour queue, and trasnfer, rather than more layering.
---
I believe the login stuff is exactly the same thing. You can't be logged into modern and classic wow at the same time, but you can be logged into two different blizzard games at once. This likely also explains why classic is on the version dropdown for modern.
---
If that's true, classic's launch will go great. Launch for BfA went better than any expansion launch before it, and that was with a simultaneous global release.
---
Oh I'm still playing on that server. Just gonna wing it on the name.
---
nope. not even remotely close
---
Did you not read the last step in the guide?
---
"I challenge you to Claw-Claw!!"

/dance

illegal danish anyone?

\[NA West Coast\] \[H/A\] \[PVE/PVP\]  Convince me on which side for both PVE/PVP and alliance/horde.
---
**Character:** I'm maining my old character which was a Holy Priest.   I'm expecting to be a MT healer again but I'll be happy to do raid spot healing/group healing.
---
I'm undecided on professions as of right now.  I previously was a tailor and enchanter.
---
**My gaming experience:**  I've been a healer in MMOs since classic EQ '99.  I quit raiding in MMOs due lack of difficulty back in WOTLK.  Spamming heals and not having to be conservative with mana and over healing killed it for me.
---
In classic I was the MT healer and the guild trainer/adviser for the other healers.  I was one of 4 co-guild leaders for my guild which was the 3rd on ranking on the server.  I'm not looking to be any form of officer or leader.
---
**What I'm looking for:** I'm looking for a more hardcore guild that will be grouping up while leveling and heading right into raiding as soon as we get enough geared and attuned people.
---
**Times I'll be playing:**  I'll be playing mostly from 6 PST to 10-11 depending on whats going on during weekdays.  Weekends are a hit and miss due to other life commitments.
---
We are going Ally, how about you?
---
I have a NE Hunter, Dwarf Priest and Human Warrior.
---
If you are Ally we have a group of about 15-20 playing together. You are welcome to join :)
---
Biggie is a sick name, I'm guessing Tj is your name?
---
I used to farm lvl 50 items here when i was a lvl 20 hunter.
---
The steps used to be :
---
Have someone in your party afk in EPL zone with you.
---
kite a mob and get a white hit
---
bring mob to Korfax.  Other Guards did not attack mobs
---
Survive until Korfax kills mob.
---
loot mob!
---
One of us! One of us!!
---
Either. If you have the gold, **all** of the materials for crafting the hammer, other than the Eye of Sulfuras can be purchased, provided they're available. Almost no single person will have enough gold to do that, especially early on.
---
Otherwise, given the drop rates and crafting cooldowns, some of these materials will take a very long time to acquire. The estimated times required to acquire these items are if you choose to farm them.
---
I dont want to be wrong or I wasted my vacation.  Take my upvote
---
Lololol guess it is against ToS
---
full time bro!
---
Server transfers existed in classic.
---
Unless they've "Locked" the server ("Full" will turn to "Locked"), then anyone can still make a character. Full just means that there's enough players there that it'll trigger a queue after a specific amount of players log into the game. :)
---
Correction! ...that says "Voll"
---
They really need to update the FAQ here and list all the available servers with links to subreddits.
---
Blizzard does know more than you.  It's easy to make new servers (as evidenced here), it would be a lot worse to end up with too many low pop servers.
---
As opposed to basing it off... what? Every reason aside from region and type are going to be minor.
---
Fair point.
---
Yea, I have the same feeling about Herod and Whitemane. Making a char as backup as well.
---
*Laughs in Undead*
---
Wolves from AV or Broken Tooth. Nothing else really matters. :D
---
Ya I had Ash xbow and wanted the sword so bad, i did end up getting zinrohk though which is a nice consolation prize.
---
It should be "name trading" not "selling".
---
Lol. You suck.
---
It's kind of funny, and it's not like he's camping them.
---
You tried it on right?
---
Layering does not affect queue at all. A server has a set limit on how many players can play at once and people wait in a line (queue) to get on which only happens when someone logs off. Layering just makes it so people who are all in the same zone in game dont all interact together and fight for limited resources. Its like a dungeon. you dont see another 5 man group running deadmines if your group is running it too but you all are still on the same server.
---
That's epic bro, your mom must be glad you can spend your Good Boy Points on something more worthwhile
---
Bah. I'd rather be on the high pop realm
---
FTA
---
I considered it but the minimum lv required is often not really do-able so it seemed like a rough recommendation.
---
Ya blizz only has two datacenters for NA, LA and Chicago.

Precisely. ;)

---
We're the little server that could, gonna take up till launch to hit full and hopefully have no queues.
---
Heroic shattered halls mention triggered my ptsd
---
No Hammerfall. Disqualified!!
---
I believe from what I heard they are waiting until there is more concrete evidence of the servers. Feel free to check out my link above though! I am unbiased with it and have compiled a healthy list.
---
Not really. A roleplayer would not use an addon like this to play a merchant. They would actively roleplay the part. This addon is more like for people to stand around afk pretending to be a bot. In which case, might as well use the auction house.
---
Lol this was brilliant
---
I have the 4k but was expecting to run it at 1080
---
wel im not sure if i wanna go hand of rag or thunderfury dual wield , haven't decided yet
---
It will be interesting to see if people's opinions changes on layering.
---
Its easy to hate it now, but if everyone rolls on the same big server and doesn't want to leave... well rationalizing will start.
---
Agreed. Being left without rewards for leveling is a major drag
---
The funny thing is if layering ends the queues will get worse without people quitting or switching servers. 
---
You couldn't pay me to wait 3 hours in queue every day.

No easy feat, congrats! A shaman by the name of Nightkast managed to craft it back in the day... At the time, I had no realization of how much effort was required to craft it, and even then it was still impressive.
---
I do this many times a day. When I wake up. When I get home from work. After using the restroom. I have a problem.
---
What a power move, approaching a rando and just saying that.
---
It was a very fun game.
---
Things like this is what made this game great. 
---
Literally nothing made those noobs flag other than their own poor choices.
---
I would love to see the actual numbers on subscriptions attributed solely to Classic.
---
I was in a top 30 guild back in BoD that quit raiding mid prog because the game sucked dick, and there's decent handful of people that will be playing classic. It's pretty much just random whether someone will play or not, doesn't really relate much to the level you played at.
---
That from the movie set?
---
the ones near the top for sure
---
10 weeks is slow.
---
tbh the starting classes in vanilla are great, cover nearly every archetype, but the decision to have the horde be 4 types of crazy monster and the alliance be 4 bog-standard fantasy humanoids was one of the biggest oversights. TBC contributing a big-boy left-field monster-man option to Alliance and a normal humanoid to Horde was one of the smartest choices they ever made.
---
The wetlands run is a rite of passage I would never deny amy night elf.
---
Send it!!
---
How do you get that? I've never leveled a NE and have literally no idea about their starting zone.
---
Thanks ordering
---
How about letting people who have wanted  their name for vanilla for ages pick their name as opposed to putting it behind a pay wall exclusively for the wealthy, selfish vulture prick. Life will come back at you
---
yep! got it at auction on the interwebz
---
Now do Thunderfury.   Got to love 2 different drops with a 4% drop rate on two different bosses.   Our guild got lucky and got 3 left half of the bindings before we stopped raiding MC!
---
where find the wallpaper?
---
Mom? Im happily married and doing all right. Nice projection though kid.
---
Sick. I’m afraid to ask how much
---
I’ve noticed that’s around where I always stop leveling characters... minus a few talents you get you really don’t “progress” anymore after you hit leve 80. But I think if they do a level crunch that will help vastly.
---
What do you think Reddit is?
---
With increased item supply comes increased item demand in this case via higher pops.  The sole outlier items of this will be the ultra rare items.  While layering my help with supply drying out in some cases, it will also help fight monopoly of other items such as rare leathers.
---
I would say you can expect prices to stay lower while layering exists, then going up post layer merging.
---
Wait wait
---
You think blizzard cant see who is subscribing and the age of the account?
---
You also think they cant see what Bnet accounts are downloading classic?
---
ROFL
---
Man how is it that Tauren still don't have tree trunk weapons!
---
lol im  a bad ass get on my level
---
I leveled 3 characters to Lv15 during the stress test. One went Mulgore to Barrens, one went Mulgore to Silverpine, and the last went Mulgore to Silverpine but started in Durotar\*.
---
None of the zones had a shortage of players but it never felt super competitive for boss spawns, maybe one other person/group usually. I only passed through Durotar but it did seem the busiest. If launch is anything like that I think everything will be fine, although I wouldn't mind it a tiny bit busier myself.
---
\*For anyone curious the run to Mulgore takes about 25mins if you stop off at Org and don't die, which isn't difficult. The famed NElf Wetlands run is FAR worse!
---
Cure poison at level 14. Aquatic Form at level 16. Plus maybe one item quest that I can't remember off the top of my head?
---
I took the date back to before BFA launch for a better comparison.
---
You beat me to it.

I’m kinda interested in grobb but not sure yet. From my experience, overcrowding makes for an awful world pvp experience (was on lights Hope with a 60 paladin). Is world pvp just dreadful in general? As a healer (I’ll be playing a Resto shaman this time around) I don’t have much options to fight back anyways. I don’t plan on pvping in any meaningful way so a pve server may be right for me but those 40v40 fights that spontaneously break out seem too good to pass up. Man I’m so pressed about what server to pick :(

It's on the Google play store for those wondering.

Disagree. I played a lot on private servers with 160ms and it was always a relief to play on west coast servers with 28ms. Huge noticeable difference for me

There is a Druid trainer is Stormwind Park.

This is in Retail, not Classic.

I played on venture co too but by cata it was pretty crappy already unfortunately

Keep that shit on the DL brah
---
I have a lot of really fond nostalgia towards Lineage 2. The massive sea of player shops in Giran and Aden really made the world feel alive. One of the few times I played an MMO and really felt like I was looking at a living, breathing, organic city. That game had some serious flaws but damn it holds a special place in my heart.
---
Yes this has definitely happened in the past and looks to be heading that way currently. Locked means no new accounts. If you have a character there you are grandfathered. If you don't you can't roll there. They have to do this from time to time other wise the population would continue to roll exponentially  and the queue times would continue to climb into the realm of the ridiculous for those already there.
---
Ohhh hmmm, laptop it. That could be the play
---
Same armor Adam savage got and showed on his youtube channel. 
---
He also got a sword and shield.
---
I think our guild plans to roll here as well. About 12-14 of us. Watching for an official discord to join now.
---
Wasn't accurate at all from pagle. No one took into account the number of mega guilds rolling there. 
---
This is a small sample size and not representative of the whole.
---
Hey guys this is the first part in a series of 3 outlining all dungeon rare spawns &amp; their loot. Also includes mob location, item/loot appearances as well as any noteworthy gear comparisons to be aware of. Dungeons are covered from low level to high, with this first part ending after Razorfen Kraul. Hope some of ya'll find this useful or entertaining!
---
Cool do you want an award?
---
Nice
---
I'm gonna make an alt on an rp server. I've been on argent dawn eu since cata and while it has been nice (the world feels alive and no cross realm shit at all) i dont wanna risk doing that again in classic because on live guilds that try to recruit for raiding get attacked by Rpers because "why even come to this server if you wanna raid" i dont wanna deal with that autistic shit again.
---
Do you really have to stay in character for say and yell? If I roll on grob I would just be interested in the community but wouldn’t want to partake in rp myself
---
I really like this reply. I wouldent mind the craziness honestly. and the I feel it when you say massive pvp because thats 100% going to happen on Faerlina in all for that chaos.

It was also his cake day

I mean still don't be an asshole and refuse to go to dinner or activities or whatever, but just have it available for downtime
---
I tanked SM as a shaman yesterday. People won't wipe in WC or DM.
---
The one thing mythic + in retail did is make the general public better at not pulling extra mobs, and I think that is the thing that made instances more difficult back in 2006.
---
it should show the option without subbbing from what my brother (who is unsubbed) told me, can't login without a sub tho
---
The layering still does not limit how many people are on a server, it just limits how many people are on each layer at a time. When the server is full with a queue, there will be lets saying 20 layers, when someone logs out, the next person will just replace that person on that layer. They don't have to wait for a whole new layer to be made to join. And if one layer gets 40 people coming together for a raid from other layers, those 40 people dont get replaced by 40 more people in queue, that only happens when people log off the game.
---
Lvled a rogue and warrior in vanilla..fck that not doing it again, it was fun at 60 but i figure as a mage i can be and do much more.    
---
I may take 2 month to ding 60 so aoe farming is very much possible while lvling.
---
In world pvp it almost always depends on who starts the fight.
---
Just downoaded it to try it. Says its managing 0 addons even though i ahve a bunch. Do I need to redownload them using the program?
---
I legit think some of these challenging areas were intended to be instanced dungeons but for whatever reason they just didn't.
---
Jintha'alor in the Hinterlands is an area I'd use for the best example.
---
I am the only one of the 5-7 people I'll be rolling with.
---
Blizz has no idea what shit storm is coming their way.
---
Oh fantastic. I didn't actually know that!
---
That has been my experience too, at least for the last 2 or 3 xpacks.
---
What is spell batching????
---
What's Asmongold doing in this lineup?
---
Don’t let an hour or two influence which class you’ll likely be playing for months.
---
I got around 45 FPS on a Ryzen 2500u/Vega 8, pretty sure that’s slightly weaker than the mx150
---
I will do this so I can download vods later for those sick highlight vids
---
If you end up on a server with APES, you won't be able to kill any world bosses regardless of faction. You also won't be able to go for high PvP ranks, since the APES premade will upstage any competing premade.
---
Regardless these are names I picked for myself and im the one who got them. So if I didn't sell them and just used them for myself, either way the people your talking about don't get the name they wanted so whats your point?
---
Thanks. Makes sense
---
as soon as you shoot serpent sting the enemy mob comes running at you so maybe he thinks you should fire auto shot before the mob is running at u
---
 Don't forget. No Blood Elves.
---
&gt;every single server will be overcrowded 
---
I’m not too sure about this one
---
Fuck vacation  you can do that every year. Classic wow release day is a one time event.
---
Did you get your names again?
---
I cannot recommend picking a class based on its ability to tag mobs for the first 6 levels.
---
Don't pick your class based on what's easiest to tag with, it will have you rerolling almost immediately after the zerg-rush of launch. If you pick a mage you'll have fireblast and net an easy tag every few seconds, if you roll a Priest just sit on a respawn point for quest mobs and auto attack them when they spawn.
---
Don't be an idiot and pick a Druid when you don't want to bloody play one rofl.
---
How about the best of both worlds - that party member who purposely played music over ventrilo on his 5$ mic for everyone else to enjoy.

[&lt;From The Beginning&gt; | Horde | Stalagg| EPGP ]
---
About Us Our guild started in 2013 as a reddit post during Mists of Pandaria. Many of us were tired of modern WoW, so we formed a guild with a singular goal: to do old content at the proper character and item level on live servers. We ended up leveling together and clearing all raid content from lvl 60 Molten Core all the way up to 85 cataclysm with Deathwing. Here's a few of our raids to give you an idea of the atmosphere and environment:
---
BWL run - &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauUwwBeHs8&gt; Black Temple Mother Shahraz with no shadow resist gear - &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qTgZToJoS38&gt;
---
Raid Times To be determined. We traditionally raided week days at 8 PM EST until 11 or 12 with the occasional Sunday night raid
---
Member Expectation We raid in a relaxed atmosphere with most raid members being in their late 20s, early 30s. You will be expected to follow directions, be polite and respectful. Raiders will need to bring a minimum amount of consumables to raids, as well as put together a half decent best in slot pre raid set. We’re estimating that we’ll be starting MC 3 months after launch, that should be plenty of time to hit 60 and get some decent pre raid best in slot stuff. While doing MC our optional raid nights will be focused on running the entire guild through attunement quest chains. Casual players who won’t be raiding, or pvpers are still welcome. We’ll be running Battle Ground premades and our optional raids (everything not current content) will be open to all and alts.

There is one but it's not working atm and is under development.

Would you like a pre-made LVL 60 with full BiS to go with that?
---
I just realized something, are all the eu pvp servers MC bosses and all the US pvp servers naxx bosses?
---
I’ve done all three of my names, I’m sure you can do it any time now as only certain people want certain names and the probability of them spamming their name to snag it from you at the exact time you’re changing it is extremely low.
---
Luv you too bro
---
I'll be honest, I've raged at this sub in the past, I'm not proud of it, but these last few weeks have been great, seeing the memes and the excitement 
---
The waiting is killing me but this sub is making it bearable, thank you
---
I understand how layering works but you don’t seem to understand how the login queues work.
---
Blizzard isn’t going to spread the initial 5k or however many players get in before the queue starts over 20 different layers. 
---
The queue and layers will work together.
---
Nerd
---
You should play what you want and not worry about something that isn’t going to be a problem once people get out of the starting zone and start spreading out.
---
I dont see where this would be an issue in the first place.
---
Tanks and melee dps rarely compete, just like casters and healers rarely compete.
---
Arrrrggghg..... I don't wanna be that guy... But professions....
---
I'm committing. Stalagg here I come.
---
Fairbanks is RiP like the rest of these servers come launch day.
---
You're complaining about a server not being "full" when it has only been in existence for 4 hrs.  It's going to be a layered cluster fuck by day one just like the rest.
---
Some one needs to do that clip like they do the German dictator clip for Herod and Stalagg, instant highest pop server of them all. lol
---
Didn't that StoneTear guy ask how to wipe Hillary Clinton's harddrive on Reddit?

Can someone explain the thex thing to me?

You should finish your pet quest first, otherwise you'll have to walk back and do it later.

Ghetto Healthcare Professionals Minmaxing Guide to No Life Leveling/Pwnge.
---
OK, first is pressure sores. Sitting in one place can cause nasty pressure sores. Go look up stage 4 pressure ulcer on google images. I’ll wait. Yeah! You want that? Good....neither do I but that’s the future of your ass if you don’t move around and redistribute your fat ass every hour or so. Now, go buy yourself a hospital grade airflow redistribution chair. Retail is like $4,000. What? Want the ghetto plan....ok. Stick a pillow under one ass cheek. Every hour switch the pillow to the other ass cheek. Look, no pressure ulcers.
---
Ok, no about urination. Go on Amazon, buy a home catheter set and a box of condom catheters. Yeah, you need the extra long extra wide condoms...of course. That’s why you play video games for 18 hours a day. The other 8 are spent shooting porn movies. No, you need the little ones....probably 34 is my guess. If you are over 20 and still a virgin better get the 32. Don’t forget to buy the glue, it will make sure the condom stays on when you fist pump while pwning that newb lvl 20 Hunter you just ghosted with your mountless lvl 48 Rogue. The condom cath should hold 1,000ml easily. That means it will only need to be emptied every 5-7 urinations. Which is about an hour based on a case of Monster consumed daily. 
---
Ok, now how are we going to handle the eventual hershey squirts that you will encounter from a diet made of the four main WoW food groups; Airheads, Bong hits, Doritos, and Hot Mothufuckin pockets. Amazon is your friend again. Buy about 100 disposable bed pans and 50 packs of hospital wipes, preferably with silver. Also grab a hospital grade commode....this is your new gaming chair. The bed pan should fit perfectly into the bottom of the commode. If it doesn’t fucking smash and squish that bitch until you make it fit. 
---
Now, everytime you hear all that processed sugar calling just drop the deuce in the pan, wipe your ass with the wipes, stick the wipes in the bedpan, pull it out from under the commode, and drop that shit out the closest window. Oh, make sure you remove the window screen before the servers go up. Don’t want to 360 no look no scope that pan out the window while tanking BRD just make a huge shit stain on the screen and the window sill.
---
If you live in your basement you need to buy a anal cavity suction system. Basically it glues to your ass and provides constant suction into a wall container. You’re going to want to dump it when it gets full. I would still invest in that sweet commode gaming chair and just run the tube up through the hole. Don’t forget your god damn ass cushion. We don’t need any fucking stage 3 pressure ulcers before BWL unlocks.
---
Ok, you are probably getting pretty fucking sweaty under all that massive hardcoreness and showers are for server downtime. So, go back to Amazon....all the best medical supplies are always found here. Pick up some barrier dust with silver, and a crusting spray, and some Zinc moisture proof cream. Apply in that order. The cream stinks like hell, but no fucking moisture for this Rank 12 Warlock. I hope you like that stuff, because it never comes off. It’s a part of you just like that sweet lvl 60 green that just dropped off Ragnaros.
---
Enjoy your medical minmaxing.
---
And some are fishermen.
---
Is stalagg west or east coast?
---
Yes you can, at least you could in Vanilla
---
http://imgur.com/a/pSiwSvs
---
Talk to people, group with people, ask questions
---
It's medium now as of 8PM PST.
---
not much of an issue as you can opt to start kiting the moment you fire your first ability and once you are lvl 8 you have conc to add into it
---
Yeah, problems won't show up until they turn off layering.
---
Once that happens, I could easily imagine getting to MC becoming almost impossible during primetime.
---
\&gt; On that note, leveling a hunter 1-10 is probably the worst. 
---
It's absolutely awful, which is why I've never gotten a hunter to 10
---
pretty sure he's talking about missing the opening for reserving specific names he wants.
---
That can only go 1 of two ways bro cha cho. 
---
A. Y’all end up back together 
---
B. You play wow twice and she ghosts you
---
Skip it and grind.
---
Haha fuck! Thanks for noticing!
---
I don't use the same name on Horde as I do on Alliance. So each time I go back, it has had plenty of time to be taken. I'm not worried about it, but I'm glad it hasn't happened.
---
Internet is spotty but reddit app seems to work which is why I posted. I’m in the mountains of Arizona and internet is no good. 
---
I was asking for suggestions for a server tho specifically. Do you have one?
---
The problem is that if you have a server like Herod, many of us (hardcore people) will be rolling there. As tome goes on, we will have a lower attrition rate than others because we live and breath WoW. So Herod could be looking at like a 30% attrition rate, while others are 60-80%.
---
This place is a nightmare on a hunter before you get your pet,, no room to kite and when you do sometimes mobs behind you spawned again
---
leeeeroy jeeeenkins
---
You didn't explain anything other than layering is needed... which i agree with on. No where did you explain how layering affects the queue.
---
How does layering affect the queue for getting on the server then? Because the queue is just people waiting to log in. The first one in queue only gets in when one person logs off the game. You are acting like each layer has a set player limit which isn't true. they are dynamic. people can join other layers so they are not even. that does not allow others to join the server because another layer got smaller. So the queue is independent of any layering.
---
I just want to say that I love you no homo. this just changed my life, not just for wow but for all ! ty
---
Honestly, if your one hold up for Paladins is the rotations, then you're right, most classes will only have a few buttons their pressing in fights.
---
In addition to the buffs, some other benefits of their class fantasy are the classic bubble (+hearth), divine intervention to save your group from a wipe, and a free mount at 40 and a challenging class quest at 60 to upgrade it. 
---
If you're already attracted to the fantasy, you'll have plenty of fun outside of healing raids.
---
ty ty :)
---
Not going to count towards anything

They don’t count at all.  If you kill anyone it will just be for the sheer joy of it.

I played wow with my gf back in the day. Was awesome.
---
Okay for one I wasent complaining. I was replying to the guy who asked why it was a hard choice and I was telling him what I perfer. A fuller server.  
---
;  
---
and two Sure If Stalagg get Full in the next 2 weeks ill consider it. I highly doubt that will happen though.
---
Medium as of this evening. I think they messed around with the settings because everything jumped up a population size.
---
I may be wrong, but I think you have to train your pet training with your racial trainer.
---
Play to level 10 on both servers. Stick with the server where you made more friends.
---
Go to Bali, but get some Warcraft novels to read on the plane and the beach to keep you hyped up. The game will be here waiting when you get back.
---
I kind of agree with this, I found myself constantly rerolling on new servers as they came out as that was always the most fun time to me - when everyone was on a new, even playing field.  OP, you will love it.  Maybe research the class to play but other than that you don't need to know anything beforehand.

Looks like a heavy metal album cover in the best way.

***I am seeking Pappy on Herod***!  If the holder of this name reads this and are willing to give it up, hit me up!  I'll tell you the whole story as to why I want it so bad.

Go to bliz account and remove starter account.  I had same problem.
---
Thanks, this other dude telling people what's worth it is a smelly boy.
---
Finish the update that you have paused there and then restart your client. Should be all good.
---
Garrosh in Cata release was pretty cool. The Stonetalon quest in particular was awesome.
---
Its when Blizzard decided he would be a raid boss that things went downhill.
---

---
Whirlwind axe, no question.
---
&gt;There's always something worthwhile to read about every time I visit this sub
---
TIL shitty memes are a worthwhile read
---
I might do this but @ 60  
---
It would just suck to start over or pay to transfer
---
The same people who say millions will play classic think that everyone has already signed up.
---
This guy fucks
---
I'd recommend staying in Darnassus because you'll have the easiest time tagging enemies, Dun Morogh is going to be hell.
---
Watch at 2x speed, sleep 12 hours a night. Gotta be fresh for release day.
---
Unique users != active users
---
Playing on overpopulated servers is horrible. Probably one of the least authentic Vanilla experiences.
---
LOL jfc come off it man.  "If you think druids should have multiple appearance options, and that it should be possible to get PvP ranks without literally quitting your job, dropping out of school, or cheating by account sharing, then classic is not for you, go play retail!!!"     
---
     
---
Even if you combed through my post history, and even magically combed through my in person conversations, found every single change I've ever suggested to classic, and made all of those changes... you would STILL have a game that is much much much much closer to classic than it is to retail.    
---
**Not only that, but most of them are changes I also suggested DURING VANILLA ITSELF.**  So if you want your "authentic classic experience?"  Fine.  But you should be aware that reading me say these things online is PART of the authentic classic experience, because I did it at the time.  Checkmate atheists. 
---
    
---
No amount of being rude to people will change the fact that there are a mix of opinions out there (especially when you consider that most people who will play classic haven't been camped out on the subreddit for months).    
---
      
---
Some people want essentially zero changes at all for nostalgia reasons.  Other people basically want a remastered game in the spirit of classic keeping in mind the things (like no flying mounts, no dungeon finder, etc...) that made classic better.  Many other are in the middle.  Deal with it.
---
I mean, Sylvanas literally kept a dreadlord as her righthand man and we are supposed to believe she had no idea what he was up to?
---
The españiards already made up their minds about [staying at Shazzrah](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/es/wow/t/comunicado-de-la-coalicion-de-guilds-espanolas-de-shazzrah/11058). Welcome over to Gehennas!
---
Thats always been enough for me
---
Do you plan on answering my question or are just going to keep giving me notifications of irrelevant shit?
---
That's assuming there are 0 additional people that will sub or roll a toon on launch day. I would wager all servers are going to be Full AF on opening week.
---
The pros will be fine but lots of oblivious people are gonna be doing lots of graveyard runs. I think people underestimate how bad a huge portion of retailers are at the game.
---
In Classic you'll be forced to group with people because a lot of the content while leveling you can't complete solo. You could avoid group quests/dungeons etc, but I'd suggest not. Join up with some people you meet along the way that you like.
---
This. (sorry). It is infinitely better to open up new servers than to close existing ones. The only people hurt when new servers open up are.. people who decide to move but cant get the name they want? who cares.
---
Stalagg squad go!
---
I got Eren, Drift,Kiba,McLaren,Nuit and Chibi PM for more details if interested
---
The game will be much more connected now with things like server discords. Should be pretty easy to have extensive blacklists.
---
Play a healer.  If alliance specifically dwarf priest.  Always need healers.
---
Just snagged the name Lenin on there as well, I guess Stalagg is the place for me.
---
Many people don’t care about names. Of the 20 guildies, me and other person moved our names to Stallag.
---
Herod will be aids on launch day, so Stallag is the clear choice.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/EbyiNhn.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/EbyiNhn.jpg)
---
No, but for /say and /yell you’d want to surround your text in (( )) to denote that you’re not RPing.
---
Cool thanks!.
---
Nothing says alive like running back from the graveyard to your fresh corpse by three fucktards that still waited for you to get to half health by asspulling 3 mobs. 
---
Yeah, it’s about the immersion son.
---
Herod is gonna be our horde mega server similar to mal'ganis on retail
---
Dynamic respawns makes it way easier, play whatever you want, you'll be fine.
---
Gear is phased, you heard wrong. Each major phase will update the gear and instances available in a similar fashion it was available in vanilla.
---
Oof that's rough
---
Come comrade, let's raid the means of production.
---
I never checked either out of laziness sorry lol
---
You will meet plenty of people while doing dungeons , wouldnt hurt to ask a party member politely if they are in a guild that interests you.
---
Hey mate - interested to know how you make you buttons on the mouse their own keys - i have to bind them to a kb button like the numbers etc. Really keen for them to be their own keys in wow
---
Thing is, the concerns you talked about for each server, you have built those concerns up to be something that worries you in your head. But you can't predict how much those concerns will actually affect your playing experience until you are there playing.
---
My advice, do your absolute best to not think about that. Then the day of, flip a coin and play there. See how it goes. Right along with that, try to make friends with people early. That usually improves the experience and lessons any potential downsides there may be.
---
I already answered it with the "irrelevant shit"
---
I remember the good old days when the CST servers were in my backyard (Dallas).
---
My friends and I are more than likely switching. I don't think population will be an issue, people who haven't subbed or reserved a name yet will more than likely end up there. There will be about 10ish of us rolling horde!
---
Makes sense you play a paladin dumbass
---
"Thaddy Daddy" love it. See you on stalagg!
---
But $$$$
---
You think you'll be able to stop yourself? Lmao
---
No.  Not the asshole.
---
I misspoke on his initial response, I said the eye.  Don't know why I thought he was talking about that first.  Would have only been 33 runs basically the math didn't even click to me that he wasn't talking about that.  My bad....defo not one run for those.
---
People thought I was a fucking leveling savant. With thotbot and a coordinates addon I magically knew what every vague quest text meant and exactly where to go. Fucking genius I was.
---
The biggest pain in the ass? Feeling compelled to start working on achievements that I know I won't actually be able to get credit for for another six years. But we are who we are and I have to embrace me, LOL.
---
Yeah, I'm not trying to argue either. I did miss that announcement. I will be on Whitemane with large queues, but I do genuinely believe that Faerlina will be the biggest. Just looking at viewer numbers, Asmongold, Shroud, Sodapoppin, Lirik, xqc, and Summit alone all get 10k viewers+ at any given time. Then there's dozens of other streamers. 
---
Perfectly willing to admit that I might end up being wrong, though.
---
rogue is fun if you like to enjoy the game as a playground
---
and you can focus on your DPS gear when you play in a group you are never the target and when you happen to be, you can reset aggro whenever you want
---
you could also think hunter if you are looking at a new class (?) hunter is a lot of fun, different, and very independent leveling up
---
The pvp blues are solid, and depending on your class, functional in competing with some of the later gear, and if not competing, at least let you not feel utterly useless.  DM will have some very nice upgrade blues that will in some cases be close to some of the raiding stuff.  The reason DM is phase 2 is because it’s blues are good enough to make MC and Ony way too easy if we had access to it on launch.  Gearing in Classic is not going to be like gearing in retail, there will be some old content items that you’ll keep basically forever since they will be optimal in certain circumstances and finding those little gems is part of the fun.
---
I don’t follow Tipsout, but I’ve listened to him a couple times in the past, and he seems a bit more hype man and less substance.  That said, your gearing concerns are in a way valid in that there is a cap to the gear and that’s full Naxx gear and after that there’s no more up to go.  The majority of players will not get close to this however.
---
Sorry for going on and on.  Gearing for pvp is often more efficient through raiding.  The epic pvp set isn’t bis for most classes and specs in pvp and the later raids have better gear than it.
---
To clarify, it sounded to me like these blues that are too strong were updated throughout vanilla, but they're releasing them in their final form right away. I could be way off but I think it was something like this
---
Doubtful. They were added in 2.4
---
https://www.wowhead.com/npc=26111/grimtotem-spirit-wolf
---
A def won't happen. B is more likely and I'm okay with that. The breakup was amicable and I'm binging WoW either way.
---
sounds like you should stick to retail.
---
I like how you managed to be both condescending and also answered the question. Cover two people's responses in one. Really saves time.
---
Are those numbers total characters or online at once numbers?
---
Fingers crossed, I'm afraid when the 2 hour queues come around Stalagg will get flooded, and become just as un-unlayerable as the others.
---
Basically a guy made a post here about “what do you plan to name your character, I’m going to be a troll shaman named Thex”. 
---
And for whatever reason the internet powers at be came together where 300 other people wrote “a troll shaman named Thex” and thus here we are.
---
I made that trek myself way back when. Would recommend.
---
&gt; and you’re the only paladin. 
---
Even still, you are rolling against Warriors. And Sulfuras is a terrible Holy weapon, so the Warrior is going to make better use of it in raids.
---
My guess is that even with Layering, the might be a Layer cap. 
---
For example a realm might hold 5k currently without Layering, and each Layer can add another 5k. But they just won't keep adding Layers as it could mean up to 30k on one realm (regardless if they all log in with no queue).
---
So my guess is that might be capping Layer to maximun say 3 Layers.
---
So in capping Layers once a server hits it threshold no more Layers will spawn and hence a queue will be implemented
---
Yeah, this sub went from 150k to 180k in like 3 days.
---
Those google trends are insane!
---
Imagine me.
---
Day 1, Fresh priv server release.
---
Haven’t played classic wow since vanilla.
---
Roll nelf warrior.
---
Priv server has dynamic respawns.. No layering
---
Hundreds of nelfs swarming into the cave to complete quests.. 
---
100s of mobs in packs spawning INSTANTLY and just murdering everyone in sight. 
---
Ground? There is no ground. Only corpses.
---
YEeaaaah. Fuck that place. I’m not rolling nelf on release.
---
Thank you everyone for the information!
---
Let's hope so! =)
---
A fringe reference? Here? Located entirely within this sub?
---
Play lock so you pull aggro and die when your curse of doom crits.
---
Hey dude, start smoking or something.
---
This seems impractical. To sell we'd have to just sit there and wait for whispers.
---
Thank you!
---
One of my buddies rolled on Moonguard years ago just to make fun of people in goldshire inn, and now he has a lot of fun with in-character antics. It’s a slippery slope and becoming an RPer is the glorious bottom, baby!
---
No. Look up phases.
---
Yeah. I did love when he dropped that guy off.
---
But he also contrasted it by calling Sylvannas a bitch in silverpine and starting the whole "you're not orcs so I hate you" stuff
---
Insecurity.
---
If most people make ot through a fight for a boss, no one gives a shit about healing meters.
---
Lol no
---
If I could swing it, I would too
---
Nice!
---
This was stupid. I loved it.
---
If only it hadn't killed the open world by adding flying we'd be talking 10/10.
---
He didn’t mean log in queue lol
---
Yes absolutely. One of the main selling points of WoW Classic is how the game encourages in-game socialization and in many cases it's actually mandatory. I would say that overall Classic is a lot more new player friendly than the modern game.
---
Shrink me MOAR doctor
---
Same with Paladin. Only the Warrior would actually use it in a raid.
---
JOIN THE MOB!!
---
You named your dwarf after the thing that killed millions of dwarves?
---
That's my plan.  I think I'm gonna play perma-flagged.  Just someone always looking for a fight, willing to give enemies the first whack.
---
I'm completely calm. You're just not used to people giving you the straight truth since your parents probably encouraged you at every step of the way and you ended up...like that.
---
I mean, personally I won't be playing classic until after layering is gone. It's the one reason, and the only reason I've got my entire friend group waiting. Sucks, but whatcha gonna do. We wanted vanilla, and what's a few more weeks after years.
---
Yikes. Glad these guys are alliance so I can grief them if I see them.
---
Thanks this is the most constructive criticism I have received. I was laregely looking for suggestions but all I got was trash talk basically. Thank you. I have been trying to load the forums for a while to no avail. For w.e reason this app works.
---
Hey really great work! Ive been testing it out and so far its working great for me. I'm wondering if you've looked into adding support for addons from the wowinterface website at all?
---
I have Schrödinger, any interest? DM me.
---
This is pretty convincing.... a real thex on your group
---
I'm a mushroom.
---
Unless I'm Drakedog, whose still a mushroom, but also Drakedog.
---
It will take you 200 hours to hit 60.
---
A solid point
---
Calling Sylvanas a bitch was a fantastic moment.
---
She was using plague and when her what separated her from the Lich King she was just "I serve the Horde lol". Calling her out on that was perfect.
---
Like for real though... 
---
But that’s actually the reason why I first picked Alliance. I looked at the horde and thought “they look awesome. That’s probably because they are compensating for something”.
---
I know lol. I'd say MAYBE 10% of people have created their characters. Every server will be full that is currently out.
---
There should be already but Blizzard really seems determined to half ass Classic at every chance possible. 
---
So who knows.
---
Classic, don’t recall if they’re from crafting or from winter spring. I do believe there is a green BoE variant but I can’t think of the level range probably 30’s.
---
So I CAN'T park my mount on top of people...?
---
Didn’t respecing also double in cost each time up to a certain amount?
---
This most likely means they will be a maximum number of Layer's created. It wont be infinite hence there is a realm limited once all Layers are capped.
---
Cant remember the pw of my main blizz acc, it has a few lvl 100 to 110, and the email is a hotmail.com..havent had acess in like 10 year but my bnet still worked...last logged in a year ago...my mind is blank i tried like 20 pws..     
---
Found out though my overwatch acc with also a lost live.fr email has a wow acc so...o well ill roll on a fresh acc
---
Like other people said, it will only affect 2 hours. You can join a group. You can auto attack. 
---
You'll be fine
---
I like the name first and picked the race purely based on the irony. lol
---
The layers dont work like that. They are just mini servers inside a server. Each layer being the size of the original vanilla servers, so as the population decreases they just have to remove a layer to keep them always full.
---
ahhh, cheers, didn't know that
---
You're fine
---
Retail right now is specifically designed for that kind of play. You log in once or twice a week, get your weekly stuff done, do a couple quests - and you’re done for the week until the next reset. That being said it doesn’t particularly feel as rewarding or good as you might think. 
---
Technically, in classic you could do the same thing. Go at your own pace, get a few levels in here and there. When you eventually get to 60, do some dungeons, play some BG’s casually. You will be progressing your character all the time no matter how many hours you put in.
---
All of them does kinda suck, except Herod and Whitemane. Those names are iconic. Grobbulus has become overrated due to people pretending it doesn't suck and... EU names. All of them. Trash tier; weaksauce Flamewalkers and middle of nowhere Pyrewood Village are the worst offenders. Mirage Raceway gets a pass because it's a Prequel reference.
---
Even with 10k, you gonna have a good time.

So someone released a video and made a claim that if you have pre-raid blues you'll never get an upgrade for 9 months? Maybe a piece here or there will stick around, but you'll get lots of upgrades. 
---
What class was he talking about?
---
Classic is a completely different style game. Honestly it would be a 100 page essay explaining differences. Check out some of the multiple YouTube videos going into depth about that.
---
In terms of social atmosphere, it's very different and very social. Current WoW (BFA) you can click buttons to auto group and solo all the way to 120 easy and without talking to anyone.
---
That LFG/LFR/LFD system isn't in classic and forces social interaction. Therefore you meet a lot of people and end up playing with a lot of the same people.
---
Play Classic, it's a much more social and better game IMO.
---
Holy shield is huge for the aoe grind. Pop it when redoubt procs and shred.
---
30 then. But stop before 40 cause you'll get that sexy free mount and be seduced into the wrong decision.
---
There’s a bunch of us Texans and New Mexicans playing with a couple NY friends on Grob. Super stoked.
---
Twinks arent a thing at 60.
---
Agreed,  my character can be named Kdbiejnf for all I care.
---
I think classic is the perfect time to start playing. I’ve read numerous stories about people who are excited because the community of classic is different. You’ll make friends with people more easily because you’ll need help from strangers with a lot of quests and things like that. It’s a great way to make friends and enemies at the same time. 
---
As for what’s different, it’s A LOT different from current wow. Classes have radically changed, as well as most parts of the game. It’ll be a lot different then retail wow. 
---
I personally am super hyped for it and have been since the announcement. I have no worries I’ll make plenty of friends along the way, and you will too. I 100% encourage you to try it out. It’ll be quite the experience, and if you want people to play with, odds are you’ll find a lot of folks who want the same thing.
---
Does it not in retail anymore?
---
TBH I jumped on for the first time since WotLK and got a few different characters to 10 before I turned away in disgust. It's just not the same.
---
Worry about queue times when layering is removed. Not launch.
---
I hoped on stalagg to get the name I really wanted but missed getting. And when I mean hopped in I mean I probably made the first character on that server
---
Glad to hear you like the concept! Sucks we happen to be rolling different servers, but maybe if you ever find some free time you can make an alt just to stop in and say hello. Since we're right in Stormwind it won't be too hard to get right in on the action!  
---
Best of luck on your adventures, whichever server you and your friends end up rolling on!
---
Can you at least post a picture of your character pointing at this NPC like the spiderman meme?
---
Bali is overrated, play Classic.
---
Ty, been looking for something easy to reference like this for a bit
---
Wow all day and cry yourself to sleep.
---
This is one thing that has sort of put me off from rolling Herod. It has the potential to be pretty anonymous and end up with a sharded feeling, compared to a smaller server.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=1121
---
Pretty sure its these. If not, very similar model. They are the best rogue 19 twink boots, and will eventually sell for lots of gold.
---
Why, it's excellent for them and rolling out new servers to meet demand is already in their plans - with virtualization it's no big deal either.
---
Piss off, RPPvE Normie. Nobody can handle the awesomeness of the Grobb Mobb.
---
Poly full heals the target and breaks on a single point of damage.  Also I'm pretty sure we are getting heartbeat resists back so that'll be fun.
---
Herod is still going to have the most players and larger community. It's the place to be on EST
---
I suggest joining a guild that strikes your fancy while leveling and seeing where it goes and who you meet. It probably won't be your forever guild but it sets you on a path. 
---
The game will be much more social than retail.
---
He clearlt mentions the Gehennas server in his post.
---
It just means it's super high pop. There will be queues to log in during prime time for sure, and even in the off hours it'll still be near max capacity/high pop.
---
This thing owns with it's proc plus windfury. Easily one shotting people.
---
You can just adjust your talents whenever you’re in a rested area now. No trainer needed
---
Ah I didn't bother looking at the level, just the design.
---
&gt; I'm just worried playing solo as a holy paladin is going to be awful especially with the odd dungeon throw in while leveling. Is there even a viable spec to level as a paladin that doesn't involve a respec whenever you want to heal a dungeon?
---
THis is vanilla... don't think of yourself as a prot/ret/holy pali... think of yourself simply as a pali. The talents just improve the spells. a hybrid holy/ret can easily heal a dungoen.
---
That’s what you think now, but it will all change with time.
---
The biggest QoL change I would like would be the original version of AV.
---
3 servers is still not enough, not even close really.
---
Awesome! :D
---
Add-on dev here. Both players have to have the add-on right? Unfortunately 90 percent of the time it's hard to get those off the ground :'(
---
mate you can do that while 60 too
---
Seen the census? Horde got majority of every single PvP realm. And most likely because horde racials are better overall.
---
There's definitely gonna be longer queue times by far on horde.
---
They should have the servers overloaded just enough we get 10 minute login queues at least, for the classic experience.
---
Or I guess, you know, fabricate the queues. Just don't tell anyone.
---
Alli warlock is worse on average in 1v1 pvp than horde, but paladins can dispel magic and shamans can’t; shamans have tremor totem but if you’re keeping aware you can usually destroy it before it ticks. Also, dwarf priests have a 30 second fear ward.........
---
This will be the biggest. As much as I wish everyone to feel the pain we did back in vanilla, addons will assist with at least where to pick up quests on the maps and maybe more.
---
Nice that’s really cool.  I’m an account manager for BMCs Control-M and I’m always interested in how different people run their cloud infrastructures since it’s a big push for us right now.  
---
I was thinking the same thing as far as the servers would go on release since we have helped a few companies be able to implement those environments with AWS and azure especially on days like Black Friday.
---
Saved
---
You can replant a tree at least.
---
On pservers so not official. I leveled a pally to 60 and healed as ret every dungeon. Down ranking is a must and the heals are plenty. You will only be able to cast your big heal maybe 6-7 times before going oom. While you can spam your heal that is 2 ranks below maybe 20 times and this means more chances of crits also. Flash of light I usually use one rank below and it works fine. This means when you do need that big heal it's available. You won't be just healing the tank either and those other classes will just be over healed if you use only your big heal as they wont have as much health.
---
RP servers would be desolate without non-RPers.
---
Oooff
---
yeah the totem ? i think from the shaman mobs. Fuck that quest, not doing it
---
Reminds me of DotA and the failed attack sound, which was probably a dev making a placeholder sound and they just decided to never change it. [MEEP MERP](http://www.myinstants.com/media/sounds/magic_immune.mp3)

They were the single greatest example of why we should have had Classic: OSRS worked so well that it is making Jagex a ton of money, so it would stand to reason that Classic would work well, too. Because of OSRS, Classic was seen as not only possible, but likely to be successful. We owe them a debt of gratitude without them even really doing anything, because their success is leading to our own.
---
What makes you believe rppvp servers are immune from layering?
---
True
---
Dude are you kidding me? IMMORTALIZED! Meme and all! Omg! I'm so jealous that is amazing lol

Im 30 lol WoW came out while i was in high school and my parents were never gona pay for a subscription service lol. I never really understood the MMO thing back then and i was on consoles being Master Chief so missed out on all that good stuff
---
Do the private servers have the same spell batching window size as retail or classic? Because classic will have a batch window of hundreds of milliseconds, compared to retail’s 20 ms or so. That means ping won’t matter as much in classic.
---
I used Classic Codex back in the day, so I am admittedly biased. [https://willitclassic.com/view/FetfyBR3BGtqmA7vPhQw](https://willitclassic.com/view/FetfyBR3BGtqmA7vPhQw)

I ran into questionable routing suggestions with the 2 versions of Questie I mess with, as well as AAP.    
---
Best of luck.
---
Well you won’t have to deal with as many fear dispels in group pvp from paladin and you won’t be fighting dwarves so your fear won’t immune. Gnome still a great choice.
---
Sshhh, it's a secret, just like Fairbanks himself tucked away in his secret hole in Cath.
---
For sure, good point. Allways wondered how it hard it mustve been just to be the first having to figure out how to kill a boss. No guides, no DBM. Just theorycrafting and plain old whiping till you find a strategy that works.
---
And then the other five? phases come...
---
Yes.
---
If you were looking at pvp a quick breakdown so far. 
---
West coast (LA? Server location):
---
Whitemane - high pop or full 4chan group said they would be going there so expect some trolls.  Big queue but not as big as herod probably but the closest
---
Fairbanks - medium pop last I heard no weird groups
---
East coast (Chicago server location):
---
Herod - some smaller streamers not expected to be disruptive, very very high pop people avoiding streamers, big queue
---
Faerlina - steamer server, a good 30 different steamers or more with varying fan bases.  Expect ign vanilla like experience with people working for the streamers basically.  Camping resources for them and whatnot.  Bonus they probably set up cool large scale events because of their followers.  Up to you will probably be very high pop also. 
---
Thalnos - Brazil and Latin America lots going there.  Only thing keeping a ton of people from there but still likely not be that big of deal.  Maybe see some Spanish in chat. 
---
stalag - new one that just opened not much info.
---
Obviously because no one wants to hang out with a bunch of *RP nerds* in an MMO*^R^^P^^G*!
---
is that orc running with scissors?
---
No, no, and no. If you aren’t listening to “LIVE TO WIN!” on max volume and on repeat. You’re doing it wrong.
---
Telling people they don't know how to play the game is the same as telling them how to play.
---
Ultrawide 2560 x 1080 21:9
---
I cant use anything but ultrawide anymore
---
Theres a huge difference in week 1 or  week 2 kill.
---
Nobody cares
---
People knock druid in vanilla wow, but I had so much fun with it on a pserver that it ruined retail druid for me! If you're interested, you can PM me and I can invite you to the classic druid discord server which has a ton of resources (:
---
Where do mushrooms end up at the end of this conclusion? 
---
Giving everyone fear and bad trips?
---
Link?
---
We don’t move because of the Spanish. We move primarily to try avoiding massive queues at launch. But you are right about the split, it’s mostly swedes that are moving.
---
I wasnt even in the same state as my PC so I got my names for once :)
---
I’m hopeful we will get realm forums, they are a crucial part of the community aspect that classic is brining back. Without them, cross factional rivalries won’t be as good. 
---
However they recently done a bit of a shake up of the classic section of the forums, not long before they announced the realm names. I was kinda bummed because I thought they would add new sections (along with realm forums) after the announcement of the realm names, not before.
---
Yeah got it down to Mage or Warrior so far. Ive been on the fence for so long on which class to start with but Mage is the front runner so far.
---
Too edgy for me bro.
---
Streamers are definitely going to stay away from Herod now!
---
Me and one other Horde.  Maybe one more.
---
Watch his other content he gives plenty of praise to the class.
---
This. I'm only following the development so see where to go to avoid everyone.

Use translate. They're extremely conflicted. Some are butthurt because they're being asked by the leaders to speak English or refrain from speaking in official channels at all. Hurt pride or smth.

The wording doesn’t indicate to me that they are incapable of adding the keyring or that they don’t have it working. Rather it comes across as an intentional decision to not have the key ring until phase 2, I assume thats what he means by first patch. Not some hotfix patch of stuff they know they need to fix but for some reason won’t fix before release.
---
Nope
---
This sounds awesome
---
In retail, when you want to run a dungeon or raid, you press a button and are teleported inside the dungeon with random people from other servers. You'll finish the dungeon in half an hour. Then you are teleported to where you were and you will never see from that group ever again. So there's no need to talk to those people. Pretend their robots, I'm mean whats the difference?
---
In classic you'll be in a city asking around for people to join you for a dungeon. Once the party is assembled everyone rides out together to the dungeon a continent away. On pvp servers you might run into the other faction and have fight or slip by and into the dungeon (Scarlet Monastery for the Alliance). After an hour the dungeon will be completed, and you'll use you home teleport to get back. Maybe you made a acquiescence or two and added them to your friends list, or were invited to a guild. Reputation matters since you always play with people from the same server.
---
Classic is a slower game, but that downtime is to interact with other people and get to know them. You can solo the game to 60 but classic heavily encourages group play.
---
I took that day off.  Might just stay up late Monday night and sleep late to hopefully sleep through the maintenance.  
---
Heres to hoping blizz tells us when its going to be the night before so we can plan ahead.

I believe the Void Walker does considerably less damage on Classic, versus Pservers. It was closer to Succubus damage numbers.

I looked up spell batching but it’s not making much sense to me honestly. So anything under 200ms won’t matter? I looked up a post where blizzard said their spell batching will be 200ms

This would be... Like a huge immersion killer, surely? Classic WoW had a very clear Alliance/Horde divide, anything that blurs that line would genuinely really bother me, and I've been playing on an RP server since I started playing...

Ya it's a very lackluster racial. It gets better in arenas because you KNOW there's a stealthers somewhere. Out in the world? Or on a BG? There's just way too much space.

im 25 tho.

Because no more players will sign up on launch day 😂

Faerlina looks deceivingly less autistic than it should .....

The alliance/horde divide was a lot more clear in Wrath imo.

In vanilla it feels more like a cold war scenario save for like ashenvale and hillsbrad where there is outright conflict.
---

Or all the people who don't want to be queued for 8 hours on launch day and decided to make the swap.

I think you're underestimating the amount of people who literally don't give a damn about streaming or twitch related and just want to play the game. Everyone was simply pigeon holed into Herod from Faerlina being 'streamer' server and Thalnos South American. Stalagg is great auxiliary and I predict Stalagg and Herod equalizing if not Stalagg filling and ANOTHER server popping up closer to launch or post launch.
---
the best spec is ele resto 30/0/21, and any heals is welcome without gear, but shamans have to facetank damage and if they have bad stamina/armour they'll get eaten alive.

i tested it on the stresstest. a fried of mine then tried to change something cause one of the problems was that the combatlog changed and the addon reads the combatlog. after he changed it the addon would load but it would produce like 10k errors per min. i didnt create an issue on the gidhub because the addon maker doesnt make that addon anymore. on top of that he would have most likly updated the newest version of the addon and i prefer the first version of it. he somehow managed to make the addon worse over time

how are we supost to join then?

I did, but didn't get the name I wanted. I \*did\* get the name I wanted on a different server, but now that poor guy is all the way over there by himself.

Lol this fool tried to gank me and I fuckin destroyed him 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/nekrage
---
Yeah every server that has been announced will be High or Full by launch day. Calling it now.
---
Hard disagree, mate. There are multiple quests that reference heavy hostilities between the factions, including quests that require you to kill mobs designated as the opposing faction.
---
Zones that include references to extreme hostility between the Horde/Alliance are: Desolace, Feralas, Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountains, Hillsbrad Foothills, Badlands, Silithus (in later patches), The Barrens.
---
How much does it take before it's playable?
---
I know im leveling Lock and only a Lock. For one Mages are very popular, which means. Gear Competition. I have alot less for tier gear and other important peices like Shadow Wrath greens for preraid. Im also loving the utility. promised raid slots because i bring summons, Curse of Elements, health/soul stones, and stuff like that.
---
Mages are too popular, for good reason of course. Locks are cool
---
I urge you not to read too much into what tips out said. The dude really doesn't know the game very well and he's notorious for spouting false leaks, misinformation, etc as fact.
---
That said, items are going to be in their 1.12 states once they are available. Some notes will be better than mc gear. That's okay, you'll still want mc gear.
---
Lol yup, I try to make my peace with it as I slave away doing a job i hate for chicken feed.
---
This is the best answer in my opinion. The laptop suggestion is genius too.
---
Addon looks amazing! Keep up the work! I will definitely give this a try! 
---
I saw you mention in another comment that you just got into making addons last weekend, have you found any good resources like PDFs or books besides the API? Besides that, would you say it’s pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it?
---
I started reading up these past few days but I haven’t fully jumped in yet lol
---
Classic db is based on private server data, not vanilla
---
It got patched like one day after the stress stest started.
---
There's some really good fan made trailers for classic.

No raider uses LFR though, it should be sitting on the bank roof and typing 1 for summons
---
I really don't get this whole obsession with story telling in retail for the past few xpacks. It feels like "sex and the city but with axes". Why does it matter how Sylvanas is "written"? The whole point of an MMO is to create the story yourself with friends, no? Not just observe some weirdly written drama like riding through the haunted house in an amusement park.
---
All low servers turned to medium when stalagg got added, because the populations are relative to eachother.
---
I've never understood wanting to roleplay as a human, but you do you
---
Google's search engine data is indexed to 100 here. The graph shows that the term 'classic wow' is being searched \~8 times more now than it was around July 11 for instance.
---
Chicago is CST.
---
I’ve managed to get 6 friends who have never played classic to get a sub now and reserve their names. I think it’ll be huge
---
haha ofc not :)
---
This was so much more effort
---
What makes it bad for warriors?
---
Sorry.. been watching a ton of leveling guides
---
Of course I play with both hands. I think it's stupid to put your most used button, pet attack/recall on a bind that requires two hands to operate. How about 1. Or Mouse back. lol..
---
Thunderfury is going to my rogue.
---
It is my channel bud, didn't see someone had linked it already.  Appreciate you.

Next Wednesday if we get one
---

---
Umm. Who is Thex?
---
Unblanced servers are not nearly as fun as a balanced one.
---
I was on the stress test, and I felt like having more people around made it worse. With dynamic respawns, they were popping up almost instantly. Once you died, you were fucked. Impossible to tez and run out.
---
tf is also a massive upgrade for tanks for threat and dps guys as well
---
i used mine as mt well into BC raids because there was just nothing that beat it for holding aggro.
---
sulfuras isnt even better than a lot of 2hers available when your guild is likely to get one
---
as you said, rotations are mostly very simplistic. the most complex rotation is probably hunter. that being said paladins are great in pvp, and top nothc healers in pve, also blessings are very useful.
---
I don't think Ninja is playing/streaming Classic anymore. Epic probably dropped him a few Mil to not do it.
---
I'd like to see one of these for each legendary.
---
Paladin is objectively better than Shaman
---
Fight me in front of the Superdome if you disagree
---
Yup... we moved and did the exact same thing. Hell we're only 3 days into launch and the game isn't even out Stalagg will go high or full. Especially imagine the people who haven't even subbed yet.
---
As an allience player, it do be like that tho
---
So how much does the Sulfuron Hammer sell for on the AH generally?
---
Same!
---
Druid is really good. Instead of rezzing people after they die, you can NS them and just keep them alive.
---
Kalonline as well.
---
This has to be satire guys
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA... wait one more time AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
except in private servers everyone is on the same layer, as to how aggressive blizz will be with layering on day 1, only blizz knows. The stress test was doable, so hopefully it'd be like that.
---
You must have been real good at drawing penises in middle school. *Looks at fingers*
---
Can’t you not drink pots in forms though?
---
Doing push-ups or sit ups during flight paths works really good also.

FAIL LIST
---
There is a difference between when a server says full/high etc on the side and what its actual limit is. The description on the side of each server like full is just an indicator of how many accounts have characters on the server. It is strictly there to tell new players picking a server or changing servers that its high population or low population. It doesn't mean anything about how full the server is with people logged in at the moment. My vanilla server was medium back in the day and it had queues constantly. Just look at the Classic servers, mostly all say high or full yet not one person is in the game. Blizzard, based off what the hardware can handle, sets what the maximum players is. The whole purpose of the stress tests is to see where they can set that max number at and to make sure the layering did what it could to limit the clogging of players in single layers. The only way you ever know a server is full is if there is a queue.
---
Yes, a queue can be used to alleviate the pressure off the server in that situation, but that's why blizzard sets the limit, to avoid putting their hardware in that spot. The only time a mad rush like that will ever happen is on launch which is why they watch it carefully and they might batch players into the game manually increasing the cap from like 50% up to 100% but that not layering, that's just Blizz staff tweaking it.
---
There will definitely be more servers to come.
---
I doubt many BLOOMERS will be on any server
---
There will be lots of new players, and lots of old players excited to help new players learn and experience the game
---
No idea about the numbers, seems like the actual spanish "coalition" refuses to even talk about it either.  
---
Early on I heard 40 guilds going to Golemagg. Then they were going to Shazzrah, then apparently only half when to Shazz and half to Golemagg.  
---
tl;dr, no one fucking knows and the Spanish won't tell us.
---
I think it’s clear that CST+EST is significantly bigger than PST
---
Correct. Pet quests are race locked.
---
It is really cool, but I think the challenge is getting others to install it. 
---
I think a cool feature you could add that may help with that part (but may already exists) is to have it keep track of WTS requests in trade. Then have a good interface for filtering and displaying that info.
---
You could also add whisper commands. Where someone can whisper you that does not have the mod and you could auto respond with items and prices. This will help raise awareness of the mod and in a way help people discover it.
---
Anyway, keep up the good work. I like the way it looks and it's a solid plan idea.
---
I smell Thex and candy.
---
Yup, it happened on my server back in the day. Alliance druid on Greymane. I remember the dude being a massive forum troll, so this made it even worst.
---
Stone talon was a mistake. The creator thought they were going to redeem Garosh and that’s why he acts honorable there.
---
What class is best for a younger kid to play well? Simple rotation? They want to be a Druid, should I just go with it....?
---
If I was a chef you think I would know whats inside your kitchen? 
---
Thats the better comparison server guy
---
*only true in pvp, in pve hunters start doing mediocre - bad pretty quickly after molten core.
---
I am hoping to get on Stalagg as well.
---

Sure. Why not. She is also secretly a Goblin who crafted the Mana Bomb

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cql4n7/for_the_horde_crummy_thing_i_did_in_anticipation/). 
---
Lol no. Do you really think people cared more about their characters on shitty private servers when there was a new fresh launching a few months later?
---
This isnt even up for debate, attrition on pservers was way worse than youre going to experience on official blizzard servers
---
Let’s go!
---
Just go watch the latest video from Ebbnflow that should make you reconsider since you're not determined to play a druid.
---
Well there’s no Draenei yet sooo
---
*FUTA female night elves*
---
Level 10-11 with bear form is easy mode in there.
---
why would anyone play on a ROLEPLAY server....
---
Plus it was an absolute fucking *hellscape* unless you were Alliance. Until war mode became a thing, it was almost unplayable as horde. I swear, people made ganking and camping a *career* there.
---
Well, it offers no benefits, you get no holidays off, you get paid minimum wage, and most of the time you have to work a split shift schedule.   
---
But yeah, if you are going nowhere in life anyway you might as well go there from the comfort of a desk and 15 year old MMOs.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cpqk9z/does_anyone_know_where_the_different_eu_servers/)
---
Mm yea I have a feeling we’re not done adding servers
---
The great thing about Vanilla is bs like this will be called out and dealt with. Hopefully this priest does not pick the same name for live classic.
---
Do you know if there are spanish subreddits i could try? If we could get some numbers on this and show them to blizzard i think it could help convincing them.
---
Healer is always more valued. No question there
---
PvE: yes, id like to see hardcore players trying 
---
PvP: meh
---
Even then some of the quests you have to read the whole background story to get just a tiny hint and you have to wander around an area aimlessly until you happen upon what you need to do.
---
That resist tho
---
Its a real shame the best part of Garrosh's character arc was a mistake.

[An anagram for Fairbanks is Brains AFK](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cql4cq/when_you_realize_the_server_name_fairbanks_is_an/?)

Our whole guild made the switch.  About 20 people.  Fuck queues.
---
Why doesn't that Orc have back problems?
---
All hunters. That way every time something drops, at least one of you can use it.
---
I absolutely refuse to roll Alliance characters.
---
I'm just not interested in any of the races at all. Human, Pointy Human, Mini Human, Mini Mini Human
---
NTA for being conflicted. Definitely an asshole if you don’t go.
---
What you’ve had happen is extremely lucky. Think about it; you already have the time off to go on an amazing adventure with the people you love. Thanks to the power of the internet you’re almost guaranteed to be able to play with your friend while you’re there too, albeit not nearly as much as you were hoping for.
---
That said, this is win-win-win. Your family gets to have you along, your friend gets to play some WoW with you, and YOU get to go to Bali with your family *and* experience the thrill of the launch of Classic WoW while you’re there! How crazy is that?!
---
You do have to be up front about it with everyone. about it though, and set firm but fair expectations. “I will be going to Bali, and I will be playing some WoW when I’m there.”
---
Have fun!!
---
Ditto
---
... in an MMO**RPG**

Mudvayne - Lost &amp; Found on repeat?

---
I don't know, not even sure if there are any discords, most of the links we've gotten a hold of were from the official WoW forums.
---
And both of those were just basically "The Spanish Coalition decided to go to &lt;x&gt; server" with a list of guilds.

Including guilds called "Autismo" and shit like that.

I picked east coast for this exact reason, time zones

They look amazing tho, dont be afraid to rock a tauren hunter friend

Well, what do you know. A couple of days after the name registration and blizz start opening new realms... :P
---
Your need to express this tells me you must be insecure.
---
Watching these guys get stream sniped is very satisfying.  I am new to wow and been playing private servers, the game kind of has this stealth action aspect to it especially attacking quest caves and stuff too.  Seems like streamers will need personal armies to stay alive.  Might make some really interesting fight videos.
---
The priest starting weapon has a 1.0 attack speed. Just tag it with a melee.
---
Why are you surprised the name was available and why would someone want that name?
---
I mean, there's way more EST/CST players than PST. Blizzard clearly knows this and that's why it's EST.
---
[They don't think it be like it is, but it do.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/they-don-t-think-it-be-like-it-is-but-it-do)
---
Wow, it’s kind of impressive that a 15 year old game still has 1/3 of its peak population.
---
Heard it directly from the mouth of my global company's regional head of IT and security. Considering we handle VERY high profile breach and legal cases, I would assume there was some truth to it. Not calling you out either, just providing evidence to my own claim of where I heard this. 
---
Also, the backhanded pothead insult is a bit insulting.
---
Zin'rohk for me!
---
Lmao imagine seeing a neckbeard jogging outside your place at 2am
---
Team up, makes it manageable. It's still going to take a long time to complete, but less painful. I did it with just one other person and we managed to do it all without a death. Got lucky once or twice though :)
---
There are plenty of upgrades
---
Some blues are better than epics
---
A lot of epics are dogshit
---
Some epics are insanely good for a really really long time - Quickstrike Ring for example.
---
I have swiftmend if that counts
---
If we're talking reset it's 32 hours after launch. The next reset would be the second one.
---
If you were a chef yes you would know what is in the basic kitchen hahahaha
---
What a terrible retort
---
Yes I know about server infrastructure, no it doesnt differ from company to company.  It may vary slightly,  but we all have to keep up to stay protected.  
---
You are defensive for no reason.  We all want the same thing bud
---
The best thing an orc can hear.
---
Lol this is a troll for sure
---
Oh yeah because one user created website is the authority on the damage they do?
---
Nowhere else does it list the average damage the vile familiars put out originally. 
---
Can you back up these claims with a video from 2004 or something? 
---
Cause the only one I can find is from 7 years ago https://youtu.be/g2Ylzbvl29c 
---
And it seems even more face roll to me. He could probably have pulled all 8 of them and still lived. 
---
Furthermore, its literally 1 quest with 1 particular mob and you're worried that people are going to get through the starting zone at the speed of light or something? 
---
Are you high?
---
Nice hair dude.
---
Build it and they will come. This is awesome for idea for rp.
---
Locks can move and cast decent dps dots at the same time.  Mage have very low pve dps while moving.
---
Damn!! TIL Didier came up with “Warcraft”
---
&gt;According to Blizzard cofounder Allen Adham, the name "Warcraft" was originated by Samwise when he shouted it out in his distinctive style during a lunchtime brainstorming session prior to the development of the original game, Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans.[6
---
I have Highlord on Pagle, Bloodhound &amp; Octane on Stalagg and Swiftmend on Herod
---
I am torn between 3 choices. Gnome mage, human warrior or dwarf priest. 
---
I'm completely content playing anyone one of these but can't decide which. I'll be making all 3 regardless but one will be my main focus for the first 6+ months after release. 
---
Anyone have some good selling points for these 3 classes?
---
Not an EST server
---
Trying to decide between Druid, Mage, and Priest for raiding.
---
Love Mages, pretty straight forward DPS caster.
---
For Priest, I've literally never end-gamed a Priest before in all my years of playing. Not sure if Disc or Holy would be better for me and what would land me a spot easier. Also for this I'm worried about leveling and how I'd fare.
---
Druid - I assume I'd be forced into healing which I don't have a problem with at all. Plus my first ever character was a Druid, so that gets nostalgia points lol.
---
Any suggestions?
---
How is this at 0 already? What is the point of downvoting this post? Im honoustly curious.
---
 But our lord and saviour Fairbanks, is already dead!
---
This. Classicdb is a pserver database, and a pretty old one at that. It's not a reliable source of information, and should only be used as a lightweight alternative to wowhead while keeping in mind that some of the stuff there is wrong.
---
I think grob is going to be my settle spot.
---
I see... well thanks for your reply hopefully well hear more about this
---
Let's make some noise about this!!!! It's vital to the classic community
---
Something's not quite right..
---
What do you mean Whitemane is the 4chan server?
---
So, the authentic vanilla experience can only be enjoyed by US people?
---
Doesn't make much sense.
---
It's late at night, in the shadows of the Drag.  The torchlights burn low, leaving bright patches in the darkness few and far between.  A whisper slides down your neck from a shadow beside a hide-roofed hut.
---
"You wanna buy a watermelon?"
---
The question freezes you in place, as you think about your bags and their contents, the time since your last meal, the likelihood of having to go and get in a fight anytime soon, and the negligible HP regen you can get from some shadowy off-brand Melon Vendor.
---
He opens his trenchcoat like half a flasher- a bulging green sphere peeks out over the top of an inside pocket.  The stripes shine in the darkness, drawing your attention to what may not actually just be junk.
---
He whips the other side of his trenchcoat wide open as you stand before him, unveiling cantaloupes, honeydews, and old-fashioned-root-beer-melons and the rest of his delectable fruits.
---
"I got what you like, big boy.  Fresh and juicy, hot off the tree."
---
That was quite a paragraph to say nothing relevant. 
---
You still didn’t address the fact that Blizzard aren’t going to be able to instance all 5-10k (whatever the max is) into the game all at once before the queue starts because it’s full. They didn’t even let that many people into the world before the queue on the stress tests so you are grasping at straws in the air. They will get the first 2k in instantly, batch the next 2k from the queue in, etc while whipping up a new layer for every batch until the server is at actual capacity and then the real queue begins that will take much longer because you will be waiting on people to log out instead of just making it through the log in process.  It sounds like you didn’t play the stress test so I’m not going to waste any more time with you.
---
No worries, I'll be keeping an eye on the thread since I'd also like to see an estimate of how many spaniards will be on Shazzrah, since my guild decided to roll there.
---
There will be plenty of night elves willing to be your gf for an hour
---
You're likely thinking of [Blood of Heroes](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12938/blood-of-heroes).
---
[
---
Blood of the Mountain](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11382/blood-of-the-mountain) is only obtainable from Molten Destroyers in Molten Core, or at about a 0.5% drop chance from Dark Iron Deposits.
---
Thanks Incel.
---
I bet she wouldn't even roleplay for gold so you can get your mount ASAP. Despicable.
---
You can say you don't care about server name but you'd much rather play on something like Nefarian than Ivar's Patch. Let's be honest that's the next EU PvE realm if there ever was one going by the naming trend.
---
Ragnaros is not a portuguese (nor a brazilian) server.
---
It really won't lol.. Herod is still labeled as Full and Stalagg is Low. 
---
I'm sure it'll have a healthy population but Herod will be the largest server.
---
I said the exact same thing he did. The name sucks, but if you like it then that's all that matters. And smelly boy? Grow up.
---
Would be cool to have a button in the interface under each item that you can click to auto whisper the person that you want to buy something.

Go for aesthetics.  
---
I personally LOVE the undead aesthetics, lore and animations so if I can be an undead, I always choose an undead.
---
IIRC I looked it up since I was interested, and you pretty much have to do X quest ~1000 times to go from friendly--&gt;exalted, on top of having to do another quest 50-100 times to get up to friendly.
---
No fucking way
---
Unbreakable, baby! Check him out on YouTube and witness the 480p PvP greatness.
---
That also implies that he has an actual character and wants to RP, though. It's really not a big deal if people just speak in say/yell normally. RPers kind of just congregate on their own without issue.
---
This is the longest I've ever spent watching any content with streamers in it. It was a bad idea...
---
I have a nasty throat infection at the moment and I laughed so hard I ended up in a coughing fit. Totally worth it though.
---
Most classes don't use that much T1 or 2 as their best gear. I think some don't use any.
---
Can it actually sell stuff?  Or do you end up having to /trade the guy anyway, this just shows off inventory and prices?
---
As "Collection" is fine.
---
Aside from TF what else are these mats used for that's a priority for a guild?
---
Working smarter not harder bro.
---
It's what we did back then.  Anything to cut down on the 30 hrs/week for raiding.
---
I got better shit to do with my time.
---
Nah dude, that honestly makes me wanna BabyRage.
---
Honestly, I hope Fairbanks is high pop or medium. I've played on a low pop server before and I disliked it because it's so hard to find people.
---
Loktar! I’m doing the same thing. Was night elf Druid. But I’m Horde at heart and I’m not as keen with the Tauren models. Going rogue for classic.
---
Is it pdt or pst?
---
That boomer didn’t play the stress test and has no clue how layering interacts with server capacity. Don’t bother.
---
i agree. his face cam takes up very little space and the red light makes it so your eyes arent drawn ot it , and he's pretty low energy. i like it.
---
Ooh I was hoping they wouldn’t stay on low
---
1 Horde side, Undead Priest. Disc/Shadow.
---
2 Alliance side. One Dwarf Male, Disc/Holy. One Shadow primary, switched out to Disc/Holy once he got rank13, he wasn't going to go to 14 but he figured he was basically there.
---
All 3 quit before Burning Crusade hit. Along with most rank 13s/14s on the server. I know of 2 from my server that still play the game, that were rank 14. Both are chill/insane and will attempt the climb again if given the chance.
---
Real talk, I'm not one for RPing (even though I kind of like the idea of building a character back story) but I kind of like the idea of being part of the community on an RP server. How does one exist in an RP realm without an interest in the RP aspect of it all?
---
You used to be able to transfer for sure.
---
Thanks guy
---
At this point I think the amount of time spent on discussing whether it's DM or VC outweighs the time is would to type Deadmines or Dire Maul overall haha
---
I don't understand when people started calling it VC. It's always been DM, I've never heard it called VC until the classic announcement
---
needs a noobmaster69 lol
---
Stalagg crush youuu
---
Good im dutch but i like my scandinavians in wow, makes the experience even more vanilla for me.
---
Warrior was cool for speed runs, max threat made farming runs super fast.
---
WHAT A COMPLETE SHOCK!!
---
You should just go with whichever appeals to you the most. That said, druid is probably one of the harder class to play right. Best for younger kids are probably one of those dpser like mage, hunter or rogue.
---
UD priest
---
Please send link
---
Looove Duskwood. It's got such a dark and disturbing backstory, and a there's a few chains that get really really interesting.
---
I'm also stuck between hunter and lock as a main. I played hunter during vanilla and I can for sure tell you hunters and rouges still topped DPS charts up well into BWL and ZG. But its possibly DPS has been figured out since then on pservers if the data for bosses is correct. 
---
Hunter is such a fun class and very mobile compared to a lock. I feel a well gear lock is way stronger than a well geared hunter and will most likely win any 1v1 world pvp encounter. But on the other hand a decent geared hunter will beat the lock. So my dilemma is do I want to be strong early or late game.
---
I think you are seriously underestimating bloods - sub 1% drop rate from only 9 mobs makes them at least as rare as ingots (assuming you are getting that far anyway).
---
The fuck you talking about? Eye drops, whole guild is going to get behind the guy chosen for it to go to. All MC mat drops from the guild bank are showered, and normal mats are going to be offered at a deep discount if not free from guildies.
---
"Sorry guys, I'd have brought have of rag to the raid today but I'm still farming all the mats" - never going to happen
---
True classic experience
---
As a note, at a 3% drop, after 33 attempts, it is only a 64% probability the item will have dropped.
---
Who are the BR's?
---
Is there an addon or something that lets you keep a list of people's names and maybe a not without ignoring them? i realize i just described the friend's list so that may sound stupid but stuff like this adds up and you wouldnt wanna ignore half the server
---
Brazilians.
---
well done dude!
---
nope,  richturpin
---
Also confirming. Even made a separate 
---
Reddit account for work use to avoid, uh, questions.

ah ok i didn't know if it was some half honor system for heal assist or what have you ty.
---
ill have fun playing with my guild and everyone else your switching server for an easier start when herod will be the full server with the bustling community so im sure well have fun
---
So does Herod
---
The best grinding strategy for the mats was based around getting as much gold as possible, anyway, lol.  Especially towards the end of Vanilla.

Hi, I’m not OP but can you also send me an invite? Thanks a lot!

How do you do that for the Chinese models?

\[H\] PVE SERVER PAGLE | CASUAL ADULTS | &lt;THE DARK KNIGHTS&gt;
---
Yeah, you read that right - I am looking for casual adults just wanting to team up, guild up, and have some fun playing in classic with zero pressure and 100% understanding that most of us are older adults with jobs, careers, families, and other things that need our attention away from the game.
---
I looked for *DAYS* trying to find something like this here, but anything that comes close to this is either on another server (US West PST) or the Alliance. I am all about blood and honor, for the Horde! However, everyone wants hardcore or semi-hardcore raiders for horde side on the PvE servers.
---
I get it, I really do. I just don’t have time for it. I am sure a lot of other people don’t either. This is why I am here - to create a home where we can all hang out, level up, group up, chill out, and have fun doing so casually.
---
**Goals as a Guild:**
---
* No rush to level up
---
* Play as Horde characters
---
* Play casually and enjoy the journey
---
* Help clanmates reach High Warlord in PvP
---
* Raid when we get there and have the time
---
* Play on USEast PvE server Pagle (or Mankrik if Pagle full)
---
* Make friends, team up, accomplish goals as an in-game family
---
We encourage you to play what you want and when you want, there's no obligation (aside from obvious rules such as behavior). We have over 50 dedicated members ready to go at launch! Everyone is very friendly and welcoming.
---
As far as our existing members, most of us have a family and a full time job so we aren't on all the time. We have many warriors, mages and hunters, but again, play what you want! All professions are covered as well. As I mentioned before, there are no obligations so do whatever you please :)
---
Want to know more? Interested?
---
Add me on Bnet: **FatPasta#1266**  
---
Join the Discord server: **discord.gg/TpfMs7Q**  
---
Or just follow up here with a reply, that works too.
---
Looking forward to gaming with you!
---
I’m going to have to make a character there just to have the chance of hanging around my e-celeb crush!

Jajaja is used by people who speak spanish not portuguese.
---
Stalagg came out 4 hours ago... Of course it's currently low.
---
Speak for yourself. I as well as many others never played Classic, TBC, etc. We may have knowledge of later expansions but Blizzard gained a large amount of people over the years who will be learning classic content and mechanics for the first time.
---
Best: Tirisfal Glades
---
Worst: Durotar (screw that eye ball quest into oblivion)
---
Troll master race!
---
well i planned on playing priest from the jump, i just wasn't sure how hard it was going to be to grind pvp rank as a healer, some pretty decent items come from the higher ranks but i wasn't going to bother if you only got half hk's for heal assists or what have you.
---

---
Northern ireland on a PVE server o.O
---
Then it's only a matter of faction. Cause real Scandinavians play Horde. So unless you want to get stuck with those fake Scandinavians on Alliance, you need to Orc it.
---
Doing the same. Getting her to play. Hope it goes well..
---
They basically do, I am testing on a well known pserver right now and the mobs just do ridiculous amounts of damage. I can barely solo mobs of +2 level at level 8 (i'm not playing warrior btw). Pservers were deliberately tuned to try and make things somewhat challenging for an experienced player base. Vanilla in 2005 was balanced for noobs playing their first MMO on dialup at 20FPS.
---
Oof.
---
It's on retail so it doesnt matter what Thex's name is.
---
Or its just relative to Stalagg.
---
That’s actually the point of this post I really believe. It’s a type of counter propaganda.
---
Jesus. You are correct. Good damn Joana :( now there's no chance of getting a harder leveling experience :,/
---
Hi, pvp, chucknorris on herod
---
You guys left cus of some discord server?
---
Im in a 30 man guild and none of us have even been on there yet.
---
Why base your decision on some trolls on a random discord server?
---
Teldrassil my favourite, the music, the lightning, the treeeeeees.... Everything is grouped relatively nicely together and there's a good flow and pattern to questing there, a handful of hidden quests too.
---
Dun Morogh by far the worst for me, so few quests, so far apart from each other. Zone is huge and feels like there is nothing in it. Durotar is a close second because it's ugly as.
---
Really looking for a working EzDismount. Anyone know if it works on beta?
---
Yes we do log in and clear it day 1 with barely any effort, considering we have done it many times.  PTR is minimal, just to clear the cobwebs.  Anyone can be trained up on these fights in a few hours
---
Neither were trolls
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it, once you get outside of the starting zone it gets a lot harder pretty fast. I did Durotar on the stress test and saw plenty of people dying to the trolls on echo isles.
---
I did Fizzle Darkclaw in a 2 man group and still almost died. 
---
We are getting true Vanilla values, just like they were back in 1.12, and that is what we always wanted from Classic.
---
The only people in BFA who do.
---
There's a lot better hardware available than the first time around, it will absolutely be based on players online and not the login queue.
---
Original servers had 1-3,000 players online concurrently with very few outliers to that (think Argent Dawn with its constant queue). When layering is removed as promised too many players might be a very bad thing.
---
The idea is that there will be a massive drop off after the tourists leave and we end up with normal sized realms. If no such drop off happens then new servers will open just like they did with the new pvp server
---
Filthy casual /s
---
Right it's either coming out in the next week or there won't be a new cinematic. I don't think they'll do a new one though. Doesn't seem worth the effort.
---
It seems to be in order. Thanks for the info.
---
Skinning is the only one that really fits that bill. I have seen it estimated that skinning will yield you about 20 gold from levels 1 to 40 vendoring everything.
---
Shouldnt he be a hunter? Would make more sense
---
Good meme
---
Other players pick NPC sounds that play when you click on them. 
---
“Wanna browse my wares?” 
---
Yes, yes I do as a matter of fact. That’s why I’m here.
---
?? 
---
I dont, i know plenty others that dont either.
---
I like world pvp for the challenge of fighting people in my level range and the thrill of hiding from higher level people.
---
Acting like 99% of the pop are gankers is so far from the truth.
---
No you haven't.
---
why? its a pvp weapon...
---
You might appreciate this.

I'll be damned. Dead players you say ? 
---
This makes me so happy I can't f.. wait
---
i was in the same boat.
---
My first character ever was a warrior but in BC and ongoing expasnsions i learned to love and master mage.
---
but in the end i decided to Main the warrior just because warriors are more gear dependend than mages. like this i can funnel gear to the warr and still have fun on a worse geared mage twink
---
I think this is better than any excel sheet. Reminds me of old days when there was no printer and you had to write everything (like San Andreas cheat codes) to paper. Then you kept that one valuable piece of paper somewhere safe for years.
---
An interesting idea, but I don't think it will work in practice. The AH just seems so much more practical: when you want to buy or sell, you can look at everything being sold, and compete in the market. How is anyone ever going to find the specific item they need by going to people and inspecting their wares? Besides, most of the time people are out and about, questing or in dungeons, not standing around waiting for potential customers who don't even know what they are selling until they inspect... 
---
The worst part is that you need to stand around with your wares in your bag, not be AFK, and expect people to approach you, hoping they actually need what you're selling. Sure, you're not losing money to the AH fees, but time is money friend, and this does not save it.
---
The example you give with the gnome selling a quest item next to the quest giver is just about the only situation where I can see this addon 'shine', but even then, the gnome could just stand there and spam "Need cheese? All your for just an arm and a leg", and it'd work just as well (better even, because people don't need an addon). Besides, even if this addon becomes popular, there'll always be a sizeable crowd of people who don't run any addons, let alone this niche one.
---
Something else that worries me: let's say that a decent amount of people use this Addon. The result? Less people are selling stuff at the AH, and those who don't use the addon have less chance to find what they need at the AH, because people are standing around with the goods in their pockets. 
---
Maybe I just don't get it, but the more I think about it, the more I don't like it. The AH does a 100x better job, because it's centralized and because it works for you while you are offline or doing other things besides jumping on top of the capital's mailbox.

GROB GANG GREATEST SERVER
---
Could someone give me some good insight on what RPPVP severs will be like?
---
I'm not really a fan of RP myself, no problem with people that do so at all, and I've no problem naming my characters lore based names as well.
---
Is it fun? Will I have intense pvp? Will there be legit raiding guilds etc etc.
---
What will be better Grobb will have than Herod?

Convince me friends, so I can convince my other 4 friends.

Get a dedicated gpu that doesn't need a lot of power. Probably 1050/1050 ti, you could probably find something cheaper if you look on craightslist or something for an older used GPU.
---
You are the one who does not understand how the queue works.
---
The queue happens when you log in (actually enter your password) and are selecting a server. This is before you ever get to the character select screen. 
---
You are not placed into any layers until you select your character and are loaded into the game. You are saying that at this point, if they do batching into layers, before you select your character you are already placed into a layer. That is not how it works and you are not talking about the queue.
---
You make it sound like a ton of people logging into the game at once is this impossible feat. You are just making up a situation to make your idea seem more feasible. Well guess what, their servers can handle the influxes of that size... THAT IS WHY THEY DO STRESS TESTS. To figure what their end can handle so they don't worry about it crashing on launch.
---
Kind of random but I actually really enjoy mulgore. Other favorite though is teldrassil.
---
I look forward to 1080p vids of frost shock windfury crit montages. Now flavored with memes.

Mulgor is awful
---
I think it's because it was after the Beta had ended and before they announced that they were actually going to  do a Stress Test. There was just a lack of anything to talk about, basically just sit around waiting for launch. It just came along at the right time I guess and people latched onto it for some reason. I don't get it either though, even weirder that they put an NPC of him in Retail.

&gt;each boss drops literally like 2-3 pieces of loot. Per week. A full raid assuming they stay and no one leaves to join another guild, 5 months? To gear the entire raid. And honestly that isn’t accurate.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts! I think it's very possible they release Phase 2 about 6 months in then.

Druids are a hybrid class. If you aren't doing hybrid things you will of course fall behind. Of course, this means that they are necessarily subpar in raids since having 40 people allows you to specialize all of them.

Awesome!! :)
---
Take what people say here with a grain of salt. I dont know what Hellhole they played on but not everybody you come across is a ganker.
---
The reason PVP is fun is because you get the excitement and challenge of being able to fight the opposite faction. The Thrill of runnin into higher players who might gank you. Having world battles between factions because some high guilds alt was ganked in hillsbrad.Having to hide behind a hill with your friends. All of this  adds to the immersion and makes the world slightly more believable.
---
I honoustly cannot imagine playing classic on a PVE server. It seems to go against the grain with everything i love about classic.

Your logic doesnt hold water. If new servers dont reduce congestion then why did new servers do exactly that back in vanilla?

Low effort repost with a title that doesn't make sense.

Have you got a friend/family member/SO with an account? I let my husband "placehold" my name while I take my time customizing my character and then get my name back. That way I know it's safe and can take my time making my char look how I want without the anxiety that accompanies it lol.
---
I don't know if that method was common knowledge back in the day, or at least I certainly didn't know about it 15 years ago :) I made the pilgrimage with a couple of others at the same time, it was a rite of passage.
---
Nah we just have to change our general understanding of complaining. Everyone does it. Everyones shit stinks. Some people act like theirs doesnt. The internet is like the free market. How many unique replies can something get. Probably not 7 billion. But the market will fill all available nooks and cracks. Nothing you havent heard before, but ya we all act like complaining is the worst thing ever. All manner of compliments are put forth too. Complaints rise to the top be because negative energy gets people to act. If you have a splinter you want it removed. Someone is just telling you you have a splinter so your like o fuk get rid of it. Pain is the motivator. Same with anything people complain about. Its usually pain of loss. Ima shut up now. Ty.

I'm not sure you can use the term "retconned" when it was stated 6 months later. WotLK released on November 2008, and the Arthas novel, that includes Sylvanas condoning the use of the plague, was released in April 2009.
---
Considering it had to be written well before that, it means it was always planned as being the truth.

Once you get past that first block of people who aren't taking time off, it'll be easy.

i came here expecting chuck norris, this is just sad

The addon folder that they have always been saved to lol
---
Wasn't he related with the original ashbringer quest in nax?
---
This is wrong.
---
Step 1: get lucky  
---
Step 2: farm/buy the mats and buy additional ingots from other guilds  
---
Step 3: sacrifice one ingot to learn the recipe or find another guild crafter who can already do it
---
Huge faction imbalance though. That's never fun.
---
That mage should uninstall LOL
---
Draenei and Pandaren are the best races in WoW
---
I don't know what you would even do with 12.6k+ gold in Classic. Buy BiS epic everything for all eight alts on the server I guess.
---
I could but that would cost me a fair amount of research and this model is made from fairly subjective perspectives and maybe the results for a rogue version wont fit you guys playstyle?
---
That's hilarious.  Rosh was in world chat daily trolling everyone.  He had ninja'd something the day before I got into the beta and everyone was still going on about it.
---
If this fools on your server, he's 100% going to do this in every group.
---
Cringe
---
I’d say pretty high now that stalagg exists
---
Game doesn’t start until 60
---
I have see this mentioned a lot. Could you explain why or give a link to one?
---
Sm was related with nax though, considering the ashbringer quest line. Same with pagle
---
They layed off 800 people less than a year ago, there’s no one left to scream.
---
Oh I didnt know that! Makes it more easy then. Thanks!
---
If only. We didn't know what we had at the time.
---
The same could be said for all the dumb meme names. 
---
I have “Skip”, “Horn” and “Mance” which are all memorable names that reflect their respective characters. 
---
I’d also much rather ask for “Skip” in /g or voice chat than “bigdpsboi.”
---
wont be touching my NE until ive got solid starter gear because of this. May be the hardest dungeon in vanilla mostly because you may not have more than 1 other person and even as a due this place is rough.
---
The new realm Stalagg seems pretty horde heavy at the moment.
---
pvp servers are for sociopaths
---
Saw quite a few sub-10 NEs in Dun Morogh, and you'll have to go all the way back. I recommend staying until 10 personally.
---
Paladin has the simplest rotation.
---
Druid seems fine if they level as feral and know how to do ranged pulls.
---
Casters are squishy unless the kid can CC.
---
Pet classes seem like a bad idea because they might cause grief to people they group with.
---
Rogues probably require more caution than an 8 year old can handle.
---
I'd say just let them go druid. Make sure they know to level as feral, and try to teach them how to do ranged pulls where doing so keeps them safe from aggroing many mobs.
---
Thex is a Shaman, Shaman color is blue
---
The European casual racism is so weird from an American perspective.
---
People are different.
---
Exactly. Back in 06 on lightninghoof RPing was everywhere and expected, even in instances. It was so much fun. I guess in later expansions that was lost but I hope it goes back to how it was in classic.
---
Hunter.
---
The pet takes care of them. **They learn to take care of the pet**. It's a huge buffer that frees them to dps largely consequence/death free. They only die when the pet does, and the lesson becomes, "take better care of your pet".
---
1-10 isn't even hard if you're a bad Hunter so long as you don't know what proper efficiency looks like. 
---
They may not figure out aspects, or rotations, or mana conservation. But they'll be free to experiment and fail their way to understanding ... so long as they pay attention to and take care of their pet.
---
Might get downvoted to hell: I'm 23 and love Fortnite. I've never played MMOs competitively but honestly, despite that game being designed for a younger audience, the skill gap in that game is fucking ridiculous and every single hour you play you'll see improvement even after a year.
---
However the devs and management of Epic Games have finally decided to run the competitive scene into the ground and 100% cater to 12 year old timmys.
---
This is what made me and many others quit Fortnite; I'm finally gonna get into WoW which I never did back then because of the subscription costs. Really looking forward to casually playing it and have some fun

Is it a deposition or in-court testimony? You can reschedule the former no problem with any plausible excuse, especially since it’s two hours away.

No, instead you have to run through alligator-infested territory to get from your boats to one of the capital cities. You're dumb enough that you're not even using Stormwind Harbor...

Not being able to use guns until 10 sucks and you do have to go back to darnassus at level 10 for the hunter quest for Nelfs. Can confirm.
---
Stable for 2,5k - 3000 concurrent players, not created characters or people playing overall..

Im glad we have you for the analytics..

Wotf is very annoying in casual levelling pvp and wpvp and pug bgs. In more 'serious' battlegrounds with proper support/dispels it's not going to be a big issue, and having half the classes on the enemy team that can dispel your stuff is very nice, and BoP and pally support is very nice for a warlock.  
---
So yeah if you're just taking it casual solo - alliance warlock is pretty annoying, but if you know you're going to get T2 + gear and will be rolling with groups in pvp it's going to be more than fine.
---
7 layers
---
I think you really missed the point of that complaint. How long does the Onyxia attunement take? It depends on how capable you are, whether you know people to form quick, capable groups and whether you have the knowledge to traverse the world efficiently. At no point will the game tell you you're going to fast or putting too much effort in, and force you to slow down so everyone can catch up. Vanilla does not have timegating (for content) at all.
---
Thanks for trying
---
There's a good reason everyone goes male ud caster.
---
Wolfshead Helm is BOE, not BOA. Druids do need to get Enchanting to ~250 for the Smoking Heart trinket, and if you are Horde then you might also want to level Blacksmithing for the Fear Immunity trinket. Skarm has some good Druid videos on Youtube.
---
At 9% per run you need 11 runs (or close enough) per ingot, so you should expect it to take 81 runs.
---
There's a 91.6% chance that the Eye will drop within 81 runs, assuming you kill Rag every time and the drop rate is 3%.
---
If the drop rate is 12% then you should expect to do 75 runs, and there is an 89% chance that the Eye will drop in that time.
---
So odds are that the ingots will be what holds you up more than the Eye, but there is a real chance that you will get all the ingots before you see an Eye drop.
---
that name aged VERY well
---
Instead of (( )) to denote OOC, just put some slashes \\ in front of anything in /say or /yell if you really want to be respectful.
---
Of course, this isn't really necessary if there is no one roleplaying around you.
---
Play on Grobbulus! Even if there are streamers, they won't be on the scale of anything bigger than a guild, and they'll be more respectful of other people's enjoyment of the game there.
---
Tbh, free roll group loot is the best, assuming your guildies are responsible, mature, and trustworthy
---
Depends: blizzards biggest issues with it was all the gm time spent answering tickets from players who were either hacked or were reporting gathering bots hoovering up all the peacebloom and copper so nobody could level their dam mining/herbilism.  I had alot of sympathy for the issues they were facing, it really did detract from the player experience. They kinda solved the problem on retail by just selling gold themselves, which is kinda what they should have done in the first place.
---
Mage
---
Whoosh!
---
Nope, it's still 11 days away.

I don't think you should Disregard Stalagg, it will be a High pop or Full server come the end of launch week. It will have a decent community from new player and most likely avoiding the 'elitist' ones you think you'll meet on Herod. The streamer server will be hectic, the economy will be weird, but they will have cool events. Stalagg seems like it will be a pretty chill server, and i'm willing to bet they add some more.
---
Those are bold words for someone... outside of PvP distance. Fuck.
---
Can you elaborate
---

---
Shadow priest.
---
Shadow priest has some serious synergy with warlock.
---
Druid could be good for rez/buff/hots, shaman could work too. Hunter would be really strong as well. Honestly, any pairing of classes without the same gear will work.
---
Druid gets you stealth, but also end game party invites for 5 mans. If you only have a few hours a night, being a healer will get you an invite right away in while a dps class means that by the time you get a party lined up you probably will be wondering if you can even stick around for the whole thing.
---
If you want to PUG occasional raids eventually then Pally and Shaman will both be sought after.
---
Free food for you two to quest, easy portals for you both. Both long range high dps, both great at pvp, both needed for raids.
---
I could totally see people on the RP servers advertise their shops in chat: “Come get your alchemy goods! Wetzel’s Pestles open until 18:00 (located near Ironforge Bank)!”
---
Infograph needs to be adjusted. Ancient Bone Bow wasnt originally added until Patch 1.4 which means blizzard wont have it be part of the scholo loot table until phase 2.
---
Awesome pic!
---
but why is the "L" lowercase?
---
Hunters scale terribly, but their base pet damage is solid early on.
---
Warlocks wreck in pvp though, especially with gear. Don't let that assuage you though. You'll pick up decent hear even without being a hardcore raider. Plus you'll get pvp gear in phase 3(2?) when rankings come online.

What’s she rolling otherwise? Female UD look pretty clean with the “bones” off. My guildies are rolling ally so she wants to play a human or nelf female.
---
Status.
---
That would be the logical progression after they run out of classic content.
---
Interesting how that works.
---
Druids don't get cat form until 20... Tank leveling gonna be fun.

---
&gt; Iirc you couldn't trade back in vanilla
---
So, you can in Classic. In private servers we had one ML stay behind while everyone else rushed forward. The ML was then summoned forward at bosses if he didnt manage to get to us before before that.
---
It literally didnt slow us down .. any. We did 23minute MC, 33min BWL, 56min AQ40 and 2h Naxx in normal raids, we didnt do special "speedruns". 
---
Only speedrunning our guild did was on ZG, where they did ~24minutes run, no precleared trash killing all bosses.
---
Deadly boss mods and threat meter are pretty standard if you plan on raiding. When I was raiding hardcore in wotlk though I had keybinding, interface and raid ui mods though. it's all personal preference.
---
Yeah seems like a solid choice. Usually if I main a warrior I go blacksmithing, but since it would just be an alt I dont really have to worry about that.
---
It’s like you think you understand it, but you don’t.
---
I think people want to put in more effort into creating groups.
---
"Fairbanks"
---
No - but they stated, that they will allow this maybe later on.
---
I can already hear the drama 2 years from now
---
There is status to having one though.  Maybe not provide all the mats but to have one still reflects positively on the guild.
---
Imagine not pulling a 36+ hour session at launch. Fucking casual
---
Fer the Herod!
---
I'm pretty sure in Vanilla they would just farm the best spots 24/7. There was a few Chinese farmers on Shadowmoon that would never leave the farming spots.
---
You know we can see your post history, right?

Sounds good. It wasn't very fun having your core gameplay centered around glitching the sit/stand toggle.
---
Genius mage...if he hadn't moved, right at the end, he would've gotten a return kill at least...interrupting wand-swing is never a good idea.
---
Notes. Thx for the detailed insight
---
According to spanish forums Shazzrah will have these spanish guilds:
---

---
Guild Masters say they are about 1200 players, plus all spanish players with no guild that will follow them because "it's the spanish server".
---
They are forcing people to queues because they have always planned on having a concurrent player cap. They know the cap they want, and don't plan on adding layers to allow more. I garuntee they have done way more research on the launch population cap vs rate of decay than anyone on this sub is willing to give them credit for.
---
GROB SQUAD
---
Ha I'm just bein a troll. Gettin rdy for launch clearly. I also like to bind pet attack to a mouse button, I just think one of your most pressed binds should not require modifier keys :P
---
Are you really this challenged?
---
You were a broke one.
---
I would be shocked if the servers were playable the first couple hours.
---
Post it in the shazzrah sub as well: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/shazzrahpvp
---
During leveling it will be "live to win" on repeat, there is a nice 10 hour loop on youtube. At 60 in PvP it will be inflames
---
It's more that Mia was immortalized with an NPC of her own called Mia the Rose
---
that information won't be available until they do sub
---
It depends, I remember 2007 my network connection was so bad I could not use wow and YouTube at the same time. I also want to listen to the BGM of the game.
---
I remember selling stuff in the tunnel of common lands before the bazaar cane out too. Crazy times at torch 3!
---
This game is so good, I played it for the first time last year.
---
You ought to contact /u/shako154 about advertising this on Grobbulus.org. I can really see RPers getting good use out of this since you see a lot of player-run shops on RP servers.
---
If you aren't racing, efficiency isn't critical. You know your going to be behind anyways, grabbing the most efficient class won't change that.
---
But a priest is always welcome (pve 5 man or in pvp) even as a fresh 60. I think it's a great choice if you're already inclined.
---
Flip a coin on your professions, you'd enjoy both combos.
---
Anticheat system that actually works
---
Im just going to start out as engi / mining which will likely be my endgame prof, until I drop mining.  Skinning takes up a lot of space and isnt that much money.  I'd rather have the goggles, trinkets, gun upgrades (goin hunter), selling deadly blunderbusses etc.
---
Southern Plaguelands
---
All you do is tell the server the action you want to perform.  The server decides if it's allowed.
---
I think Most People Google „bfa“ or „wow bfa“ instead of „Battle for Azeroth“. But still the difference is huge
---
the funny part is that, there will be quite a lot of people that are just not subbed atm and won't be until classic launch, so even though they are adding new servers now, it's still going to hit the fan come launch day
---
Made me laugh
---
It seems I'm a bit late to the party. What is this thex meme?
---
In Everquest (because there were no instances) guilds could block entry to zones simply by never letting people kill the bosses needed for attunements. It was awesome. Imagine if only one guild on a classic server got to raid MC. Good times.
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
So does the game come out Aug 26th or the 27th?
---
Absolutely. It’d be really cool to see dozens Palys in T2 sets walking about Stormwind for sure. I’ve been wearing the Priest sets in retail as transmogs and I’m kinda over them at this point.
---
Eddedundeady
---
It comes vubdledef with the openjdk 12, size is a bit bloated at the moment, but if you are familiar with Java you can just run the. Jar and it's substantially smaller... But I don't trust that most people know how to do that
---
Proud wielder of Ok at your service
---
Keep pushing all items to your friends will result in you being in a guild with your friends. And only your friends. Because everyone else has left. Then you cant clear the raids anymore, no more loot for you. Those items you hoarded early are now mediocre at best.
---
The level is off center.
---
I'm getting hyped now just from reading your reply haha
---
Warrior T1 definitely isn't max threat though
---
No one uses it to raid lol
---
There were definitely gold exploits in the past and Blizzard patched them quickly/banned people for even interacting with the gold (you could petition and if they deemed you not guilty of trading duped gold you could get your account back.)
---
And there were exploits to fly and stuff, but any detection got you teleported to GM island until they banned you.
---
And if guilds choose to move server it's not an issue. If they stay then whats to whine about?
---
Warrior or Rogue? Which one has the highest skill cap for PvP? I initially thought rogue, but been watching a lot of 1v1 warrior PvP videos and the stance dancing can get complex.
---
I had a speed hack working in original vanilla, and i tried it out in wsg. I could jump across the map and it wouldnt let me click the flag for a certain amount of time, or return it, and it was super buggy. Didnt really help me in any way and it was only about 5 bgs before I got banned
---
Yes! Enchants work just like trading. If you're able to tap into whispers, then make commands for professions! Or make them an icon in the inventory window
---
I was originally going to go mage because I’m interested in PvP and they seem like an all-around great choice for any gameplay. And they’re cool. 
---
But I reserved a great name for an orc warrior and I love the aesthetic and fantasy of playing a warrior. Especially getting cool new weapons/gear and slowly getting more powerful. 
---
I’m worried warrior isn’t a good choice for a casual player though. I’ll get outpaced leveling by any friends I make along the way so I’ll probably have to solo-level.
---
Nice? I have "Lore" and "Corgi"
---
Mouse wheel up = giddy up!
---
Mouse wheel down = get yo all down and drink.
---
Have added wowinterface support to the to do list
---
You do know that even on private servers the average amount of time it takes to hit 60 is 10 days played?  
---
Believe speedrunners do it between 3,5-5 days playtime which still means if you play 16 hours a day it still will be saturday that the first people might hit 60.
---
Then don't switch server...
---
Agreed, guy's a dick, is he right though? I'm ashamed to admit that I have no idea if +agi increases wand speed. Definitely not saying he was correct in taking the cape, just curious if what he was saying is true.
---
Y'all are missing the main point of crafting Sulfuras.  Other than it being a PvP meme weapon, it's a bragging point. "Look how good how guild is! We were able to get someone a legendary weapon! We're the best guild ever and you should join us!"
---
No worries I'll look into it!
---
I can't even recall losing to mage with a druid.  OP heals &gt; mage mana pool.
---
Sure. I recreated my good old times Playlist with Song from 1990-2006
---
I'll also add that if you skin every beast you kill, your skinning should reach level 300 (maxed) around level 40.
---
Meaning you won't have to worry about *"going to a lower level zone and killing low level beasts just to level skinning."*
---
+
---
Even later on when you pick your first real profession to level, it will take time and money to reach 300.
---
Better have a 300 Skinning AND your work-in-progress profession.
---
there have actually been dupes and speed hacks in wow
---
its less common because blizz pays a lot of money to stay on top of it
---
you cant just create gold because most stuff is server side and normal cheats are client side
---
Idk why your getting downvoted - I didn’t sub for this exact reason. We are also talking on a forum that consists of not so casual players. 
---
The people here are extremely dedicated to the game but there will still be plenty of people who aren’t spending time on this sub..
---
I think everyone has gotten a little lost in the /r/classicwow echo chamber honestly
---
Your reply is giving me hope of an awesome gaming experience that I'm about to endure!
---
First rule of life is to assume that the world is made up by complete and utter morons.
---
Kevin plays horde, VC was an alliance thing.
---
All of BR and latinAm play on east coast servers too.
---
I would use this instantly. It's how warframe does their ingame market.
---
No worries man I'll PM you when I do!
---
At the moment yes, it can't auto-detect manually installed add-ons. I am considering adding that feature but it's a bit more work thank I had time for in this version
---

How to kill lvl 1a in style
---
1. Go to starting area
---
2. Release [Explosive Sheep](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4384)

3. Re-Stealth

4. Watch.
---
Omg. Brutal.
---
Goodluck finding x3 Mail wearers willing to farm dgs together.
---
Enjoy doing all your own food prep mate my wife's got my back !

Not to mention the possibility of disconnects.
---
Think he explicitly asked for the min max way
---
Hour, iirc.
---
I played back then.  I've played h1z1 with streamers, i've played pubg with streamers.  
---
It will be different, anyone who thinks they will get genuine pvp with streamers around are delusional.
---
500-1k gold will be a shit ton of gold on classic for a really long time
---
Killing priests is hard in pvp, because everyone loves heals and the moment the priest gets targeted every melee from a mile away gets a spiddy sense to come f your shit up.
---
Priests do stand still in pvp a lot, but not as much as you may remember.
---
If you have to ask reddit you are not min max material tbh
---
Your exchange rate estimate is well off. Gold is so inflated in retail and classic is a fresh economy.
---
Is it instant to send mail between your own chars?
---
Who tf cares about people streaming. I’m trying to play...not watch people play lmao fucking plebs
---
What's RMT?
---
Isn't this similar to botting? I'm not sure if I'm entirely behind this idea. It does sound nice but seems to go against the intended mechanics
---
Thanks everyone!
---
no
---
It's a new build.
---
This sounds handy
---
My first character was a NE rogue.  I only got to like level 14 but that is not important.  What is important is I created this character around new years.  Well, on NYE I wanted to get to this city called stormwind where there would be fireworks.  I had to see that shit.  This leads to me trying to figure out how the fuck to get to stormwind as an NE for about 4 hours.  Eventually I gave up.
---
My second character was a mage.  I wanted to be a fire mage so I went for the fire talents for leveling.  But I also didn't train any of the frost skills including frost nova until someone told me to.  I didn't realize how hard I was gimping myself.  I gave up on this guy at about 30.
---
My third character, a warrior.  I leveled this character *without cooking* from 1-60.  I bought food sometimes, but mostly I just begged mages and used the crap I found.  When I didnt have food I would /sit with spirit gear or use first aid.  Leveling this character built my irl character and made me the man I am today.
---
43 sessions of cardio for a length of 15 minutes each, means you're losing 10hours and 45 minutes of total grinding time. Seems like a waste.
---
Paladin Lock is an excellent combination.
---
King's Honor, Friend
---
I don't think it would be RMT since it'd be using gold?
---
I was planning to, however due to the name itself I know it will be horde heavy and i'm looking to roll alliance for the 10% rep.  10% more of my life outside of the game.
---
Now you gotta stream while wearing it
---
&gt; Blizz always planned for it to be a game of Alliance and Horde
---
No, that decision was taken relatively late during the development. originally, the game was supposed to have 9 playable races (gnomes &amp; trolls weren't planned, but there were nagas, demons and goblins), without a clear faction separation.
---
In his book relating WoW's development, John Staats only starts mentioning factions in July 2003, mentioning that player silhouette became important after it was decided to split the player population into two opposing factions, implying that, at some point, it wasn't the case.
---
Not to mention mlem
---
Only Hunters and Shaman use full T1.
---
I actually just got the DruidBar Classic guy to try this, and the functionality does NOT EXIST in current wow's API. You cannot shapeshift or leave shapeshift from an addon anymore. It's VERY sad!
---
Join the Druidbar classic addon discord if you have further questions. Guy named Tek can answer more questions. https://discord.gg/d79DfK
---
Yes, I think so. Britain's always been a special case in the EU with all of their exceptions, rebates and opt-outs everywhere. Vote leave bascially promised people to retain all of the privileges of being an EU member without any of the obligations while already being the member with the least obligations.
---
In a way, I do hope BoJo gets this no deal brexit through, so people in Britain can learn first hand what that means and when a sensible government is back in charge and reapplies to the EU, all of those special priviliges for the UK will be gone. If it even still is the UK by then. But I don't wish all that suffering on the many millions of people in the UK, who want to stay in the EU.
---
Wow Interface is the only one atm that lets you sort by last update. A lot of early classic addons didn’t work or were buggy and still haven’t been updated properly. So being able to sort by that date helps a lot.
---
You're literally spamming this in every thread despite it not being relevant to the discussion whatsoever. How long have you had it occupy your ctrl + c?
---
I wish Blizz would come out and say it violates the TOS.  That is not a very good trade rate more like a token = 100g in Classic.
---
I don’t like RP because it’s not enjoyable to me. You should play on Grobbulus. It’s gonna be packed and very active.
---
Wrong - try again.
---
Come to Atiesh, the cooler realm.
---
There are multiple ways to play the game. Some people like leveling as fast as they can. Some people don’t. You can’t bash someone for wanting to challenge themselves by leveling as fast as they can. Usually those who do it by the way have already been doing this content for 10 years on private servers so it’s not as magical for them
---
They Hearthstone card when?

Ah yes. My friends were Master Chiefs while I was a PC gamer with a shitty laptop. We all decided we were gonna pre-order the Xbox 360 and we couldn't stop talking about all the fun we were gonna have with Call of Duty 2. The problem was I had just gotten my first job at 16 and finally had a debit card. I immediately activated it and ordered a WoW subscription.
---
A month later, I canceled my 360 preorder to save up for my first built PC. My friends were disappointed. We kinda drifted apart from there, but I was a WoW addict. I don't regret it still.
---
I am 30 too so.............. WTF man, you're late!
---
Whatever Blizzard’s stance on RMT gold selling/buying is going to be their stance on gold trading. They have absolutely no way to sufficiently differentiate between the two.
---
I changed my bank alt from a Druid to a Hunter so I’ll have a cool pet to keep him company. But bear form would be so cool...Argh!
---
That is a good Point. But since they do nothing else - it will work nicely.
---
For example scarlet monestary armory they would run probably 10+ times. That way probably all mail wearers get what they need
---
You have two friends who will be needing on cloth, leather, and caster gear. Since you have heals, and don't want to tank, then go for a dps in mail or plate.
---
Warrior (dps) (leveling is easier if you party with a healer)
---
Pally
---
Shaman (mail at 40, until then competing with druid for leather)
---
Hunter (as with shaman)
---
If recommend warrior or pally
---
First goal is simple, level up to 60 by completing quests and killing enemies!
---
Dont you think this would ruin the game experience? As an ally, if I saw an umbalanced server in favor for horde, i would roll there just to balance it out a little. You have wrong thinking by avoiding it. Imagine everyone would do it
---
undead warlock, I don't think she really minds the bones, just the scraggly hair. She joined in BC only picked horde since family was there, but stuck around because how can you not be moved by the horde? Now any alliance character she rolls she can't play happily as she feels like a spy, lol
---
Spending time with your own kid sounds awful? Sounds amazing to me!
---
Mail between players with items attached always takes an hour, even between characters on the same account.
---
It’s only useful for dot/buff timers on unit frames/plates but I couldn’t seem to get that functionality fully working tho apparently some have. It also requires ClassicAuraDurations tho.
---
i play in china, sent you a message

---
That’s funny. Warlock in classic is.. interesting haha. Sounds like she’s been playing for a while though!
---
What the fuck this isn't even funny as ironic cringe, it's just painful whether it's serious OR satire

Seriously. I was going to turn it on for a bit just for fun but when it asked me to set up an account I immediately decided it wasn't even worth that much effort.

Cheaters in free games cheat get banned and make new accounts,  you can do that all day in wow if you want to funnel money to blizzard.
---
This
---
Can we atleast agree Eu got the best server names? hoping blizz will add servers ahead of the curve. Would be great if we hit a more solid worldwide server count before launch.

lol
---
This is why I prefer classic
---
Could never get very far on a paladin until BC's revamp. Still had to go back and get a Quel.
---
Im going alliance main pvp, and had decided on shadow priest main. After trying it out i fear it will get too boring really fast, and i dont want to main healing.
---
So now i dont really know, thinking maybe warlock or mage. I mained a mage from tbc, so im afraid that will get old fast aswell.
---
Is warlock any fun in pvp without any good gear untill i rank up? I doubt i will do any raiding, and i know warlocks are very gear dependent.
---
I love how mages control the fight and can get out of any situations, but warlocks have a lot of tools and control aswell. Wotf will be annoying but im kinda used to it.
---
Any thoughts?
---
I was gonna go with the white/ grey not the dirty white colour but at the last minute I went for the light brown/tan as I think it looks best with the yellow Priest dungeon set.
---
Which Terms?
---
Tell me there's better ways to get to 60 then killing boars in that forest like they did on south park haha (basically asking for an efficiency list) =p
---
that’s not cheats. that’s a bot. and honor buddy suxked in pvp. people that used it were mainly afk and flagged / kicked.
---
The repair all button in a trap in classic wow while leveling, your deleting money that you have little off, when you need a lot for training skills, and lvl 40 mount. Only repair gear that you need too, that's almost broken, a lot of the time you can find a new piece before needing to repair, unless you die alot

April 09' was mine until June!
---
If you've never played World of Warcraft before, I highly recommend that you take your time and enjoy the world. Some of my favorite memories are leveling up with gaming buddies. Don't rush to 60 like the majority of us. I've already experienced the amazing world and wanna experience the end game differently this time. Don't play on mute either. The music and atmosphere are important. You'll understand years from now.
---
No longevity? Ok
---
Is leveling without cooking really such a noob move? I almost never do cooking on my characters. Or is it only for warriors that it's a bad idea to skip cooking?
---
I am still torn between Druid and Shaman. I really want to play a Druid, I love the flexibility and utility of the class, particularly while leveling. I also love the idea of being useful in raids while still able to go out into the world by myself and be functional (I played a holy priest in Vanilla originally) without respeccing. HotW spec sounds particularly appealing for that.
---
Unfortunately I'm afraid of being disappointed at 60 with all the things I read about druids being "jack of all trades, master of none". Will I still get 5 man group invites as a healer without a real rez? Will I end up frustrated and feeling useless as a healer in raids, just relegated to tank heals and/or decursing?
---
Should I just go with the safer option and take shaman? How do shamans do out in the world alone in raid spec? I don't want to end up unable to kill anything efficiently without respeccing like I did on my priest back in the day. It also seems like there are a LOT of other shamans, I'm a bit concerned about the competition for raid spots and/or loot. 
---
I also find Druid healing in groups a bit more interesting with Hots and different ranks of HT and I find dropping totems every pull a bit tedious. Again though, I'm worried about being disappointed at 60 if I don't choose what I know is the "better" healer option.
---
Gear should not be a problem at all, everyone should be fully geared once we have out leveled the dungeon.

In gaming terms buying in-game gold for any outside currencies - virtual or not - is considered RMT. The best example is forum gold at d2jsp.
---
What matters to you is if they have rules against this, which are enforced. I doubt they do but best check it out.
---
It’s definitely RMT, though. But that does not need to stop you.
---
r/outoftheloop what’s the story behind this Thex meme

That's true. Of course broken items don't vendor for as much, either.

Bars work. Found a bug, can't thoroughly test but here's a gif.

Do you have a single fact to back that up?
---
You nailed it all. Are you willing to give up raid slots with a competent guild to play s.priest? If yes, go for it. If no, then go warlock.
---
Either way, you made the right call, and own it.

There are 2 in stormwind park.
---
My goal is Benediction/Anathema. So mad I missed out on that one originally.
---
Restoration druid for world PvP at 60, just keep your lock hotted and try to survive while her dots burn stuff down.
---
If you don't want to be forced to heal in end-game I would go for mage instead since 2 high dps ranged casters who both have cc abilities is quite powerful.
---
I'm confused about what you're saying. Is this still related to Classic already having cooldown timers on action bar buttons?
---

---
I don't think you will be able to do the Undead pet summon quests as an orc so you would have to go back for them.
---
How is the expectation that people communicate in public channels in-game by using English on English language realms casual racism?
---
65% horde or alliance?
---
My first took 14 days and i started at launch. I remember the guy - playing a hunter i think - that was a big deal when he came in under 5 days.
---
I am looking. What are you seeing that I don't?
---
Very tempted as they’re great flag carriers for WSG and the mobility is really useful but I spend most of my PVP time in AB
---
Remote in, get in queue before you leave. You’ll probably be in when you get home.
---
potentially  the most useful addon in the whole game imo. i hate the AH so much. EQ player here
---
you are a hero
---
Yes. You don’t need omnicc unless you want what I said.
---
Sooo.
---
I don't know of cases where someone cheated Gold. I know there have been mistakes on Blizzard side where you could "make" Gold by buying things of the vendor that actually sold more expensive to the vendor again.
---
But there is for sure flying hacks, and growth hacks, wallclimbing, speedhacking.
---
You just get banned within seconds or minutes because the Server instantly realizes.
---
I remember when Gold farmers used to advertise by writing their Website into Org by killing themselfs with cheats and forming a word with multiple dead bodies :D
---
Why am I getting a zoidberg vibe from the troll?
---
I would hope they bring ConsolePort to classic.
---
!remindme 1 month
---
Yes.  No.  Yes.  You may want to wait until you hit ~10 and then head over to Silverpine.
---
What does it do
---
Yeah but not in the 1-10 starting area so you would need to run back and forth to get new spells as you level.

Could you please explain me, how did Thex name become a meme? Im completely out of loop and im just seeing posts about this mediocre name
---
there is a lot of boss which is easier to tank woth 2h, 30 fire resist is okay too
---
What's your class? some classes only have their class trainers or level 10 class quest in their zones.
---
nah i always level whatever in the human zone , just travel time i think

Mages are literally the most valuable class in world pvp.
---
World pvp victory is win with numbers, and mage aoe scales against numbers.
---
The second best world pvp class, is any class with engineering.
---
Think you have articulated this better than me! My guess is maybe alot them to strange combinations that you wouldnt use?
---
It seems to flow really nicely, the aesthetic doesn't change so much. Agreed
---
I still don't see it as a RMT if it's using in game gold from the same game? People sell carries for in game gold on retail all the time and that is allowed. People trade gold cross realm on retail too.
---
Gayhannes and Majorhomo. 
---
Now, 15 years later, I'd feel slighty queasy using those name on a 40-man Teamspeak channel.
---
Awesome. I figured there is a priest trainer there so shouldn’t be any issues but wanted to confirm
---
100% remember it being called VC on Gilneas during vanilla. I remember whispering to join a "DM" run, assuming it meant deadmines because I was new.
---
Kinda anticlimactic, was expecting a crazy story behind the name lol. Thanks for the explanation tho.

I actually played for few months on some private server but I guess that's not the same as playing classic WOW.
---
Played a Warlock there and enjoyed it, definitely rolling one. Definitely going to enjoy every part of a classic MMO, playing like I was 12 again.
---
Only thing I'm gonna listen to others advice is I'm going to choose Orc over Undead (which I found cooler, but I remember that Orgrimmar was very cool, so that's ok) because I don't want to miss out on that stun resist Orcs have for PVP later on.
---
I'm reading guides about talents and classes all day, couldn't be more hyped lol
---
&gt; It's the place to be 
---
in a queue
---
You can't do the 1-5 quests of any other race.
---
You have to reach level 5 in your starting zone first then go to the undead zone.
---
For normal quest chains you won't be missing anything. Getting quests from your first Inn area have no pre-requirements.
---
About Class quests: I believe your first class quest needs to be done in your *original race town*. But not 100% sure about this.
---
You didn't wait as long for that group though ;)
---
Where does the 5% come from?
---
I thought women inspected each other's penises all the time?
---
2500 unique accounts with a character on the server.
---
I would say 7-8...Typically private servers with 7-8k people were completely playable but also felt very alive. Anything beyond can alter game experience. But heck, Nostalrius used to have 15,000 and you could still enjoy every aspect of the gaame
---
Horde.
---
Yea if you give people tools, you don't need to police the community.
---
at least in retail its normal to click repair all whenever you vendor something, at least in classic the repair bills are a lot most costly vs the amount of money you have,
---
Idk if u didn’t play the stress test and don’t know that they show a yellow dot on the minimap or you are unhappy with the distance from the NPC at which the dot appears...
---
People like a lock however you will be expected to get there asap to give the summon
---
Well, he's very likely to die a lot of times getting there...  Menethil Harbor is what, level 20, at least? But once you've done the run once, and picked up the flight paths, it'll be easier to commute.
---
I think the only thing you’ll miss out on is the quest to learn Desperate Prayer at level 10.
---
Not updated for classic. Over 50 pages of errors, this isn't a simple fix:

I’m having one of those don’t want to leave the house days but I’m putting on the podcast and heading out, god damn it! Thanks, Josh.

Some of us have multiple friends in multiple communities and seeing them split into different servers is something to freak out about after all the hard work of getting them all together.
---
$15 was worth reserving Demonshlong. See you all on Fairbanks!
---
Cool!
---
Holy shit, that actually looks like me
---
Did not ask.
---
Sorry I don't have friends to test on :(

Ok, you are making some fair points with the loot but it still doesn’t change the the other aspects layering effects. Which I listed above.

Seriously dude. Give your mantra a god damn rest. Look at this guys comment history lmao. On topic: Indeed. But the sooner layering is removed the better. Its an abomination.

I have one goal on Grobbulus enjoy the journey and create memories. I will pvp and raid and sometimes just fish in a beautiful spot waiting for the backstab. I am in no rush to get to the raiding content personally my first goals at 60 is get pre raid bis farm gold for the future and grind wintersaber rep after that is all done i will look for a casual raiding guild
---
This realization just made my day better. BElves never managed to feel like they fit the  Horde. Having a faction of anti-misfits would be a great idea if it wasn't for the fact that like 3/4 of all Horde players were BElves.

It'll be sound we won't be playing for the raids, just odd dungeons and PvP. I've decided not to remind her that shards took up inventory space.
---
LMAOO HORDE WANTING AN UNBALANCED SERVER POP TO STACK THE ODDS IN THIER FAVOR CUZ THEY CANT WIN OHERWISE.
---
why am i not surprised. let me guess - you play undead frost mage and run away from all wpvp unless its an ally warrior...?
---
That already happens...
---
So what would it hurt? Not the game or other classes.
---
During vanilla I don't think it was that uncommon, but leveling warrior without cooking was leveling the hardest class to level on hardmode.
---
For classic I would level cooking for every class except maybe mage
---
Where do you check?
---
Learn about populations and layering! Oh and enjoy fortnite!

You forgot ['bfa'](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2017-10-01%202019-08-15&amp;q=classic%20wow,wow%20bfa,battle%20for%20azeroth,bfa). Not sure if there are more phrases people use to search for classic? Search was also set to the UK only. Bfa has quite a bit more with that added. :(
---
Hi a bit late but hopefully someone can give me some tipps.  
---
My gf broke up with me two weeks ago so when classic comes out i have tons of time.  
---
I do work fulltime but besides that and weekend evenings im gonna play classic in my freetime which is about 4-6 hours on week days and probably 10 + hours on the weekend daytime. I also have taken of two weeks when classic launches.
---
Now the question, which class should i roll when i have that much time, sure there are people without jobs yadayada, but this is still a hefty amount of time to sink into  a class that benefits from much time investement.
---
I think warrior would be good since they scale hard with gear and more time roughly equals more gear right?
---
any other suggestions ?

I can’t remember if there was a shard bag or not. But yeah... it’s pretty rough. I had 2-3 guys forget raid lockouts were a thing.
---
&gt; asking me 9001 questions about the game
---
This is where you teach them the usefull skills, like say fishing or herbalism.
---
Yup will happen, won't matter.
---
you don't HAVE to have NS, but it's useful for a few reasons:
---
\-you're getting HOTW and you want to raid heal, so going down the healing tree makes logical sense (imp healing touch &amp; reflection help). 
---
\-NS is pretty damn useful for PVP. Especially as deep feral without as many ranged talents and survivability talents as a balance/resto pvp spec. You're going to be taking damage, and you can't deal damage as fast as other classes can (especially if opponent is geared). So you'll need decent healing. Having nature's focus/insect swarm help here as well.
---
\-NS and all spells are boosted by HOTW. Arguably, you are a stronger healer than a pure resto spec. It makes NS's usefulness in pve/pvp even better.
---
This.
---
Health pots, free action pots, buff your str, agi, sta.
---
Warriors are the most gear dependant. And what that means is stat dependant.
---
Yeah the run will be tough but I’ll soldier it out!
---
Or maybe, just a thought, know other people in relationships...
---
I did the same. Really don't know why people get so bent out of shape about this, it obviously varied with server and faction.
---
Boomkin piece of shit!
---

Stance dancing looks more complex then it really is.  It is druid forms without a visualization.  No one gets impressed by a druid that went bear to bash or cat to dash.

God damn. How in the hell did I mix Grimm and Mute together. My bad!

It's also been a day and a half.  That would be a day and a half too late if you are playing launch night.

The issue with askhandi is that they have to compete with the hunters for it.

I got this back in 2006 while playing Vanilla. It was an amazing weapon for a RetPala because you could kill clothies inside one stun. I don't think I'll be going for it again though.
---
Knight Online did the same thing.
---
People would /merchant to set up a shop somewhere (usually in a main city) and people could browse and buy any item the merchant put up. The /merchant mode would also yell out marketing line every couple of mins. Sadly you obviously had to leave your pc running too.
---
Great idea for an addon and great alternative to the auction house
---
“Classic wow”, “wow” and “bfa” would probably give a better representation of each for this comparison

Thank you both! This is great

AddIgnore is marked as depricated, my guess is that it is already removed on Classic but is still there on retail, hence why it works on retail and crashes and dies on Classic. I will fix it in a few. Thank you for testing.

Does anybody know if an addon called Sunn Art Viewport is being developed for classic, or if another similar mod is available?
---
true true
---
Can we take a second to discuss how terrible WoW addon documentation is across the board?
---
On twitch for instance the majority of the addons don’t even say what they do in the descriptions and have one useless screenshot that shows nothing about the addon.
---
Documentation on the Classic addon sites seems slightly more detailed, but still lacking across the board.
---
Can devs actually start providing info into what your addon does and how it looks? I don’t know how people haven’t made this into a bigger discussion because surely I can’t be the only one annoyed by this.

Unless Blizzard comes out and says it's against TOS, people will be willing to swap. Even if it was against the rules, Blizzard wouldn't be able to stop it completely. I predict exchange rate will be closer to 1 Classic gold per 800-2,000 Retail gold. Far too many people are multimillionaires in BfA for it to be any less.

All of you grinding non-stop to 60 are gonna be burned out with the game in a couple of months, if not within a few weeks.
---
Second this, find a sweet ass beach near a hotspot and just game on the beach alone. Don't forget a big umbrella, chair and cash for endless drinks.

And that’s just the top of the iceberg of the discord. Why being so attached to a server where you didn’t even start playing?

Did the armor stand come with it? Or did you get that separately? I've been looking for a good armor stand, and I can only find either shitty-looking wooden ones or sturdy-but-plastic ones.

I believe Dick begs to differ. Here’s some [proof](https://youtu.be/IN8X6PDCr4s)

Pro tip, move with your mouse
---
Final Fantasy XI and XIV also has a lot of possibilities regarding auction houses, and selling own stuff.
---
Why would you want to play on a dead server?
---
True, in addition BfA didn't really shoot up to those heights until a few days before the release either. If we compare both of them 15-20 days before release they are pretty similar, classic seems to have a slight lead by 4-5 points. Gonna check this again in a couple of days or so to check out 10-15 days before release.
---
Corrected. Thanks

Then don’t ask tbh.

Can somebody please explain the whole thex thing to me?

Always DM. None of this VC nonsense
---

Yes, it saved your settings since your last test. So if you were in mode 3 during last test it will stay in mode 3 after update.
---
Exactly this, so far I've only seen positive stuff about blizz opening another server
---
/r/humblebrag

We are grob.
---
I think that's part of their marketing strat honestly.  It looks really good when you gotta open new servers, and motherfuckers love some fresh.  They don't usually respond, but they are always listening to the chatter.
---
I wish we could go back to the before everyone was crazy times and the devs would talk pretty openly about ideas and stuff.  Now if they make one off comment you got 100 YouTube videos about how they are liars and the sky is falling.

One of those earlier sites that I'm sure I thought was really really funny back in 2001. 
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YTMND) 
---
This particular recording involving WoW was pretty popular back in Vanilla thanks to the endless sea of whining in the forums about basically every class and ability under the sun. I guess the more things change....
---
**YTMND**
---
YTMND, an initialism for "You're the Man Now, Dog", was an online community centered on the creation of hosted memetic web pages (known within the community as fads, YTMNDs or sites) featuring a juxtaposition of an image (still or short animation) centered or tiled along with optional large zooming text and a looping sound file. Images and sound files used in YTMNDs are usually either created or edited by users. YTMND is generally considered to be a humor website, owing its tone and culture to the original YTMND and its early imitators. Other YTMNDs, however, are artistic or political.

Don’t roll on the streamer server. You act like there’s so many of them with tens of thousands of followers. There’s like 3 that get over 10k and the rest are in the hundreds.

ragnarok was like that too

I just hope your prepared to meet players like these anywhere.

That's OK, there are lots of that guy! :D
---
I was hoping I didn't have to do this. Currently have 0.6 mbps dl speed in my stone age country. Thst 50GB gonna take forever
---
The cardio part is basically running to get some food.
---
I agree with everything you said, except rogue skillcap. Honestly there is little to no skill in playing a rogue in vanilla. Even with engineering, your main goal is to execute 1 rotation to a player and flee.
---
I'd say warrior, mage, hunter are the top 3.
---
Gonn a be tough to level mining week one though, with the competition for nodes going on.
---
Hey, how about calling it "who fucking cares, they both work, please shut up about this already"
---
Id be sad cause i looove the leveling in classic
---
The germans got themself their own server, so you germans better use that one
---
I have a little less time to play then you.
---
But I also have almost 2 weeks off..
---
I will be going warrior without a doubt.
---
Its going be rough and its going to be tough!
---
But in the end it's so much worth it I think!
---
Go for warrior!
---
but i cant really use that build for raiding, damn.,
---
The indicators are based on other realm populations, so it's supposed to have a new player pick a lower populated one. There is no such thing as "full", it's effectively a lock to force players into another realm by not allowing character creation unless you already had one there.
---
I'm sad, nobody appreciates your Al Bundy parody. :(
---
Those were five impressive touch downs.
---
This would be awesome.
---
Internet there is really bad. Like real bad. Be sure to get a good airbnb if laptop is your play.
---
When legendary items were actually legendary
---
brah communism is all about industrialization, they just want to seize the means of production, not to halt it
---
omg unrealistic meme!
---
I'm terrible with the auction house and the addons that improve it, so something like this would be really awesome. I also plan on playing on an EU RP realm, so this only adds to the roleplay value of a character; I reckon this would suit a fence of stolen goods nicely!
---
Anyone that understands premade strategy and is willing to heal will be desired. You’re just not the optimal class for the role is all.
---
I have the names Dusk and Dawn on Stalagg. Willing to trade for names on Herod.
---
Yeah, and getting the Brushwood Blade on my Warrior! Amazing upgrade.
---
I really hope The Legend of Thex will be remembered for decades to come, just like Leeroy and his P4Ls.
---
Ummm.... 56/44 is pretty fucking bad actually. That's a 12% difference. That's a LOT.  Horde queue times are going to be really, really bad.

You could also roll Troll Shaman for Taz'dingo
---
Anyone else miss the days when everyone wasnt a know it all professional player and streamer and just picked shit based on what they like instead of trying to min max every little detail.
---
I remember tons of cheaters like botting , flying hack , speed hack , scam for boost in raids and ..
---
Not at all. We made millions.
---
All though we can't be sure, it seems like this is true due to:   
---
1. Tribe's stream and discord server: A lot of different talks around why they picked Gehennas, talks and trades to get names etc.   
---
2. Monkeynews got his name while streaming yesterday. Mods on his stream wrote about a bunch of other APES members securing their names on Gehennas as well.   
---
3. Hydra's GF tried to get his name while he was streaming yesterday on Gehannas, but was not able to get it.   
---
It seems like this decision was finally made due to the swedish scene going Gehennas with solid guilds, and the fact that a majority of them got their original names on the new server.
---
What? The us get it on the 27th of August on a Tuesday.
---
From what I've heard you can use that build for raiding IF your guild isn't super hardcore. I'm sure plenty of guild wont be saying no to a competent healer
---

totally agree, this is an irreplaceable moment. Season two of this epic adventure opening up with all the buzz of our endless enthusiasm!
---
just imagine you get a queue when trying to login in on an english realm because of the germans there... https://i.imgflip.com/382020.jpg
---
Yes community will be spread anyway between the three servers. At least so far I can properly discuss with mature people on Golemagg discord for the next 10 days! See you on release !
---
Durotar's my favourite. I like deserts, plus it transitions nicely into The Barrens.
---
I can't stand Mulgore. Too much wide open space and the mob density is putrid.
---
Why did you get downvoted?
---
I will not resub only for name reserve. 2 weeks of bfa is too much.
---
Im torn between Warlock, Shaman and Mage
---
**Warlock** - Seems to scale really well but has more of a rot playstyle rather than big crits and exciting oh shit moments which I love
---
It also has the easiest time leveling of the 3 so questing could actually be very enjoyable
---
**Mage** - Lot of in your face upfront damage, food and water are really nice to have along with portals. But it seems very samey after a while spamming frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, etc. Might get boring to me
---
**Shaman** - This is the class I've been leaning to alot, it has good damage for pvp and later as ele-resto can 1-3 shot people, whic seems fun as hell, it can also heal if I want some variety from killing people, tons of utility too
---
The downside? It seems kind of at a disadvantage in PvP situations, mages run circles around you, warlocks outlast you, it just seems like you're always fighting an uphill fight as a shaman, I dont know if I want to put myself in that situation
---
Any thoughts? suggestions?
---
Kekked and checked.
---
Oh I’ll always give thanks to a janitor. I just won’t bow to him.
---
Yeah - from private Server Prices I can tell you that you will Need more like 5-6 Tokens for 1000g and that is a few month into the Expansion.
---
3 Tokens for 500 Gold seems reasonable (maybe you Need 4 even depending on when you plan to trade) but Gold is expensive af on a fresh realm. 
---
After a year or two you can defenitely go for that when you find someone with the spare coin
---
Hehe fair!
---
I would go druid. An easy to learn hard to master pick! I picked druid back in the days.
---
The only disappointment I later on had with druids was their general dps..
---
But that doesn't have to be the case for you. I was just really bad back then..
---
Yea and totems are a bitch to me. Respect to all shamans but I couldn't do it!
---
It only takes one with a gang of followers to corner the devilsaur market.
---
Don't let your memes be dreams!
---
Yep, Managed to remake my Main Main with appearance although he's gonna be hidden by the armor 24/7, he is now good to go! just had default random that came up in one click when I saved name on name day launch.
---
Just think about all the people who didn't sub just to reserve a name. More servers will be needed 100%. 
---
Layering will be disabled at some point - it just can't be the other way. Just think about the world bosses....
---
True. And I don't think Paladins should be fixed. At least not until after phase 5. But the baseline taunt the other two specs have should be a given.
---
Okay, *that* can understand, but if you're just working with your 3, I'd assume most people would want to snag their main and 2 alts names on their primary server.
---
Herod
---
I listened to a lot of Daft Punk back then, so yes.
---
And that’s different than anyone else farming it? You don’t have friends that help you do things?
---
It's when I realise that a 15 year old game is *all* I have to look forward to that I feel my worst
---
Samwise is one of the big boys at Blizzard, up there with Metzen.
---
The average pserver player is just as bad. Its not like they are two entirely different groups of people, both groups have the same distribution of bad and good players.
---
&gt;till say Cloak of Shadows is and was some fuckin'
---
Cloak is completely fair and totally balanced :)
---
Sorry in advance if I step on you. I usually don't look that far down besides when I tie my shoes.
---
I'd kill for a good note app.  I used to use my ignore list for people who sucked for one reason or another, but notes would be better.
---
thast a pot
---
It's the same for us. We're over 50 norwegians, only me and the guildleader is part of the discord.
---
Only all the time. Rolling NE priest for the looks.
---
Whener I see a female troll, tauren or dwarf, I stop and just look at them for a bit and wonder who that person is. What drives a person to pick one of those. 
---
Deep down I respect them, because they are very rare.
---
I cant believe were less than 2 weeks away and people still dont know.
---
its the 26th for NA realms.
---
Only melee attack power. Which means it does not benefit hunter ranged weapons. It does benefit hunter pets.
---
Does Blizzard have any available info regarding retail average online players vs overall subscribers?
---
The Dwarves head is on the same hight as the nelves booty.
---
I think he will be alright :D
---
Cloak is completely fair and balanced :)
---
Dude everywhere I google it says 27th. Even on this IGN post says the 27th
---
Was a difficult decision to make to go against what I had before since I’m really playing classic for nostalgia - but the flip side is I get to make choices that I think are going to improve my experience, rather then the painful choices I stuck with when I didn’t know better.
---
Hi! I just made an addon that automatically screenshots when you level up. Can you test it please?  [DingPics](https://github.com/fouronnes/DingPics)
---
That was the answer I was looking for. Cheers! 
---
Looks like I will travel from Mulgore over to Durotar, do all the orc quests there and then be on my merry way to deep into revered when I hit 60.
---
NE Rogue here, for sure I'll get laughed at but I couldn't care less about racials.
---
I'll freely admit I don't understand Reddit very well, but what the hell is this post? How did this get upvoted?
---
It's obvious that the servers will have an upper limit to concurrent population even with layers, because Blizzard doesn't want huge numbers of players getting comfortable on a single server. So there will be queues, not for some technical reason but for game balance reasons, because the server will be literally full - so yes, people will be waiting for other people to log off before they get in. Because the server is full. Because Blizzard needs some push/pull to get players to distribute evenly and join the additional servers they'll be opening gradually until and possibly post release.
---
Blizzard hates him!

---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
scroll down to launch times.
---
lmao IGN
---
Might as well get an account to use with the wowhead client and addon. Their database relies on user submitted data on pretty much everything. It collects:
---
*     NPC locations and maps
---
*     Droprates and item sources, including dungeon loot
---
*     Vendor Costs and Sold By Tab
---
*     Quest Progress and Completion Text
---
*     Quest Start and Finish NPCs
---
*     Translated NPCs and Quests
---
*     Quest Maps and Objectives
---
*     Ordered Quest Series
---
*     Adding NPCs and Quests
---
*     Quest Experience
---
A lot of other addons rely on this data to be made accurate, such as drop rates for AtlasLoot.
---
Fuck that.  Don't let the two Georges collide.
---
With that build youll be absolutely gimped without the key talents in resto tree. Casual raiding guilds will make you spec for manatide. And organized pug MC will most likely too, since they can just take another shaman with tje right spec.
---
Just pay the respec costs every week as we all do and youll be just fine. You can do random BG's with the PvE spec quite fine too, but might be a little annoying.
---
I mean it’s the first post that show up when I google the release date. There’s multiple sites that say .27th
---
MobInfo2, tough I don't know how well it works on classic since I will only resub after 27th so I can't test it.
---
God dammit...
---
Proof the alliance are little girls who are afraid to PvP
---
That's awesome! Will be using thanks!
---
Lol thats crazy
---
&gt; You'll also want Feline Swiftness ASAP as it is ***amazing*** for leveling before you get Travel Form. 30% movement speed in cat is great. 
---
100% this.  Feline Swiftness is like having the sun come up after a long, dark night when leveling.
---
I'm trying to convince my OCE brother to play on EU with me for a real experience for him :P
---
Great idea
---
Nah, 'Blizzard' gets blocked saying it contains mature content.
---
Ppl want vanilla as what it was before but wanna download all retail features as addons hmm interesting
---
If you put all the expansions on there as topics, which takes two graphs as it can only plot five things at a time. [One](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F06zmlf,%2Fm%2F02wv_3y,%2Fm%2F07kd817,%2Fm%2F0h95x6d,%2Fm%2F0z2nc6f), [Two](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F07kd817,%2Fm%2F0h95x6d,%2Fm%2F0z2nc6f,%2Fg%2F11bw8dv9c5,%2Fg%2F11f26m_ds0) it looks like interest peaked at Cataclysm, declined massively with Mists and built up a little with each expansion after before crashing with BFA.
---
But Mists and BFA seem to have some erroneous data from before wow even came out so I don't think the topic search is actually working properly. It is clearer on a [shorter timeline](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2010-01-01%202019-08-15&amp;q=%2Fm%2F07kd817,%2Fm%2F0h95x6d,%2Fm%2F0z2nc6f,%2Fg%2F11bw8dv9c5,%2Fg%2F11f26m_ds0).
---
There isn't a topic for wow classic yet so I can't compare it.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule August 26th 3pm.
---
At this point I shouldnt even mention it, it'll just save queue time for everyone else lmao
---
I was quite Young when I first played on my Brothers account.
---
I used to watch him and knew that he was always low on Gold. He had just gotten his 60% Mount at Level 51.
---
So I played his character like the noob I was and realised that the armor he was wearing actually sells for Gold. All I thought was that he would like some Gold again. 
---
Ahead I went selling all the gear on his shaman. He was literally naked without a weapon.
---
That was the day he Changed his Password for the first time :P
---
He forgave me - I mean I was Young and only wanted the best for him...
---
Unlucky I had already logged out :/ I think Blizzard gave him the items back though I should ask him
---
Remember how what everyone actually has said, keeps saying, and are correct in saying that Blizzard will open new servers if they need to, and if they don't open new servers then it's because they don't need to? Because that's gonna be true until the end of time, as evident by them opening a new server.
---
&gt; From what I've heard you can use that build for raiding IF
---
Stormwind too.
---
what server?
---
everyone gets at the same time, so the exact time that is that the clock shows varies by where you. in USA it is the 26th in the afternoon. other places its midnight of 27th and so on.
---
Terribile experiences in last games/years
---
I played in the night elf zone for 3 months thinking it was the entire game then accident walked through the portal in darnassus one day
---
It’s 00:01 on the 27th CEST. As NA is a couple of hours behind, that would equal sometime in the afternoon on the 26th (depending on location).
---
I mean to each their own. You are throwing all your plans out the window for an rng situational racial ability. If you are going for absolute min max why not just roll a gnome?
---
This is what I assumed the post was about when I clicked on it lol.
---
That’s so weird that they are advertising it that way.
---
I’m curious how 2h fury with hand of rag would stack up with 1h available at that tier ( bar ironfoe felstriker type stuff). Definitely not a long term option.
---
You should at least get level 5, you won't be able to do the starting zone quests
---
I mean you said everywhere on google, that blizz post was the second thing on there.

Wait, where are these old-fashiones-root-beer-melons?!
---
Whoever got Sirus. You better level that fucker up to 60 and dominate Naxx. That's not a scrub's name!
---
Or maybe horde have better PvP racials and Alliance are superior in PvE? Logic hurts
---
yeah lol ive been broadcasting LF wow classic gf for a couple months through various channels have not found any metalhead gothic sub girl to join up with me yet. LOL.

i want a heavy metal adventure gaming psychonaut kink GF. she's out there somewhere, i am sure. maybe i will meet her in the game world itself first.

Seems pretty nifty, would like to see how it comes along.
---
One site says one thing. 4 other sites say another thing.
---
I‘m with you, but Thunderbluff is really cozy and I only hang out there if I play Horde. It‘s really chill music up there too. And you can feel the wind breeze through your short cape.
---
As an alliance only player I demand you remove this post.. It's a little too real and cuts a little too deep :'(
---
I think you are grossly underestimating the overlap. E.g. Name reservation and beta both require a sub and why wouldnt you reserv a name . So thats only 100k.
---
Im not trying to be pessimistic but i think we have quite enough servers. Yes there will be queues on launch + 2 weeks but then it‘ll blow over. Not because of ppl quitting but normal life setting in.
---
Lmao good luck bub
---
That‘s my fetish
---
Lol at those level 20's going to dire maul /s
---
Two worst for me were buying vendor white gear as a druid and trying to jump off Teldrassil. I spent hours trying to make it to certain branches, especially up north nesr the river. If a gm was watching me they would of thought I was legit retarded.
---
The only thing logic points to is Alliance being little carebear babies.
---
Watching two bad players fight&gt;watching high tier players fight
---
&gt; other stuff requires a reboot of the virtual machine.
---
Which shouldn't matter either since it's probably load balanced regardless. Just keep a few nodes online at a time and you shouldn't ever have an outage because of rebooting servers. I'd be willing to bet that maintenance for WoW is when they take down the application only, and it has nothing to do with the servers underneath it.
---
That‘s such an alliance thing to say
---
Concussive is mostly pre 10
---
my experience was that some quests didn't show up but most do, and have plenty of experience running my other characters to start in deathknell. Including my first tank that I played as a tauren in BC.
---
Still having second thoughts about warrior vs warlock as main. I love both classes but afraid rolling warrior as second would leave it in the dust.
---
I did it around 3am and it was super safe
---
I still get nostalgia flashbacks whenever I hear a song I used to listen to during vanilla. You hear the song as it's like damn, and right then you're back 15 years grinding twilight cultists in silithus. It used to be met with sadness for the loss of such a pivotal time in life but now it just fuels the hype!

Oh really? So I need to get out of the aldrassil area before I can pick up quests

The author went for the cheap Hunter weapon joke when druid is sitting right there on the table for them.

Elune be with you

Remember, as long as you bring innervate for the priests and a combat ress, you're golden. Just remember that you won't top the healing charts. You might not be the healer to be geared first. You will probably be coerced into a resto role (Which seems like a no point for you).
---
As long as you can accept those three drawbacks, you will have a great time and guilds will generally be happy to add druids to their roster. Don't worry at all!
---
Your dps was probably shit
---
10 days played is absolutely horrible for hardcore guilds.  The bulk of their players will be 60 10 days from launch, not 10 days /played.  It is super easy to get 60 in 7 days /played if you have any experience doing it, put the tiniest amount of research in, and actually focus on it.  Hardcore guilds will have rag down before the 2nd raid reset.  Every other raid will be killed day of release by multiple guilds on every single pvp server.  This is the reality of a 15 year old game that has been run to death by many of these people.
---
Working on professions is relaxing though! Gathering? Go to opposite faction low level areas and gather.
---
Then just relax in the city while you craft your way up

26th for na, 27th for europe, we all start @ the exact same moment globaly.

Different times/dates tho because of the different timezones.

It was definitely VC for me back in vanilla,  no idea why people are so butthurt about this.

thats racist!🤡

All of these comments also happened back in vanilla, it’s great. #nochanges lol

And how do you know it will be 50k.

Also, have you seen the og statistic that most of the players that ever started wow never made it past lvl 20. not overly relevant but still.
---
So weird that they are all saying the 27th without mentioning the actual timezone. People would just assume it would be near their local timezone if it wasn't included.

I feel like they would fit much better if Lor'Themar had more presence in Horde affairs from the beginning. Genn and Velen are incredibly involved in everything the Alliance does, which really makes Worgen and Draenei fit because it makes those races feel involved as well. When it comes to BElves, well, i sometimes forget Lor'Themar exists.

Halo was too good to pass up lol, plus had a potato for a machine lol. I feel like i missed out on a great community game back though. Hopeing to atleast get a taste of what it was like back then. So damn late, better when your an adult and can do whatever you want with your money haha

I have first hand experience of a guy who farmed weeks with me in DM:E (he was shaman, I was warrior) while I completly geared a warrior from scratch to full raid gear, he was farming thousands of gold for his hammer.
---
*One* ingot goes for as much as 1000g. You need 9 of them + all the other mats. More casual to semi hardcore guilds who don't plough through content and have no stakes in prestige and PvP will not shell out 10.000 to 15.000 gold for some random PvP item.

It is possible that websites recognize your time zone and shows you release date and time in your time zone :)

I agree, this does seem possible.

That's a weird looking Horde flag, I think you got the wrong one.

---
&gt;Only way you are going to be disappointed is by playing a class you don't enjoy.
---
I mean it's not that I don't enjoy shaman at all. It's a close second. And being refused for groups with a class I enjoy would definitely result in disappointment. So would feeling replaceable in raids.
---
You're probably right though. My first instinct has been Druid since I started thinking about playing Classic. I'm just letting myself get talked out of it by agonizing over all the people saying druids weren't good in vanilla. The one that really hit me hard was one of my own guildies who was one of the best druids I knew in vanilla telling me the same thing.
---
This of course depends on the server, but I almost made goldcap since 8.2 on a high pop realm where prices are low.
---
Key thing is to buy cheap.
---
My goal is to get Predition Blade :(
---
Hunter is the easiest class to have one spec that’s good for pve and pvp.

Beast mastery is not part of that though.

I have leveled a couple warlocks over the years, most recently I did so on a private server and used dark pact along with something similar to to build to see how it went, and it went fantastic.
---
Dark pact is **great** if you are juggling 2-3 mobs constantly, which is what you do with this build, you use your imp/succubus as an *additional* mana battery, which means you can move and grind even faster and larger numbers of mobs at once. What dark pact lets you do, is more quickly return to a full health and mana status than regular life tap -&gt; draining, waiting, whatever would do. It is more micro intensive, but it does work very well. 
---
Spirit ties into the build concept, which is basically regen as mobs tick down, it is not a bad stat at all, and you don't need massive health if you have the double mana battery from imp 
---
Nightfall optional? sure, you wont be wasting mana on shadowbolts, so its optional, personally I took it because its fun, but when efficiently grinding at max potential, shadowbolt wasnt something I would ever use.
---
You obviously feel strongly about your own talent choices but so did I until I changed things around. This build is insanely, ridiculously efficient, and the sky is the limit on how much you can grind with it. You can easily juggle 4+ mobs with decent gear, which makes for really fast grinding.
---
The idea here is to push the possible mana regen to that limit, and use all of that extra mana to increase your exp/kills per hour through chain killing and pulling endlessly, and faster than regular life tap alone would allow for.

I mean, it's cool, that you added paladins, but the ret paladin list on wowclassicbis is so terrible. Even a month or so after they added it, it still has leggings in the boots slot for the first two phases and overall is just wrong on so many items (Far too much hit, far too little spelldmg, many pointless items, not accounting for racials (arcanite reaper is a terrible weapon choice if you are human).
---
Let‘s see if you‘ll say it again, when you realize Blizz was full of shit and layering will stay in the game.
---
I think people are underestimating just how many people have yet to create a character - all we've seen so far is the hardcore people who are on this sub and are keeping up with the news.  There'll be many more who are wating until 27th to resubscribe and choose a server.
---
I can see them adding even more servers after launch.
---
Go full arcane made and spam arcane missiles!

Thank you very much! I hope you get good rng karma for this when the game launches.

Missed a chance to just put 420 my good man
---
Feugen sounds cooler too, tbh.
---
I was playing a druid healer because my cousin told me that's what really are the classes they needed.
---
So I made my druid and started leveling... But I thought since I was a healer I could only use the healing spells.
---
So I leveled from 1 till 60 only with auto attacks and a lot of self healing. On this day I still don't understand how I even kept playing like this. 
---
My cousin rolled a mage and leveled around 2 levels per evening playing. I leveled once every 2/3 evenings. 
---
Also I did not understood the difference between stats. So I was focusing on getting all stats equally. Of course now I do understand why people got angry at me for needing on certain items.
---
I played DaoC with italians 2001-2008 and it was a blast. Nobody cares what nationality you are if you atleast make the effort to type/speak English with others.
---
There are rules?
---
It says 1st week in the damn title. The first week isn't even a full week. Doesn't matter if it's a reset week or an actual week it can never be more than 7 days
---
They are already releasing the 15th anniversary collector's edition which has a lot of references to Classic of course. I think it's a reasonable decision to not release a Classic CE on top of that.
---
When was their golden time?
---
Whenever I try to get into Penny Arcade it seems to just be a statement of fact/a joke that has an interesting story, but no punch.

I think mage is not that boring, in raids it might be frostbolt spam, but while leveling you use frostbolt, fireblast, blizzard, cone of cold, frost nova, arcane explosion, blink, etc. Also fun in world pvp. I leveled a warrior, mage and rogue on a pserver recently and mage was definitly the most fun. The only thing I didn't like was the drinking.
---
6% mace stun is very bad, because it DRs with other abilities and with itself.
---
If you fight in a prolonged teamfight and you proc sword spec 5 times, you have 5 more swings. 
---
If you proc mace 5 times, the proc DRs heavily and you barely get any stuns off.
---
I tried using Malowns Slam instead of an Arcanite Reaper in early PvP progression and it is seriously underwhelming. Everytime you have a 0,5 or "immune" mace stun, you'd wish to swing another 800damage white hit.
---
Also mace stuns dont generate rage while axe +5% crit and swords do.
---
I actually have a question, maybe you can help me: As a "new" player my initial thought was to roll on a PvE realm. For my understanding I won't be destroyed be people without me being able to do anything about it, but still can participate in BGs once they come out.
---
Would you say that it's probably gonna get boring once I got the hang of WOW? should I play on PVP from the beginning on?
---
I'm levong a warrior and it's my first time since classic, is there any way I can speed up an already slow process ?
---
Lionheart is phase 1, Titanic is phase 5.
---
Who knew that Warrior came last in an alphabetical order list of classic
---
I'd call it Swedish. Considering they are fronting themselves as all Nordic guilds, it's very misleading for the rest of the community.
---
Personally I like that there are 3 servers. Am rolling on Gehennas with a few friends and the rest of the Swedish community. Got to reserve some decent names as well. Should I end up on Chadzrah or Swolemagg instead I can always name a new character.
---
this part sucks, I almost forgot/missed some quests when I was testing tauren starter zone. I am going oldschool and will read my quest and use google/wowhead to assist, just wish the "!" was visible on the map just like "?"
---
Imo [https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1087](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1087) is a great guide with everything you need but only for Horde Warlock.

Probably Shazz. I want the biggest server innit.

Evanescence. Take me back.

---
You're god damn right. Getting sulfuras was a huge achievement for the player and the guild, and showed that the guild is capable of going through huge efforts to equip players with gear. Which then naturally attracted more players to them. It was a big fame thing back in the day.
---
Evanescence.
---
On a side note, is it worth leveling armoursmith as you level for plate gear ?
---
that looks like a retail model...
---
Upto what level? Getting 125 mining is the real test of endurance. Also I'm unsure how comparable stress test is to actual launch.
---
I love this, thanks blizz!
---
it's updated on wowace now
---
On his stream. He's asked constantly about his record, if he plans on trying to break his own record, what class he thinks gets first 60, stuff like that. His streams are pretty dry, but he's obviously very knowledgeable when it comes to speed running.
---
Do they though?
---
The issue is, who yould even want retail gold, its worthless...
---
THey rehired new people in most of those positions QA/CM

They were just dumping staff so no one expected raises or changes to improve their jobs.  Now they have new hires to be dumped next year.

---
Best time I had in this game was WotLK on my Death Knight. Which class is the closest to that in terms of lore and then playstyle? Been thinking mostly paladin but I wanna know my options.
---
aight, thanks. one more question, i read somewhere that besides taerar dropping lionheart helm recipe, it is a world drop aswell, right?
---
It's more along the lines: the only player willing to put in the work.
---
Warriors won't want the item normally. Most paladins already healing will not want to be retardin with all their shortcomings and underwhelming PvP prowess.
---
It really often comes down to: "Who wants it? WHO WANTS IT?! I will destroy it if nobody wants it!".
---
15.000gold to craft such a mediocre item is really no small feat.

This time I'm rolling shaman, so windfury + ironfoe is mandatory :-)

I'm pretty sure he is able to do starter zone quests unless there is something special with nelf
---
I'm currently working on an extensive equipment guide for ret, I can give you a link to it, if you are interested.
---
Yes, a few ways:
---
1. Have a weapon progression plan from vendors and quests. There are a few now here and on YouTube. 
---
2. If you follow a guide, keep a couple levels higher than the guide. Green mobs are much better for you to take down - more crits from you, and far less damage to you. 
---
3. Prioritise doing some dungeons with their respective quests to help keep geared up.
---
My first experience was in cata, you know the tiny chapel in the human starting zone? I got lost in there and couldn't get out so I deleted my character, after which I made a new one, again a human, but I swore I won't step a foot in there. After I did all quests which weren't picked up inside and didn't level a single ability I got bored and deleted the game until a few years later I played on a private server with friends.
---
I think his joke was an incel comment and he's backpedaling.
---
I remember in vanilla detect invisibility warlock buffs helped me alot. Might have been placebo effect mostly but I had a easier time not getting jumped on.
---
How can you not log off so you don‘t get put in queue? You will eventually get kicked for being afk. Unless you‘re on your computer moving your character every once in a while.
---
Should I do the quests in Ashevale as Human or Dwarf? I always skip the NE zones from level 1 to level maybe 40. If I should do it, at what level should I go?
---
For the best experience leveling PVE. You don't have to worry about getting ganked you just play the game naturally. if you choose to PVP out in the world you can choose to enable PVP. But you can only engage with other people who have it enabled.
---
On a PVP server it's the same thing except once you leave the under level 20 area and you going to stonetalon as horde or ashenvale or you go into like redridge mountains for alliance. Any horde/alliance you encounter will be automatically flagged and attackable. Now this is the most fun experience you can have and it can also be the most annoying. let's say you only have a couple of hours to play and you end up getting camped for 2 hours by the opposite faction. Now there are no BGs for the entire phase 1 of classic. So world PVP which will only happen on a PVP server so it is your only source for PVP. 
---
I've never played on an RP server, or an RP PVP server so I have no comment on that.
---
[Here’s somewhat of an explanation](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/spell-batching-in-classic/137118/2). The way I understand it is that no matter when you press your spell, it won’t go off until its batch window is done. For example, say you press the spell at 30 ms into a batch, it won’t go off until 200ms into the batch (if that’s the batch length Blizzard chose). This means that small differences in ping won’t really matter as much as in retail, where batch sizes are very tiny.
---
Out of curiosity, what could you do with it that you can't do with any of the others?
---
Yeah I don't understand exactly but this is what google says about that Y axis 
---
&gt;"Interest over time
---
Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term."

---
Only the leaving part would suck.
---
All holies, rets, resto shamans, enhancers, furies, tanks etc. are allowed to spend their DKP on it.
---
It is a 99% PvP item and nobody should have dips on it.
---
Go to the Classic folder, then interface and then Addons.
---
if you are a paladin, you won't have any trainers anywhere close by. The other classes should have no problems.
---
I don't understand why everyone in here with experience in IT/virtualization/distributed apps is acting like the technology is what's in question. Just because you can *basically* scale virtual servers infinitely doesn't mean you'd ever want to. These things are expensive, and far more often than not, bottlenecks are caused by bad code; not technical limitations. 
---
I have no idea how seriously Blizzard is taking the launch of classic WoW, and it might be the case they're ready to drop some serious cash to make everything go smoothly. They might have really brought their A game to the programming task required to launch classic. But this is Blizzard and it honestly wouldn't be a surprise if they managed to flub it one way or another.
---

I feel completely out of the loop. Who is Thex?

---
Want those huge chain lightning crits on your shaman? Drink 100g flasks in PvP and other +sp consumes.
---
If the server name just wan‘t ugly. Seriously, say it out loud, it‘s disgusting.
---
I would say Lore wise it would be Paladin. Playstyle seems to be Paladin as well or possibly Warrior, both are plate wearers and both can Tank/DPS and Paladin can also heal if you're into that. Warlock has some similarities to Unholy DK, with using shadow damage/dots/pet also
---
Fair but Fortnite also gets way more marketing then WoW Classic and has been a huge game for a long time.  Classic hasn't even started yet.
---
For macros I really liked stopcast macros.  Very useful for iceblock, blink, frost nova, counterspell, polymorph, fitebast, etc.  
---
Basically if you’re in the middle of casting a spell and let’s say an enemy starts to cast a heal.  Instead of either moving, jumping, or hitting esc to cancel the spell and then casting counterspell, the macro will cancel your currenint spell then cast counterspell, all in one button.
---
I’ve also heard of iceblock macro to basically instantly cast and then remove it instead of the very minor delay that would come from manually doing it.
---
For keybinds:  one thing I really enjoyed was making my rank 1 spells (frostbolt, fireblast for pulling, arcane explosion, blizzard, cone of cold for kiting) using the shift key.  So my frostbolt was normally 1 for max rank and shift+1 for rank 1.  Very helpful!
---
Tips for AoE farm: 
---
1) to make larger aoe pulls (example would be pulling every single non elite mob  hearthglen) without them running away back to their normal spot would be to keep tagging them.  Best way to do that is rank 1 arcane explosion/rank 1 cone of cold.  You don’t have to over do it, just enough to keep them from running away.
---
2) permafrosted cone of cold slow duration is 11 sec slow, 10 sec cooldown.  Therefore you can also just kite using only cone of cold,
---
3) be careful of 3/3 improved blitz with cone of cold.  Imp blitz with permafrost is a high slow than CoC, therefore the CoC slow would not apply unless the improved blizzard falls off (4 sec slow).
---
Majority of us did it this past weekend in the Stress Test, if you missed out you'll have to wait until launch :(
---
You are now forever immortalised in our favourite game. How does that feel, Wolfbrother Thex?
---
Have you had any idea when you posted yet another name thread that you will achieve such fame?  
---
With great power though..

I'm pretty sure he won't be able to do the quests 1-5 in the nelf zone
---
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. That wasn't me who posted this.
---
Eat a dick.
---
Just FYI the scandinavian coalition is going to gehennas. http://nordicclassic.jinnis.se/
---
Learn english krauts
---
Doesn’t matter because 75-80% of all the English PvP realms will be English.
---
Does it involve spell power and in gear?
---
Did you just say "I want the biggest server isn't it." in non tea?
---
Yes, it's an ultra rare world drop with increased drop chance on raid bosses. It's something like 0.001% on everything  high level (mobs, chests, lockboxes) and 0.5-1% on world bosses and raid endbosses.
---
It depends on your class. If you are a melee class heavily dependent on gear, I would lean towards Westfall to get some Deadmines gear, at least before you go to Ashenvale. 
---
Ashenvale is best done in two parts - about 20-22 (then Stonetalon if you like), and later about 25-27. However the bulk of quests there are chains, so if you want to make it worthwhile make sure you have a guide or a list of the chains.
---
I'd skip the s#!tfest that would be the first week after the launch even if I wasn't going to Bali.
---
If you have a friend or group to level with I'd say go with Warrior first. Warlock can solo level pretty easily and won't require much help, so if you are going solo route I would say start with Warlock.
---
Most things work, but when I tried enabling xp/rep bar on the Player frame, I got errors.
---
Yes!
---
😂😂😂
---
Can’t wait to grind out to Offspring and Red Hot Chili Peppers :)
---
Not to mention the majority of players will not sub early to get their name. People say I’m wrong but that’s totally crazy talk. Most players will sub and play when the game comes out. And they will probably just take the server with the shortest queue times.
---
Nordic people speak English well and are therefore not a ”problem” in this case. If Russians, the French and the Germans didn’t have their own servers you would see the same posts about them, particularly the French and Russians.
---
I think fury 2h maybe can use it?
---
given I think the alternative 1h are not the greatest and not from 60, although from my memory 60 didn't mean much.
---
is there a simcraft of this rofl
---
You what
---
This was before names were selected, Thex did an oopsie!
---
I want to play Gnome Warlock, but everybody saying how Will of the forsaken makes alliance locks suck, because most horde play undead, makes me sad.
---
I was using his numbers, that i guess are yk just a guess. I just explained that in his example he would not be using enough overlap.
---
Btw „people i know“ is anekdotal evidence.
---
And while Blizzard might take the route of opening servers as they are needed and start on the low end i think the more i read here the more i am convinved that most of the posters here dont work in buisness/procurment the prediction models used there today are crazy accurate and why would a company like blizzard not utilite those.
---
Why is this so important anyway? If im playing on a server with 3000-50000 why do i care if there are 10, 20, 50 or 1000000 other servers?
---
Gehennas

Ironfoe was simed to be better than all other MHs safe Kel'thuzad weapons if you used full consumes and wbuffs.
---
This was considered overpowered and they nerfed the 10% proc rate down to 3-4%.
---
The guy working towards this nerf was somebody who ran BRD lava runs over 500 times never acquiring it. Once a similar item dropped off Kazzak, he did a 180° and tried to revert the nerfs to IF and Empyrean Demolisher respectively, because both got nerfed in that "fix".
---
People just assumed that the time that he had an axe to grind with IF as it never dropped for him, therefore he advocated for a unfounded nerf.
---
In classic we will see for the first time if the 4% or the 10% proc rate is the actual correct one. Either is possible.

As a Skandinavian I have yet to meet someone that dislikes Italian people, heck I'm even gonna learn your language in the near future.

If you go to bali, you will regret not playing classic right away for a couple months until you get to 60. Maybe 3 if you level slow. 
---
But if you play classic instead of bali, you will regret it the rest of your life. Even if you decide to go later in life. 
---
I spent my golden birthday as a teenager with my friends at a sleepover playing smash bros. I had an amazing time, but whenever i look back at it, i wish i had spent that time with my family instead.
---
I went the other way.
---
That's actually a secret lvl 60 raid.
---
IIRC they are still called "dungeons" they are just outdoors. Anywhere with a lot of elite mobs or one big structure with a lot of corridors and caves are supposed to be things you would group for, just not instanced. I think it was in a strategy guide or maybe an old retrospective from blizzard that they said this.
---
Are people forgetting the crap loads of people who didn't bother to reserve names and will also play classic? 3 servers is awesome
---
Another turtle made it to the water.
---
Yeah :( but we're that much closer to classic release. So I'm staying on the bright side of things lol
---
Well. I played a female warrior. There was one guy in the guild who i guess thought i was female who have me free stuff and a mount! I nerver told him my gender...
---
Possibly getting this in 2-3 years or so. I might be like 4th or 5th in line to get the eye if it drops, depending how active will the other pallys in our guild be.
---
Yea but there‘s less paladins and dwarves than undead, since it‘s the most popular race as far as I know.
---
They’re actually beautiful.
---
You know that not every guild raids based on server time, right?  With how many players we're seeing coming to Classic just for name creation, there will be plenty of guilds that are EST/CST that raid later, I can't imagine you'd have a hard time finding a group that suits your time preferences.

Were you alliance?

Because you have seen the error of supporting the plague that is the horde and have joined the holy war that will rid these heathens from our lands. I a holy paladin welcome you and do pledge to buff you with blessings of kings and salvation.

I think you can move, as long as you stop before the next auto attack. Just like hunters.

I like how you're angry about what he's doing just downvote and stay quiet.

Isnt Innit short for isn't it?
---
Or when your main tank gets banned for leveling-botting on his alt, just before Sapphiron in top 3 server gear including frost resistance.
---
Yes. My retail main is horde. Mostly rolling alliance for stormwind, elwynn forest, teldrassil and other amazing starting zones that have amazing music. Also for races, I just like the alliance ones more, and forsaken and orc racial seem OP in pvp, which wouldn’t make it as fun to kill someone imho. Also population, I’d rather play under pop side.
---
They have flagged the guild I am going to be a member of as moving without a GM meeting. My GM have later spoken to other GMs in the same situation. It feels like making everyone move by telling them everyone else is moving kinda thing. Maybe i got it wrong. Maybe they have a good reason but it feels shady
---
Also with DI you can put it on the main tank during a pull to wipe the raid ;)
---
You wont be able to get your class quests IIRC until you head back to IF.
---
That could be one of their sneaky hidden changes though.

Fortnite vs classic wow is 31 to 6 for the past week. And we are not even at release yet.
---
6x more is a lot, but even if classic is 1/6 as big as fortnite thats huge.
---
You mean "spice up what I'll be wearing for 3 months solid for release"
---
I created character on the 3 pvp servers but will be playing only on one, like most of us did.
---
I'm enjoying the break before the real deal.

That's not to say I haven't logged in to look at my level 1 a few times already.
---
Hey everyone! *I posted in an original Thex thread! Look ma!*
---
This is correct.
---
That click on the healing touch tho...
---
Can confirm. Most Danish guilds stay Shazzrah.
---
Do you wanna tank, heal, or dps? Also for the most part any spec will be taken for dungeons.
---
Please give me a PM. I'd like to talk to you about something, please.
---
Finally a list a can relate to, that isn‘t full of metal and rock
---
whats this trash playlist lol
---
Managed to post a goodbye message in Barrens chat seconds before the server shutdown.
---
Very insightful, thank you!
---
I don't know how harsh the death penalty in WOW is. PvP sounds really appealing but I don't have that much time to put into the game (like 3-8 hours per week max) and if ganking and shit like that costs me too much time (by having to farm gold to repair things, running back to where I died etc, getting back my exp) I fear I'll get demotivated when I play just to get ganked multiple times a day and don't really make progress.
---
I think I'll stick to PvE for now
---
I feel like im taking crazy pills. A mildly popular reddit post (5x less popular than this one) somehow warrants an nps as a cultural reference. And if youre gunna say “tHis Is tHe ComMuniTy” look at just how many people on this very forum (the source of the “meme”) have no clue whats going on.
---
Wow, you got an NPC named after you, in a game you've never played. This is the true power of Memes.
---
Meh if you have a group of friends to play with, surely it’ll be a lot of fun despite layering possibly being a bit wonky.
---
Being picky here but Scandinavia is 3 countries. Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Finland and Iceland + Scandinavia are the Nordic countries.
---
Great, rerolled on Gehennas and now fucking APES is there...
---
Then again, Counter-Strike and DotA are bigger than they were 15 years ago.  
---
What's really impressive is they get people to pay a monthly subscription to a 15 year old game imo.
---
From the confirmed guilds yes, feels like most non confirmed Swedish guilds are staying Shazzrah.
---
Confirmed in the coalition that is.
---
Yea I agree, but when somebody asks what server I play on and I have to pronounce it...yikes.
---
I'm just hoping for Gehennas to become High.
---
Before level 60 you can heal anything as a priest even if you were specced 0/0/0. 
---
As far as level 60 goes, you’d actually be surprised how much damage priests can do with smite and holy fire if specced correctly. If you really for whatever reason wanted to grind mobs plus function in a raid I’d give deep disc a shot. I’m sure some mage will love you for PI. You’ll lose a little bit of your healing throughput but it’s not gonna be a big deal for molten core. You can even heal molten core as shadow spec.

Hi! Loving the tool! Was getting annoying to update manually.
---
A few questions i have.
---
1) What do i do with addons like this?  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files) They have the classic and reatil files listed together for some reason. Same goes for OmniCC.
---
2) Would it be possible to add wowinterface as well? This addon isn't found anywhere else:  [https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24924-RealMobHealth.html](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24924-RealMobHealth.html) 
---
3) Details! for Classic seems to be only here:  [https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/details-damage-meter-classic/](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/addons/details-damage-meter-classic/) 
---
4) ElvUI is another case, they have:  [https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development](https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-classic/tree/development) 
---
Otherwise i looove this tool! Keep up the great work!
---
Tl;dr
---
Just go ret and pick talents you like without overthinking. It's really hard (but not impossible) to go wrong this way.
---
I didn‘t downvote you, must have been somebody else.
---
I was genuinely curious.
---
Mulgore is amazing for tauren, because you can get [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=765](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=765) as early as level 5 if you do it in a group. 
---
You basically leave the very first starting zone, head over to this quest and have a 2hander that lasts you to level 14ish.
---
give it to your top holy paladin assuming you dont have a ret
---
holy paladins need something to have fun with when not pvping
---
I'm not bashing anyone, I just stated my opinion, and my opinion is that of someone for whom the magic is *not* gone. I dare say that is the majority on account of how excited people are to be getting back to Vanilla after so long. So when someone asks for a guide and what's posted is a stripped-out min-max speedrun build (without stating that's what it is), well that makes me feel bad for potential players who would be missing out on the full Warlock experience if they followed it. If you had posted it with some sort of disclaimer or note, I would've scoffed and moved on instead of giving my 2c.
---
[Logging in at zero hour on Herod or Whitemane](http://oi59.tinypic.com/2vry54z.jpg)

He literally just stated a fact
---
Definitely not, people shouldn't get more chances just because of the stupid tech used. Imagine being in a layer that's always full (so you pretty much never win), and one dude just wins the event in an empty one...
---
Meme? There arent exactly many 2h weapons that were better for arms than Sulfuras (I dont think there were any before Naxx tbh)
---
I remember warriors being pissed off when losing it, but they were dual wielding anyways. They wanted it to dick around in PvP, while as a hunter using it as stat stick brought a benefit to the raid. Plus the looking cool factor and raptor striking clothies for 1000 is a nice benefit.
---
Better be prepared to lose it to a couple of hunters.

When he called out Sonni on stream infront of thousands of viewers for stream sniping Staysafe( he didnt stream sniped btw, i was watching Sonni stream later on ) i was a dissapointed...i mean, its beta, its vanila, world PvP is one of vanilla trademarks, u rolling on PvP server and crying coz other streamers gank you, ruining your content or w/e...well fuck you lol, stop crying and go play PvE then, if ur streamer u think that what? Noone can gank you?
---
And sometimes seems like he fake hyping things a bit, with all that PUMP IT UP shit
---
But overall he seems like mostly nice dude, i actually enjoying watching his streams, its just that calling out on stream sniping and ganking was mega bullshit, watching beta after that, when they made "deal" LOL, about not ganking or whatever, become boring

---
This is just to level 51.
---
My thoughts:
---
* Don't get imp blessing of might - use Wisdom on both yourself and the warlock (it's better for uptime).
---
* Eye for an Eye and Vindication kind of suck, get Pursuit instead (at least). 
---
I don't think you need that many points in holy, either. You'll be fine pocket healing without any points in Holy -- honestly. Getting Precision in the Prot tree could be a good shout.
---
Too soon.
---
I agree, but now the class is even less viable in PvP. It‘s not like they gave it an ever so slight buff to compensate for it.
---
Just removed the only thing that made the dps version of paladin viable in PvP.
---
I am rolling a Dwarf just as I did in vanilla, though mainly for the reason this time to make my friend group more diverse with: 1xGnome, 1xDwarf, 2xNight Elf, 1xHuman. :p
---
I feel that you need at least 3 customers to make it worth leveling blacksmithing. As a result, it makes a lot of sense to BUY  blacksmithined armor, or to make it and auction house it, but I would 100% not level blacksmithing primarily for personal use.
---
Generally though, yeah. Blacksmithed gear is not going to replace every slot, or even close to it. But there are a few key pieces that look to be well worth selling and buying. The thing is, green items are often either 5 levels out of date, or poorly itemized.
---
Blacksmithed gear, when it's on the auction house, should be neither.
---
Lol discounts the way people cheat in mmos claims it doesn’t count then asserts no one cheats in WoW. 🧐🤔🔬

Shaman are pretty damn threatening as raid spec out in the world. You can always windfury some dudes head off with mace/shield no matter the spec. Plus, shaman gear seemed to fall from the sky whenever I raided back when.
---
Druids have much less kill-fu as resto, but honestly it doesn't matter. It's damn near impossible to kill a druid, especially a resto druid. You can't earthshock/windfury crit kill people in the span of a global cooldown, but druids get to decide how the fight goes.

Basically have it boiled down to Rogue, Mage, Hunter, maybe Warlock?
---
I'm skeptical about things like: making a Rogue as a first character if I want to make gold and not gank a bunch? I've heard pickpocketing in later stages is decent, and I remember opening lockboxes for tips which was nice but I'm still not sure. Should I go for a Hunter to get established because I might be doing a lot of solo content if my friends are busy at school/work/etc? Are my pre-concieved notions of TBC classes that far off from Vanilla that I should throw out those entirely before making a choice?  
---
Did I really enjoy content as a Rogue as much as I think I did or am I just gravitating towards that pick because it was my first main? (That one I guess is for me to decide lol)  
---
Rogue is what I'm leaning toward because that is what most of my nostalgia is based on (BC raiding, not much Vanilla). I stopped leveling it at 85 so it's been quite a while since I've really played Rogue so I'm hoping the playstyle will be fresh to me, but familiar enough that I can excel. I'm concerned about having my gear stolen (ahh the memories) and not being able to find groups as I'm not the most social person ever but I'm hoping I can just find a decent guild to tag along with eventually. I also have like 2 or 3 friends who play so maybe I could sneak into groups that way. I will say, I do remember dying quite a bit on my rogue leveling up and that part wasn't the most enjoyable experience either (hoping cannibalism will at least help. I know Orcs are probably better but I don't like how they look).  
---
Looking back, raiding was engaging and challenging as a Rogue (mainly not dying) so I'm wondering how much different it really is from Vanilla apart from some of the QoL things like needing reagants for skills. The idea of being able to choose my own engagements in PvP, and contribute high levels of DPS in PvE are obviously appealing. I just wonder if Rogue is the best choice for a first character on a fresh high population PvP server where I'm probably not going to be the highest level around. I'm also concerned with grinding to make money to keep up professions and everything.
---
Mage seems to be the second choice because the last class I played in WoW was a Warlock in BFA and while it really wasn't getting along with me too well, I really enjoyed the prospect of a caster as someone who has previously played Rogue, WW Monk, Enh/Ele Shaman, and Disc/SPriest. I will say I think I was expecting more of a Classic WoW skill set when I level boosted my lock though as I didn't really find any of thew new specs that enjoyable. I only made it to 119 before I ended up giving up on BFA. This is also why I'm entertaining the idea of playing a lock but I'm a bit more skeptical about it because I already feel slightly "burnt out" on it even if it's my preconcieved notion of BFA locks. Warlocks obviously having the mount is an bonus, but soul shard management seems daunting but I love the idea of having a caster with a pet. That's what originally motivated me to roll lock with the level boost. My cousin who I used to play a lot with mained a Mage and I always envied the casting life. My main concerns with Mage are being forced into Frost for certain content, him possibly getting annoyed that I'm rolling his old main (lol), the awkward shared debuff system in raids (I guess this isn't specific to just Mage, looking at you too Warlocks). As well as battling my Rogue mindset towards them being too squishy and immobile when it's really not the case.  I just felt trapped on casters in the past when trying to run away from melee but it's obviously me not strafing/playing correctly. I think I'm just spoiled on a Rogue being able to sprint and jump around while attacking and what not. I will say the money and time saved on portals and food is appealing, as well as some of the unique aspects of PvP like slow falling around AB casting pyros at people, and AoE grinding (which as I hear will probably be infeasible due to the amount of people in zones but still a nice thought.)  
---
Hunter sounded interesting because of the ease of soloing, the ability to collect pets, and potential for farming/easy gold making. Albeit the deadzone for shooting, as well as needing to bring your own projectiles also is not ideal. A hunter was the last thing I was leveling on retail before I quit. This was another case of having more of a Classic mindset towards Hunter as I had taken my 19 BG hunter from the early days and finally pushed him up higher. I made it up to around 45 but when I came back to the game after my hiatus, I once again didn't enjoy the new specs, granted I didn't give them a fair shake. I figure I could probably statisfy my hunter itch by just remaking my 19 hunter for BGs once I have some extra gold if I don't go hunter as a main but I thought it was worth considering. I don't really understand a lot of the auto attacking clipping/coordination that hunters need to utilize but I did enjoy learning auto-canceling in games like Smite and what not for the extra frames so I assume it's do-able.
---
I don't know, the release is creeping closer and closer and I'm changing my mind every other day.
---
Are they actually banned though? Is it just the one off words? Becasue I play a character with black in the name, Not wasting half a month of money just to secure a name though so I cant check.
---
The new server hadn't even been announced when name reservation went online, that's the problem.
---
Blizzard messed up thinking two servers would be enough. I reckon stacking people is a good idea, but two is just too packed.
---
Can we go ahead and get the addons installed before classic launches or is it better to wait until after?
---
People on reddit truly are autistic and habe trouble understanding clear jokes without „/s“.
---
Depends on how hardcore you are going to play imo. Remeber you have to look at this character for hours and days, so having it look the way you want can be important. However, if you plan on playing Hardcore the racials start becoming more important to maximize performance.
---
I think this has to do with them starting a proper internet marketing campaign yesterday. I saw a lot of people start talking about ads popping up on IG.. I saw my first one early this morning lol
---
Focus on PvE - Doesn't matter much. If you want a powerful/easy solo character I can recommend Hunter.  
---
Easy money - 'Skinning' as you level up (vendor the skins), herbalism and/or mining when you get to 60. Not a lot of money in crafting professions.  
---
Leveling solo - Druid, Hunter, Warlock and somewhat Mage are all very strong solo.  
---
2 - 3 hours to play each day - Might want to avoid healing classes, getting a group going and completing an instance could easily go +2 hours  
---
Casual raiding - Most things work here  
---
Based on your requirements I would recommend Hunter. If you roll horde, I would pick Troll since they have the greatest damage output with their racial ability. If you roll alliance I would probably pick Night Elf since Shadowmeld is a cool ability, but honestly, if you're a casual player your race doesn't matter much. Pick whatever you like aesthetically.

It’s totally acceptable to show up to early tiers of raiding with that build. Mana tide totem is balls anyway
---
Originally played a paladin to 60 and I have always loved healing. Ended up playing Hunter to Lt. Commander because I could never get enough of battlegrounds.
---
I think I'm having the same problem  I did at launch. It seems like shaman is the right class for me but I wanna play on alliance. So maybe druid? This would give me some flexibility in terms of pvp and healing. Part of me wants to be a warlock/mage/rogue and focus on pvp but I worry I'll miss healing. I always had the problem of too many alts in WoW.
---
I spent a lot of time hunting rare pets with my hunter and part of me wonders if I should just do that again.
---
It seems like I wanna do it all which of course brings me back to druid but I feel like they were always in a weird place in classic so im a little hesitant to pick  it up. It was probably the class I played the least in WoW/

The sulfuron ingots are \~300-500g each on pservers (which are often heavily inflated). Blood of the mountains goes for \~5-30g or so, I think I bought mine for average \~12g each, never seen them reach 100g (iirc they can even very rarely drop from some mobs in brd, and the only other popular &amp; worthwhile recipe they're used in is for the smoking heart of the mountain, a feral tank trinket). Arcanite bars on the other hand can go up to 40-50g, but usually stay at around \~20-30g.
---
source: I own one on nighthaven. I got 4 ingots from the guild (one sponsored by the gm) and farmed most of the other mats myself, in the end it costed me roughly \~3.5k and a few weeks of hardcore farming to complete.
---
I would say medium is probably closer to 5k+
---
Everyone enjoys the game in different way so you shouldn’t limit yourself only on speed. Dual boxing is likely going to be slower, but you’ll have two levelled toons at the end!
---
But it isnt untrue, if you dont stop to "smell the flowers" you quite literally are missing out. 
---
Again, I point out that different people find fun in different things, but there are alot of people out there who did not start playing this game from the beginning, and due to the conditioning of BFA alot of those people are in the mindset of "get max quick!!!", and will miss out on some really cool content by trying to play this way.
---
Yes it does?
---
10k was too many on private servers and people play all around the globe on them. When you have 10k ppl in the same time zone on one server that aint a good time.
---
Bull....corn.....
---
Alrighty 📝 adding that to the list
---
How big is the spanish community? I switched servers twice in old WoW, just to get away from Spanish and later Russian servers - it was horrible!
---
Wtf, I checked the sub count like 2 days ago and could have sworn it was around 163k. Even then, I was in awe how fast the sub blew up.
---
Dont rly care
---
Oh lol
---
uhm ok, let's pretend that today
---
So here's my conundrum. I played exclusively DPS back in Vanilla, TBC and Wrath mostly Hunter and Warlock. I was a kid back then and healing and tanking never appealed to me back then. Come Warlords of Draenor my guild wanted me to heal so I rolled a druid and shaman and have been mostly having a blast healing. Thing is now I'm unsure what to roll in classic.
---
Here are the things I'm planning so any opinions are appreciated. 
---
-I'll be rolling on a PvE server, I don't like open world PvP
---
-Rolling alliance so shaman is out
---
-I tunneled my choices down to Warlock, Hunter, Mage or Paladin
---
My worry is if I play Paladin how will I level effectively and also heal? I like holy paladin on retail but I have no clue how it will work on classic. Warlock is my comfort pick as that's what I've played on vanilla way back then.
---
There is a huge "skill plateau" for rogues: when you stop saving your cooldowns for "later" and start mashing them all at once and then stealthing till they come back.

Or maybe they call it nordic to indicate all nordic countries are welcome? Not their fault danes and norwegians aren't joining.

Thanks for this infographic! Not that big of a deal, but the word Entrance in UBRS is spelled wrong haha.

Lol I posted this exact idea and was downvoted into oblivion when they first announced early name creation.
---
Played sort of all the way up to BFA. Played less and less after wrath taking massive almost expansion sized breaks though.
---
Anyone know for how many phases this will remain one of the better 2h weps for the suitable classes &amp; specs?
---
It's all fun and games until you wake up in another universe wearing that armour! Then you're thinking "Why didn't I hang up the Phase 5 BIS mage set?"

Wait do players names color match their class colors in chat in the classic wow client like retail???

I'm taking some gathering professions for early game to make gold, should I learn these asap?

I don't think it matters that much

Cross realm battleground

Who is this guy and why should I care?

Have you got any addon guides? like Zygor?

I didn't get my fancy name on neither Shazzrah or Gehennas, and most of my friends are going Gehennas anyhow so I guess I'll go there aswell.

Kia Ora! Hope you find the right home for you.

Already there lad.

If you're good and know your shit you can heal as shadow priest as well as tank with an "arms" warrior.
---
There are plenty guides out there from private server speedrunners who explain shit in details I could'nt even remember (Impale build on ProtWarrior etc.)!
---
If you want to make yourself rare and be sought after then pick tank or healer! Its gonna be like retail with all those wannabe damage dealers who stockpile on top of each other and then sit around waiting 30min for a partyinvitation. But its even worse because you yourself need to actually look for groups!
---
If you have buddys and all you guys gonna roll is dps you will have fun times.
---
As for what class to choose... just look into Videos and toss a coin. I'm not gonna tell you what to play mate, Mages just end up spamming Frostbolt and Warlocks spam Shadowbolt. Its a 15 y old game there are not so many difficult mechanics.

He said, "Go back to retail"
---
That's the type of comment you usually hear from a pserver player. Most players don't actively hate people just because they play a different game. If he's used to pservers, then he's gonna have to cut the shit he normally gets away with over there. Blizzard won't abide it I promise.

Each boss drops 2 Tier 1 sets if I remember correctly. 10 bosses total. 20 tier 1 sets in a full clear. MC has week reset timer.

Servers will definitely be busy 24/7 at the start considering how many people they’re shoving in them. Maybe later on down the road you might have issues if you’re only on when it’s 5am in the us.

Hunchback is a sign of being a slave or a peon - the ones that do all the heavy work while the straightbacks are sitting back and drinking beer.

Minor point but Killers Eddie is not undead yet, not til the end of PoM Tour / Powerslave album release can he be considered undead. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPQf6PoGY0c :)

Such as? Are these features perhaps something that simply aren't doable in Classic and only in retail?
---
I'm rolling Shazzrah with my IRL friends, hoppas vi ser dig där!
---
It's viable not optimal
---
Hey, I am currently not at my pc but I will reply in maybe an hours time!
---
Source on that info?
---
Tilt people that you spend all that gold for nothing... not really. The material costs ALONE is enough to turn most people away from this weapon. People dont even want it.
---
The true Nords stayed on Shazzrah.
---
No dude obviously 90% of the playbase pay a sub early reserved names. I know this because me and my friends did it - people here. 
---
Most people will just show up launch day. They probably don’t know or care about the names.
---
Welcome brother!!
---
When  I first started the game and looked at both factions, I immediately chose the Alliance, because to me the Horde looked like a bunch of beasts and monsters. Over the last 12 years I've played every race and almost every class, but I still prefer the Alliance, because I can identify with them more.
---
The skill cap for being AN AMAZING druid is incredibly high, and 99% of druids won't reach it.  
---
Professions doesn't matter much, although you'll need the enchanting trinket from 250 skill (after that you can unlearn it). You can herb and skin while shapeshifted though, so that's a minor + for a druid.
---
With spell batching being in 400ms chunks - i dont think latency will matter all that much. Server times certainly do, but you can work around that. For the first month or so - I imagine ppl will be playing nearly 24h
---
Waterlords
---
They won’t be full in 6 months when BGs release, so in the long term it’s better for you to play on the English EU servers.
---
Yeah I think 5 months is assuming many duplicates drop (fair assumption)
---
If you get extremely lucky and 1 of each piece that is needed per person , it's like 18 weeks or something (not gonna do the legit math right now, it's 2:42 am here)
---
Well done! Looking forward to seeing more.
---
The difference is: Thunderfury is hands down the BiS weapon for its intended purpose for the entire runtime of Vanilla, and the Effort of making it is worth it for the entire guild to do, as a tank who has is, is a massive boost to the dmg potential of the entire raid.
---
Sulfuras on the other hand, is essentially a Vanity item, which, in purely technical terms, benefits no one, not even the person who gets it.
---
Pretty sure my priest also had to get an eye of sulfuras to make his epic staff, benediction.
---
Yeah, nah. It's Horde for me.
---
Same op, same
---
Dude, there's enough interest to fill 20 additional PvP servers...
---
What would the ramifications of them turning on the servers early be?
---
I know that question seems entitled but if they turned it on a week early or so that would be good so they can iron out the inevitable server problems.

Come on man, you didn't look very hard.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w) 
---
"our concern is what's that going to do to realm communities as some server populations dwindle over time. That's where we're looking at using sharding in a limited way"
---
"... while making sure that in the long run, as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population"
---
That's just the one I found quickly. Read between the lines and apply some common sense. Think about how many people are going to play, and think about how few servers there. The game world is simply not equipped to handle that many people. In 2004-6 it was only a few thousand concurrent, on Nostalrius it was about 13k concurrent and while fun, leveling got so bad that they had to make their own dynamic respawn system, it was completely not Blizz-like. 
---
Think about it like this, based on what we *know*:
---
\- Ion confirmed the Classic servers are "huge", way bigger than the original ones
---
\- He also confirmed that each layer holds roughly the same amount as an original server (about 3.5k concurrent cap)
---
\- Blizzard want layering turned off before P2
---
So if you don't think the majority of the server populations are going to quit, what do you think's going to happen..? They remove layering and then the servers are rammed with tens of thousands of people making the game unplayable? Or do you think there's barely anyone playing Classic? What do you think happens when the gates of AQ open and every level 60 is in one zone and there's no layering..? 
---
 **Yes**, layering is going to alleviate start zone pressure but only because Blizzard have made the decision to make the servers hold drastically more players than before. They could have just had dozens of servers with 3.5k concurrent caps like they have in the past. Do you know *why* they haven't done that? Because it's exactly what led to dead servers and server merges before, and they want to avoid that. They're well aware that people are going to try vanilla for an hour, day, week, month, and give up. They don't want 24 very low pop servers, they want 6 high-pop ones.
---
4 shades of humanity

Based Paladin bro
---
Hai my flair twin
---
Yes. they are not pvp healers. On Horde if you want to HEAL, priest or druid.
---
Casual? Mother fucker planned over a full week down to the hour on how to min-max his health and game time at the same time. Most people who think they'll be playing a lot are actually going to just chugg mtn dew or monster day one &gt; crash hard and sleep for 12 hours &gt; play for 14 more &gt; crash again etc.
---
This man clearly values his time a lot and won't be the type to be wasting a minute of it.
---
I always liked the aspect of these early/mid 2000s asian mmos that flood the market. 
---
You could set up your "market" just stand there, or go afk and when you came back some items where sold. 
---
The regional aspect, where you sold some items in the game played a role. I always wanted something like that since vanilla, that you could set up your market everywhere you wanted (maybe with a safe zone towards NPCs so they wont get camped and you cant click or see NPCs).
---
The only Problem i see with your addon is, that it's probably hard to identify people that have set up a market, would be nice if you could code something into players tooltips if 2 players have the addon and one has set up the shop *Players name has set up a Shop, check out his Items* for example.
---
The most awesome way imo is if you could code something like a visual plate under a players name that has set up a market with the Shop's name *Fresh Fishes* for example, but i don't think that's possible.
---
I'll definetly try the addon nonetheless
---
He is shit though, really slow and clicking spells.
---
Shoddy Layering &gt; competing with 1000 others for a Rattlecage Skeleton.
---
(Shoddy meaning it splits me away from my party members)
---
That said, I hope they fix (or have already fixed) the layering so it DOESN'T split me away from my group.
---
Only in the 1.12 version of the game which was AFTER the release of naxx. When I got my Sulfuras in Classic BRE was still dog shit and Sulf was by far the best weapon you could have at that point.
---
Thanks pal
---
This quest is harder than most raids in retail.
---
**say no more**
---
Name checks out.
---
And the Moonkin form &gt;_&gt; 
---
That one really got me.
---
he talked a bit of shit so you assume hes a racist? have you ever played a competitive game or sport in your life?
---
Noone is questioning wether its technically doable nowadays to have servers that could easily handle such amounts of traffic and situations. We're questioning wether blizzard is willing to invest that little extra or not.
---
less than 2 weeks to release and after all these betas, stresstests and the name reservation they STILL vastly underestimate the general public intrest in classic and the amounts of people who will want to play. Maybe they're also just hoping that people will quit and forget about classic if they cant log in and instead go back to bfa...
---
If you've never raided naxx on a pserver I could see how you would think that it's a joke. The thing is you need at the very minimum protection potions to clear naxx. Loathed is literally impossible without 120x shadow protection pots. That's a lot of
---
Gold. And if you want to clear it in a reasonable amount of time (less than 3 raid nights per week) you're going to need dps consumables. So yes the content is very easy but the grind for gold is very real and your average player and average guild won't be able to keep up. This is why a majority of guilds die going into AQ/naxx on pservers. I think phase 5 will be a big wake up call to a lot of people.
---
Someone took the name 'sloth' so 'sloths' checking in for some ganking action!
---
It's pretty good until AQ and dark edge of insanity comes
---
Hell ye, when i mained mage i hated warlocks. I was so jelous, seemd like they had everything going for them.
---
I rolled a female tauren shaman on a &lt;&lt;fresh&gt;&gt; TBC server. Got to 70 and hated every second of it. Race changes came out 10 months after TBC so I couldn't do it. Went back to my male tauren druid instead. NEver again.
---
Let's gooooooo
---
You shouldn't let others decide what race you should roll.
---
If you prefer Undead over Orc then you should definitely roll with that, if you have consumables and play properly you will barely notice that you're missing the stun resist racial.
---
Check out [Goth II - Vanilla Warlock PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3iHXZXx7g0) he's an Undead Warlock and it doesn't seem to hinder him at all
---
But do you think they will offer a server change thing?
---
That's not how full works. It doesn't lock you out of creating characters.
---
For me it is probably [Earthshaker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17073/earthshaker) which I had on my Paladin during vanilla. I remember fighting at the Alliance-base bridge in AV and running up to the stacked Horde attackers and just downing EVERYONE since the proc on the weapon had no maximum cap on how many it could affect. :p
---
I believe it's actually called chunky dunking
---
I love it! First time I see an addon that is both a convenience addon AND has the potential to add greatly to the community feel.   
---
If you could in any way, think in the opportunity for the addon making sense for using with bank alts, that would be cool. Something like having an "account shop" that is viewable from any char, but that you can display your items from varying characters in that same shop.   
---
I'm definitely getting this!
---
Whats your twitch mongrel
---
Warcrack
---
Yes I know. I also said:
---
&gt;those searches around that time are definitely going to be due to the release. After and before is going to be hazy though.
---
This wasn't done out of some machiavellian attempt to try and make classic look more popular than it is... it was just a mistake on my behalf.
---
Blizzard said in their content post that they aren't sure when phases 3-6 will be released.
---
Devs said in an interview 2-3 months for for phase 2, maybe shorter - same interview they said layering will be removed by phase 2.
---
What I said was not meant to be an evidence for any extrapolation I didn't do. I only brought it up since some here seem to forget that the ones who subscribed already before launch are mostly the very hard core of players.
---
There's a big group of people who don't actively follow every burp Blizzard makes, traditionally the biggest group of WoW players. While I think that today a game like Classic will actually be attractive mostly to more dedicated gamers, there is a huge pool of former players who left WoW not because they got tired of it, but simply because they didn't enjoy the new gameplay. The number of the ones who will return eventually once classic launches can only be subject to wild guesses. 
---
It seems to me that (many at) Blizzard themselves still don't even believe that classic could be successful. But they are to some extent living in their own bubble of current WoW and the characteristics of it's playebase.
---
That said, I think their strategy of combining layering with new servers on demand is not bad. I only hope they are not overestimating the number of tourists, given WoW can be quite addictive. Otherwise it will be very difficult to get rid of layering on these high pop realms, even with free character transfers. I've been through this myself during vanilla, and believe me, it's very hard to convince everyone in a guild to move to a new realm of which no one knows how it will develop.
---
I am playing Alliance as well. Maybe I will see you in the world ;) I do like PVP but honestly, I won't be playing at a super high level.
---
Jesus....
---
&gt; any other service
---
Oh god.
---
Please don't allow this addon to work in Goldshire.
---
Yeah that's what I'm afraid of to, the whole there'll be 10000 dps for every tank or healer. I do like soloing stuff though and that would be better suited to a paladin correct? I remember the wowhobbs videos of him AoE grinding down large quantities of mobs with his prot specced paladin.
---
Priest never really appealed to me, it just always felt like the most bare bones healing class to me thematically. Thanks for the insights. I might just roll a holy paladin for classic.
---
&gt;All MC mat drops from the guild bank are showered
---
Unless the guild is swimming in mats, no. This doesn't happen.
---
Sulfuras doesn't benefit anyone in the guild. It's a vanity item. Guilds may finance it if they would otherwise sell the mats on the AH, and even then its usually not free for the guy building the hammer.
---
Reason being: Fire resist gear, Crafting items like Titnics and Lionhearts, Saving mats for Thunderfury, SS bags, and even AH gold take precedence over Sulfuras, because all of these go towards raid progress...Sulfuras does not.
---
The only somewhat-technical reason why a guild would want to finance Sulfuras, is to have a guy with the guild-tag standing around town, attracting new recruits, but that's pretty much it.
---
Lol. Nice
---
It will be 2004 wow launched in 2019...
---
Keeping out the white nationalists is a little more important
---
Yeah people on competitive games are more willing to say edgy racist shit cause mad more than anyone else. Have YOU played an online competitive game with voice chat?

---
I'm assuming you mean [something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-0050550120055-050252103030101).
---
It works perfectly fine, you just need to keep in mind you're less reliant on CP generators (and thus energy consumption) to get your CP. Think about how much energy goes into getting 1 CP to begin with
---
+ Hemo = 35 Energy
---
+ Ghostly Strike = 40
---
+ Sinister Strike = 40 / 45
---
+ Backstab = 60
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Even if you imagine 'Seal Fate' builds getting 1CP for 30 energy, that still sets 30 as the minimum  baseline cost per CP.
---
Non-Dagger builds are not designed with 'burst/instagib' type gameplay in mind, as long as you understand that you'll be fine (and whilst less beneficial for non-dagger specs, you still have Thistle Tea and Renataki's for a massive energy boost should the need arise).
---
A 25 energy recovery from Relentless Strikes still fundamentally requires you to have that 25 energy before-hand. It's not like it makes the ability cheaper outright, you get a 'rebate' so to speak, not an up-front discount.
---
It's not really a 'squishie' fighting build, it's a build for taking out more durable targets.
---
Same as Gehennas
---
I freaking got Netherwind here, finally i can rest
---
You can’t really kite mobs with normal running speed and a 3 second snare on CD (which you get only at level 8 anyway). At most you could say that Hunter 1-10 teaches you to run away when you aggro several mobs, that I’d agree with.
---
Same. I haven't told her yet 😅
---
Unless you are the GM, and okay with playing alone from the moment you leech the first binding, no it wont.
---
according to his twitter @grimtherogue, yes
---
The Swedish coalition is only a small minority of all Swedish players. Me and my almost entirely Swedish guild is staying. So are plenty of other people and guilds I know.
---
There is no way of knowing what blizzards numbers are for layers or server caps at launch.
---
Pick a server you'll be fine. 
---
Classic wow servers wont be a ghost town until after naxx.
---
That was a later addition to the game (from memory).
---
May the farmers never cease spamming you with gold for sale
---
If you don't spend the first 12 hours of the game's launch streaming with a webcam wearing that armor, I will bi incredibly disappointed.
---
Hunter weapon.
---
i played the game since 2008 and have only seen a Speed hacker once
---
That is one weapon and only in it's 1.12 version. How does that make sulfuras a meme weapon lol for 90% of vanilla  wow sulfuras was pretty much the best weapon for arms...
---
Are you saying that The Barrens is a superior questing experience compared to Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge Mountains, Duskwood and Stranglethorn Vale?  
---
The Barrens is cool, but the story is more inconsistent and not as intriguing as the Alliance zones I mentioned above. Even Horde players agree that Alliance quests were better written.
---
Fishing extravaganza isn't until like phase 4 or 5.
---
So no layering wont affect it.
---
Solid advice right here.
---
He is a really cool guy, not your traditional retarded streamer, I think he and his community will not disrupt gameplay at all but in fact help it a great deal.
---
My normal leveling run includes running from Orc starting area to Tauren, grabbing FPs on the way. Works fine in stress test.
---
Always this. You never know what can happen!!
---
"they just brought in a train car of russian broads!"

I want to make a Human that looks kinda like me and sort of roleplay as myself in the game. If you want to roleplay as any of the Horde races, be my guest, I don't understand the appeal either, but whatever.
---
The Shazzrah discord has been an embarrassment! I won't be joining until I know it's  correctly ran by effective moderators.
---
Delete layering, add servers
---
People have already reserved names on the first two pvp-servers so no one is spending time on the server atm. Trust me, when they get massive ques on launch date - that third pvp server will go from medium to high/locked real fast!
---
That may be the case, but we are discussing "Classic" here, hence r/classicwow, not "Vanilla Patch x.y
---
For human ret pala best weapon in pve until ashbringer or Might of Menethil in Naxx.
---
For non-human paladin/shaman Dark Edge of Insanity is the next pve upgrade and Dark Edge is better in pvp even for human ret.
---
However Ashkandi is pretty much equivalent to Hand of Rag.
---
For warriors Sulfuras is a pure pvp weapon as bonereaver's edge is better in pve.
---
You point being? Any NElf class after their class quest will have an easy time, possibly except warriors.
---
No absolutely not, it's basically watering down the competition/challenge and adding additional resources that should not be there. The damage caused vastly outweighs the pros. I agree with layering on the starting zones. Anything past that damages the economy and dynamic of the whole game and it's fundamentals.
---
An illusion ! What are you hiding ?
---
Wow a quality post in /r/classicwow
---
The legend RichTurpin is back with another pvp vid chasing down streamers. The rage from the entitled streamers is hillarious. I just wish APES rolled on the streamer server and chansed these guys down
---
Some people don't want children and that kind of schedule might seem terrifying for them.
---
Because it sure looks like hell to me.
---
Confirmed. I come from Middle Europe (Slovakia) and I will gladly roll on a server with Swedish community. I learned Swedish language because I had many Swedish friends during the old Vanilla days. Nu kan jag prata med andra maniskor på engelska och svenska. ;] A bonus is that I understand writen text in Norwegian as well. Vi ses där snart!

I knew a guy whose first toon was a shadowpriest, but nobody let him raid as a shadowpriest, so he deleted the toon and rerolled a warlock named shadowpriest.
---
There is a Norwegian discord with guilds not included in the jinnis coalition, with 2500+ members. So calling it the scandic collation is misleading to the community
---
Will that drop in phase 1 tho?
---
Not at the start but they’ll have it at some point down the lin
---
Eye of divinity.
---
7 of my friends and I are subbing on launch day. So it's at least a slightly more than 0.
---
Well felhounds eat buffs (which heals them), can silence on command, and have insane resistances. And there's not much you can do about the dots other than the one curse too. Warlocks are mage counterclass.

Well the thing with bis. Is that is basicly only works in "pre-bis" state. As a guild, you can't bis people in raids. There is just to much people for the low amount of drops. People leave, new people join.
---
Best possible outcome
---
I am sorry for this stupid question but what is it all about Thex? What have he done to be so popular? I read about he getting his original name reserved etc but I can't seem to find to why he is so big? The curiousity is killing me.
---
Eh, not really. The initial version of Bonereavers was worse, but not crap. Yes, Sulfuras was better. The 1.10 version is also already pretty nice, just the proc doesn't stack.
---
And finally, it's a moot point as we'll get the 1.12 throughout all of classic.
---
I did everything as a Horde on a pvp server so i literally didnt do any quests on alliance till post WotLK and mained a shaman.  
---
Playing alliance will feel like playing a true WoW Classic expansion pack. The basics are there, but the class, zones, quests, raid compositions, pvp etc will all feel different. I wont be redoing my steps, il be playing vanilla wow again.
---
What's your source for these numbers?
---
Skip viper sting? This must be for a pve server.
---
I started in TBC, so vanilla is a new experience for me. I am just really excited over the silly things like having worthwhile professions. Leveling characters and some good old pvp. Not to mention, helping out a few fellow Horde a long the way and making a few friends.
---
SPOILER: Group 2 is real Thex multiboxing 5 ele shamans.
---
It's certainly where the queue will be at.
---
Things may change even more, the latest server is filling fast.
---
Barely an upgrade over thrashblade and replaced by dalrends 
---
Not worth its absurd price
---
I use a similar macro, but it also lists all of the items you sold in the chat log.
---
Yeah, I don’t know. It was very tough during the first stress test when you were limited to level 5. I still completed it after I found someone else who was willing to do it.
---
The second stress test and beyond made it really easy honestly.
---
Between this Meal Prep Guide and the [Diapers Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cnowfl/race_to_60_choosing_the_right_diapers_i_know_its/), looks like the Classic WoW community is ready to go.
---
If what I have read the last few days is true, then the layering thresholds where set very low. That might explain why you got ripped from your party. There may also be bugs in the system that didn’t spot that you were in a group when they needed players to be moved to the next layer.
---
I have some theories on what might be causing those issues assuming they have designed whole infrastructure the way I think they have. I could spend hours talking about that kind of stuff but its guess work and would be down voted to hell.
---
That all being said I played about 20 – 25 hours of the stress test with a range of groups and on my own. I never once noticed a laying issue and the whole gameplay experience was actually really good for me.
---
Make the Earth Mother proud!

I saw a Classic ad on Youtube on the first time yesterday. This was on EU.

I can re-sub 2 days after release for no one will take my name: Retailsbest
---
Do you have any general tips for warlocks
---
Reserved two names on the server my friends intends to play on, then i reserved a third name on the new server. Chances are the server will be locked and people will flock to Golemagg
---
So you want to ban these people? You dont want people to enjoy a free space or atleast you cant? You prefer authoritarian space?

If you don't like it.. You can mute all public chats.. I like these "trolls" more than you tbh. Never buy wc3 (reforged) we don't want you their either.
---
Im so excited to start completely anew. I love the idea of being broke, the fun is building up the wealth. Keeps the game interesting for me.
---
Yeah that is how it will work, you come late to the party. You miss out, either long que's, taken names or worse case the server gets locked,
---
But 5 shamans in the raid all in the same group so they cant even provide totems to anyone else.
---
Brillant raid organization, exactly what I expect to see in classic.
---
Do you know if it has been tested whether armor can go negative (due to arp) in classic?
---
I played alliance when WoW first came out. Migrated to the Horde in TBC and have decided to go back to where it all started (But I may end up going back to Horde in a few months.
---
I'll admit I'd probably be considered a layering sympathizer, but the danger of them not removing it due to a few massively overpopulated servers might be real.  Sure four weeks after release you'll have players spread out all over the world in every zone, but there will always be events that cause a significant portion of those players to congregate in one area.  Imagine no layering on Herod when someone starts announcing that the Alliance have two raids coming to Org to kill Thrall.  Even if only 5% of players hearth back, that's a fuckload (quick maffs) of people.  
---
It is certainly possible that they're going to be faced with the choice of continued use of layering (in cities at the very least), or they'll just lock up the maximum population and have rediculous queue times on the already "full" servers.  I hope they continue to voice that concern more and more loudly as release approaches, so we don't have people making the pikachu face when they start having 2 hour login queues due to layering getting removed by popular demand in December or whatever.
---
ya and I get shit talked almost every time I play, racist encounters not nearly as often. I just think its retarded to assume the guy is also racist cause he said "go back to retail".
---
We are not Shazzrah Discord :)
---
Thrashblade isn't even remotely close in comparison. Dalrends mainhand is kind of rare, and it requires level 55 compared to krol at 51. Not to mention groups for UBRS were a nightmare.    
---
Definitely goes for an absurd price though.
---
Thanks guys.
---
This is the single dumbest reply i have read this week on wow classic forum and that says alot.
---
You really think Blizzard will lock servers because its full? then think again, because that would be a PR nightmare.
---
If you don't want kids, like me, it truly sounds awful because it takes a lot of your freetime.
---
BRE is actually better than ashkandi for PvP. If you watch some of the best vanilla warriors ever on the practice premade servers they all run BRE. 2100 armor reduction is almost 50% reduction on plate, like 70% reduction on mail, 100% reduction on leather and clothies... yeah some will end up on negative armor. A demon armor warlock in r14 gear has less armor than that so they even go negative. It's an insane boost in dps and super good for nuking anyone in a PvP matchup, works really well to kill tanky bears that carries flags too.  
---
Not saying ashkandi's bad or anything, with BRE and r14 2h's it's BiS until DeOI from c'thun which is arguably BiS in pvp forever because of the insane proc it has, some prefer MoM over that and some prefer the DeOI cause it basically guarantees a win, especially vs low armor enemies that you can burst fast and relies on kiting/controlling you.
---
No, it will. 
---
Thank you for giving your opinion, though... I guess...
---
Some stuff you pay good money for just because you love the item. Im going warr so arcanite reaper is basically the same thing. IF it wasnt for all the other expensive stuff; edgemaster, lionheart etc id surely buy one.
---
Must have been a private server   ;)
---
lol'd
---
I wonder if the AH fisher add on will be making an appearance.... used to love sitting there and finding items that were significantly cheaper than the norm...
---
Yes - never played alliance beyond Level 12 or so :D
---
Now that I Play with a friend that exclusively always Plays Paladin I decided to go Alliance in order to be able to Play with him :)
---
I'm such a nice guy!
---
I was in a guild with esfand called return before he got famous, he was always realy nice and he tried to be prepaired for raids with consumables and gear always, I just couldn't get over the fact that he wanted to compete with me (a warrior) for gear, so I consider his persona legit.
---
I don't think people even understand the amount of time you need to put into the game for the min max to even be relevant lmao.
---
True. I know. But for me this was the final push! I could just ignore it..but it tilted me to much. ..ohh well its to late..the cats is out of the bag.
---
That clicking physically hurt. But i guess he's going full classic.
---
Nah because the char is doing everything that is allowed.
---
Its only doing it automatically by a machine.
---
Look, these guys don't speak for the community in its entirety. What I see here is a curious dude asking legitimate questions who's getting shit flung at him for asking said questions. And downvotes. I just want to have that said. Good luck mate. I hope your questions are answered and that you consider staying for a while. Classic is magic for reasons beyond the superficial stuff. It's a god damn feeling. &lt;3
---
This can be done with ease and without an addon. Google how to remove the water elemental water sound from the mage and apply the same logic. Good luck finding the correct sound file though.
---
Will most likely be worse overall but on some fight with high armor bosses it might still be viable. All bosses on Pservers have the same armor values which wasn't true in vanilla. Garr most likely has more armor in classic than on Pservers for example. But many bosses will indeed have lower armor values, rendering BRE procc useless.
---
someone should make a video series with noob fights
---
Its actually a lot easier than N*dale IMO, they definitely heal there and the mobs hit a lot harder on most private servers as well. Not to mention the relics of wakening aren't on shared loot on private servers.
---
Doesn't
---
I literally was just thinking the same thing.
---
Boring af content. Ooga Boys &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Rich Turdin
---
This is so dumb
---
Whether it is true or not, we will probably never know the true story as there are 2 different sides to the coin. What I don't understand is why you are trying to stir the pot and cause drama. If you don't like him, move on, don't waste your time. I don't see any objective benefit in villainizing someone for something trivial in their past. At the moment, all you are doing is wasting your own time and energy.
---
I didn't even think of that, good idea
---
That was one hell of a intense fight. He hung on like a champ.
---
After naxx hemo gets insane before that its complete garbage :(
---
No, just no one agrees.
---
Well, I liked cataclysm but they wiuld bust botbrelwasw flying mounts and destroy the world lol
---
instructions unclear gonna boil hotdogs or make omelettes every day
---
I dont know og theres any addon that does what you're looking for, but theres this website https://www.wowdownrank.com/
---
But thats only for healing.
---
Dont know if you can use it, just thought id share it.
---
You should attach a StrawPoll to your post. I haven't seen any done yet, and I'm really curious considering a good chunk of servers are at full status already.
---
@Fenald is right. Dal Rends are way less rare then Krol Blade and you get way more out of them. Thresh Blades DPS with the extra swing &gt; Krol Blade. White Dmg dominates your PVE dps.
---
Phone Thex
---
Real WoWers also edits together the clips and render the movie in uncompressed AVI. Probably only need like 1400TB of space, but I think its worth taking out a second mortgage on the house for HDDs so you can preserve your journey in the most c r i s p quality
---
My primary concern is equal faction balance
---
The main use of it is that you can cast your max rank of Healing Touch instantly. So when you're finally about to die in bear form you only need a second to go caster form, use Nature's Swiftness, cast healing touch, and BAM - you're back to full hp and go back into bear.  
---
Basically, you can give yourself or any ally full hp in less than a second every 3 minutes.
---
You're utterly clueless on this topic, please take your soggy brain elsewhere
---
He couldn't take that big staff of his.
---
Hilarious!
---
Yes I've collected it.  Theres about 3 million active subs and theres about 7.5 billion people on earth.  So about 7 billion people have not subbed.
---
Yeah you kinda did. Hell from what I can see, most of the people are spamming children. We should enjoy free spaces where everybody can communicate with eachother instead of these toxic moderated spaces that turn into echo chambers within the blink of an eye. 
---
I have not noticed these trolls at all.. What you propose disgust me yes and is a betrayel to our universal morals
---
Who is thex?
---
Apes are smoke and mirrors. You cant take anything serious from them. Pretty sure it's a bait to get ppl on the big realms. 
---
One can only wait :-)
---
losing out on IF rep. dont believe all faction rep starts out the same so you may have to use cloth turn in to get exalted with darn if that was your plan.
---
Why don't you hire a disabled tour guide?
---
\+1 for this idea. I want to re-roll on Doesn't matter!
---
It's like 4-5 months of 4 hours every single day including weekends or something like that.
---
I don't see a Problem.
---
One layer is "apparently" on Server size. So one Server size has one world Event.
---
If it wasn't abusable and we were to believe that layering will be removed because that many People stop playing. It would be all good IMO.
---
Now we don't believe sooooo.... :D
---
Dude, from what people were saying there was cp in that discord. 
---
I don’t mind your standard trolls, it’s fun watching people get worked up other that stuff.
---
It’s people like you I try to avoid, I like my constructive environments where people talk, have fun and work together over solving problems.
---
No “OMG this sucks, you will kill the game” posts. Stuff like that are pointless in my option, I want to see people talking about how we can fix the problem. Let’s pool are collective knowledge and help solve the problem with the community managers and developers. 
---
“Try to leave every *place* you visit *a* little less sh$@\*% than you found it”
---
Cacti apples? Or how does this grammar stuff work
---
It can if you type in chat ingame:
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Or, add SET chatClassColorOverride "0" to your Config.wtf now.
---
If you use the chat command it also ends up in your config.wtf btw.
---
Take a look at their pre-raid bis lol
---
Grob means grave in Serbian :)
---
I remember swaping to full epic only for pvp and afking in the city to have the noobs something to inspect
---
Add the hotdogs to the omelettes! or just slice it and fry it with some sliced potatoes [not my recipe](https://www.justapinch.com/recipes/main-course/main-course-other-main-course/simple-hot-dog-and-potato-hash.html)
---
Way too hard to tell. I was personally going to wait until the day of launch to re-sub but decided to try and reserve some unique names. I would say there is a huge number of people that don't care about snagging a name.
---
Clickbait.
---
I really, really, really like EQ back in the days. I joined with Shadow of Luclin, so 2000? I was 19 but my friend was playing way before that and use to watch him kill bats.
---
Different mindset, I had fun, but never look back once I got into WoW stress test and been playing since day 1.
---
Haha, legend.
---
More like prisons and the police system are thriving because of immigration all over western Europe (safe for East Asian and intra-european immigration).
---
The rest, not so much. Hence why countries like Sweden despite their humanitarian values have started closing the doors to economical immigrants for a couple years, as their social system won’t last much longer if people keep coming.
---
Esfand caused my mom and dad to break up and then one night at dinner, looked me right in the eye, and said “I’m your daddy now”
---
I didn't know you'd need one.
---
Listen son, how about you take that rational pragmatism and run it down the road. It's not welcome here.
---
silkroad online had this also! i loved it

Laughs in undead

No mana entire fight, better not use the innervate off cooldown. It was still a very exciting fight to watch.
---
You are so lucky man! Congratz for owning the set! 
---
Tried to get Llane's ring but the price went totally insane at the end. \*shakes head\*
---
your comparing bricks to fruit. there have been "hackers" one of the most common is a speed hack to move at 200% speed or some other rediculous speed. Blizzard is quite decent at acting on these reports and probably uses some software to detect these issues.
---
Golechadd squad, represent. We are going to be on Golechadd horde side, too, come say hi!
---
In a game like a first-person shooter, your client is sent a lot more information, often including the position of players you can’t actually see. This is because the game is too fast-paced to work under keeping everything server-side. You also have cheats that help players be more accurate and react more quickly than human dexterity even allows.
---
In WoW, the game is slow enough that everything is done on the server and that server doesn’t send you any information that the client has to hide from you to prevent cheating. There also is no advantage to having a machine assist you in playing the game.
---
I think many better guilds give the askhandi's to rankers over hunters. It is indeed pretty good for hunters but gets bested by ZG 1handers (dagger+sword offhand). Here's some math:  
---
Asscandy (+25agi) 136 RAP, 0,47% crit   
---
ZG Combo (+15agix2) 116 RAP, 2,56% crit   
---
Even Barbarous blade from Dire Maul, with +25 agi gives you 110 RAP, 1,47% crit, which is comparable to ashkandi's stats.  
---
Can't be bothered to do math on brut blade + CHT but those are probably better than ashkandi too. With that said, brut blade will be sword rogue &gt; fury prio and cht will be dagger rogue &gt; hunter prio most likely, so they'll have to wait a bit for those anyway.  
---
As you can see, its not bad but there's definitely better options or just AS good options that are way easier to obtain. Good luck ranking vs premades with a barb blade over ashkandi as a warrior though. :D
---
Get good.
---
Lvl 1-3 mobs shouldn't ever touch you, concussive extends to 4-5, raptor striking takes that further.
---
By level 9, mobs should be down low enough that your second strike is dropping then below the threshold where their speed is reduced and by constantly side stepping you can auto them soon after.
---
Not all the time obviously, misses and the like. But shit dude. They have you the mechanics and all but spoon feed you the scenarios to learn it.
---
You get track beasts at lvl 2 so you can immediately watch your kite pathing.
---
Hrm! I didn't know that! I suppose the only *real* reason someone living in the east would prefer eastern over western would be so that they could do things like raiding and pvp at the same time as others, and not have this 3 hour time delay (which, if you're working full time, could impact how productive your play time is!)
---
Very interesting addon, would be very interested to see that being developed! Good Luck!
---
No cause kiwis will be awake and farming.
---
for the pvp thing u absolutely should play on one if u roll a druid or rogue for stealth
---
Ah the good ol' pen and paper list &lt;3
---
&gt;I'm sticking to my Timbermaw rep grind.
---
Not the smallest time investment either
---
Right? What is this list? Throw in some Pink Floyd for questing in Ashenvale.
---
what was the mistake?
---
This is the kind of shit that makes me despise retail, and even elements in Vanilla. All these easy jokes are just cringe, and incredibly immersive breaking. I remember doing a quest in Drustvar a few months back and getting some feelsy experience for one, since it was about a guy who got killed and you going back into the past and seeing his marriage. And what do you know, the assassin literally says "Nothing personal, kid," and it's even voiced so you know they meant it. Just so fucking retarded. Fuck anyone who likes this trash.
---
You obviously never played WoW classic lol.
---
I'm pretty sure that peak hours the first week is gonna be from 0am to 12pm
---
Nice suggestions, from countless no life grinding with every expansion since cataclysm release.
---
 I can say soda is usually not the best way to go long term. But it sure is tasty 😋
---
Bursts of exercise every 4 hours is really a great idea like jumping jacks, or even push ups. 
---
And the more fiber you consume to help with bowel movements the better in between all those high saturated fats and unhealthy carbs we're going to attempt to digest.
---
5minute steam in microwave vegetable bags are a good solution, just add soy sauce or teriyaki sauce to it and it's a helluva snack with little to no prep, perfect to cook for those bathroom breaks.
---
Like soda, energy drinks if chugged do get the job done, if you can find one tasty to you. I love NOS orange personally. 
---
Coconut oil tablets or cook your food in it for natural energy.
---
Also a good idea. Is to get a full 8 hours sleep prior to release, and then stay up until the next day u naturally go to sleep, it's best way to keep ur sleep schedule and get everything done.
---
Oh, you too? My mom is dead, but I hope yours is proud!
---
Is that an mmo or a place where people illegally sold drugs on the internet?
---
At that time the servers will be a lot quieter yes. At launch they will still be packed because for the first 4 days (typically) people are going hardcore and will play crazy hours. After that, you should find it easier.
---
Ahh shit.. good point
---
Kind of but actually no. Being able to read and modify the source code doesn't mean it is open source if it doesn't have an open source license. If someone is a dick about it they can sue you.
---
Just want to point out the panda monks who brewed beer have at least been in the lore for almost 30 years. Hell theres a few quests about Chen Stormstout sprinkled throughout the horde in Classic wow. So if you want to know how long World of Warcraft would remained untouched from things like that, it was like negative 15 years.
---
Yes because a moderated space with some basic rules id so toxic compared to a bunch of 4chan edgelords spamming racism and CP. Makes sense.
---
Undeddie, I am forsaken Woman now, you treat me like animal. Undeddie, I WANT HALF

I don't really give a fuck if he made it to naxx or not. He's a player just like everybody else who plays the game learn from their mistakes and improves accordingly. I'm not watching him because he's some MLG pro gamer. Not every streamer needs to be a try-hard elitist prick
---
Silkroad
---
Like the other guy said, enjoy playing alone :)
---
just go stalagg it will fill up come launch day.
---
most of us elitist have solified herod as our home and are salty types not willing to reroll.
---
I agree with your volatility concer for faerlina.
---
Yes, I'm tired of people only making videos, I always have to skip to find the info I'm looking for.
---
I haven't subbed.  I also low key think anyone who subbed to reserve a name is a bit of an idiot.
---
You're going to miss Cannibalize hard. UD for me even if the stun resist was 50%.
---
I find they win equally as much, might even give the edge to alliance if we count AV too.
---
Yeah it was a worry for me too.  But the bfs never played wow before so that will be a very different journey to solo/playing with mates.  Hoping it will motivate me watching him experience things for the 1st time
---
Thanks for the info and help :)
---
&gt;Also, why no + or - buttons?
---
It lets you scroll in and out to zoom so the + and - buttons are not needed, but it threw an error before it executed that code.
---
Looks like it will be a quick fix tho. Just gotta be on to see what frames are what. 
---
Chat looks gnarly with hooksecurefunc errors, but shouldn't be too bad.
---
Thanks again.
---
Agi increases wand damage. Valid roll and not ninjaing. Learn the game.
---
Sounds intteresting project.
---
Would love to hear more about this in the future.
---
Leveling in holy is like climbing up a mountain made of honey. With lots of time and dedication it can be done but it’ll be one of the most exhausting things you’ll ever do. I might as well have cut off a hand it was that painful.
---
Thunderfury. 
---
I will do anything for Thunderfury this time around. 
---
Anything.
---
There was soooooooooo much untapped potential in Wrath - really reminded me of the untapped potential in Vanilla. And the class imbalance carried much of those same frustrations in Vanilla... both were amazing and wonderful and nothing else has come even remotely close to them imo. Such good stuff.
---
Would also like to see Sauce.
---
Always played horde. Rolling alliance this time.
---
So don't roll on Faerlina then. Any other streamers will be a non-issue.
---
Isn't this thing notoriously over-hyped? Like isn't there a blue sword that's better?
---
Yeah that's not good enough of a source to claim that APES are going Gehennas.
---
Ok i will make it today, let you know how it went
---
I'm Alliance in retail. Horde in classic.
---
On launch day I'm looping this episodrr and looking up all the old WoW youtube machinima I can find.
---
I'll never forget some gnome who did this in WSG. Was hilarious watching him rubber band around quickly.
---
Eh hard no things don't get hard til like ST. Scholo and strat are when things get really dangerous.
---
My bad, wasn't being clear. I just mean that the highest population servers usually are the ones with the best raiding / PvP scenes and economies. The mid pops are probably fine, but IMO the more players on a server, the better
---
You have to do one for the Thaddius fight in Naxx, but that’s all I can remember for mandatory jumps at those levels.
---
What is the story behind this meme?
---
Played a Tauren Hunter, no idea about dungeon roles or threat of course. I also somehow missed the quest for the pet and leveled to around level 20 without pet, needless to say the game was very hard and it took ages as I died a lot, but I did learn how to step kite by myself out of necessity. At some point a dwarf hunter, my level with pet (pve server) followed me around spamming /question. I think I got the hint at that point that something was wrong and asked when I should get the pet quest.
---
Of course I did not learn my lesson and did not read up anything about pets and completely missed the fact there was such a thing as pet ability levels and growl until level 45ish, making my pet a pretty useless dot instead of an amazing tank.
---
On the upside, I was pretty bis at kiting and dps during movement encounters once that actually came up during raiding much later. No other hunter had an idea about step kiting effectively.
---
Im german and I am rolling on a english pvp server ( undecided wich yet ). Dont worry tho I wont speak a word of german in my entire time on that server. The only reason im going to play there, is because I despise most of the german gaming community and dont want to deal with all those ppl.
---
It's just a name, you literal mental midget.
---
I've never played WoW. But I want to be an Orc warrior.
---
What do you mean by item progression plan? Send help.
---
Alright then, lets apply logic:
---
On the one hand, a guild could hand TF to a tank, which will boost the entire raids dps by a huge margin, benefitting the entire raid for the remainder of classic.
---
On the other hand, the guild could hand it to a rogue, which may boost one guys performance by a bit, benefitting the raid by almost nothing in comparison.
---
All this keeping in mind that acquiring the weapon demands the investment of time and resources by the entire raid.
---
Please point out to me the rational reason a guild would have to give it to you.
---
Don't roll on Faerlina then. Any other streamers will be a non-issue.
---
Its an adictiooooooooooooon, I do drink a lot of "healthy flavored water" which has 10x less sugar than coke but still tastes good to me. Basically Lemon/Raspberry/Apple flavored carbonated water.
---
I like going outside for 10 minutes to clear my head while a snack is cooking so I really have to try out the vegetable bags! I do have a steamer inside my oven but I only used it 2 times.
---
Late 2005,  a Warlock named Darknesslord ran past me weilding that weapon with unholy enchantment. Two weaks earlier same guy asked me where i got my Voidwalker from.
---
Vanilla everyone....
---
Noon here. What keys do Blacksmiths make?
---
As others have said in here it's not an issues with nationality itself, it's the language barrier. Large groups of Spanish and Italian players have shown that they can not and will not speak English, making it very hard if not impossible to play with or form any lasting relations with.
---
If you speak English then all of this becomes a non issue.
---
Simply, if you speak English I will have no problem playing with you.
---
Who runs it? BDE? ADSO? None of the above?
---
When you get it you better be like
---
"ARCANITE REAPER, HOOOOOOOOO!!!"
---
So, this addon has HUGE potential. It's essentially a Bazaar feature that I think Blizzard should've implemented years ago.
---
Suggestions would be to have addon sort players items by realm/faction and upload to a website for players to select their realm/faction and then they can simply ctrl F for the item, find the player, and whisper the player personally.

One of the comments:
---
“Eh it's kinda crappy to me that they over look people who have contributed to the game for years or helped build communities around it to add a person who made a reddit post recently that wasnt insightful, helpful or even funny. Just seems like there are better candidates for people to add as NPCs to the game....”

Jeez. What a sad, bitter person.

Most gaming companies wouldn’t be able to force you to run something like Warden without huge backlash. It’s more robust than most spyware/malware and requires permissions that no one should really give over.

The people who run Golemagg, Gehenas and ClassicWoW-EU discords launched an alternative discord with better moderation for Shazzrah last night.

Just think about it logically for a second:  
---
In case of a local/national emergency, would you honestly condemn everyone that doesn't have a tab of Facebook/Twitter open? What did the government do before these social media giants? Nothing? No system in place to warn for emergencies?  
---
Also, would you honestly trust your life in a third party like The Succ to warn you of an immediate local or national emergency?

300-400g of Fresh Pasta
---
4-6 slices of Bacon
---
1dl of a dry (cheap) white wine
---
1dl cream
---
Half of the cheapest "Parmesan" 
---
1 egg
---
1. Start boiling some water. 
---
2. In a large pan. Cook the bacon ti'll it is not raw, but not enough so that it becomes crispy.
---
3. Add the wine to the bacon pan. Let it cook for 30s-1min. Meanwhile pasta water should be ready, add the pasta to that.
---
4. Add cream, shredded "parmesan" and lots of pepper to the pan. 
---
5. When everything in the pan has gotten each other and the pasta is done (its fresh, so we're talking 1-2mins of boiling). Add the pasta to the pan.
---
6. Add the egg then stir ti'll you have a creamy carbonara.

There was a poll on here a couple of months back. It was overwhelmingly DM, but there were a number of large realms that called it VC in the US.

VC is dumb and stupid, so DM is the only true option.

People are gonna tell you they turned on the beta to do just that. Maybe they did, a little.
---
The real reason is free advertisement on twitch.
---
Ok, thanks!
---
I absolutely love Mulgore, might have something to do with a Tauren druid being my first character!
---
I find Durotar to be very boring looking, just red dirt everywhere.
---
Even fort nite doesn’t compare to the cultural impact vanilla wow originally had. Only a few things do, like the original SW trilogy. There’s a reason there are documentaries on both. Fortnite will get it’s to be sure, but I reckon it won’t quite up there. It’s also dropping so fast
---
Questie &amp; Ez Junk working fine from open beta.

I should really make some fresh pasta again, especially for lasagna. Thank you for your recipe, never tried it with white wine but it sounds really good in my head :)

So love watching that one streamer get ganked over and over who only know's one childish word to say... "retards"

to be honest it was only a few that needed the whole raid to be attuned, most just needed one person with the key to let the others in. and even the others only needed to attuned as if you weren't you would have the run the dungeon that was linked to it. only one i think you needed to attune to regardless was naxx but could be wrong about that

Krol blade + mirah's song are pretty much equal to dal'rends (if you have both) 😊

For some reason shitloads of carbs and fats make for the best marathon gaming food, I’d prepare like 12 containers of potato bake and 12 spaghetti bol if I was gonna go super hard.

I love this, will download right away. In a kind of related note, I'm still looking for the Lore Library addon.. the one that lets you record the various books around the world that you can read so you can read them again whenever you want. I love that stuff.
---
Terrible how some people feel the need to lecture you and downvote you after you made a joke comment.
---
Yes, obviously I wasn’t talking about level 1-6 and yes, it’s pretty easy to get mobs down very low on life before even having to melee them. But getting 2 more shots by getting a couple steps back and monitoring Yaht is not kiting ...
---
And if you get into a melee situation with 2 mobs at level 6-10 with a Hunter you’re very likely to die. That has nothing to with “getting good”. You have no abilities to defend yourself at that level, you probably have a shit 1H weapon and do shit damage, so it generally boils down to RNG. Track beasts ? I don’t think there’s any class who dies to beasts in starting zones, it’s always humanoids/undeads/demons who are an issue. No need for a condescending comment, really ...
---
That’s incorrect. Many UK players on Gehenass and Golemagg
---
European here who lived in the States for 4 years.
---
Totally, you just have to acquire a US account. I got help through costumer support to make one. So right now I can switch between playing on EU or NA on the same account. Just put in mind that you have to pay sub for each user though.
---
feel it made it more of a rush to get max level and people missed out a lot of the story line and things you would get with attunement
---
No player should go hungry ;) 
---
Also if you wont make a lot of dishes with White wine or Parmesan - make a simply risotto (with fresh spinach or mushrooms) later!
---
Nah I played it first time in wrath I remember 100%
---
So noob question; why exactly is this weapon so good in pvp?
---
Got you, mate!
---
I PvPed and raided as a Shadowpriest throughout all of Classic up until MoP.
---
In Classic SP is exceptionally strong in PvP when you get gear, and you don't need PvP gear. PvE stuff is excellent for it. There are however some major drawbacks. You have no reliable CC outside of Fear which is counterable by all Undeads, Dwarf Priests, Warriors and can break quite easily on damage. Speccing into Blackout for PvP is an RnG fest. Mindflay range is VERY short and only saw buffs in later expansions, Classic spell pushback and mind numbing (Slower cast time) basically nullifies Mind Flay. Mana gets eaten alive with no regen ability. No debuff dispel/cleanse protection. No Shadow Word: Death for instant casts.
---
DoTs and Mindflay cannot crit (Hellloooo Classic) which makes it a very weak stat benefiting only one spell (Mind Blast)
---
Undead is by far and away the best class for it (Devouring Plague) which is now an any race DoT. You wont have it as anything but Undead in classic.
---
SP was a compromise build and it was a labour of love. In raiding you WILL need the support of a druid and warlock. 
---
I still don't regret it. I was a PvP monster and had the support of a guild to raid as shadow. The class is so different now to then it's incomparable though. Even Shadowpriests in TBC were a world apart in terms of PvE and Raid utility.

---
I've been using this - are the any addon that adds something like it ingame?
---
Poland, Finland and the Netherlands are on Shazz as well
---
The local channels are layered, if the X-roads is under attack, it will be so in your layer (at least).
---
Are there any world bosses in phase 1?
---
The problem is that You have the worst mobility among healers and no instant heal/hot, that forces you not to
---
Move while healing.
---
 but in BG, a healer is almost always welcome.
---
Go to Bali mate. Classic will be there when you get back.
---
true but if u go to the gehennas discord, its full of people with the clantag, while the other servers aren't
---
Sue for what? There aren't any damages because you're not allowed to make money from addons.
---
And that's completely fair and understandable. However I was talking about the people who go out of their way to harass/mock/bully Spandards or Italians.
---
It's OK to avoid a person or a group, but it's not okay what has happened with the Spaniards on Shazz the last couple of days.
---
There is a lot of variety in ramen though. I sometimes make my own Chashu and ramen noodles (well more like udon noodles). But I also eat a lot of instant ramen and just add meat, spring onions, eggs, mushrooms or other toppings on it.
---
I was ret all throughout BC.. the day the Wotlk pre patch hit was amazing!
---
No longer was it a joke but something to be absolutely feared. I still remember my first pvp event in the prepatch. A resto druid started attacking me thinking he would widdle me down slowly.. Stun, crusader strike, judgement &gt; Dead druid.
---
He just laid there.. on the isle of qual danis, he now knew the fear.
---
who is the streamer that looks like seth rogan?
---
You're a master of the art of Trolling.

wtf lol
---
Good luck! We need more data on these subjects for future game devlopers to understand their audience.
---
I really wish the Alliance in-game banners were changed to the ones from the movie. 
---
Way fucking better.
---
Want to play a Mage probably, but can't decide between Alliance (for max nostalgia since that's what I played in Vanilla) or Horde for a bit of novelty. Will be playing on a PvP server and focusing mostly on leveling and battlegrounds.
---
Why not?
---
&gt; Are there any world bosses in phase 1?
---
Exactly. People forget that timegating =/= long content paths. Time gating means that you literally cannot do the thing yet because not enough time has passed. Daily quests are timegating. Weekly quests are timegating. Even the fucking raid-reset timer is timegating. Long questchains and repgrinding aren't timegating in and of themselves.
---
4 people doesn't exactly make a guild lol
---
The instant kind is what I meant 😂 I do love me a full broth with eggs, spring onions and celery.
---
Sorry, world bosses, wrong term!  I mean like, Rexxar or something.
---
Great stuff
---
Damn dude you are extremely obsessed with this game, arent you?! Imagine secretly loving smthg so much that you spend several times a day playing the baddy around online platforms to be a part of it.
---
The Beta is kinda pointless. I logged in and setup my Addons and then never touched it again. So close to release it feels kinda pointless doing some leveling in a random levelrange.
---
There is a big Part of german players, playing on EU Servers
---
Go back to your containment server.
---
God I hope not else there will be so many layers we might as well just be 1 server all regions
---
Because it takes away from the social aspect which makes vanilla great: you learn to make some friends with people who you can do dungeons well with and are forced to interact with them in a more real way.
---
This is based on mainly discord communites and forum posts from the bigger guilds
---
Yea lol I played it because I couldn’t afford wow sub back then

I don't know mate. This is the info I was given :)
---
Apes claiming they are joining Gehennas should hopefully balance the server abit causing people who want to play with/not against them to join alliance.
---
Seems a likely possiblity so they can avoid the big guilds on Golemagg.
---
It's not bad at all, the damage isn't phenomenal but you have virtually no downtime and significant multitarget potential. The leveling process on the way to bear form is far worse IMO.
---
Damn 40 hours! Im only 24 but I already feel too old for this haha. I will most likely go for 20 hours (4am to middnight) and then sleep for 6 hours at the beginning. Got any good potato recipes? 
---
And also Carbs4life, I did try keto, I learned a lot of very very tasty recipes that I like but I cant quit pasta/bread/rice.
---
So I would need a sub to play in EU an one to play in US?
---
Come and join us Brexit boys on Shazz! We shall not be in the EU together.
---
&gt;They won't disable character creation... how are people still thinking this in 2019?
---
Because this has been a restriction set in the past for locked servers. You could only create a character in a locked server if you already had one. You could (try to) log or create new characters if you already had characters there, but if you had nothing there, you were blocked from doing both. 
---
I think that this hasn't happened that much in any case, but I don't see the problem of thinking that Blizzard may potentially (although not likely) take the same approach that they have taken in the past to really full servers.
---
And to think all of that became irrelevant at some point in Cataclysm... azeroth was (is!) huge and full of beautiful places and wonders.
---
This is the most nostalgic video I saw in a while, so much that it hurts in a strange way.
---
Can’t wait to embark again on adventures to those places. Thanks for the video!
---
I wonder if apes are going to do devilsaur mafia again? Would that even be allowed according to the ToS?
---
Just reading about that made me laugh, it just sounded so ludicrous. I played a ton of classic and never saw anything like that. There were people who would try to game the economy cross-faction by using neutral AHs a lot, but that was it. If you did that together with securing a special resource and use it as a monopoly..it would be crazy.
---
Reminded me a lot of EVE online, where the playerbase basically runs the economy and where you'd find similar tales.
---
I highly doubt it, since it runs on the current, thus modified engine compared to back then.
---
"Better specs"
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I was thinking the same.
---
According to the census that was made here on reddit, the Spanish community is estimated to populate approximately 10% of Shazzrah.
---
i always wanted them off alts but not mains, until they added a new gate for alts in the for of AP and Rep to be able to do the core things you want to do, i'm not talking about having that ultra rare pattern from an obscure faction, i mean being able to make a rank 2 pattern to let me level my profession to max

Undead racials are actually better so if you love the way undead looks, it's a no brainer.
---
And what is the risk with having "multiple" Rexxars?
---
This thread is gonna be deleted fairly quickly, but there have always, or almost always been a way to modify your character model, and I know that at least one "project" that has focused on it during BfA is doing one for classic as well.
---
A night elf has died.
---
The cycle of life can be cruel.
---
Honestly having such a hard time picking a class, so I at least decided on a RACE, I will be playing Night Elf, I’ve ruled out priest because fear ward is OP and dwarfs, I leveled a warrior to 15 and enjoyed it quite a bit, just extremely slow to level and the sword expertise humans provide is really good just not willing to go human. I am also open to playing rogue or druid, just not exactly sure if any druid dps specs are even viable, I should also mention i dont want to tank because im newish to vanilla, the one I dont really care for that much is hunter because ranged isn’t that appealing to me. Thoughts and or advice?
---
There are dozens of us! Probably going to Gehennas.
---
Aye I worry about community integrity with such an inevitably high amount of layers. Gonna be tough to have spontaneous friendships occur due to repeated encounters. Won’t feel like a world either when I know I can jump between dimensions.
---
Me and 4 of my friends play wow retail, but we want to play wow classic as well, so we all reserved names because why not..
---
regardless of graph accuracy this is exactly right adding realms aft the core playerbase have placed their guilds and made external arrangments is hardly going to fix the overpop issue with realms like herod.
---
&gt;You really think Blizzard will lock servers because its full?
---
They have done it in the past. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/9tCDRnT.jpg?2). Locked means that you can't create characters (or transfer) on it unless you already have characters there. Quite the extreme solution, but it has happened in the past.
---
Grats on the singlest dumbest reply of this week by the way.
---
If racial's were all even then I'd likely stay Horde but I always wondered how much difference being a human rogue would make to my dps, so I'll probably try it out this time. Also, since I've never been Alliance it will be a fresh experience for me which will hopefully add to my enjoyment and immersion. Having said this, I'm going to miss out on the nostalgia of leveling up in Horde zones which is kind of a bummer.
---
Oh boy, here we go.
---
Tell them you don’t remember anything.
---
&gt;I see this as the only option tbh

You could, I don’t know, grow the fuck up.  That might work.

Am I the only one who didn't sub just for name? I am sure I can come up with decent ones at launch, while names similar to Arthas and Illidan must have been insta taken.
---
&gt; over 2GB of RAM and hog 80% of an intel i7 after 15 minutes.
---
Damn, that’s probably more demanding than Classic itself.
---
It's nitpicky, but "Will take 9 weeks to aquire" isn't really accurate. It's not 9% over all runs, it's 9% per run. Your first run it's a 9% chance, your 100th run it's still a 9% chance
---
Phase 4 most likely as it was originally released in 1.7 which also introduced ZG.
---
By the way, the parent post is the real answer to the question. Layers don't play a part at all.
---
Ok, I keep that in mind.
---
rep shortage and potentially gold shortage will hurt your mount situation.

Unless they increase or decrease the amount of layers, in which case the amount of people allowed in would increase or decrease which then would cause the queue to either increase or decrease.

Yep, i think is the way our minds work.

Good luck with people anyway!

We dont know when Hunter quest will be available. Could be phase 2. Hunter quest came in 1.4 patch
---
Dude this. WoW classic coming out has been a tremendous source of motivation for me. More often than not I can tell myself to get shit done so I’m ready for release, and once it’s out I’m gonna do the same thing: get shit done so I can have my free time. It really makes a difference, I’ve played so many great games, but god the industry has been in a shithole of greed these last few years, with no integrity towards gameplay or quality.

These server war memes are actual dogshit.

Or add the white wine in a bag with soy sauce, grated ginger and/or garlic. Add strips of chicken or pork and marinade 1-6 hours. Then you can add whatever coating you want (I like panko) and then fry it :D

So true.
---
Don't you mean XIV ?
---
I hope its atleast 70 to 30 I'm really hoping its not a 90 to 10
---
Not since they stopped announcing subs in 2015. There are probably some charts from WotLK times on active players. Those numbers are usually true in correlation to active players vs average online.
---
It stems from retail servers, similar to NA and the BRs and Latin countries.
---
Pozzo'dell is a truly awful server to be paired with and almost anytime you're grouped with someone from it you're in for a bad time with a bad player (who will probably make a single mistake, blame someone else then kick them/leave).
---
Does that make the Italian community bad? No, and people probably play with Italians/Spanish on "English" servers all the time but just don't realise it because they don't have that obvious server tag identifying them as "FOREIGNER HERE!!!" and are speaking English.
---
"painful choices". Like, the racial differences between orc and UD are what you consider painful choices because of what you've read on the forums?
---
Man, those fucking minmaxer elitist assholes. They are destroying everything that is fun in this game. Fuck them, really.
---
stonetoss is a nazi
---
&gt;If the population doesn't reduce significantly, will layering also be removed?
---
This is the big question. Blizzard have implemented layering in the hopes that most people quit before P2, which they will. But if not *enough* people quit, we have a problem. Most likely they'd have to open a new realm before P2 hits and ask some remaining players to transfer there.  This is because they'd explicitly stated that they don't want server merges or to keep layering on. They could potentially have very high population servers and keep dynamic respawns on across the world but that's not "vanilla-like" at all.

Doubt. The record was like 4.5 logging off after using hearthstones and using full rest xp.

My girlfriend works so that i dont even see her much during week. I work 8:30 - 17:00 while she works 13:15 - 23:00. So i can have all the gaming time in the world now after work but honestly id rather spend time with her if i could. Its just more fun. I suppose different people have different priorities.

Nothing really I guess, just wondered.  There is however a risk of having multiple 'nodes' for mining, alchemy etc.. In the BETA I could log out/in and mine the same node which felt a bit like a cheat :/.

My work friends and I haven't subbed because we haven't played for a while but we can still download and install classic. You'd be better looking at classic install base I believe
---
You do realize that not everyone who’s playing did a random reddit poll lol.
---
Why? We played together in vanilla, and we're looking for that. Layering absolutely does not fit in with that. It's not like we're climbing buildings shooting about the failure of classic, we understand it's the best of a tight spot for Blizz. We just don't want it.

From the survey on server choice, the EU-RPPVP realm seems fairly balanced (+5% for alliance). But that is just reddit talking. I am guessing it will lean even more towards alliance after launch, like 60/40

I never understood why some weirdos call it VC. It makes absolutely no sense.

People like you is precisely what I point out to friends who somehow thing the game being old means it’s not compelling to newcomers. It’s a new game that just happens to have an old design philosophy, and guess what - gaming minus shitty micro transaction philosophy = better.

I see it has become "cool" recently to shit on Sulfuras as apparently being a "terrible weapon".

It's not. 
---
Alright, it's not the best in the game (why would it be? it comes from the very first raid), but at least in PvP it's still better than just about anything besides Dark Edge of Insanity and Might of Menethil. Both of which drop from the last bosses of Ahn'Qiraj and Naxxramas.
---
They could have replaced the 30 fire resistance for something more useful though. Pretty sure by the time a guild member has Sulfuras, Ragnaros is going to be on farm at that point.

im not saying that a raid cannot carry a ret. i am saying that all the guilds ive seen with them were either so good they could do anything with any roster or so terrible they wouldn't clear vanilla in 100 years. ive seen top end guilds competing for the fastest clear times with a boomkin. that boomkin was only there because the egolomaniac leading the guild was a warlock and wanted that buff for himself.
---
i have yet to see any serious guild clearing with a ret in the raid. because the guilds that can kill KT just don't have them. none of these players actually wanna be this dead weight. and the others are not good enough.
---
and yeah ofc im talking about 2nd half of aq and naxx. because in bwl you can literally roll your face on the keyboard to get past it.
---
You are correct and made a valid point, I should not be speaking for the whole of scandinavia. I’m sorry about the missleading title.
---
is this a unstylish oogas or something?
---
Making me wanna roll on faerlinas
---
Good luck! It's not like private servers.
---
Pretty sure if you go hard like this you will out level the majority of the "pack" so you won't have as much competition. And if people are sitting around ganking people then they are wasting time not leveling.
---
The thing where you can log in/out and just keep mining combined with getting invited to swap layers is something I hope (and have heard) they change.
---
Just having more nodes overall should be somewhat counteracted by having a more players overall. It will be proportional (if that helps or not, I am not experienced enough to tell).
---
I'm expecting the competition for devilsaur early on to be insane, ngl.
---
You forgot the cosmic brain reason... rolling troll for Thex 😂
---
Especially not cry laughter. Tasty Swedish nerd tears. Got addicted over the years !
---
Absolutely not the majority of players. Just a bunch of guilds that proclaimed servers.
---
What does it matter? 
---
There will be queues at launch.
---
If it's not on every server- the servers without queues for the first hour is still not empty........ they just didn't need to put a queue on it.
---
Noted thanks!!
---
Asherons Call did this as well. Eventually there were so many merchant bots they created a marketplace for them all. Was pretty cool.
---
Ya, it's like 50/50 with those who chose the new server. As a fellow scandic, I would love them all to stay at Shazz
---
Layering might make it way more viable than we expect. Otherwise yeah it'll be kinda rough.
---
Does anybody on EU's Zandalari Tribe (RPPVP) happen to have the name Evenstar? :)
---
Painful choices - trying to level enchanting on my first toon while trying to save for an epic mount in vanilla, not understanding that warlocks shouldnt melee things for damage, asswipe talent builds that never got to anything relevant, selling boots of the lynx for little better then vendor prices. You know - making mistakes?
---
Why the downvotes? I'm just telling the truth.
---
All the info about spanish players going to Golemagg or splitting in both servers is wrong. If you read spanish forums you'll find there are just 2 or 3 trolls talking about going Golemagg.
---
Garrosh himself was amazing.
---
My problem was the writers had to turn all other horde leaders into morons to justify his arc of becoming a villain.
---
Thrall - made Garrosh a warchief even though he didn't want to, eventually killed them in a dishonorable fight, denied responsibility and becomes shunned by the elements, he's a family man now or some shit.
---
Cairne - Tried to kill him because of a rumor, then died like a bitch offscreen. Here goes your wise and peaceful leader.
---
Vol'jin - Apparently was butthurt Thrall chose Garrosh over him and acted like an ass towards him. Tore the horde apart in a civil war, did nothing for 2 years then died like a bitch and chose Sylvanas as his successor because the voiced in his dying head told him to.
---
And the less said about Sylvanas the better.
---
Shazzrah had an 11k queue just to reserve names, I’m fairly confident all the PVP servers will have a queue in the early days.
---
I’ve been around the block a few times.
---
Dude, I'm far from any type of pc culture and stuff and I rarely complain about something on the internet but the witch hunt is real this time. As I said I've seen threads on the official forums asking to mass report Italians and Spaniards just because and it wasn't just the "lone wolf" or the casual troll. They had people agreeing with them.
---
I just want the community to avoid toxicity. I can't speak for the other Italians, we don't have a "league" or a "coalition" as other groups do, but I just hope to not be ostracized, that's all.
---
I wouldn't even know the current expansion, because I don't play at the moment. So id just google WoW and check the website, probably.
---
This is the start of a very good click-baity youtube video title
---
Rolling troll to troll alliance streamers
---
How did you deal with 50% of the horde being undead and having will of the forsaken
---
Bean
---
I thought you needed weapon skill to keep the crit level, but I might be wrong
---
I've played a lot of poe and for like 6 years I was that braindead sugar coma loser that crashed hard barely into day 1. Caffeine is a powerful drug, but only if you don't take it regularly or in massive doses. Water is the key because you need to be hydrated.
---
Welcome to classic, man! Enjoy!
---
Damn, now I want this to be an option :D
---
Each to their own but I've somehow never seen Dal'rends in over 50 ubrs runs. I get that I must be an putlier in that but I can certainly understand why people wouldn't bother eith that and just buy Krol.
---
went there 3 times with  3 chars in the test servers i dont mind it as much (2 of those chars hunter below 10)
---
Legit been considering this, but my rational is that if I get a 30% chance to utterly screw over what I feel is the biggest threat to a warlock (rogue opening combos) then the channeled life gain can be replaced with drain life + hearthstone.
---
I can't
---
Many players of all countries on all servers i'm sure. But majority of UK went and stayed at Shazzrah I think.
---
male: dwarf priest human mage
---
Female: Ne priest human mage
---
It's good at level 51, but there's lvl60 blue weapons that are as good or better that don't cost 500g
---
Best feeling when you succeed in here. Did with a 3 man team. A Druid, a Priest and myself, a Hunter.
---
Good point.
---
Classic hasn’t launches yet, so he didn’t have to carry his carappy group... yet...
---
There have been tons of cheats in Wow, here is a list of what you could do for ages, without detection mind you
---
Teleportation: used by bots and people to get to chests in instances, main way of gold farming for ages
---
Duping: much easier to detect, but used nonetheless
---
Fly hacking: high chance of player detection, but useful
---
Speed hacking: this has been possible forever, used wisely this can be used in battlegrounds without detection by players (slightly longer sprint etc)
---
Wall walking hacks: I used these as recent as legion without any issues.
---
Lua unlocking: this allows you to control your character with ingame scripts, very hard to detect server side, still used widely.
---
\*shakes head\*
---
RP PVP seems quite balanced since RP draws Alliance in bigger numbers and PVP draws Horde in bigger numbers.
---
Thex be to da gods
---
Not to mention, instance attunements guaranteed that players who eventually joined a raid had actually played with other people before - getting to the MC fragment in BRD takes time, effort and some degree of skill. All things that are vitally important for raiding.
---
Some people like spreadsheets, some like youtube videos, some flying by the seat of their ass.
---
You might get burnt out, but that doesn't mean we will.
---
Tried playing alliance the other week. Lasted 25 minutes then I got sick to my stomach and had to shower the filth off. Disgusting. Never touching that again.
---
Lots of kids mad that they got rejected in here, sad honestly.
---
Yeah speakin another language in /1 and /2 can be annoying. But don't ever try to annoy me if for some reason you join my party , with other Italians in it, and we speak italian on voice chat.
---
Blood of the Mountain and The Eye of Ragnaros are the gate keepers.
---
Solid 10/10 advice this right here.
---
Going to Golemagg with my friends, far away from Shazz retail kid server.
---
Then he isn't talking to you..............
---
.....
---
.
---
Is chipotle delivery not meal prep?
---
That's fair, man. I speak Italian ofc and I dislike people talking in Italian in general as well but in the last couple of days I've seen a lot of hate against those groups on Shazz.
---
you can but you ll have to deal with 160-400 ping depending on your location, connection, server you pick etc
---
Would be interesting on the EU discords to have roles for nationality.
---
Me.
---
My first char and main back in the day was an orc warrior, but now i really like paladins and want to main one. I mean they got like the best of the both worlds, healing and melee damage. 
---
Not to mention that almost every quest will be new, because i mained horde.
---
All this being said, i still kinda feel a want to play orc warrior. Choosing a class sure is hard.
---
Wasn't it revealed or at least hinted at recently that Sylvanas was behind it all the time? Though that would be a retcon anyway, I don't think the same writers of Wrath still work at Blizzard.
---
What i mean is still calling it the «nordic coalition» is misleading, as its only swedes left.
---
It gives unaware the impression that other than swedes are moving, which isnt the case.
---
its the regeneration smh u know nothing
---
Exactly, but it can be done on the same account.
---
Never claimed it was a meme weapon lol, read before posting.
---
And "only 1.12 version" is insanely op, The versions before cant even compare.
---
The effect is reduce armor by 700 stacking up to 3 Times.
---
And if you look up things, you would know its only bis in phase 2. Ashkandi is bis in phase 3.
---
Phase 5 is dark edge of insanty bis, then ashkandi.
---
Phase 6 sulfuras drops Down to Spot 9 on the BiS list
---
The only reason bonereaver aint higher is due to its a proc and Hard to calculate.
---
Also good to add, The list above applies to both arms and fury
---
&gt;s as long as you speak English.
---
ofc we will speak engilsh cause it is ordinary politeness. maybe not very competently, but i dont think that random spaniard,scandinavian or german speaks   english fluently =)
---
Can't get full epic without the tabard, and that was a TCG thing, don't know if it'll be redeemable in classic.
---
It is as misleading as it gets lol.
---
Reminds me on a story that was posted back during Vanilla on the unofficial forums of the EU Stormscale realm. A Rogue saw a player from the opposite faction fighting two mobs. He killed the other player, got the mob aggro afterwards and killed them too. One of the mobs dropped the Krol Blade. From what I know the loot is generated in the moment the mob dies, so it wasn't like he took the Krol Blade from the other player... but it sure felt that way for him. And I guess it felt pretty damn good.
---
It's a formidable number of Swedish, Norski and Finnish guilds going there though.
---
And for alliance dwarf female
---
Grats
---
I believe I read somewhere the other day that it was female Tauren hunter based on the survey they did on this sub-reddit.
---
zug zug
---
Ty.  
---
To be sure. The main drive of sulfuras is the epic factor, which to be fair is not to be underestimated. If i was to go for it and put in all that work, get a weapon like that.. Would feel a hell of a lot more epic and gratifying, not to mention emotionally attached to it.
---
Unless you're powerleveling i'd just take it slow, chill with (new) friends and go on adventure.
---
Yes
---
How do you know it’s a shit realm? They haven’t even opened yet.
---
I will probably be on Gehennas or Zandalar if I don't change my mind, hope to see you there :D
---
I don't think you followed.

The harm is literally the same as when you're buying gold with real money. You get an advantage without having to work for it. Especially since retail had blozzarf sanctioned RMT in the form of tokens. That you worked for it in another game doesn't matter, you also have to work for your money outside of the game. It's basically cheating with the cheat code being your credit card number...
---
Ah yeah that’s the stuff
---
Yeah, except the first half of skinning does not generate very much money, the money is at thick leather+, so skinning all mobs is not very useful, just do enough to keep it leveled untill that part saves quite some time.
---
If the mobile version cuts spell batching down I would gladly play that version instead.
---
Anybody knows of any Quest History addons?
---
[https://imgur.com/NV8tdcJ](https://imgur.com/NV8tdcJ)
---
What this quest does is save every single quest your character completes and then display them in a list ordered by increasing numbers by order of date/time completed.
---
In addition, it also lists all the quests you have abandoned as well as those quests still in your quest log at the bottom of the UI.
---
Yeah no one actually cared about that during stress imo
---
There should be no cream in carbonara
---
Davy Pirate Draenei Jones.
---
Nothing new
---
As it doesn't affect you gameplay or UI if no one else has this addon, it's worth installing it just for the case another player is using it :P The inspext inventory feature might be suitible for the case that notany people with use this addon. So you wouldn't need to maintain the list with items you want to sell.
---
Technically there is nothing stopping Blizzard delaying phase 2 indefinitely until the population reaches a point that will be sustainable without layers.

---
I will be using atlas quest for the dungeon quests but besides that I will going in blind.

Not knowing where the quests are incentivizes me to explore the unknown zones on my map, caves, and any nook and cranny I can find to see if there's an NPC quest giver.

**Server Types**
---
There are two different kinds of servers: Normal servers and PvP servers.Before you create a character, you first must decide what server type you want to play on. This decision determines how hard or easy it will be to fight other players in the game. The conditions for enabling player versus player combat are different depending on where you play.
---
**Choosing a Server**
---
If you want the thrill of fighting other players, and prefer the challenge of player-controlled opponents over computer-controlled ones, then the PvP server is for you. However, if you choose this server, be aware that in most areas of the world you risk getting attacked by higher-level enemy players when you least expect it. Not only might they be too powerful for you, but
---
they'll also strike when you are at your most vulnerable. For example, they might attack you while you are in the middle of a quest or a monster fight. Interference by opposing players is a constant reality you must accept on a PvP server.
---
If you want to restrict your gameplay to computer-controlled challenges, and want the freedom to enter PvP mode only at your own choosing, then the PvE server is for you.
---
**Normal Server**
---
On the normal server, PvP mode is disabled by default. You have to turn it on through your own actions. When you enable PvP mode, you turn on a flag that other players can see. On your own character portrait, you will see a PvP flag next to your face that looks like a shield belonging to your faction. Other players will also see this, and they will be able to attack you at will. You can enable this flag by doing any of the following:
---
* Attacking an NPC of an opposing faction, such as the opposing faction's aerial mount master, guards, quest giver, vendor, or similar NPC.
---
* Attacking an opposing player that attacked a friendly NPC. By counterattacking the first player, you enable PvP mode, and opposing players can begin attacking you.
---
* Aiding a player engaged in PvP combat.
---
* Entering an enemy capital city.
---
Besides these four ways, you can also type /pvp at the chat
---
prompt to enable PvP mode. In all cases, other players can only
---
attack you if you enable the PvP flag through your own actions.
---
You always have control over whether opposing players can attack
---
you or not on a PvE server. That means PvP is consensual-only on
---
normal servers.
---
**Turning Off PvP Mode**
---
On the normal server, PvP mode lasts five minutes. At that time,
---
you revert back to your default non-PvP mode. However, if you
---
engage in any of the above PvP-enabling actions, this timer will
---
reset to five minutes.
---
**Player Versus Player Server**
---
On a player versus player server, there are additional conditions that enable PvP mode. You can enable PvP mode by doing the following:
---
* Entering an enemy territory.
---
* Entering a contested territory.
---
* Attacking another player.
---
* Attacking an opposing NPC.
---
**Territory Control**
---
On a PvP server, all zones are divided into three categories: friendly, contested, and enemy. The concept of territory control allows low-level players a measure of security in their home zones, but also heightens the risk and danger of venturing into farther-reaching areas beyond the protection of their faction guards.
---
* **Friendly Territories:** You are safe from opposing players while you are in friendly territory unless you attack those players.
---
While the territory is friendly for you, remember that the same
---
territory is considered enemy territory for the opposing player.
---
Based on the PvP rules, you can attack enemy players who
---
come into your friendly zones, but doing so can be unwise
---
because they can only attack you if you attack them first.
---
* **Contested Territories:** Contested territories are neutral ground, and thus any player in these areas can be attacked by any opposing players. By definition, contested territories are dangerous, and all players are fair game as long as they remain here.
---
* **Enemy Territories:** In enemy territories, opposing players can attack you at will, but you cannot attack them unless they attack first or enable PvP in some other way.
---
You really don't need to know much WoW lore at all going in. RPing in vanilla is more about **your** character. You could watch the Warcraft 3 cutscenes or do some reading if you feel like it but it's not necessarily required. Your character probably wouldn't know about a lot of it.
---
From what you've said in your post I would suggest PVP. It adds an entirely new layer to the game that you just can't get otherwise. The world doesn't feel very dangerous when the enemy faction is running around completely ignoring you, they might as well not be there. PVE servers are generally for those who haven't got the time to stay ahead of the curve and would end up being constantly ganked by high level players. If you're only planning on playing one character then that alleviates that worry somewhat.
---
Also you're going priest who are absolute murderers in world PVP. Mind control is 100% the most fun ability in the game.

Well there are people who are using multiboxing and whatnot ... and if you quantify how much you are playing contra how much you’re paying in a month for your hobby, it would probably be worth it, if you use it ✌️

STV has some of the richest XP chains in the game, pvp is a pain but still worth it. 
---
The Study of the Elements chain in Badlands gives you a useful speed trinket. 
---
If you are a melee class, you should run Deadmines at least once for the quests for gear upgrades. 
---
There is a level 50 chain that starts at Hero of the Horde which gives excellent XP. 
---
For levelling plus wpvp Tarren Mill/Hillsbrad would be the biggest outside STV, and Un’Goro gets pretty crazy. 
---
Mining rich - I don’t do much with professions unfortunately!

Hello :)
---
1.st if people tell you to roll dwarf for fear ward, then ignore it and play the race you want to play as priest.
---
2nd. I start on the RP-pvp myself and I’ve never done rp myself.
---
You need to make sure you pick a propper name for you char. Or you will have to rename.
---
3.rd Don’t interupt other People’s RP :)
---
Human warrior.
---
After that most likely orc warrior.
---
After that Tauren warrior.
---
Theeeen comes the other classes. that's how many warriors i expect to play.
---
Ill be doing a miso salmon for dinner and something light but full of energy for lunch the first week. 2nd week will be burrito bowls I suppose. Lots of red bull/nos and water and snacks will just be whatever I can find haha.
---
Unless they overhaul the addon by launch there is no way point arrow.

This is 100% your fault for giving your tank a weapon that is only good for Enhancement shamans.

Still frost no doubt about it, with how mana efficient it is. That said fire isn’t bad, and depending on what type of person you are it might be more fun.
---
Technically correct, the best kind of correct!

Pls, I am rolling troll for the mount.

Actually I didnt think it was, thats why I was adding it to the list of missing addons - But it seems like it might be!

Awesome!
---
"Just one quick dungeon before bed..."
---
A lot of people I know were on shazzrah but we have all moved to Gehennas
---
Maybe add mage to robe of volatile Power in MC. Its bis for them from the point they specc fire to naxx i think.
---
Noooope not yet. So many levelling guides are being built and none are totally complete, only two weeks out. The guide is over 80 pages long so it will take months to plug it in.
---
Well, the earlier versions of bonereavers had the same weapon stat. The latter versions only improved the proc and added a bit of stam. Also keep in mind, that for an arms warrior macespec is useless in pve, while sword spec is great.
---
And how is Sulfuras the best weapon in vanilla? Ashkandi is basically identical, for arms spec Ashkandi is just straight better in pve. Dark Edge is 100% better for PVP and also for PVE unless you are a human paladin. Kalimdor's Revenge, Claymore of Unholy Might and Severance are also equivalent. Ashbringer and Might of Menethil are clear upgrades.
---
For a human ret pala Sulfuras can hold itself until Naxx in pve. But for everybody else Dark Edge in AQ40 is the latest point for a clear upgrade.
---
No it isnt. Majority isnt on reddit, discord or even subbed for mere name reservation.
---
I believe I got my mh dal rend my second run an got the offhand the 4th or 5th run, has noooo idea how lucky I was
---
I never had that much problems with rogues but they'll be more skilled this time around I guess. But the amount of times CB turned around the fight in 1vsX situations was immense, not to mention its very useful in pve as well; leveling, dungeons and soloing dungeons. I don't think I could solo stuff like DM North or West as an Orc. 
---
Another underestimated benefit is when low on mana/hp in bgs you don't become such a desirable target for rogues who hunger for clothies sitting down. It sounds silly but you definitely notice the difference. Once you start pumping your hp towards 5-6k it's really nutty on a lock.
---
I will roll Orc for all my other classes but for a lock UD is a no-brainer for me, the animations and looks is just the cherry on top. That said you do you. :)
---
Stalagg gang tho.
---
Enjoy your free mount :)
---
But seriously, get a wand early. A high DPS wand when you start is absolutely baller.
---
Majority of swedes will play Shazzrah too. From the 100's of threads you can definitely see a pattern in Swedes wanting to play with English speakers rather than Swedes only.
---
One? I can name three weapons, which are straight upgrades and six which are sidegrades.
---
Is it really more mana efficient? From what I tried in private servers and in stress tests, you need almost double the frostbolts to kill a mob, compared to fireball...
---
How high can I take my cooking skill with this before the recipe turns grey?
---
Female/male Horde paladin and alliance shaman.
---
I saw that the Polish announced to be on Shazz here on this subreddit and that they promised to speak English in public chat.
---
Send them a message, I'm sure they've just forgotten
---
Wanding has a cast time unlike hunter autoshot, so if you move you delay your next shot
---
Barely any recipes are true to their origins. "True" Italian carbonara uses Pecorino instead of Parmesan and hams such as Guanciale or Pancetta, not bacon.
---
&gt; feral 
---
haha
---
How did you get here without playing wow. Are you old enough for reddit to take your wow virginity?
---
Item progression is just some pre planning of where and when to get your weapon upgrades. To save you the hassle, just google warrior weapon progression classic and a few lists will pop up.
---
Yes it is Quin, We accept you as you are.
---
What do you reckon the arcane gem prices will be like? 20 arcanite is a lot, not to mention the plans aren't exactly easy to nab
---
OP is making suggestions about the game from sources that aren't the game.
---
It’s just a simple joke no need to get so heated over it lol it’s not like this is going to change the whole game
---
I've played horde since bc.
---
SO and I are jumping into azeroth together but they play alliance. I never played alliance very much so I thought it would be more interesting. Not really a huge deal. I joke about having to kill hordies as an alliance makes me queasy lol.
---
But what I'm saying is the +healing from the short cast, which given equal values across characters, would be the same added healing to each due to the same coefficient.  So the lower mana cost from the paladin makes it that much more efficient, even before you factor in crit scaling.
---
Compare Flash of Light (115mana) to Flash Heal (315mana) which both gain the same coefficient to +healing, and that spells even higher efficiencies on fast casts for pallys.  Downranking makes it even more in their favor, as (level 20 baseline for each) r1 FoL is 35 mana compared to r1 FH's 125 mana.
---
Same for me - I joined in 2017 just before Nighthold released and I can't wait to join Classic when it goes live!
---
5 hp per second... And there's nothing you can do about it.
---
This sounds awesome and shall be tested next week. Thank you! We both love tortellini. Will try it with bacon first and then smoked tofu afterwards as we try to reduce meat in our diets.

This addon is not supposed to replace the auction house. But it can be used in situations where putting an item into the auction house isn't worth it.
---
Are you wanding?  FB to slow and kite + wand them down for free
---
5. The odds are 5.
---
Well my friend told me i need it to play classic and after buying it i found out myself you dont
---
It’s pretty accurate from what I’ve heard as well... according to the forums the Netherlands, Poland, Greece and Finland are joining Shazz as well
---
then make sure you enter every room in orgrimmar / stormwind every 10-15 levels :P
---
No they have not only some Swedish guilds did stop spreading fake news!

Tauren female hunter/druid yeah

I leveled a Dwarf Warrior in proc Spec to 60... The grind was real.
---
Frost bolt, frost, frost, wand, nova, frost, wand should be the way to go
---
This doesn’t exactly answer your question but In a non hardcore guild there are plenty of PvP specs that are fine for raiding. In other words, the RL won’t care if you’re PVP specced. 
---
Off the top of my head I think at least Holy Paladin, Resto Druid, Frost Mage, and Shadow Priest are this way. Depending on how non hardcore you mean you do it in any PVP spec. There are so many talents that are weak and just steps on the ladder to something else that you can switch them to PVP without any big consequence.
---
I have Ariana on Thalnos and Taylor on Stalagg
---
The game had been played constantly for 15 years. No longevity my ass.
---
Besides, items will only drop once their specific phase is released. They just drop in their patched version, which mostly means no Spirit on Warrior T1 and stuff like that. The really badass catch-up blues mostly come from DM which will not immediatly be open. 
---
Also, you seriously underestimate how hard it can be to get a bis blue and most people will settle for less. If you can't stand the idea of a blue being bis for you, roll a class that doesn't have hood blues. But beware, you will be running around in blues for a LONG time regardless.
---
Not to mention it's prime bind location during AQ tier.
---
aarrrr! shiver me timbers!! we lost some swedish scallywags to tha sea did we? oh well... HOIST DE ANCHOR!!!    The 27th is nigh!

Piggyback as I’m in the same position and want to see responses!

Yeah, but the problem is that they donmt spela english even on english servers, so it’s nice to get rid of them

you can and could, in vanilla we had an addon called super inspect

Wow... talk about a fucking mind-job.
---
"I love this game! It's so beaut-- WHAT THE @#$% is all this?!"
---
enjoy your echo chamber
---
The thing is: its a 2H weapon. Many guilds I know skiped it and focused manly on thunderfury.
---
This is soo good
---
Big fucking spell and melee crits? Barely needing any mana to kill others? I agree, he bashed that mage's skull in with his massive fucking rod
---
Pvp.
---
And no, you never get full bis
---
There Are some „wow oldschool pvp music“ mixes on YouTube :)
---
Just going to play normally, no mad rush, few hours after work. Don't have a guild I need to level up for to start raiding and I don't want to get burned out.
---
Logically the more non RPers, the more likely RP will be interrupted.
---
Yeah apes went to gehenass...
---
Omg, THIS is what Classic World PvP is all about!!
---
Character creations? Is wow classic up and running yet? Been busy with personal life hard to keep track of things 😅
---
Discord link is expired

Does it do the same job like OP describes? I'd like exclamation points but nothing else

I will use this

---
Why would bg’s be easy wins? With an unbalanced faction he would only get longer queue times. The team sizes are the same, granted wpvp in phase 1/2 would be dominating alright.
---
It’s because the mage template gear has nothing but intellect &amp; sprit on it leaving mages with about 900hp.
---
oh nah it like fills the map
---
This video lacks an introduction to what the hell WOW is for those who isn't into WOW at all, why Classic is relevant, what it was back then and how game shaped the whole generation of nerds. 
---
You need to speak to your audience that may not be familiar with all that and it's seems to me you are now speaking with WOW fans that already have firm grasp on the context.
---
But for us, nerds - it looks awesome!

This seems to me a decent start if you're just looking for an easy list:

Imagine being a country that known for brewer's yeast and bouncy deer.
---
There's technically no confirmation about Classic, but it's safe to assume the data center locations for retail wow are the same for Classic.  So, that's Chicago and Los Angeles.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Americas_region_realm_list_by_datacenter
---
Also, the server time zones in retail have nothing to do with where they're physically located.
---
If dracula was an npc
---
If you just want a little bit of everything RP-PVP is the way to go. If you want high competition pick one of the PvP servers. If you hate fun and never want to have it PvE is the definitely the play.
---
in central Europe I think it's around 180-200 ms
---
Not true. They announced the server yesterday afternoon and the registration was at 8pm cest.
---
Dolt
---
Better moderation? I got kicked for asking why they made the discord. The guy who owns the discord doesn’t even play on the server, he just wants to own all the eu server discords. Powertripping 101
---
Agamagann or something like that is the one usually quoted, never experienced it myself but spazzrah is truly an epic dumpster fire on the discord to the point other server admins are remaking it with blizzard CM support...I dread to think what shazz is going to be like for the unlucky ones who don't realise.

We are still gathering everyone's weekly schedules via a Google docs spreadsheet and haven't made a final decision.
---
Right now it is looking most likely that we'll be either Tuesday/Wednesday or Wednesday/Sunday at 8ET
---
First time I saw this concept was in Wonderland Online.
---
No dude. Next time you lvl a hunter, read the weapon speed (or download an addon for shot timer if you prefer), then simply shoot-move-shoot-move. 9 times out of 10 i got a mob before it got to me - it honestly only got harder at lvl 8 due to health pools, even with conc shots. If you don't get an opener, hunter is bad, but if you play your pull smart and do honestly basic kiting, it's easily the best class at lvl 1-5 imo.
---
Super stupid question here: I played NE but I can‘t remember. I by myself did the wetland run back in the day and it was cruel. Wasn‘t there any zone for NE to level instead of going to westfall? I just can‘t remember
---
Thanks dude! I’m really no expert, so that would force me to put a lot of time and effort in researching to achieve the most relevant chart for my leveling pace. But in time I might! Feel free to change the model.
---
Actually it is a very unique game. Came in 2005-06. It has caravan trading system; Player thieves can rob player caravans and get their gold etc. It was all open vast areas to lure around. And skill animations are still extremely smooth even for today. It is a piece of art.
---
Game's still up but not like the old times. People play in privates today.
---
''Yes, obviously I wasn’t talking about level 1-6 and yes, it’s pretty easy to get mobs down very low on life before even having to melee them. But getting 2 more shots by getting a couple steps back and monitoring Yaht is not kiting .. ''  
---
It is... you're bitter. Walk it off or something m8.
---
I like the analogy
---
Oops. Better get rid of engineering on a rp server
---
Horde player are gay
---
He looks like a combination of Ryan Reynolds and Hagrid!

Does anyone have any private server experience on trying to heal 5 man dungeons as a shaman enhance spec with an offset? Is it possible or no?
---

In classic you can't.
---
Damn am I the only one rolling shaz alliance
---
Thorium mining should be good at those hours. Either go to Burning Steppes or southern Winterspring if you're going to be a rogue or cat.
---
Thex, first of his name.
---
In most cases thats exactely what you do. Even if the pc can recognize it as a uniqe key, the game wont.
---
Pick up herb and mining, do about 1-2 hour farming around the starter areas = profit
---
Reminds me of the little houses in Rose Online! Cool :)
---
The population of the game will either reduce or spread. Sure you can later have lag on world bosses but only if enough people are 60 at that time. Keep in mind there will be tons of people starting out later, tons of people leveling at 20, 30, 40, 50, and then the people at 60. So even without the population reducing (which is aiming at having a smooth experience AT LAUNCH and at the beginning of leveling) I think they can take it out.
---
The main plan though, is that most people will stop playing after a while, be it the first rush, or at lvl 10-20 (probably a lot) and others later. Pretty sure their plan is solid. They'll add servers if it's problematic.
---
I guess your school didn't have proper Thex-Education plans?
---
You just have to be very slightly creative my man.
---
No you couldn’t. Super inspect did not show the talents.
---
Im half swiss and half italian so I have had both variants multiple times and I still think both are perfectly valid and tasty. I do prefer the one without cream but with parmesan instead of pecorino since I didnt like the 2 pecorino's ive tried.
---
These are not gut-feeling, but **estimates** based on months of cooperation with several discord communities and countries
---
Swede here, staying shazz.
---
This reminds me of Flyff online. It had the same feature.
---
Silkroad is reaaally underrated.
---
It should be exclusive to hammersmiths
---
You misunderstood my comment.
---
&gt;Was a difficult decision to make to go against what I had before since I’m really playing classic for nostalgia
---
I was strictly talking about the racial issue you mentioned, and the fact that you are picking Orc instead of UD despite nostalgia. This to me is not right because it is only a consequence of what shitmaxers spread on the forums. They influence people to the point they forget their subjectivity, their rpg fantasy, and just play for the numbers. The fact that they do it for themselves is fine. The fact that they talk about it out loud in the forums is cancerous for the game.
---
You can totally avoid the legit noob mistakes you're talking about in your last comment, while picking undead instead of Orc at the same time, you know? Fulfilling your nostalgia, your subjective feeling and fun is way more important than trying to minmax.
---
Horde you saw it more, most hadn't ventured into Dead Mines with any regularity.
---
There are many people of all nationalities on all servers! But Shazzrah is just where a vocal part (and likely majority) of UK players went.
---
Just curious because I'm a bit out of the loop. I keep meaning to look up the 411 on everything but will ask here if someone would be so kind to fill me in. I keep seeing the term retail and I assume that's TBC thru BfA?, but you have to have a sub to play Classic, right? Or can I play classic some other way. I actually haven't even seen anything in the game side bar on the Battle.net launcher mentioning Classic. The whole thing is confusing.
---
Hol up! Grim? The O.G? is he playing?
---
I still don't know what thex is and I still don't want to know.
---
I used a few of these on the stress test, and can confirm that they work. The ones I tested from your list were:
---
AAP
---
Questie
---
Details
---
Classic Castbars
---
This sounds too good to be true
---
Can someone clear this up for me? Shouldn’t names be account bound after official launch at August 27th? Which would mean it’s safe to recreate after launch..?
---
Every single server will have insane queue times on classic launch. Only maybe the RP servers will be able to not be 5000-15000 in queue. 
---
Shazzrah bois for life.
---
This is the true Gnome racial, humiliation in pvp.
---
Ya'll gotta bring him back asap Esfand! It was indeed one of the best so far. :)
---
Because EST server is in Chicago, it’s more centrally located than anything else, hence the larger player base.
---
Probably. Need to think about hoe I want it to work. Thought about checking the inventory for the count of items automatically. This wouldn't work anymore with bank or mailboxes. I'd probably could save the guild bank inventory, however, I don't know how the WoW API looks like for inspecting the items in the mailbox without open each mail.
---
The game releases about 17 hours before the first reset in NA. A week + 17 hours = 8 days.
---
Now that's a face I haven't seen in a very long time.
---
I can tell you what made Blizzard change their minds on classic wow, Money. Once they realised how many people wanted and how much it would cost to make from it classic wow servers then it's not a very hard business decision to make.
---
Oh, thank you, missed it. Good news :)
---
I was Alliance and my server called it DM.
---
metin2! probably the worst game i've ever played but i kinda really miss the good old days. tried it again some years ago but there are very few people left and none of them are clueless casuals like back then.
---
Woerd how the old games with no crazy ease of life features are still popular. Its like people want rpg elements in their mmorpg.

I level as fire and stack fire damage gear.

---

---
You’re the goat. Thanks.
---
Excuse me my son is also named Thex
---
Fb is like a drug addict: first normal posts are enough. You generate organic reach and fb is happy. Suddenly you realise you have to put money in it because nobody sees your posts anymore. Then you have to put in more and more and more and more money because nothing works without paid content any more. I worked for a news outlet and also did the social media part. A couple years ago we had good reach without money but then we had to start pumping money in it. It gets more every time.
---
Neither armory nor addons nor inspect shows talents of other people.
---
Nobody will inspect WoW armory unless you're seriously under performing.
---
/Inspect doesn't show talents
---
Addons can't tell how many points I have in Improved Sinister Strike
---
If one player out of 40 is doing within 20% of their ideal DPS in encounters which aren't just freecasting on a boss, will they really stand out?
---
There is a grin discord?
---
why am i laughing so hard at something so basic.
---
hi
---
If you can’t handle memes what are you doing on Reddit?
---
I mean it is pretty obvious. Retail is just a garbage game compared to Classic.
---
Nostalgia is a non argument. I don't play terrible games from 10 years ago. I play good games because they are good.
---
Imo it's easier to farm 300g than 100+ Rend runs for your Dal MH.
---
For a long time, I’ve had the idea that splitting exp in groups is generally a bad idea in vanilla. But now I’m seeing that even people aiming for speed are grouping in various ways. 
---
Am I correct in assuming that solo play generally has the most potential for speed? Does duo or group questing ever have more potential? And will dungeon grinding be something I should plan for, at least as a backup?
---
i like the 15 min cardio sets
---
Oh yea? Cenarion Battlegear too? Scepter of the Shifting Sands too?
---
What server?
---
Just a reminder you cant track herbs and mines at the same time in classic.
---
Swede here, don't give a shit.
---
Lirik is rolling there
---
Hopefully it stays this way, and hopefully Sunken Temple quests will be in too.
---
This server pride shit is cringy as hell especially since they don't even exist yet.
---
Was thinking the same.. read a guide about Warlocks and the author was like "if you are melee range.. just try to autoattack with your stuff inbetween, you probally will do more damage in that short time" and looks like he will lol
---
Can someone put some super dramatic music on this?
---
When you realize Bloodsail Buccaneers is an anagram for Buccaneers Sail Blood.
---
I did it back in vanilla for my gnome (add darnassus grind to it). Got so many looks and whispers regarding it. Used the mount almost always to end of cata when I quit wow. Definitely my favorite mount in the game.
---
That being said, that grind was crazy and I will not do it again. But good luck if you decide on doing it, it is truly awesome and unique as far as vanilla mounts go!
---
The addon just displays the items. I don't want to automate the process (don't know if it's even possible), as I want to encourage people to communicate with each other instead of automating everything. I think inter-player interactions/communicarion is very important for WoW Classic and actually every MMORPG
---
The queue times are going to be legendary.
---
There probably won't be with the current state of combat log analysis. HotW could be feasibly detected by checking your MP pool max and comparing it to what you should have in your current equipment. Even 10% increase talents can be noticeable after a raid night.
---
It's also possible that the log version of the raid boss start event will include everyone's talents to begin with. This is how it works on retail. Don't think there's a way to test that without access to MC though.
---
When I’m grinding, every time I use the restroom gonna do push-ups pull ups and squats.  Coconut oil in my coffee, adderall for breakfast
---
I like to play NElfs a lot and plan to roll them at launch because Teldrassil and Darkshore are amazing for fast leveling. The way I look at it:
---
Warrior is pain in the ass as any other race.
---
Rogue is fine, if you plan to play casually. NElfs don't really have anything to help them succeed more. I would say every other alliance race has a better Rogue.
---
Druid is just a fun class to play with and NElfs are the only option, so there is that.
---
Priest is fun and pretty easy to level. NElf might not have the Fear Ward, but Mind Control out of Shadowmeld memery is worth it.
---
Hunters are weirdos and you are #1 on the most Horde players KoS list.
---
As well as being hung like a champ
---
Lol retail bosses are not hard. Sure there are way more mechanics, but they're neutered by hand-holding addons and retail character design.  Retail toons have WAY more complete toolkits with major mobility/dmg shield/heal abilities on basically every class so its much easier to recover from missteps and boss mechanics. Mana is also way less of an issue. Just spam away. Vanilla toons are fragile and rely on each other way more. Itll still be easy but a grind for experienced players. Though not as trivial as non-mythic retail.
---
Faerlina has a few big br guilds going there.
---
I've just started seeing advertisements show up online.  Nothing on YouTube yet.  Honestly this next week will be a huge marketing push or they wait until after launch.
---
What matters is he gave us one of the greatest games of all time
---
obviously, but its a statistic, surely everyone that participated cant be an outlier
---
Would this be against tos?
---
Yeah a mafia thing will get you banned on live
---
Yes. The current version opens a window woth the items for sale if you click on another player with this addon. If you click on an npc or a player without that addon, then just nothing will happen, as if this addon wouldn't be installed
---
Your nickname triggers me :-D
---
My chrome detected a virus from this
---
That is tru. I am just honestly not even sure if I play that long. I ahve not palyed since WotLK and if my nostalgia is wearing off I might stop pretty soon.
---
made my day 😂
---
Okay yes I see now what you’re saying. And that makes perfect sense - I just highly doubt that was what op was saying, and if he was it was a roundabout way of saying it
---
There are going to be cross-realm BG's, which were present in 1.12 in vanilla. It will help queue times a lot, but we'll miss out on the server flavor from earlier in vanilla about encountering notorious players in BGs.
---
Yeah not sure, i do really like that there are genuinely hard ''instances'' in the world tho. Dungeons are fine, but we need both.
---
I wouldn't play the beta even if I had it TBH.

Me... Not only this but I also will wait for some concrete info about servers populations. I bet someone will scan the servers in the first week to know the faction balance.

Great, so now we get ads in the game
---
Hey Chrisorie4,
---
There is not a way to check :(
---
Good luck on finding a name on the server you desire!
---
Alchemists xmute pots or mining thorium that shit is used I  everything in end game
---
All the players who are somewhat dedicate have already created their characters on the day the servers went live for name reservation, which means that the only people who will flock to the new realms are the shitters who are late to the party. That is especially true for all the big guilds. If you want to be on a good server, go to where the good guilds are.
---
There is so little downside to RP-PvP that I'm suprised not more change from the PvP servers to get less impact from layering. I've heard some players say they want a "high Pop", but a full Layered server has several times the pop of a full Vanilla server.
---
we love to laugh at ourselves and there is a fan book in Russia "Black Chronicles of  Arda" where  Melkor  shows in terms of gray morality, more like  romantic, rebellious spirit, striving for freedom. We have a huge  representation of tolkien fans in 90th.

---
You have montenegro, estonia and iceland on your charts, yet youve excluded poland and finland other way bigger countries. I get that there are sure some players from these countries in these servers, but it is misleading and makes people think these are some confirmed data or that other servers wouldnt have their countrymen.
---
This depends on the guild. More organized guilds will say X gets it first to stop people having to waste time crafting. I'd much prefer to give it to a player that used the insane amount of gold needed in the craft to help the guild then to someone who spent it on a weapon they aren't using
---
To give you more context: I will play as a warrior (tank)
---
Since we have server discord there will be "spontaneous" world PvP on the PvE servers too. In general I feel many have an exagerated view on how big a part RP is on a RP-PvP server, and how there is no WPvP on PvE servers. Apart from griefing and going full Tourettes you can do pretty much the same on a PvE or RP server as a PvP server!
---
Don't worry, with how little servers there are both pve servers will be very populated.
---
The ”reckbomb? Wtf is a reckbomb?” -patches are generally hotfixes and patches are bigger units with eg changes to class mechanics along with the bugfixes

Herod went medium last night, will be dead by launch.
---
So i'm not sure if any of you noticed that there is now a "Thex" character on the test server. This implies that the thousands of people employed by Blizzard have a bit of a interest in the game. I'm sure enough of those employees, their friends and their families are interested enough in the game to keep up with general news, rumors and ideas of people playing it. They've likely either played on a private vanilla server, or had a friend/family member play.  You guys just see the company, I see all the individual people and all the other people they're connected to.
---

Does this add dot/debuff timers on the enemy? thanks
---
Apart from the usual mining and herbing, you can also go and farm mobs that are often camped. The elementals in Arathi can drop elemental stuff that sells very well (fire was the most worthy if I remember correct). If you have skinning you can take a look at the devilsaurs in Un'goro but they are elite and really heavily camped.
---
then name them :)
---
Wow. Nice. But why?🤣

Is there anything like this on retail??

Imagine paying 7 bucks for a *name*.

It's not ok. See you on the battlefield noob.

u n l u c k y
---
Cross-realm battlegrounds were in vanilla in patch 1.12 - pretty much  TBC prepatch.
---
Come top you freakin idiot
---
i've been screaming the whole first minute
---
mwuahaha, did you not realize the above truth till now lol?
---
Hah awesome. Love KJ
---
It's not a matter of pride but a fact. Just like retail, classic will have high pop realms where the best players are and the rest are shitter magnets as they have always been.
---
What guild?
---
What about combat rogue
---
I’m gonna grind mobs first to get enough cloth to make robes, D/E them and make me a wand and then start.
---
Time to see how many hordes whines as soon as bg queues become to long because they picked the strongest racials for PvP.
---
You need help, mate.
---
Diskoteket. Horde
---
Why’s that?
---
I think you'll be better off going for Imp build, I think StaySafeTV has some guide on this matter on his YouTube page. Drain Tanking seems like more solo focused playstyle.
---
Adding to this. Horde you think you want 55% of the community. But you really don't.
---
Straight better:
---
* Might of Menethil
---
* Corrupted Ashbringer
---
* Dark Edge of Insanity
---
Sidegrades/slightly better/slightly worse:
---
* Kalimdor's Revenge
---
* Ashkandi
---
* R14 Weapons
---
* Severance
---
* Claymore of Unholy Might
---
* Bonereaver's Edge
---
Atleast you will have shoes.
---
You’ll still be playing WoW.  Roughly half of the population goes Alliance and raiding is easier on that side.   I am horde through and through, so it would be weird for me too, but I would play Ally if my RL friends were rolling there.
---
Its not about toxicity or thinking we’re better. 
---
It’s just about building a joined community, which is hard when you can’t communicate with eachother.
---
You're beards and cow fascination aside, the above picture is truth itself.
---
But you still have a worse weapon in the end :/
---
You'll be fine, just roll a dwarf. Humans are boring, gnomes are awful, and everyone knows night elves are the worst players.
---
everyone here is a random redditor. who should I ask and believe then?
---
Because we were unsure about the data's given
---
Well then you’re not. That doesn’t change what the majority is doing though.
---
It's never OP. I think it's almost-preraid-BiS best case. And ye IMO their main value is for leveling.
---
All I know is EU shazzrah has 50k players and that's (full)
---
Why am I hearing Disturbed playing at full volume all of a sudden?
---
Send an email to HR, put in vacation first week of September. 
---
What can I say, I love danger
---
if your name was on a script list, I doubt you would've gotten it in the first place.
---
What name would you want the most?i have a toon I’m willing to delete and see if it’s there.If it’s not I can try a few if you’d like and hold it until you’re ready to make a toon.Idk if anything will be left though.lol
---
It really is insane the names already taken though. I even tried slightly misspelling words and it’s taken 😂
---
1. phase1
---
2. phase2 (leaf shouldnt drop before world bosses are out)
---
I play on retail on a u.s. server from Germany. Its not bad, but if you are planning on hardcore pvping, you will definitely have a disadvantage.
---
Lolwut
---
2 hours later "LF TANK LAST SPOT"
---
Understandable, do you have any sort of list that I can look at instead and I'll make the the changes this week?
---
Yes i have this mouse - my point was that you need to bind them to buttons on a kb and they do not function as their own button - if there is a way to have them as their own button - I would prefer it this way!
---
There is no a learning-curve. On PVP servers people from the opposite faction in most cases like you just want to do their quests.
---
Cenarion Battlegear isn't tied to any raid. Grind outdoor elites, get rep and badges.
---
You could always google the quest if you get really lost like the good old days
---
1. Low pop is only low density when taking layering into account (ie possibly the equivalent of a full, unlayered server).
---
2. (Imo) pve realms are likely to have less volatile pops.  Most people's default setting seems to be pvp.  This means that the vast majority of players (almost everyone) on pve servers are players who have 'been there and done it' and are now choosing pve realms because they know what they are getting themselves into. They are less likely to drop out (in the first few months) because 'it's hard levelling', 'where's my flying' or 'I hate getting ganked'.
---
3. As an extension of point 2 (I hate getting ganked), I can see a noticeable number of players migrating from pvp to pve servers over the first few months.
---
In a way it could be crazier than we've ever seen even with layering.
---
People forget layering is not perfect, the most dedicated will find ways to use it to their advantage.
---
Does playing around good players make you feel cool? Who gives a shit? BGs are cross realm and there will be good guilds on every server.
---
HEY! Why does druid get a tanking guide, but paladin doesn't! WE CAN TANK TOOOOOO!!! ^(nowecant);\_;
---
its phase 1, and its under phase 1
---
So have APES. If you want to avoid them don't follow the swedes
---
It seems obvious to me that if you click upvote, the color changes. However, I have relayed this to one of our CSS people to get their insight. No promises, but just saying that we've read the concern.
---
Same boat. I was super excited about my orc shaman and found out some friends who quit in WotLK are back (yay!) And going alliance (boo!)
---
So now my orc shaman is going to be an alt - hello human warlock. It will be ok../sigh
---
I commented on a "missing addons" list, but I can see how it could be misunderstood. 
---
I am so sorry that I hurt you, are you okay?
---
before having kids my week might have looked like this
---
Smiting early on is more than enough to get you through the initial quests and grouping with people helps also. If you don’t want to fall behind then I wouldn’t worry about a wand from the get go but that’s your choice
---
I don't know. Doing 1 glass of plain water for 1 glass of soda as ""compromise"" says volumes about how healthy the whole thing is.
---
I need a tank pad like this!
---
DUDE!!
---
Imaging shilling a recruitment video like that.
---
BlIzZaRd HaS nO dAtA
---
I get a virus error as well. In fact, my windows immediately deletes it as soon as I try to run it or move it.
---
And then people start using DD instead of DPS...
---
Did someone really kill lvl 60 elites with lvl 40? I mean they're kiteable I guess... But that 1% drop chance. I want to see that 20 hours long video.
---
The week ends on Sunday, it's been like that for centuries, how can this come as news to you?
---
Looks good! Definitely needs a introduction as to what wow actually is as stated above you need to have alot of context to understand the true weight of the "you think you do, but you dont" clip for instance.
---
And the music is abruptly cutting from the loading screen to your speech. It's a good transition but the abrupt volume decrease is undermining the epic ness you are going for.
---
I suggest looking at modern trailers and see how they are handling the music tracks, otherwise the phasing is good and it left me interested. Up until you said you were going to stream, then it all of sudden felt like a commercial. 
---
In my mind at least live streaming should be something you should advertise on your social media or just do on the side and have it sort of just happen, mentioning streaming in this intro really deducts authenticity from this otherwise intriguing project!
---
I've only played RP on EU so things may be a bit different in NA.
---
1. Less "funny" names, probably more of pro than a con for those above 16.
---
2. Very little noticable RPing unless you seek it out. Most RPing has been in RPguilds wanting to RP. RP events tend to be in isolated locations to minimize disturbances from non-RPers.
---
3. Apart from 1-2 the same as other servers.
---
CMs respond to memes but not actual tickets
---
Slow levellers compared to other classes pretty sure they’re the slowest and also very gear dependant at 60. In all though they are real cool and orc warriors imo look the bomb!
---
If you're horde, then I welcome you with open arms my swedish friend.
---
My friends and I nabbed names on Stalagg just in case Herod is a clusterfuck. 
---
So ready for launch already!
---
rip you
---
Love that game. The pet mechanics were fun, I collected all the tigers
---
/r/TotallyNotRobots
---
I don't get what you're saying. 
---
When a post has not been voted on, the arrows are both yellow.
---
When you vote on a post in either direction, the direction you voted in goes a golden colour and the opposite is silver. E.g. if you upvote, the up arrow is gold and down is silver. 
---
So in your second panel, where it says in relation to the up arrow "the visual appearance has not changed", this is not true. It's changed from yellow to gold. You can even see this in the picture. Are the colours just too similar for you to not see the difference visually?
---
Of course it is, it came with the AQ Patch.
---
I have to admit I played one but I can't give you any reason besides : why not? :D
---
That feel when you enter the main BRM door and hear the rogue stealth noise....but see no rogue.
---
awesome, thank you! I also wanted to make sure i was not missing some reasoning for the particular colors
---
[It was awful for everyone](https://youtu.be/-HxK8yRYna8)
---
It’s also much better for keeping track of quests. Since you can have 25 quests at a time in your log but you can only track 5? at a time in the default UI.  With Questie you can track all of them on the side of your screen
---
Warrior Gnome Female.
---
I agree but I was not responding to someone saying 10 weeks is slow for a power leveler...unless I missed where he had previously stated he was power leveling.
---
&gt;4chan reject who tries really hard to pander to reddit
---
Couldn't get any less based.
---
Kind of thought blizz would at least give the option to use new models, weird they didnt
---
I had this thing drop on my priest in vanilla...
---
&gt;Straight better:  
---
&gt;Might of Menethil - naxx   
---
&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer - naxx  
---
&gt;Dark Edge of Insanity - slightly better   
---
&gt;Sidegrades/slightly better/slightly worse:  
---
&gt;Kalimdor's Revenge - not better - too fast  
---
&gt;Ashkandi - def. not better  
---
&gt;R14 Weapons - only the 1.12 versions before that not even close  
---
&gt;Severance - naxx  
---
&gt;Claymore of Unholy Might - naxx  
---
&gt;Bonereaver's Edge - only the 1.12 version before that not even close
---
So lets look at my statement:  
---
Meme? There arent exactly many 2h weapons that were better for arms than Sulfuras (I dont think there were any before Naxx tbh) 
---
\-&gt; Before naxx there was one weapon that was slightly better and that was dark edge literally from the last boss before naxx.
---
I'd probably prefer horde, but I am so much more knowledgable in the entire alliance questing zones its just less of a hassle at this point haha.
---
Dont worry its not everyone. I know a lot of swedes that are staying on Shazz.
---
"Can the real thex please stand up"
---
Hot damn, I'm gonna join that guild and get it on with those two members of it.
---
5g18s doesnt seem so bad to me
---
Rp pvp is usually fairly balanced. Rp pve is usually heavy alliance though.
---
I actually play almost only Dwarf females ... they remind me of that Asterix character. Small blond cheerful wife of the chief.
---
Gorillaz!!
---
Not to mention that a good chunk of people who will end up playing probably have no idea that WoW classic is even coming out soon. That might change in the coming days as blizzard ramps up their advertisements, but it’s hard to reserve your character if you don’t know the game is coming out.
---
And blizzard gave him a beta key did you get one?
---
Maybe my real goal here is to do just that
---
Will this be carried over to live? Please do xD
---
They might try, but they can't lock down 10+ layers and monopolize leathers.
---
The Relics of Awakening. It’s mainly the spawn rate of the bastards. They come back every 45 seconds it feels like.
---
I've read a few times now that it's asked where the "Blizzard knows best" people are. It still didn't change, they have the numbers. If you think they release more Realms because of your "Blizzard sucks" posts, then you're wrong.
---
Just look at what they did. Released low number of Realms. As the non-cry-babies already suggested and Blizzard themself stated: They have reserved Servers that can be released to fit the demand. And that's what they've done so far.
---
The only thing I am disappointed about is that it seems like there are no thresholds for Faction imbalance, at least we haven't seen a post yet that stated "no Horde/Alliance characters can be created". This would be pretty cool. Ofc they'd have to look at it actively, but that would serve us even better.
---
This shit dropped for me in the DK starting zone. Rip
---
And in the quiet, something stirred. Something yearning to be alive...
---
I ran with pet passive and the pet always returned once the target was dead.  
---
Forgot how damn good Scorpid was in vanilla as a tanking pet for grinding.
---
At the time nobody really appreciated troll and orc racials. Undead were the huge majority on horde.
---
Ya grinding is gonna be real important. I'll probably grind all the way to 5 for my NE character.  Randomly grind lots of extra mobs between quests going from 5-10.
---
Alliance has Ironforge and you can be at BRM in an instant. I guess thats all I have for you.
---
&gt; Those who changed are posting a lot of fake news. Its just a dew that changed. 
---
Nopp. The site is updated and accurate now and its far more than that.
---
After that  rumour spread, a friend of mine personally went into guilds own discs and asked and everyone was moving that he asked.
---
Its not just a few. THATS fake news. But it isnt everyone.
---
Did you buy your voidwalker off the AH tho?
---
Go for rp pvp if you are interested in pvp, you won’t regret it. It really adds an exciting edge to leveling. It’s also best to play on one from the start before people can get too far ahead.
---
With addons you can
---
Perfect difference between normal and retarded XD jk
---
Tbh if you wanna go down the shadow tree ST is more worth than blackout in pve, it'd just be the better talent overall for the mana regen while wanding
---
Ummm back problems ofc
---
I'd fukin do it to play wow with the lady
---
It is. I played on a pve realm in Vanilla, and have then played on pserver which is for the most part pvp... and I can only recommend playing on pvp. It is truly unique to especially classic, and you rob yourself of a great experience if you don’t, in my opinion. But to each their own.
---
Holy shit the stars fucking ALIGNED. The resists. the crits. RNJesus take the fucking wheel.
---
Transcend
---
I wonder if there are other thing they've forgot to put in classic.
---
Enter name, name unavailable, it's been reserved.
---
Shit man, did the barrens even have a coherent plotline? I just remember killing animals and genociding quillboars
---
THEY TAKEN
---
Yep.
---
Definitely doable while leveling you just need a separate set of healing gear with int/spirit/healing. Not sure if it's doable for the higher level dungeons though.
---
Mobile is the future, cmon blizzard!
---
I don't know
---
do you really think 10 weeks is that much faster than average? I might have a scuffed vision of all of that since I'm used to power level from the last P servers I played on, but I always thouged after 6ish weeks the majority was 60 or at least close to that.
---
If you do it at level 8, the quests in there jet you up to about halfway through 9, if not just 9. The experience is a big boost if you can get it done quickly on your first run in, but you usually need 1 or 2 other players to do this, as the mobs are so tight/aggro easily and respawn so fast. Sometimes you asspull mobs insanely easily and die. You will run back and the whole cave has respawned. Get it done quick and you are cruising through teldrassil in a couple hours...let it get the best of you and teldrassil will take you like 4-6 hours to get done and be level 11.
---
Did someone just say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Wind Seeker\]?
---
How is that pot of stew enough for a week? Well maybe if you have a very low metabolic rest rate (i.e. you're short, are female, and/or have little body mass). You have to eat a lot of rice, pasta or potatoes on the side.
---
Personally I go for selfmade protein pancakes (even easier to prep, quicker to reheat or can be eaten cold, and can be cheaper if you know where to buy your protein powder in bulk). Vary between any type of toppings you like to not get sick of eaten pancakes for a week. Has got way more protein, which is handy if you lift in between leveling and dungeons wanting to either build or prevent from losing muscle mass if you're already built.
---
I named my mage Nightbane in Vanilla. Imagine my shock when they brought that bad boi out in TBC and I’m forced to name change. Still salty ...
---
hunters are commies?  i'm rerolling
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; For human ret pala best weapon in pve until ashbringer or Might of Menethil in Naxx.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; For dwarf paladin and shaman Dark Edge of Insanity is the next pve upgrade and Dark Edge is better in pvp even for human ret.
---
&gt; However Ashkandi is pretty much equivalent to Hand of Rag.
---
&gt; For warriors Sulfuras is a pure pvp weapon as bonereaver's edge is better in pve.
---
More like a blue 2h mace is the best pve weapon for the entirety of the game...
---
Just fly and enjoy being with your family, its just a game! Many of the ppl here are just boomer, don't be one of them! 
---
Im flying for 3 weeks to Thailand at the 31st August to 23rd September. 
---
Totally rip for me because everything was planned before the announcement..but i don't care. I'll start leveling when im back. :)
---
It will be brilliant. Kings honor friend, and welcome to the Alliance. Plus, depending on the server you can dumpster on Hordies with me! Is this a new take of the story for you or have you played both sides?
---
BRE was in the game from the start, so yes.
---
One of the last items I got before BC started was during the invasion event in Tanaris and I've carried in my bags ever since next to my hearth stone. 
---
The Haunted Momento. Every now and again a spectre appears and scares me. He has followed me round all the way through to BFA.
---
I actually don't run any anti-virus programs, I just let windows do it's thing. But I will tinker with it some more. I dont actually think there is a virus in it, but just letting you know what I am seeing. Maybe it will help someone else out. The program looks great though, man! Thanks for making it!
---
Same! Just got my brand new Husqvarna a few months ago, did 14 day trip through norway, and then i get home to classic wow! Yes!
---
That would be great, just to avoid missing some quests, but not being guided like with QuestHelper or the retail version. I'll check it out right before launch, thank you for your work :)
---
Don't worry. Warlock, shaman and hunters can tank dungeons. Druids, paladins and priests in any spec can heal dungeons in any spec. That said... Using a PvP spec instead of a PvE will only remove you from the top meters but if you know what you are doing, you can easily have average performance. Most of the PvP spec is around surviving more (more stamina, damage reduction, anti CC, etc) and just a bit of CC (stun, slow, etc) so your trade is not in vain (you will not the top dmg but also will not be the first to die). The thing about vanilla specs is not what you do but what you do better...
---
Joana is supposedly releasing an ingame addon to work with his levelling guide if that helps.
---
This is now my class.
---
HOCH! DIE! INTERNATIONALE! SOLIDARITÄT!
---
Your choice is spirit tap or blackout. The blackout procs aren't going to be valuable, but even a reduced amount of spirit tap procs will help.
---
Actually tracking them at the same time or tracking as in where they usually spawn (a la gatherer)?
---
What addon does it?
---
What addon would that be?
---
There are over 7 billion people on earth... do you think its responsible to put the ceiling at only 100 million?
---
I deleted my first character, a dwarven Hunter, because I eventually ran out of arrows and thought my character somehow went broken because he wouldn't shoot.
---
I rolled a warrior then and realised at lvl 15 that Hunters use ammunition that you have to refill.
---
Expecting both servers will be full at launch
---
Same, you can join mine and if you're not comfortable there will be plenty of options I'm sure but you should always be searching for the right fit for you, classic is all about the community. 100%
---
I think in general it is just a counterweight to all the "druids can". Like you see some acting as if druids are great for everything when in reality it is more like they can do anything but they won't be the best or for the most part even close (and if they are they have mostly put in a lot more effort compared to the other class who aren't performing to the extent they could).
---
I wouldn't want to play wow with my wife because she'd be a pleb and I'd have to pretend like she isn't.
---
I was in the same and/or similar situations a few times. I can tell you (to a certain degree) what is most likely to happen since I did both ways.
---
1. If you stay at home playing, you will have a good time for the 2 weeks. Most likely a little bit plagued by remorse but nothing too serious. The more time passes after that, the more you will realise that the 2 weeks are not that much on the grand scheme of wow. In the end you will most likely deeply regret the decision, especially if a few years have passed.
---
2. You go to Bali. The 2 weeks will feel weired and some sort of missing out big time. This largely depends on how much and what you can do there (activities). When you get home after this you will realise that the fear of missing out was waaaaay over proportion. Your friends will probably help you out and you will be up to date in no time. In the end you will be glad that you went to Bali. If you take this path, try to enjoy the holiday! 
---
In the end, I would probably take a laptop with me, be honest to my family about it (explain the struggle). Play some evenings/nights (sleeping at the beach yo) and have a good time there. 
---
Hope you find your way, cheers
---
French also.
---
Hi, /u/MacNSchteez
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqops9/what_do_you_guys_think_of_blizzard_expanding_on/). 
---
This sub is horde biased. Don't listen to sub. Current survey says 53% horde and 47% Ally. Go be with friends. Not everyone agrees in groups. It's ok.
---
All I know is thay Blizzard is gonna shit their pants when they see the amount of people trying to log in. These mfs are not prepared.
---
Exactly, what a wasted opportunity.
---
From the surveys I've seen so far + multiple classic discord servers it seems like Rogue is around 3rd - 4th most populare class. 
---
Almost all the different sources has Warrior - Mage and often Priest as top 3, quite far ahead of the other classes. Then rogue is after those three classes, but in some surveys they're behind Warlocks as well.
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
Nobody mentioned it so far: Metin2. Still to this day it's done via a character you use for selling.
---
I can't even see in battle.net the option for Classic WoW
---
Gatherer - It might not be updated yet, but if you use TomTom to make the cords of spawns then you can just keep hitting the same spots, let pray gatherer will be updated!
---
id say a conservative estimate would be 2 million na players week 1 
---
this is including all the retail players who will quit after a week 
---
how many a few months in ? maybe 1 million , maybe 10+million
---
r/hydrohomies approves
---
That's assuming you can fall asleep in the first place ;)
---
Huh, well I'm curious to what caused it then. Let me know if you figure it out.
---
I will just leave this here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcqutzpMZ7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcqutzpMZ7o)

The OG prep from the OG NoLife who got world first (and world only) Diablo Inferno kill on Hardcore. Back when he was still a gamer.
---
No, thanks. Some times the amount of retcons is beyond disgusting.
---
Well, she’s a girl, so I’d understand her
---
How a man can do the same is a different story
---
Nobody is going to spend time swapping groups mid-fight, every single boss, just to give mana tide to a meme DPS.
---
I'm playing on a normal server as Alliance, so pretty well
---
Some number of months before the pvp patch, then I believe the cap is 3 ranks per week.  That is reasonably easy for ranks 1-3, but somewhat hard after that.  3 week min for the gear after the system releases, more realistic 6-7 weeks after phase 2.
---
Been waiting since 2010 playing on trashy private servers. Been waiting for my entire adult life
---
Sunken Temple and D2 quests came with the AQ patch too. But there's no relation between these quests and AQ.
---
Anyway, it's semantics. I was just pointing out that 
---
&gt;All 1.12 Quests are there
---
is formally incorrect.
---
Why? Your gonna tell me you’ve never wasted 7 dollars before?
---
Haven't tried it out yet, but I'm really looking forward to see how Classic will look on my screen all the way on max.
---
Nice. I've always wanted to be a warlock with an infernal like in the vanilla cinematic
---
UK I would say is more golemagg now really. The discords suggest that.
---
Our guild are staying and we are Swedes. You guys just wanna get more people into your "coalition" because you're now gonna get spanked by APES. But the whole coalition thingy was a big scam anyway since it showed early that if it wasn't going the way of 2 specific guilds they would overrule any other decision and make their own.
---
if you find your  name taken by someone else - you can use another name. hope that helps
---
Which was a huge mistake. The WC3 and WoW cinematics had the right formula. Don't mess with the formula.
---
&gt;It substantially decreased the feeling of depth the game had.
---
that's pretty much the result of a lot of QoL changes Blizzard made over the years.
---
But..isn't Chicago in the CTS?
---
My solution is to have two characters on different factions. One you play with your friend(s), the other you can play solo.
---
Different factions is nice for this because you avoid tackling the same quests/zones a second time, so each experience is unique.
---
Sure I have and I felt like a bit of an idiot.
---
Human sword skill is so amazing. Save you slot of money not having to get them gloves. Other than that fill your boots.
---
Same.  
---
There was also an addon for Asheron's Call that could make you like a vendor.  Until the final expansion, everyone lined up around Sub/Hub to sell.  
---
I am also old.
---
Well probably just have queues like back in the day + new realms and free transfers (although wouldnt surprise me if we have to pay)
---
I ain't no sissy pointy ear
---
No, we have a hard enough time convincing someone to play anything, I’m not going to talk you out of it if you care about min-max. Good luck bro!!!
---
I think a lot of retail players will end up trying classic for a short while, be it a week, month, maybe even 3. For those that have never experienced this kind of gaming style before it was "smash a bunch of keys" and not being conversative with resources, they may end up hating it. So I think for the first few months, the player base will be massive. After 3, I'd expect it to maybe cut in half?
---
Horde Red should be upvote and ~~Beta~~ Alliance Blue should be downvote
---
It's the same way atlasloot is able to show you the items that drop from dungeons. They know those item id's. This addon just needs to scan your bag slots for all item id's and display the item plus quantity you have in inventory. It only shows inventory, nothing else.
---
Oh really? Well if you feel that way, then pve is probably better for you.
---
Wish I could do that :P
---
But layering doesnt chance the chance to drop an item from a certain mob. I dont think it changes for drops. It will change for herbs and such ressources.
---
Why wouldnt you want to be a little tomte?
---
But he's on the left side of Thaddius.

Grinding mobs is an essential part of the leveling experience.

Yeah... If Gondor calls for aid, Rohan sure as hell wont answer
---
Imagine being so stuck-up and egotistic that you'd rather play alone than with a loved one, I can't.
---
Isnt Classic on Cata engine or smth?
---
I did just that back in the day as a Warrior; by the time I'd done all the 1-10 zones, I was level 15 or so. Quite useful early on.
---
Thought I’d want it Classic. Definitely turning it up to max. It’s beautiful.
---
Don't you dare making mistakes!
---
But why gold and silver? They're both tonally different to the yellow and they are both bright. Every single time I vote I have to try and remember which colour means which direction.
---
Just use brightness to distinguish it. Bright = vote, dark = not pressed
---
Its a gnome
---
WeakAuras. Anyone know if it'll work for Classic?
---
My vanilla experience does not.  I have no ill feelings towards non-US people.  My group would just prefer a server where the majority of the population will be located on the east coast time zone and without a language barrier.
---
I’m hoping it’ll only be a few weeks of queues at peak times. If this isn’t the case I’ll be teaching my wife how to log in so by the time I get back from work, eat etc I’ll have no queue.
---
Got a link to that discord?
---
Going Alliance. Was horde for retail classic as a Shaman.
---
REBIRTH
---
They isn't anything more stylish than a gnome warrior with T2 helm!
---
cosmetic reasons should be all the reason you need.
---
Haha exactly! Tbh I wouldn't worry to much about what faction you are, just enjoy the game with friends, who knows eventually they want to roll a new server as horde, and you'll enjoy the game all over again
---
If you're EU i'll see you on the battlefield, as my enemy.

Setting up my interface is the only reason why I want beta acces😭

NA.Thought id at least try to help!but I wouldn’t post names you want, Might become the EU Thex.lol
---
More layers = more mobs
---
More mobs = more drops 
---
More drops = more Krol Blades
---
More Krol Blades in supply = less Krol Blades in demand
---
Price will fall big time until China hoards them all to flood the market and then they can set the price at whatever they want once layering is gone.
---
Are people really so ignorant that they believe that classic will be immune to the boom/bust cycle that every game (especially mmo’s ) suffers from? Whatever new serves are created at this point will just be treated as over flow servers. I’d rather deal with over population for a month or two than play on a ghost town of a server. The advice is awful. If you’re a solo player you would want to stay on a server that is guaranteed to maintain a healthy population.

It was used in the staging of a Wagner opera (which has a lot of Norse mythology) in the 1880s. Apparently was a hit...
---
I just broke up from a 5 year relationship (obviously not for WoW, lol.) so yes, I know what it's like. I'm talking about having kids not having a relationship.
---
Personally, this isn't entertaining. 3 v 1 when the 1 has engaged a mob that's not skill or style.
---
Right? Complain about getting sniped while streaming, but refuse to not stream. Play in pvp server and complain about pvp. These streamers are fucking donkeys
---
I wonder who made these guides, did they play the game the last couple years? Doesnt seem so, sorry.

Difference between "wow" and "classic wow" is retail. That range starts about after BFA launch.
---
It is not 100% accurate but this difference doesn't change much in the past days so it is relatively accurate
---
Currently "classic wow" is almost 50% compared to "wow"
---
It on the list.

Escape artist is easily worked around by just slowing you again (frost shock, frost bolt, hamstring). AFIAK dwarves stoneskin is the only counter to blind, which is one of the best PvP CCs in the game. Also, it counters rogues crippling poison which is basically like escape artist. It’s also very helpful against bleeds from rogues, warriors and druids.

Blackrock Mountain and all its dungeons and raids are a masterpiece.

I have spent more time in BRM than any other landmark in gaming.

Human weaponskill bonus being even stronger than everyone already thought + Fear Ward + Pally Threat reduction means Horde is dead pve.

Still better in PvE and has cooler models tho.

Somewhat related, I got the name Ugin on Herod

They look horrible. They are instant kill on sight for all Horde. Gnomes are associated with assholes (a lot of people that play them have questionable personality traits). The racial really isn't reason enough to role gnome on its own.

Just remember to do: /console ffxglow 0
---
Spirit Tap all the way! Even in 5-mans you'll get your fair-share of spirit-tap proccs just by wanding while you heal.
---
The reason for that is that melees usually don't like to chase runners and casters like mages usually don't like hardcasting an expensive spell onto an almost dead target and instead switch to an higher HP-target while they cast.
---
Especially if you tell them to leave you the last-hits it increases your chance of getting them.
---
I would always get wand- and spirit-tap no matter what I'd spec into otherwise for leveling. Before I decided to go druid my intended build was 14-32-5.

Play gnome warrior. How epic is T2 and quel in the hands of a gnome?!
---
The problem is that limiting first your choices and then adding more is that the COMMUNITY has to choose a server, then they need to CHOOSE again if they want to change their server. When its not about you, but maybe 200 other people, its hard to make these decisions and even harder then change them.
---
They went about it what was easiest, best and safest way FOR THEM to do the name reservations. And completely ignored the problems it causes to the PLAYERBASE.

Oh, this is going to be awesome.

1. Get lost in the barrows.

2. Fail to manage the kill/rest/mob respawn balance. 
---
3. Run out of food/drink.
---
4. The gear is red.
---
5. Die in a spot with at least 2-3 mobs waiting for your res.
---
6. Give up and ress at the soul healer.

Or:
---
1. Group with 1-2 other poor devils like you.

2. Kill everything and be done in 10 minutes.

3. Get out of a dungeon alive.

This is a great and all, but a simple web filter, firewall, or any decent net/sys admin could block Blizzard in an instant (as I do)

Because it has to many nations claiming it as their main server. The queues will be insanely large.

I think it's in the snowy area in Alterac mountains
---
Well, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for the help!
---
No, I'm definitely not saying it's better, because those areas are great. But I am saying that it's more cohesive in that they decided to make barrens a hub "city" for quests, rather than forcing players to run to three different areas.
---
Pretty sure that’s Alterac Mountains

Looks wise. Sure. But 1% dodge and shadowmeld are near useless for a warrior. Dodges will leave you rage starved and shadowmeld is useful in about 1% of situations you’ll run into.
---
Why? That proc negates a clothies entire armor-ish doesn't it? I remember how nuts ANY ArP was back in late TBC or WotLK.
---
The honest answer is it was like that when I got here. Not sure who originally made them.
---
I've seen like 50+ people asking about the new cord and the only ones who got banned were veeery clearly trolling and not doing it once or twice either, so dunno.
---
Fwiw, the guy who admins it has already started moving away and is stepping down before Classic, he just set them up and is giving mod to sensible people who will be on the servers.
---
But if you prefer the twitch/4chan-like discord, that's ok.
---
How is what you just wrote not rude?
---
It’s not a valid criticism dude. Just because you don’t agree with my argument doesn’t mean I dont have one.
---
Idk what to tell you dude. Being upset because you didn’t get in is not a valid criticism because there is no expectation to get in.  It’s not criticism, it’s just pouting.
---
Btw, I didn’t say entitled once.
---
Sounds like it's time to make a schedule. :) Plan which days you spend with your wife.
---
I’m sure those people on vacation wouldn’t mind giving Blizzard an extra 10 days to work out the server fiasco so they can have smooth servers with low queues for their vacations instead of spending their vacations with 20k plus player queues.

You guys remember how people always used to get their accounts hacked from Vanilla up to Cata? Well its because people download stupid shit like this. For all we know the launcher could work and it could also keylog your info just so he can steal all your work in Classic. You guys downloading this is exactly why you guys used to make tickets to Blizzard crying that your toons were naked
---
Personally I'm gonna level as shadow and pick up a couple disc talents (wand spec, imp pws etc) and if I want to dungeon I'll go in as healer, its completly viable to heal as shadow, I have a group of friends I want to play with too but I'll still take spirit tap, shouldn't be to hard to get last hit if I just tell them to leave mobs super low and ill pick them up
---
If I ever have to play solo I'll be all set with talents too, I doubt all of us will be playing 24/7 together

Yeah, this is what I'm concerned with. After some time there will be a population drop off as people lose interest or burnt out. I'm wondering if being on the less dominant faction will cause this to happen more quickly and dishearten new players who get ganked incessantly... I would love to keep the 45% A 55% H ratio. Guess only time will tell. Just thought I'd ask the question because these events have happened before 15 years ago!

In a day and age when people are trying to pin gun violence on video games, this whole Thex situation is the best in gaming. From the fact that someone got the name Thex in classic and GAVE it to Thex to the fact that Blizzard is involving this community in WoW by creating the Thex character is pretty cool. 
---
Little shit like this gives me hope that Blizzard is listening to us.

It ends too abruptly.  You need a transitional element to your next video.

I don't think it'd be hard to learn how to tank, early patch raids weren't mechanically complex.
---
The question is more, are you a player that has the dedication and time to become a raid tank? You can't miss raid night, your guild is depending on you to make things go smoothly. You'll be expected to help tank the 77th BRD run to help a newbie get their pre-raid BIS gear in your downtime.
---
Raid tanks need to be dedicated if they want primary tank spot. If you only get backup tank, gearing a gear dependent warrior will take a while since everyone above you in the tanking order gets first dibs.

I don't understand how this statement is getting downvoted. Its pretty clear Herod will have the bigger population no matter what. Everyone made and told their guilds to go on it already.
---
I without a doubt can guarantee it would cause a lot more rage than happy players. It would change nothing except that we can play a week sooner :)
---
But it's not. Herod was full in a few hours. How is that false?
---
The OP LITERALLY claimed the new server would have a higher population. In the history of MMOs servers added later have never had larger populations. People aren't leaving Herod and new players don't flock to Low population status realms.
---
Downvote away, it's literally all you can do because I'm not wrong.
---
Too soon

Hope you stole that name so no one can torture you by that moniker now ;)

Take your time leveling, there are some really cool quest chains that were glossed over after TBC came out as everyone leveling just wanted to go to outland. Some highlight areas for me are stonetalon, arathi, hinterlands  and both plaguelands. Some of my favourite outdoor dungeons were in a few of those zones.
---
Happy questing and dont hesitate to ask people around you help! I made pals with 2 dudes in arathi back in the beginning of 05 and weve expanded to more friends over the years and all continue to be best mates to this day.
---
Yup.  Luckily during stress test as I sat outside of it sayin I remember this place.  Two people running up behind me instantly invited me to group.  It was a no brainer to accept that ninja invite.

Current retail is a joke for anyone who played back in the day, played on p-servers or played during the tests.

World is totally empty - everyone just pays to level - the entire content prior to lvl 100 or so is wasted and it is simplified to a level of ez mode that is actually an insult to anyone playing.

No caffeine for a week at least to lower your tolerance, make sure your computer is running as quickly as you can make it, prepare meals in advance or have microwave-able meals to make during flight paths or on boats, and thats all i can think of. Im planning on playing casually but ive heard those tossed around
---
You use both wands and staves in vanilla :)
---
I thought the gnomes height caused issues with tanking due to LOS? This happened to a guild during vanilla on my server when BWL came out, when you had to tank the dragon bosses with your back in a corner of a room. The healers had to stand in a specific location but when they did that the gnome was always LOS because he was so short.
---
Not sure if this is still an issue, or if the strat that we used waaaay back in the day is still used today, but I figured it might be a legit concern.
---
I think if the imbalance favors horde its more noticeable, since horde guys are like 30% UD rogues who gank 24/7...but in all seriousness, I still had a blast and when we won some wpvp we felt epic. The culture of both factions is slightly different, horde tend to aid their buddies in wpvp, alliance tend to ride on by, unfortunately. But I wouldnt let it worry you, being on a dead faction is the real concern (no progression, bad economy, etc).
---
That was beautiful guys

Word of warning, private servers were notably off in some numbers. Warlock pets for example struggle to hold aggro compared to private servers where they had no issues even if you didn't spec for it.

I'd say play it by ear, but people will expect you to be speccing for your team role.

I was exploring and found the ship to stormwind. Went up the stairs to stormwind, saw a max level guard and several max level characters and immediately turned around and left, thinking that I had somehow found a place way out of my league (I was about lvl 10 maybe). Didn't figure out the whole 'different cities for different races' thing until I came across a dwarf in Darnassus who kindly explained it.
---
I always block promoted tweets ...but this I will allow 🤗
---
This is what I'm actually looking forward to as an Alliance member vs the Horde! Leveling up to 60 is a huge part of the game and not everyone acknowledges that. Only thing I'm struggling with is that I was looking towards a Warlock, but with the Forsaken being a thing to go against it turns me off a tad, but nothing a few good plays can't counteract!
---
Had to cut it short due to the strict time restraint on the pitching of the idea. I'll have more flexibility with future videos though!
---
Thanks, I picked up atlas loot and map but I didn’t seen dungeon.  I’ll have to look harder.
---
FFXI let you do this natively. Set up your Bazaar for people to check. It even put a little gold pouch icon next to your name so other players knew you has items in there. Used to unload juices and food that way often while leveling.
---
Sure, in that particular instance, it could be nice to have an addon to do so, however, while I have it on the addon, but I can't think of too many instances where items aren't worth putting on the AH. Even if there was, would it not be much faster, and ergo, would find a buyer faster to just put it in trade chat that you're selling umm idk, Krol Blade for 400g? 
---
The only real occasion where I could see this useful is for RPers. Still a really neat addon though.
---
lmao, if someone said I could relive playing vanilla and listening to new tool stuff, I‘d tell that person to rethink what they just said. He must have been high! (;

I definitely would not wait until launch day. People will be making in character at the time and your name might be taken in the process. Definitely better to do it now when it is less likely for people to be creating characters because either people wanted a name the second is came out or they are just waiting until launch to get one.

Dwarf Priest or Dwarf Paladin? I enjoy complex gameplay, so Priest is the obvious choice, but I already play a Priest on retail. Paladin on the other hand can offer also tanking, if I ever choose to respec. What do?

I think you're talking about macros. Some can be really useful but they're by no means necessary to function in the game. Addons are the same way.

To install an addon you just download it from somewhere like willitclassic then put it in your addons folder located inside the interface folder.

Gnome is the best choice im every situation. Each class performs best as a gnome. People have to bow down before you! .. cause you're gonna be small. But dude.. Gnomes are life.
---
I can't say for sure, since I don't play retail, but unless I am mistaken scripting is no longer allowed in the modern client.
---
On how it works: You basically write a string of commands and activate them using macros. The addon SuperMacro is very helpful for this on older clients. (I used this on Private Servers)
---
Unfortunately most guilds and friend groups have already committed to a server
---
Isn't the narrative right now that the huge streamers like Sodapopping will be surrounded by the whole server wherever they go? Hard to camp them that way.

This is part of what made me choose horde to begin with 15 years ago.
---
Who is so boring that they choose to play a human in a high fantasy game with all kinds of cool races?
---
I totally agree. Also I don't know about any griefer/troll coalitions going on in Herod. Ones that incessantly camp you. I mean, if that doesn't dissuade people from quitting, I would feel great rolling Alliance. Curious as to whether or not there have been snowball effects due to groups like that. Ultimately you're correct, culture and other factors, such as progression and economy, matter.more. I just don't want to end up on an 80% Horde server as an Alliance member, as I can see wPvP parties on Horde having a field day! Curious as to what PvP servers back then have stable ratios over time...
---
Fingers crossed that most toxic Shazzrians are on Alliance
---
On my server Dalaran it was always called VC and never DM. Either LFG VC or LFG Deadmines. This was even before Dire Maul. Happy to finally provide the absolutely correct answer here. Anyone who says DM is Deadmines is dead wrong.
---
Honor system and rewards will be phase 2, but the battlegrounds will be phase 3. So phase 2 will be worldpvp only (I'm already pitying the poor people who'll still be leveling by that point, it'll be hell on earth)
---
BRE is better for arms warriors in PVP too unfortunately.
---
In fact i'd argue it's better than every 2h with the exception of MoM.
---
In pve they are garbage compared to every other race (you won't be MT at least). If that doesn't phase you then roll gnome.
---
How does this make any sense?
---
You make it sound like EST players only raid early. You can find a group that raid late or at a time that is suitable to you. This isn't an issue that would require you to specifically play on a PST server.
---
Seriously... how did you work out that reasoning in your head?
---
You do you guy.
---
Your outrage culture used to be so weird for Europeans, but you managed to spread that garbage over here too.
---
Jesus christ yes
---
Brb reserving Wandspeed
---
Scripts do exist though
---
Thanks for proving your reading comprehension is non existent.
---
I didn't say that. Glad I'm being downvoted for someone else's words!
---
😂
---
Rogues are good enough that it won't feel bad playing one. 
---
Gear wise, you will be fairly high on the priority list since rogues/warriors are some of the best raw dps in the game. Gear can always get ninja rolled on, but you won't get dicked over by being a rogue in that sense.
---
Honestly it sounds like you don't have the right mindset to enjoy casting. All casters have boring rotations in pve. In pvp they don't run so much as prevent their opponent from chasing.
---
Play rogue if you're not interested in any of the non-casting classes. Spitballing, I think you might find hunter enjoyable, but some of their best gear is prioritized to warriors/rogues (hunter dps is mediocre in pve, and they don't scale super well) and that might not sit well with you.
---
Well yea they finally advertised it and it’s literally 12 days away. I’ve kept away from all the news because I want to go in fresh.
---
You might wanna keep it if you roll undead
---
You mean before or after they were tricked by a gigantic demon to drink demon blood as a fake promise of salvation?
---
Fuckkkkkk I'm ready bruv.
---
Who am I kidding, I can’t handle class A drugs anymore lol
---
It's going to be okay. I've played both factions and they both have their own flow.
---
According to a 30,000 person survey only 0.08% said they'd be playing femal tauren hunter. Thats 24 people out of 30000. So that combo is going to be rare even if it was just because of sample size.
---
Not scripts but macros. When you type /macro (or smth cant remember didnt play for some time) you open your macro pannel. And basically there you can "code your own spells(?)" If that makes sense. So like u got your baseline spells like arcane shot or aimed shot which you drag and drop out of your spell book. But you can (and should if you play pretty much any class on a higher level, plus its fun, especially for pet classes) make some new spells (macros)
---
A macro is nothing else but a spell which is in essence a command like the one i mentioned to open macros. For example, if you want your pet to attack a target, you could select a target, move your cursor over the little attack icon on your pet action bar and it will attack. Or you can make a macro which makes that more efficient by making a new macro in your macro tab, writing "/petattack" and dropping it into your spells bar. Now you can press whichever keybind you designate for that spell slot, and bam, you are now better at hunter, because you can make your pet attack targets (target swap to keep aggro for example) more efficiently.
---
There a bunch more macros online for you to google, like focus macros, (pet) stance macros..
---
Hope this was helpful :)

gonna play from 3am till 12am, then work, then wife and life until 11 pm.
---
I think you're under valuing Will of the Forsaken a bit... play undead. Its not even clear that orc is the better choice,  it's so close.
---
I see a lot of people really wanting to aoe grind for some reason. It's not that great. It's technically the best way to level, yes. Except one other player fucks up your grind completely. Just one. Even if you do it off peak, there won't be 0 players on the realm, especially at launch.
---
There isn't that many good aoe grind spots, either. Usually 0-2 per level range. Most aoe spots aren't perfect, you'll have to deal with casters/ranged/cc. If the mobs you intend to aoe are needed for a quest, you will not be able to aoe grind it. 
---
It's also very, very boring.
---
What does this do? Does it remove the shimmering glow on terrain?
---
Probably will be a concern in Classic as hitboxes have been reverted to their standard sizes.

I told myself I wanted to keep the water texture old school at the very least, but we'll see if I stick to that.
---
I liked the idea of keeping Classic visually different from retail (as I'm someone who will be playing both), mostly so my brain doesn't get too confused switching between similar but very different games. But I also like the thought of seeing Classic with the power of a good computer and in HD if you will.
---
Imagine pretending Shazzrah isn't the best when everyone knows it is
---
Just keep on questing with smite, if you save the linen cloth wand will come natural at circa level 9-10.
---
Is it vanilla flavour?
---
They need to change all of the server names, they are not good
---
But why male models?
---
What dumb fuck wants to give blizzard 2 weeks of sub money when they're more than likely going to click randomize anyway?
---
Queue time matters more if you're pvp focused and want into premades. "Winning" sides matter more if you're expecting to play solo.
---
I've heard about what you expect for populations from the hardcore community. Not sure what the casual community will do to the population balance. Alliance is more popular with casuals in general.
---
Female Tauren Hunter is the rarest combo in the world.
---
Female Dwarf Rogue is second rarest, and most rare for Alliance.
---
Is that Mankrik and Thex?
---
Came here to say this!!
---
Nah, I'm happy with all the old models. What's really impressive about the way they've done it, is that they've still captured the magic of vanilla. I feel like new models would ruin that. 
---
It's weird, cos back in vanilla this is how good the game looked to me. Having the graphics turned up a little is like reliving that experience because my expectations from years of playing other games with good graphics have been raised.
---
I know that ElvUI didn't on the last day of the stress test.
---
Addons you dont really need. But they modify your game look and add features like a group dps meter counter or a quest helper.

Scripts are illegal (botting)

---
There are other problems too. Like when the quest text just plain sends you to the wrong place! I remember that happening to me in vanilla a time or two. :P
---
I wonder if the recent activity with name reservations has made it so that the classic devs could finally convince money folks to give them ad dollars. Alongside two new servers opening, it seems like they’re starting to recognize the potential market.
---
Its hard to say, when Blood elves came our server went from imbalanced to terribly imbalanced, so prior to tbc it was fairly even. A horde without elves is a more honest horde for sure.
---
Im going to start using auto-magically in my vocabulary

---
Generally unless you go looking for it all Ace addons have the dependencies bundled in with the download. Which means there's no extra external download required for end users, it just works.
---
As for textures, there are those of us that have been using the same texture addons since Vanilla. :D Example: Shadowed Unitframes existed as ag_Unitframes back before even TBC. I replaced the default UI when I started playing before I even left Mulgore.
---
So the "native look" is actually kind of jarring for anyone that replaces and has always replaced the default UI.
---
But I understand, and for a simple addon it might be a lot of extra work. Please don't feel like you have to put in extra work just for a few people. It really does seem like a useful addon for those items that are hard to sell efficiently on the AH.
---
Thanks for your work.

---
I'd say you'll be fine if you just log on in that 30 minute window. The only times queues have lasted anywhere near that long during testing etc has been when the servers crapped out, and with a more open-ended window (instead of everyone logging exactly on the hour) the chances of servers buckling are greatly reduced. If the servers does crap out at the exact time of launch anyway, and you end up getting booted, there's nothing you could've done to prevent that.
---
Well I did a quick Google and read that all AH transactions are final and wot be reversed by a GM. It makes sense :(
---
if you were to do all quests in teldrassil as a human at the correct lvls, how much reputation would you get in total?
---
More layers=More people=higher demand.
---
I think the biggest economic impact of layering will be concentrating wealth to the people with the knowledge and willingness to exploit it, but it's not going to just crash every market.
---
Guild bank. Its a big QoL improvement.
---
&gt; For people on these servers what are your strats for getting in first? 
---
None,  not worried about queues, knowing that those of us on a "full server" are just playing the game of last man standing.  We push through the queue's wait time, crowding, eventually enough people will find it not worth their time and will move on.
---
Luckily, all you need to play Classic is an active subscription! No need to buy the current expansion or anything if you don’t want to. I’m waiting until the 26th to use the sub card I bought a couple months ago.
---
Never got a chance to play classic, is ret that bad lol?
---
That won't happen
---
complete NOOB here and will be playing.  Ive been told to get the quest add ons. once I have the add on how do you apply it in game?  And which add on is the best for a complete noob?
---
You're all a bunch of stalaggots.
---
You need the subscription, but you DONT need to buy the games individually anymore. You simply subscribe and that's it unless you want collectors edition stuff for retail.
---
But will you down Rag with a guitar hero controller?
---
Small errors there. 1. Being a gnome is awsome. 2. Once a gnome goes and smashes the living dayligts out of orc and tauren warriors he gets mad respect...and loads of salt from the horde.
---
I really see no downside to being a gnome. Will make an alt who is one.
---
Only against the TOS if it's not consensual. If you can check someones bags without them knowing that's bad, if they've given permission (either explicitly via a setting or implicitly by installing the addon) then it's not a problem.
---
You underestimate the power of China my friend.

Should definitely get one. They're pretty damn cheap and make meal prep fast and easy and little clean up.

aw yiss

Doesn't that still count as '2 or more years' ? :P
---
Much appreciated!
---
Because the only way I could deal with it is by seeing the funny side of it. I thought other people would get a laugh out of it so decided to share :)
---
Our opinion on layering absolutely will not change. We've played it on live as sharding and it is devastating to the game, and that's before you even take into account the concept of world bosses.
---
It’s crazy how I’m more excited to replay a 15 year old PC game again than I am for the vast majority of games that have come out for the last 7-8 years or so.

Really stuck between hunter and warlock. Can anyone comment on the following things I'm unsure about :
---
1.  How are warlocks in pvp for phase 1-3?   I hear they need gear to come online, and it won't be until t2+ where they really shine.
---
2.   Is a warlock or hunter overall more effective in battlegrounds?
---
3.   How is competition for gear in a raid as a lock? Are you competing with mages or is it mostly +shadow damage you're after?
---
4.  How scary is a t3 rogue or warrior as a hunter or lock?
---
5.  Can you farm mara as a fresh 60 lock?
---
Gnome warlocks are the only warlocks on alliance ;-)
---
Axes and polearms have the exact same weapon spec bonus? Or are you just assuming edgemasters/orc racial?
---
Narrr, thats a crying shame. Kinda thought they would have made it free to play by now with the purchase of a base game.
---
15£ a month is a tad to steep for me sadly....back to private servers.
---
Anyway, thx for the reply :)
---
Full is just to give you the idea of how bad the queue will be. Just make your characters.
---
Unless y’all are coordinated and they allow you to get killing blows regularly to proc it, it’ll have no value. However, if you ever do anything solo, you’ll have the talent and reduce downtime.
---
Also, blackout can be an annoyance when trying to gather mobs up. So it might just be easier and cleaner to snag spirit tap and be set for group and solo play.
---
You can indeed! The game recognizes the character has been created and reserves the mail for them.
---
Boss is named Vancleef, hence VC. DM is Dire Maul simply because half the playerbase(horde) didn't play deadmines while leveling so DM = deadmines is completely lost on half the population. Also since DM = Dire Maul it's best for dungeons to not share the same abbreviation. Yes I know you can infer based on level, but why would you be okay with that when you don't have to do that for any other dungeon?
---
Anyone else here play since vanilla, every expansion, but isn’t going to no life classic because they grew up and realized blizzards classic tip that everything should be in moderation? I’ve got nothing left to prove in this game so while I see the hype I also see people who in 8 months will be at rock bottom.
---
Yeah pretty much, WAY easier on the eyes, strongly recommended for long plays sessions. Make a note and try it out on launch, can just do /console ffxglow 1 to get it back if you prefer that
---
Looks totally rad
---
You go about your business as usual. If someone is RPing feel free to interact in an RP manner or keep going about your business. You're only breaking the rules if you're deliberately messing with the RP that's happening.
---
Hunter or warlock imo. Druid is a bad choice for a kid if you want a smooth experience.
---
Both hunters and warlocks have pets that make the leveling experience smoother. And honestly, at that age I don't expect them to reach 200 hours to hit max level. Maybe they do, and if so hunter and warlock are both fine choices.
---
But for sure the time I would expect them to play, those classes would make sense. A curated wow experience (I'm assuming you'd be playing with them) doesn't sound any different from runescape that I grew up on. Honestly, a nice bonding experience and a chance to learn healthy interneting from an adult if done right.
---
Arena,guildbanks,no leeway and no spellbatching.
---
A few class balances here and there.
---
Noone asked you
---
Tanking on a Paladin can lead to a lot of frustration. You can tank during leveling, you can tank dungeons at 60 if you get your hands on some decent gear, but it won't be pretty. It will always require you to go the extra mile, and your group to respect the many flaws that Prot tanking involves (drinking breaks, no taunt, affected by silence etc.)
---
I wouldn't consider it an option that you can count on, so if you already eyed Priest, go Priest.
---
What are some of the best top secret places that you like to stop and ~~be vulnerable~~ rest? Basically if you were looking to avoid one of those pesky horde rogues skulking around? 
---
A place they'd *never* find you?
---
All you can do is ether wait for them to open up a new one or wait till launch and maybe some spots will open.
---
Those shoulders they get tho
---
Blizzard added a lot of quests in various patches up to 1.12, so back in the day you would actually run out of quests at certain stretches, even if you did everything.  
---
It does seem like Classic will launch with all the 1.12 quests available though (minus some unlocking quests like attunements for for later raids), so it probably won't be too bad.  
---
Personally I think grinding mobs is often more time efficient than traveling halfway across the world to do a quest.
---
super powerful AH scanner that integrates with tradeskills across all your characters. You can make dedicated shopping lists with crazy specific price points for buying and selling. It keeps track of your inventory and bank/guild bank across all your characters. With proper setup, you pretty much just have to log on to your main bank character, click a few buttons at the AH, then walk between your bank and mailbox to send stuff out to your crafters, log on to your crafting character and click 2 buttons and wait, then log back in to your bank character and click 1 button at the AH. 
---
Spend 15-20 mins doing that every day and make millions of gold.
---
It does require a significant amount of knowledge and a reasonable starting level of gold to get set up like that though.
---
The worst ting about it is that it doesn't really accomplish anything that can't be replaced by a nice excel spreadsheet and a bit (lot) of clicking. There's nothing that stops you from scanning the AH and importing that database to excel, same with inventory management, and doing even more advanced stuff than TSM does. The main issue is the incredible amount of automation that TSM provides by automatically generating queues and priority lists for mailing stuff and crafting so you don't have to manually go through all your recipies.
---
clever
---
You can enter it anyway. Just means there might be a long waiting queue when you want to play at launch.
---
I would just like to see a “Progressive” Classic server where the try to make all the class specs balanced in endgame. Don’t change any spells or anything, just tweak the numbers.
---
For instance. I think the base miss chance for spells on a Raid boss is 16%. Mages get 6% in the Frost tree, give Locks something similar so they can compete for the first tiers. I’m not saying I want perfect balance, but some of the specs just do fuck all for dps or tanking. Make Druids balanced so they can be MTs or even Pallys.
---
The biggest problem in Vanilla is that most people wouldn’t even consider a non warrior tank, unless they knew the person. I remember creating groups with my Prot Pally friend and people would instantly drop when they saw a Pally. A good one could definitely tank, but a bad one was just awful to watch.
---
There are two factors to consider:
---
* Private servers used inflated XP gains and therefore running out of quests was less likely
---
* Most people experienced a lack of quests after level 45, not before.
---
"You think you want it but you don't!"
---
The most WRONG thing I have heard, I think, ever.
---
I know I'll be probably called a heretic but...the transmog system. I've played classic back in the day so I'll love it anyway but I think my enjoyment and immersion in the game would skyrocket if I wouldn't look like macklemore fresh out of the thrift store in level 60 raid gear. I'd love to wear matching items and at least look somewhat nice, but I'll be a warlock so hobo it is.
---
Interesting I seem to recall stories of customer support reverting accidental sales like these. Worst they can say is no! If it were me I’d give it a shot it will only take you 2 minuets!
---
Its about the template fitting
---
Oh I would love to play on a realm named Timmy. I feel like it would draw in a special kind of people.
---
The server isn't literally full. We have layering for a reason.
---
Although I’d love this weapon on my hunter, I won’t be rolling on it cause I can’t use. Thunderfury on the other hand...
---
We got Grim, Hydra and the rest of APES. High skilled players on both side of the isle, the competition is gonna be tight, the skill cap is high. As a rogue you should be thriving to play a long side and against the best, not half ass it on Shazzrah like a common pleb. Get a grip!
---
rather be in a full server
---
That pre-start meal must be quite a feast...
---
Yup. Coolest idea ever. It would be extremely usable the more people that have it and know about it.
---
How about a boyfriend? xox
---
If that's your logic then scholomance can be called SM. Just shift click my name to see if im around 40 and want to do scarlet monastery or Scholomance. Nah that's silly. Use a unique identifier for deadmines and be done with any possible confusion. VC is the clear superior choice.
---
nope, there's no way to see the talents from anyone
---
Barbershop with original styles only. There's no good argument in not having it.
---
Yeah, yeah, I know, "you make your character and you stick with it!" whatever man, sometimes you wanna trim the beard.
---
Nice one, I own a Honda CBR600F4
---
Damn...that’s a kinda sad title.

All specs are equally valid.

This. Anyone using raw eggs should check if they are safe to eat, but I know that's the default in many countries as well.
---
That’s west Patrick.
---
Yep, after all, shareholders are like robotic reptilians who live by statistics and analytics.
---
I would even say it's the perfect solution for PVP servers. You will be ganked and you will be corpse-camped, guaranteed. Having an alt means you can still use your playtime effectively, and lategame you can park your stronger character in the leveling zone of your alt to counter-gank!
---
My plan too, although I will set my mark traveling my dwarf to NE starting zone and finish that zone and then go to bed. And then in the morning, rise and shine with some rested XP from the inn and make it to darkshore in one go \^\^
---
And then take 1 or 2 hours of relaxing and binge some more.
---
Golemagg is dead.
---
I'm glad OSRS got rid of this retarded mentality. I'm gonna guess the game will stay classic for a few years until they'll add new content. But in the meantime you can keep pretending to be a younger, happier you.
---
I work in my companies IT department and I can vouch that this is true.
---
This time around when wow ruins my life, I’m old enough that it will roll into a nice mid life crisis.
---
But he makes it sound like EST raid groups will only raid at 7. 
---
So he needs to play PST to raid at a time that is suitable to him?
---
Why wouldn't he just find an EST raid group that raids at a time that works for him?
---
I just don't get how he came to that conclusion.  Hence why I am asking him to explain the he got there.
---
Love old screencaps, always fun to see some of the high level stuff from back then.
---
The one where you are dueling in EPL is from the TBC prepatch, if that makes any difference (Unstable Affliction was added in 2.0.1).
---
&gt; You need the subscription, but you DONT need to buy the games individually anymore. You simply subscribe and that's it unless you want collectors edition stuff for retail.
---
I wonder if I'm going to get the classic collectors edition pets again.
---
That zergling was a trusty companion for so many years.

I ran to the undead leveling zone ez in tje stress test. You just run to org take the zeplin to tirisfal glades and then run to deathknell

Well Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark and there are still Swedish guilds on Shazz .. so that is the true Nordic place to be ^^ .. the other one is just majority of Swedes with a few mix guilds.

But isn't a mobile healer useful in AB as well?

i think they might be making a small tweak to it. the CSS moderator replied in the thread :D

You defended the comment, but to be fair both you idiots sounds the same

So yeah you’re the guy who unironically cited a server’s population size three hours after it was released with out notice
---
Im almost at my PTO cap and wasnt planning on taking a vacation. With Labor Day that weekend i got 8-days off straight to play.
---
So ready.
---
Eh you don’t have to if you don’t want. It was just my opinion. I was able to pull a small amount of info from them. I’m sure there is more to be obtained and I’m sure there are people out there willing to do it. This is Reddit/internet after all.
---
Wait, not even two weeks???
---
I stopped counting and now I'm glad I did
---
I was really young probably ten or eleven and didn't really understood the concept of Quests. Long texts with much unnecessary Infos and they didn't even really tell me where exactly to go. So I almost never done any of them and grinded all my way up to level 15 - 20. I was a Tauren shaman and because I never did my quests I didn't even got my totems... It took such a long time just to grind your way up and with out the gear and money of Quests I had really crappy gear and almost no spells.

Is that Rok’tar and gravy from flintlocke vs the horde?
---
All of this PvE work and massive RNG for a PvP meme weapon. Blizzard was playing 4D chess **in 2004**.
---
That is the posting I replied to. And in 2004 (up to 2006) Sulfuras was the best Arms Warrior PVP and PVE weapon. EOD.
---
It's gone before world bosses exist.
---
Yeah it looks waaay more vanilla with it turned off. Some areas like Teldrassil it works quite well, but a shiny Durotar is just odd looking.
---
&gt;does more in raids/PVP than just spam 1-2 hotkeys.
---
Not mage then.
---
Enchanter sounds like Warlock to me. However, their toolkit is also simplistic in pve and not very complicated in pvp.
---
The goto "has a skillcap but isn't insane" option is rogue imo. Harder than that would be druids or shamans.
---
Yep. It's weird how people suddenly forget how the internet works. The post ought to be at 0% upvotes because of the obvious security risk. But it's at 86% upvoted and will probably reach +500 upvotes by the end of the day. 
---
Some gullible people show an extreme lack of judgement when they download random programs from random places.

I’m moaning a Druid but I play on rolling a warrior alt for the possibility of obtaining my favorite in-game weapon.

&gt; Yes, there is exceptions

Choose one.

I didnt at first. Had your same line of thinking.  But several people reccomended I do it so. I figured it couldnt hurt.
---
I agree with the dislike of those locations. when Iornforge has people in it laughing in the taverns and running around, it feels more like a warm hearth than a dank cave.
---
That's good advice. I don't want to use a quest addon, and I also don't want to miss quests. I want to do everything possible.. will consider this.
---
Cooking isnt needed for sure, First-aid however... very important for a rogue or warrior haha
---
But.. But.. Lvl 51 and epic. Must... Have
---
Wow I'd love to have something like this installed!
---
Damn, I tought he'd be a better player lol
---
Suppose your right. I re posted. Guess I can't trust in the goodwill of people. Is that the model that came up for my plates? Because it was wrong.
---
+weapon skill buffs like edgemasters or human racials matters but incredibly little. How far you've skilled your own weapon skill does not matter, it will automatically max for pvp.
---
It was added 1.11.1 and removed 4.2.
---
So yeah, pretty much added at Naxx and removed somewhere close to Firelands in Cata.
---
I freaking love that item. Hopefully by the time ZG comes out I'll have something better but I remember watching a reck paladin with all rogue dungeon set and z'r one shotting people. Zalgradis 3 if I remember right.  Such an awesome sword.
---
Yes I realize that's the plan. HOWEVER if the attrition rates are far lower than Blizzard is anticipating, servers like Herod are for a very interesting situation. Either they keep layering, or they make Nostalrius look barren.
---
So, the moonkin meta is: Melee people? He was doing waaaay more melee damage than with spells
---
Sounds like a dangerous topic to explore, but credit if you pull it off. 
---
I always went the safe route at Uni.
---
I rolled a Tauren warrior, first time I played, and I think at the time I felt like I was doing okay playing in Mulgore and The Barrens. I remember constantly seeing people in chat ask for group members to WC and didn't know what it was, but somebody said you had to be level 18. So when I hit that level I asked a group if I could play and they let me in as long as I tanked. Sounds good, right?
---
I followed these lads in and dumped spells on the mobs there. I got that I was supposed to get the mobs to hit me, so I just tried to attack everything as much as I can in the hopes of doing so. We were shitty, we died a lot. I think the group disbanded before we got that far in, so I didn't finish for ages. I did plenty of WC runs though (basically every time somebody asked I had another go) that were bad for various reasons. One day some lad starts getting hit by a dinosaur and he keeps yelling USE TAUNT at me but I argued with this dude for ages that I was and it was on cooldown.
---
What I was actually using, was mocking blow. I think at the time I assumed everyone just called it 'taunt' cause it made the mob attack you. I was in battle stance for a good 9-10 wc runs (to be honest I didn't know any other stances existed at the time) because I missed the quest at level 10 that gets you defensive stance, taunt, sunder armour and all that shit. I think I swerved it because it was in Durotar? I was somewhere in the mid 20s before I worked that one out. dumbdumb
---
ironically, I remember partying with a hunter that was in the low 20s and the group kept telling him to get his pet out, but he didn't know how to tame one so he just played without it. what an idiot, I thought
---
Max settings with 50% of the protanomaly colourblind option turned on to mellow out the strong reds.
---
Can we get this pinned?
---
Whitemane is a PST server with a high pop. I was going to roll Whitemane because I have a few friends going there, but I was checking out a bunch of guild listings and the raid times made it too late for me on an EST schedule to play. 
---
There are so few servers out, so they will all be highly populated. IMO, stick to a PST server, you'll be fine.
---
It absolutely should be. But Japan is weird about that stuff.
---
&gt; you'll see us continue to work to drive awareness around the launch in the coming weeks. 
---
Bring back the Mr T and William Shatner ads!
---
Warcraft 2 theme hypes me every rime
---
Yeah that’s not exactly what I was saying. I was more so saying that the group of people who allocate money for different projects (executive management, probably?) may have been convinced that Classic didn’t have that big of a market outside of people already tuned into the everyday goings-on of blizzard and Classic-related news (blizzard fans and private server players). For that reason, they would have thought that putting money towards advertisements would have been a waste. I am somewhat assuming here, for the sake of speculation, that the same people allocating funds for advertising a project would be allocating funds for servers. Given that before now, we saw very few servers, and very little actual advertisement. Now, after the “extreme demand” following name reservation, we have seen more servers open, and more actual advertisements on platforms other than BNet. This is all based on an assumed understanding of the workings of blizzard, and is completely speculatory, in case I have to mention that.

I got a Dell G3 I7 - works perfectly at highest settings - 17 inch screen.

What? The new male humans look like shit lol. First time I turned my helmet to visible was when that patch released.

This started out being the most depressing thing I have watched this week and quickly turned into the most amazing one. Fucking A.
---
Horde for 12 years 
---
Excited af to level a night elf, and experience alliance questing, zones, major cities, etc.
---
I mean, they clearly know what they are doing. Or just hit a gold mine and ran with it. 
---
But I was still sad to see Paragon go.
---
That seems to be the reason everyone I ask gives me, basically they do it because others do it. I recently sold a car privately and didn't crop the license in the pictures I posted online. Nothing bad happened, but I was wondering if something bad could have happened.
---
I just wish I knew the difference between TukUI and ElvUI
---
And you are ganking in return. I think it is cool, because so many scenarios can come out from that. You might team up with random people and now you get a bonding experience with them. It might turn out to a full scale war or something different. You really get the concept of the Alliance against the Horde.
---
It will be medium pop soon and high shortly after given current trends!
---
So does the druid
---
Yessss more KJ clips! Give me more!
---
Full does not mean its closed or no new characters can be created. That would be locked.
---
Damn, Naxx cleared, Atiesh... GG.
---
Fake, Mordor is Africa.
---
He just means your age, experience and guild requirements have bugger all to do with where you should go.
---
If you're in the US don't roll Faerlina to avoid streamers. If you're in the EU ignore servers "claimed" by countries, it will be meaningless.
---
The main choice you need to make is PVP or PVE and no-one can tell you which is better for you. PVP is the more "complete" game but "complete" also includes getting your ass ganked. Depends how patient you are and how much you wanna mess up the competition.
---
Any server that matches your timezone. There are tons of people going into Classic WoW without ever playing Vanilla. There isn't strictly a server where "expert" Vanilla players will be playing on. You will have a mix of private server guilds, old school Vanilla players, new players, etc.. So, your best bet is to play on a server where you can raid at a normal time.
---
Just ordered a 1440p screen in anticipation. Figured since I was getting 150fps at 122%(1440p), why not just get that actually resolution. Will feel good to finally max the game after all these years.
---
If you really break it down; all I'm doing is streaming myself playing my favorite game, watching other streams and vids on Classic. Cutting it together in a coherent video, sharing my thoughts (shouldn't take more than a couple of hours) then uploading it.
---
I remember it like it was yesterday. I joined a group at around level 15 or 16, I very clearly remember it being for VC. I was on a ret paladin, that's how you know I was a legit noob. So, my first ever dungeon experience was doing a group formed for "VC" on my underleveled ret pally.
---
As a troll priest, Im not sure what to think.
---
This place is hella toxic towards private servers. Even tho paying 12€ a month isn't a lot, i can see how people are not willing/able to purchase it.
---
Here's to hoping that you'll find a vanilla server that won't shut down at classic launch !
---
He got carried hard
---
I'm not 100% on what "step kiting" is. I was really good at the run-jump-spin 180-instant-spin 180-run move. 
---
I also rebound fairly early my Q and E to page 1 and 2 of my hotbars(still do this). I set page 2 to melee abilities... want to say the snare, and the jump back move.  Also learned early the macro systems and modifications. These factors had a way of making me stand out to people on my hunter and latter my tankadin.
---
The resemblance is daunting.
---
A few people told me you can get personnal info from the plates.

Well you didn't specify what you're trying to avoid/what you're looking for, etc.

UPDATE: WE ARE MOVING TO **GEHENNAS**
---
Streamer servers aren't going to have as much of a huge impact as people think. They won't be ruined, they won't kill the experience.
---
The server that the Brazilians are playing on is a VERY small % of the overall server population, they will mostly be regulated to heir own guilds. Again, not a huge impact on overall experience.
---
Most big streamers are rolling on Faerlina, Brazilians on Thalnos. Both are PvP servers. So you decide, do you want open world PvP at any time? Or not? If yes, consider Stalagg for low queue times or consider Grobbulus for a more immersive experience in the world, and even try your hand at some RP if you like (although it's not required).
---
If no, any of the PvE servers. In the end, you're experience will probably be similar across all server minus PvP vs PvE.
---
I just realized I accidentally rolled a east coast server when I'm west coast :/
---
It honestly seems like you have this problem, not me.
---
oh man this reminds me so much of Lineage 2 and I loved going through towns looking for stuff to buy. Finding the person with a typo in price was like winning the lottery.
---
I believe Details! has one built in.
---
It will run on anything. I'm running it on a surface pro 3 tablet and that's basically a touchscreen potato. It does 45-50 but will drop to about 35fps with a ton of players around.
---
my guild leader in vanillia was a swede, when we were hitting Ony\\MC he had a very thick accent to the point when got flustered it was hard to understand, by the time we hit NAXX he lost most of the accent (or maybe I got used to it?).  Ravvy.... where are you?
---
Because there really aren't enough quests to get to level 10 easily. You'll find by level 7-8 that those quest turnins don't get you to the next level. But the next quests you get are for a level or two higher. You also have pretty crap gear with no bonus stats, so killing mobs level 10 when you're 10 takes longer than killing level 3 mobs at level 3. 
---
Better off grinding out a bunch of levels at the start and mid way to 10. Then you're actually getting level 10 quests when you're 10 or 11, not 8.
---
&gt; If you had the original collector's edition you do get to choose 1 of the 3 pets

Ah good to know - yes it was the original.

You are absolutely right my friend, Apple used to be good, but now they put the power (and Money) in the hands of the marketing Team.
---
Legend says, only one man ever walked out from there alive.
---
By WotLK leveling was definitely faster than in Vanilla, even though it was still in the same fashion. I remember the powerleveling services in WotLK proposed to level your characters 1-80 in a single week (real time) - whereas it would take roughly the same time in Vanilla. 
---
Some quests also became a bit easier (they were slightly changed when it comes to the number of kills etc), they gave more exp, many drop rates of quest items got boosted, and some annoying yet immersive Vanilla details were changed by WotLK (for example quest items you had to gather in the open world were shining like loot able corpses in WotLK, which wasn’t the case in Vanilla - for example, finding them quest books in SM library became WAY easier). But I agree that overall questing was similar. The big changes really started with Cataclysm.

Death knights

Thank you! 😊 Yuki was really happy to hear that someone found them interesting. She works really hard in them.
---
This is really well said! I also agree so much. Enjoy the ride. Enjoy sitting in discord with your friends on name reservation day. Enjoy scrolling through posts about classes and discussing pros and cons. Enjoy watching classic beta streams, wishing you could play.  Enjoy the little things.
---
Now I’m maiming Hunter. See you out there, comrade ☭
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Does the weapon proc with Druid attacks?
---
jeff kaplan’s name is misspelled in the game design video pour one out 😔👌
---
Holy shit. someone else who played SRO. After all these years I've finally run into someone in the wild who knows what I'm talking about.
---
Haha. People usually use lawnmower in their jokes ;)
---
Reddit being awesome as always :)
---
Scoliosis means your back curves sideways not hunched over.
---
I can give a partial answer:
---
1) Warlocks are strong pvpers in vanilla. More gear to come online also means that when they have gear they tend to outscale equivalently geared hunters.
---
2) Not sure.
---
3) 4 Items on a warlock are crafted in phase 1/2. Everything else is more or less shared with mages. However, hunters share gearing with rogues/warriors, who are considered higher priority due to being better dps. I would say hunters actually have more gear competition.
---
4) Not sure. Warlocks are tanky beasts despite being casters at the very least
---
5) Not sure.
---
If money your main concern, hunter makes more cash. If gearing is a concern, warlock has a slight edge. PvP wise both do well.
---
Does Chuck Norris' beard hold up the entire world?
---
There were plenty during the stress test.
---
I really do hope we're wrong and it doesn't change the experience for the people who jump right in.
---
#nochanges
---
Wow players are socially stunted so memes like chuck norris help them feel a little hit of social interaction like having an inside joke (that everyone knows) so there will definitely be chuck norris jokes.
---
Both are fine even great in both pvp and BGs early on.
---
Warlocks have easy access to tier gear eaely but compete with mages for big staves etc.
---
No idea about T3.
---
Apparently you can farm mara as a lock, but without FD you'd need to be careful about the tinker part, cause those vines or lashers can aggro you sometimes or if they're high enough level.
---
I don't recall, but did the Crit have anything to do with the mage being turned around?
---
Is that Monkeynews laughing? Rofl!
---
If you're in the US Faerlina is going to have most of the streamers and Thalnos is going to have a good chunk of people who don't speak English or speak it as a second language (but will still probably mostly be fluent English speakers).  But even then its a matter of personal preference.
---
I am already getting mad thinking about someone stealing my chest
---
All jokes aside you really don't have to be super hardcore to get to 60 or even to starter raids. Tbe average player will be getting 60 3 months afyer launch, maybe 2 if they really put in the extra free time. Some people have even talked about rotating between 2 or 3 characters that they only play with rested XP so they'll get further with mess time played per character
---
No. Now it ends.
---
All aboard the heal boat!
---
Yes, but it's functionality is severely restricted. Most scripts that worked in vanilla will not work in classic.
---
I'm sure it does but I was just making a dumb joke on reddit.
---
I’m sure the server will be well 420 before long
---
At least hunters will want to wear most of their set pieces, unlike most classes where at least 4/8 of the first two sets are hot garbage ... just because a mage takes it to proll in OG/IF doesn't mean the item is needed more than the directly disenchanted hunter piece ...
---
Asmongold and Stay safe are both dicks, but make no move to hide it. 
---
Esfand is a bit of a dick but pretends he isn't. His method when ninjaing loot was radio-silence as well.
---
It runs so freaking smooth
---
Any server
---
Ahh yes. I was trying to wrack my brain for more dungeons with it, came up with nothing. I kinda wish there were more.
---
“Passive” is far from useless. Your pet will follow you and not attack anything unless you tell it to. 
---
You could manually use “pet attack” or macro in “pet attack” every time you “auto shoot” but as I mentioned before I would suggest not looking up too many guides. 
---
The game will teach you things.
---
You want layering removed and no caps on severs. 
---
Very smart.
---
Yeah so a bunch of noobs lol, do you have to challenge the horde to a duel in the wild?
---
Did I stutter?  Scripts exist in wow unless you want to dispute that plz don't move the goalpost and try to argue with me.
---
What's the old quote? Something like "A lie can go around the world twice before the truth has a chance to get its pants on."
---
Could call the cops and claim you did a hit and run.
---
dwarf rogue is actually good for pvp with stoneform. Obviously gnomes are good too with escape artist, but dwarf rogue vs orc/undead rogue is in dwarves favor for sure.
---
Boat time
---
You always rez at the GY in the area you died at, not the one you try to rez at. Although there is a skip for dun morogh to menethil (google it)
---
IIRC there are no trainers in darnassus for any classes NELFs cannot be, so enjoy heading back to the eastern kingdoms every two levels.
---
From my experience in other servers lately darkshore is worth the travel. Questing there is really solid and you get to skip a westfall which is usually a nightmare.
---
Ok good idea I’ll divorce my husband :)
---
Oh nice! I am doing my grad program at MU right now. I had to figure out the best way to explain to the professor that I TA for why I needed the 26th off. Grob is going to be awesome, we should try to get a bunch of local peeps.
---
Chuck Norris &gt;&gt;&gt; GOP Talking Points
---
If I am going to have to be alliance I'm at least gonna be pretty. Human female
---
Don't go mage if you want more than a couple keys, especially in PVE.  Sounds like shaman might be a good fit but there's the danger of getting pulled into healing roll.  Druid and Shaman both have really big toolkits but druid's worst spec is balance (caster dps) and other two are tank and heals which you want to avoid both of so i'd avoid that. 
---
hunter and rogue would be my next options.  both have pretty extensive toolkits, rogues are tied to fairly long cooldowns as i understand it but have never personally played one past lv20, so couldn't really say.
---
don't know anything about EQ to compare
---
By them the player base will be spread out enough that there shouldn't be that much zone congestion.
---
Nice dude.  A buddy of mine is rocking the mini Diablo lol
---
All five of you?
---
Curious to the answer here as well as I’ve run into this issue before too
---
Doing it this way increases the chance you get your name, because it eliminates the rush and 10k+ queue after random DCs.
---
I ran through STV fresh off boat at 17 got one shot from no where said this game is shit turned it off for months...
---
&gt;htf this guy a wow dev
---
By writing code that compiles into a video game. Dudes just playing wow in chill mode, why hate?
---
This whole thread makes me feel sick, and woozy.
---
I’m definitely going with either paladin or druid or maybe mage or warrior or rogue or hunter or priest or warlock. Almost probably not shaman.
---
Most guides I see recommend it
---
Oh I'm sorry. I'm having trouble hearing you over the sound of my people's blood on your hands.
---
Citrix end users are constantly mad and sad at the same time, and they have every right in the world to be so.
---
\- sincerely, me, your IT-Guy
---
Nice, I lived out there for a couple years-but I am from KC. See you on the battlefield, and if you ever come to visit Fulton you will find "no alliance allowed" poster in the local bar, so watch your back.
---
At what concurrent population level during peak time do you consider it a dead server?
---
gnome is best alliance pvp race for warrior, this will be more common in higher ranks
---
Going rogue as a main. Proffessions?
---
I'm going to play equally pvp as pve, as I love both aspects.
---
Thinking about engineer, but can't imagine making much money with engineering. I don't wanna be poor either, but engineering is awesome in pvp. Help please.
---
An_l spam was introduced in later patch?
---
Raid finder, flying mounts, transmog, azerite gear, legendary weapons and recruit-a-friend leveling.
---
Makes sense, although my lecturers and coordinators of the subject/degree are actually really switched on and with the times. I look up to them in many respects.
---
This project is actually crossing over two subjects; one centered around Game Media and the other being broader, focusing on media trends and innovations from the past and today
---
We're reaching peak boomer
---
Move the goalpost? Not even arguing their existence. Just adding to the conversation.
---
I made this myself
---
Level 10 mate. I suppose around 3-xxx hours of game play. Loosely based upon your proposed epic walk there and then back.
---
Lots of people think warrior is the class that every race gets by default.  However, consider the fact that tauren don't get rogues.  If tauren got rogues, that would be another class that every race gets.  Tauren are too big to be rogues, you say?  Well I say gnomes are too small to be warriors.  Are you with me?
---
no?  ok.
---
Who the hell is thex?
---
Yea I extensively used the willitclassic.com linked weakauras2.  I setup basically my entire UI around it and it worked great.
---
They replied to my support email saying features are on the way, but didn't elaborate.
---
I just got a new MacBook Air. You think it’ll be fine on that? 16g ram i7 processor
---
You guys are just not realizing that in the grand scheme, Classic is just a legacy server opening. Doesn't mean they should put millions into it. Advertizing now is enough, cause the people who needed time to prepare already knew about it, the casuals learning about it now is not a problem.
---
I spent all my gold on useless greens from the AH so I didn't have a mount until ~48
---
TBH I really didn't like MOP that much but I understand why people did.  I just think Pandaren are just as much part of Warcraft as anything else since they were in Warcraft III.
---
Wow it's so deep ! Even Freud would call you a crook.
---
On private servers Arcane Crystals tend to be ~20g with a 5-10g markup for the Arcanite Bars. Since layering affects ores, they might be a bit cheaper on classic.
---
I think JAB learned a lot from that statement.
---
Imagine assuming someone is stuck-up and egotistic just because they wanna play a game alone.
---
1. I never said they was hard well not until you get to mythic.
---
2. So what you are basically saying is standing there doing fuck all because you are about to take threat from the boss takes more skill than actually reacting to the 5-6 abilities the boss is using?
---
3. So using a wand while you wait for managed to regen so you can use your one spell over and over is more complex than a multi spell rotation that can change and be situational? 
---
Everything you are saying is just objectively wrong
---
I’m so glad you’ve made this! I was just talking with a coworker about playing in a rppvp and trying to be a merchant!!! Good on you for this!!
---
Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker
---
Oh... An [dirge]
---
How could I forget
---
Finding and hunting for quests is part of the fun though, isn't it? It also rewards a players knowledge rather than using outside sources all the time. I for one won't be using any quest addons at all until at least my 2nd or 3rd alt.
---
Thanks I'm not a psychologist but I play one on the internet.
---
&gt; Mages get 6% in the Frost tree, give Locks something similar so they can compete for the first tiers. I’m not saying I want perfect balance, but some of the specs just do fuck all for dps or tanking. Make Druids balanced so they can be MTs or even Pallys.
---
That will give locks a free 6% additional crit or whatever in Naxx, which scales like a metric ton and WILL be a problem. Basically 6% hit they don't have to itemize around.
---
Yeah, do not install it dude.
---
If you have 400 hours to level 2 characters, I wouldn't sweat the choices at this exact moment since name registration is already done. Level one and debate the second, you've got time.
---
Paladin is a pain to level, a boring healer and its other specs are considered meme specs. Druid isn't boring, but same issue with memespecs if you don't want to heal. I feel like you have to commit to either healer or dps, druid tank is *not* something you want to do unless you're 100% committed to it.
---
Shame you're going alliance, the best "I want to heal but maybe dps too" is shaman from what I can gather.
---
WoW you only eat once during thr week long marathon while weaving in some cardio.. is this a weigth loss system too?
---
Yes, yes you did
---
I use thing-a-ma-jig and doo-joby on a daily basis in a highly technical job.
---
At one point it didnt but it does in 1.12.1 that Classic is based on.
---
Same here man. I tried private servers on many games including classic WoW. It's never the same.
---
Not even dalrends, Thrash Blade + Mirah's Song is also way better and both are quest rewards you get while lvling anyway.
---
Six polygons of pure sex.

HYPE TRAIN /train
---
All servers will have guilds in different time zones. I am est playing on a pst server
---
and what do we do when every single server has 50k queue LOL
---
For sure. That said i'm alliance so we generally don't use 2h'ers outside of cleave fights.
---
Those guys were so coordinated though. That was Wpvp griefing with real style.
---

How are you going to kill the mob and finish quest if you are always ahead of it?

Too late. My brain just auto-magically says it now.

Herbalism is the goto gathering moneymaker profession. Alchemy is not required, just AH the herbs.

That's actually a meme we invented, we love it.

You are rounding Joana's time down by 20 hours and rounding up OP's estimation by 6 hours. World record is 4 days and 20 hours, OP is estimating he will take 132 hours or 5.5 days. He is estimating he will be off of a previous world record pace by 10 hours.
---
I understand speed runners will certainly beat that record this time around but like I said, the "normal" players aren't going to touch 5 days played.
---
This is awesome.  Gives me a neat little checklist to go through.  Thanks for sharing!
---
trolls are scaly. He's a snekbeard.

They’re there, the original collectors edition came with pets. Panda, Diablo, and zergling.

Having played both factions, I think the leveling experience in vanilla was pretty even.

It's not so much that they are toxic against private servers; it's more that they're toxic to people who can't spend $15 on a game they apparently like very very much. It's a couple of beers less each month. Or walk somewhere more often instead of taking the car. 
---
Or don't play and study in the evening for a better paying job.
---
Personally, I really can't fathom someone not being able to pay $15 a month on their hobby.  Heck, play 2h a month less and go wash a couple of cars.
---
mmmkay, I keep seeing rank 14... what is that?
---
This is literally me, but instead of ally noobs, it's horde noobs
---
Haha same for me. In high school I had school, work, sports and rarely had time to play. 
---
Nowadays I have 6-8 hours of free time after work.
---
Trending doesn't always = long standing value
---
But I agree, vanilla wow is a classic
---
Yo, that’s fucking dope!
---
I approve this message.
---
Can never fault mages, great class. You'll have to respec between pvp and raiding, but they aoe grind mobs like a champ so money is no issue.
---
So long as you're ok with their low mobility/control playstyle in pvp. They don't really have great escape, instead they prevent the enemy from moving.
---
If you're happy with that, and don't mind a simple dps button in raids, mage is perfectly fine.
---
I feel like everyone in this subreddit already knew this.
---
When you play BFA, it's finally not that bad.
---
Hey Mal! I am also playing on Whitemane from EST. It looks like with the amount of servers we have in NA that their is going to be a nice mix of EST players on PST servers, specifically Whitemane and not Fairbanks. Also dont forget not all PST guilds will raid at 10PM our time. While my guild will be raiding around 9PM EST I wont be able to make their raids for a bit and will be looking to bring the diplomacy and make plenty of Alliances to get pug groups going. I probably wont be the only one either. If you want that time zone security though, I do believe a new EST PvP server just opened up!
---
Every server's gotta have a [Dave](https://i.imgur.com/0WZikwF.png)
---
Also, level 18s in Westfall probably aren't LFG for Dire Maul so it's literally impossible to confuse the two. 
---
I mean, just shift click their name in chat and see what level they are.  That, and nobody in Ironforge is going to be forming a Deadmines group lol.
---
That isn't a strawman, a strawman would be arguing against an argument you never made.
---
But your argument is wrong, exaggeration can help.
---
I work in education and return to work on... You guessed it... 27th bloody August!! That's gonna be one long day...
---
How many people do you have and what's your schedule look like? PVP servers turn me off because rarely its 1v1 between the same level and usually someone ganking someone 10 levels higher 😑. I'm working full time and a grad student too so I dont want to spend my time corpse walking.
---
Blizz has all this info. They won't ever tell us though.
---
I can Thex so hard right now.
---
Grobb, Grobb is the server you seek
---
This is the only reasonable thing that should be listed
---
Definitely updated graphics. Not playing classic to relive old times, but because it's simply a much better game than current version. This has very little to do with graphics details.
---
Moonkin actually has talents to buff autoattacks. Very luck crit still
---
Nice, I have a 600RR.
---
Your tldr is longer than you main text....
---
just like playing a paladin
---
&gt; I completely wouldn't mind if they implemented (panda-less) Monk class into Classic.
---
Facepalm
---
Sure 2H fury can use it. But it's maybe the third best item from MC for a 2H fury. BRE is better by a long shot, and OEB is at least as good for dps.
---
I look forward to rediscovering all of the zones you destroyed in Cataclysm.
---
Dropped your pants?
---
You would be a fool to not sell that hammer, you get 33 gold for it!
---
No idea how things will be. I do know that back in the day balance seemed to heavily favor ally side on the rp servers I tried. That changed in bc when horde got belfs and it was a huge shift.
---
No way, stoneform is good, but hardiness is the best racial for pvp, especially for rogue vs rogue.
---
Its a question about chad classic and JAB spends 70% trying defend beta retail.
---
Deadmines was the first dungeon I ever ran back in vanilla shortly after launch. I remember it always being called VC and never heard of "DM" until after tbc released I think.
---
It wasn't that way in vanilla, the player cap will be the same now once layering is gone, thus it will end up fine.
---
You've got the main qualifier as a tank then, the rest you can learn and read/watch guides for.
---
This is true. But its not such a hard deal since you'd have the flight points in menethil. There are quite a few skips, fastest would be to tun over the airfield and get down on the other side.
---
Tbh, i see alot of these posts. Many people are insecure about leveling somewhere they want to go or something they want to play and it having downsides or not being optimal.
---
Classic is not all about that. This way of thinking comes from retail. The streamline, best way to play is the only way to do it.
---
Please, just play the way you like. Play any class, any spec, any item you like. Play any zone you like. Having to run back for new spells is part of the journey. Its fun. Enjoy it. You don't want to be finished with classic in a month.
---
I will make a custom android theme for this today, will let you know when finished
---
Yikes. I didn't even know that was a thing. If I had to guess 5 min ago I would have said movement resets the shot timer.
---
Gang of like 12 switching
---
Shit we will all be fighting to get to rock bottom fastest.
---
Human warrior, what spec though? Should I dps or tank in raids (I was arms in vanilla and prot all through BC). Also back then I was a herbalist/alchemist. Worth continuing that route in vanilla or would blacksmithing benefit me more or something else?
---
I died three times in there last week, f' that place.
---
Retail WoW is just a giant meme now
---
i dont want to see the damn panda, ugh.
---
It was Distract, used to affect players until TBC (if my memory serves)
---
DID SOMEONE SAY \[\[THUNDERFURY, BLESSED BLADE OF THE WINDSEEKER\]\]
---
Blizzard not capping the servers? How do they expect to remove layering by phase 2 then?
---
RIP
---
Maxing all my settings out - the render distance in particular makes the world feel even bigger to me. Getting to see Auberdine with the new water on the stress test also felt great.
---
No :( we don't have black friday madness here in Australia. Is it as over the top as south park makes it out to be?
---
What?
---
You're right, it was pretty great! My first MMO too! I played on a smaller server than most would've been used to (Oceanic) so you really got to know people. Lots of Asians, and lots of drama :P
---
I was actually releaved going into the Barrens on the launch test.  The general chat was tolerable there, unlike the cringe fest that was the general chat in Durotar.
---
I'll probably leave it on classic for a stable framerate. If they add multithreading to it like they did in BFA then I'll consider turning settings up.
---
Your unplayable, my amazing.
---
I think you mean Golemadrid
---
Im going down the early blink182/green day path right now. Haven't listened to this music in a decade and its fucking great.
---
Vanilla had 171 servers in NA by the time 1.12, Classic has 12. Even the lowest populated server will be full compared to what people were used to in Vanilla, the only difference is that you won’t face queues.
---
You're gonna want food with fiber, so you can get on and off the toilet asap. 
---
That heavy-ass Carbonara will keep you on the toilet until BC servers.
---
High Warlord/Grand Marshall
---
Bush whacking with herbalism on your main or aoe grinding mage are your other options.
---
I leveled all the way to level 52 without realizing that I needed to upgrade my spells. I had rank 1 of everything and relied almost purely on Windfury and auto attacks to kill things. I also used the arrow keys to move and clicked all of my spells/attacks.
---
Mages are efficient farmers, especially in DM.
---
I hope your IT department doesn't monitor the traffic! :)
---
Warlocks are very gear dependent though aren’t they?
---
Spend the time farming 300g instead of instancing for a better weapon while gearing up your friends?  In what stunted universe is he wrong?
---
I'll give it a try. Doubt its allowed. Stay tuned.
---
I do play path of exile and you are talking about incredibly different economies. Do some research on different economies and then tell me how Path of Exile and Classic WoW are even remotely similar.
---
God damn I'm so hyped but I also have tricky coursework to try get done before then 😭
---
Never understood how someone could play a human in a fantasy RPG.  Do you have no imagination bro?
---
Situations like these are the reason god invented the backhand slap.
---
I mean "Full" dont mean the server is full, just mean its almost full. As in everyone is not going to be playing at exactly the same time in the future.
---
But when the server is "locked" that is when its actually full/closed. (from what i remember atleast).
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpbnq7/classic\_release\_and\_spirit\_gear\_dont\_roll\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bpbnq7/classic_release_and_spirit_gear_dont_roll_on/) 
---
See the problem is that the Reddit community made it crystal clear a few months ago to preists/healers that spi and int gear were open game for all classes because all classes can use those stats while leveling. Check out the link - the guy asking folks not to roll in spi gear got downvoted to oblivion.
---
So why shouldn't priests roll on stam daggers or agi cloaks for small leveling upgrades? These things aren't BIS and will be replaced soon?
---
I mean the answer is obvious - preists shouldn't take stam daggers and agi cloaks over rogues - rogues shouldn't take spi gear over preists - but in this priest's defense the Reddit community made it crystal clear that everyone can roll on everything while leveling if it benefits them at all regardless of group make up.
---
Being a common DPS class, it was basically the only reason I got invites, or picked up tanks/healers when forming my own group.  Plenty of people don't want to bother with the chains, but it gives you a huge boost over the "competition" if you do them.
---
Large Bear Bone
---
omg... they have no clue.... none. 0.0
---
I want to say I reached rank 10 back in the day?
---
As a Dalaran native of 13 years, I would be over the moon if they dropped a Dalaran realm.
---
&gt; Social media is magnet for indecisive, demanding asshats who don't want to be satisfied by anything.  If they can't complain about something they aren't happy.
---
This would make a very fine quote.
---
WotF is not nearly as broken as Orc's Hardiness.  Hardiness was nerfed three times since Vanilla, but thankfully it's returning to it's original form in Classic.
---
All characters have a 5% chance to resist stuns.  Hardiness increases that resistance by 25%.  Not a multiplicative 25%, which would only get you 6.25%, but an *additional* 25%, getting you to a base 30% chance to resist a stun.  Rogues wouldn't even go after Orcs in PvP because they just assumed their Cheap/Kidney shots were better spent elsewhere.
---
&gt;Your the last raid/party member alive and the boss is down to 0.1% and you've got to try to fight it, and your fingers instinctively hit that ability you couldn't possibly have in your claimed spec.
---
But just how awesome would it be if your raid is watching Rag wipe the whole raid while at 0.1%, and the last person alive is a cute little healer in a flowery dress who suddenly turns to shadow and melts Rag's face with a barrage of mindflays.
---
My wife got into a new show and was distracted. Tell her to watch Vampire Diaries
---
I'd def skip the bacon. Who the hell cooks bacon in olive oil? That's literally trying fat in fat lmao
---
It's not as bad as anyone thinks mainly because EACH person has their name reserved on 2-3 other servers where they won't be playing, so it's like artificial inflation.
---
Overrated, it's already nearly impossible to pull threat from a pet with BM
---
you forgot item levels /s
---
Do it. We need more of you. 
---
Sincerely, 
---
A priest who's life you may save some day.
---
Could also be a different server type of thing. Rexxar-US was 100% DM
---
1000 Needles, it was the first zone that I felt I was really branching out on my own after the Barrens and I really loved the exploration around the zone (I know some hate it). The story line into the shimmering flats was always very cool to me. Mind Controlling people off cliffs/ledges was always so much fun too.
---
+ the fact that I have not seen it since Cata, can't wait!
---
Looks like my summer vacation is... over
---
Tfw you used all your PTO on a eurotrip
---
So you once paid the exact same amount to play, and now it is too much?..
---
First place I realized this game was hard and I needed to do some learning about my class and the game in general.  Hit the internet hard, read everything I could,  got better.  I can't wait!
---
It runs on my wife’s 2017 MacBook Air. The last gen with the better keyboard. I think you’ll be fine.
---
yikes
---
*laughs in weapon expertise and bonus reputation*
---
I saw an official Classic advert on youtube
---
"classic mode" lol
---
Combat daggers performs well at 60.
---
HOWEVER, you will be in Herod
---
I think the true choice is clear
---
You're not updated dear padawan! Noone of those I mentioned are going Golemagg, but Gehennas! It's room for you as well! Tag along
---
there is a very interesting essay on world coherency in vanilla/classic wow and the difference to modern mmos/ wow. ill see if i can find it!
---
My first character was a ne.hunter, and I didnt really like pets. They were in the way, they didnt do much as I figured, so I just went without them until level 54 or so. 
---
I had a very solid tactic:
---
Immolation trap before me (cause it did dmg), aimed shot, then raptor strike to death. I thought I was doing fine...
---
And yet undead were the overwhelming majority at the time. Also I know hardiness is amazing. Doesn't change the fact that people roll undead despite that.
---
Yeah because they knew that the average player coming back for classic would forget about it after 6 months or wonder why they were advertising so early.
---
They only announced it so early for us because we demanded it and pushed them to announce it early and so the hype with the hardcore crowd wouldn't die before the announcement.
---
&gt;you don’t know the game is coming out.
---
Yup, I told a bunch of my gamer buddies about my plans for Classic wow and most of them had forgotten about it and are now excited to come back.
---
I have to admit I’m even tempted to put all of the amazing modern games on hold to give it a try, it is exciting
---
No temu skarpetek w sandałkach niestety nie dorysujemy :p Eh tam, ja idę na RP-PvP tak czy siak, trzymajcie się na Shazzrie ^^
---
I think the last time I took Legendaries seriously was in Cata for the Fangs of the Father?  Those took a lot of effort as well although they were less RNG driven than previous iterations.
---
It was the non streamer non south american option for an east coast pvp server. Thats why it blew up.
---
I’m not a game developer. I got started in programming writing bots for Counter-Strike and Runescape in the early 2000’s, eventually went to college for CS, and paid off my student loans ten times over writing bots for World of Warcraft and Hearthstone.
---
Bossland was one of the best programming jobs I ever had, certainly one of the most lucrative. Zwetan ran a simple shop and completely shared profits. Across all platforms, it was millions of euros. I’m glad Blizzard was unable to touch him beyond having Germany tell him he couldn’t sell bots anymore (which is fine, updates to Warden make botting without getting banned impossible).
---
I stopped working as a programmer about five years ago and now just do a little consulting, maybe ~10 hours a week average with high variance and some travel. In 2022, my wife and I plan to become public school teachers.
---
Or do a full clear of Dire Maul
---
If u have 3 warlocks in raid just one them need to summon imp the others should use ds
---
No their not. Stop spreading misinformation. Norway and Denmark are staying Shazzrah, most swedes are going Gehennas.
---
&gt;	You defended that comment, but to be fair both you idiots sounds the same
---
What didn’t you understand?
---
Only the swedes
---
Nice strawman buddy. Vancleef is vc for the dinveon because two dungeons share dm and one had to change. Makes sense that the lowbie dungeon has the change names, no? But no herp derp deadmines is dm!
---
Druid. You can heal the warrior if/when you need to. nuff said.
---
The writers admitted that the quest in Stonetalon Mountains was a miscommunication. One guy thought they were going for honorable Garrosh while everyone else was writing him as racist.
---
2nd part is mostly true, but literally everyone Thrall ever knew told him not to make Garrosh warchief.
---
And Sylvanas ignored his instructions because he sent the Forsaken on a suicide mission against Gilneas hoping to wipe them out if they didn't use the plague.
---
It's the best on paper but negligible when you realise you won't be in absolute bis(for every encounter) anyway, but I am also PvP oriented too which gives me a bias I suppose.
---
Yeah, you did fuck up. Did you not bother reading any info before you tr- oh, we're on Reddit, carry on
---
I have no friends playing with me so far so I did. Haven’t officially decided on what server I’m gonna play on.
---
Yeah they announced it early for us just to let us know it's coming before the Nost hype died too much and the private server players lost hope.
---
For the average player coming back or trying it, this is the perfect time to advertise it.
---
Uh ... are you high ? ^^
---
Majordomo!
---
Where did you see this? That's the server I created my characters on so I'm concerned now lol
---
I play on Turtle WoW due to them having a slower atmosphere, so it helps me plan out without too much interference
---
As someone who [got it on my druid](https://imgur.com/a/Y2W1L5e) just because i had nothing better to spend gold on it will cost you around 15k gold to make if not more depending on prices.
---
The main cost is the ingots, unless your guild gets really lucky with drops you will have to buy them off the ah or other guild banks and they usually go for around 1k each.
---
The weapon itself is very bad and only good for showing off that you have alot of money or your guild likes to pamper you. Paladins, Warriors and Shamans gets way better twohanders from raids for both pve and pvp and the proc does not work in druid froms so its extra bad for druids.
---
This is how every niche vanilla question is answered. 
---
Yes.  No.  Don't remember.  I swear it was like that but I could be wrong.  We'll have to see in classic.
---
Nah dm is dire maul. Period.
---
Thats a really good answer, thank you for your response : )
---
Ooh please!!
---
I was not really hyped until about a couple weeks ago, now I'm already planning how to spend my time. Now I just need to decide on PVE or PVP.
---
Because saying anything pro ally means downvotes here, while shitting on ally means upvotes. As much useless reddit karma is, people do not wish for free downvotes.
---
I mean sure, in the same way the the United Kingdom has existed for 50 or more years.
---
Oh, is that what you Priests are doing while raising your "Wand skill"?
---
Im not worried about a Que all my friends are there and we plan to stay. Im just wondering if im looking in the ballpark of 30 minutes or 3 hours
---
I miss the expected queue times in the schedule... ...
---
Meh, for Strat and Scholo just die outside the gate and res inside it
---
This reply should have started with "Ackchyually..."
---
Tuk is the linux. you build it yourself.
---
Elv is the windows 10 experience that just ask 8 questions for a basic layout. it's still fully customizable but most wont do more than the basic setup.
---
Alternatively you enter a relationship with someone who shares interests with you that you spend a lot of time on, like gaming, and do those together/separately in the same room. "Sitting at your pc all night" isn't necessarily an anti-social experience and I think your presumptuous boomer-like logic just goes to show that maybe people aren't actually in relationships that combine well with who they are as a person.
---
At 1:46, we can hear you press your mouse button after you finish your sentence...
---
there isn't a conversation here to be had.   
---
people have already called your post out on spreading misinformation and 75% of comments are people telling you that you're wrong.   
---
it really should speak for itself
---
What are "savings"?
---
&gt; Bfa had no real problems.
---
So you had some lag? some unable to loot items?  some quests not working because too many people playing?  some items not being able to be auctioned or purchased? some sharding moving you to a new place in the middle of a pve and pvp fights?  my guild had all these problems between 8pm-1230 am each night for the first 8-9 days of launch.
---
Can't imagine how much I would have gotten if I had sold my account back then.
---
TL;DR - Cooler Ranch Doritos, Monster Energy drinks, an occasional Cosmic Brownie.
---
Dang. That’s slightly annoying. I’m for sure gonna use questie then. Just purely for the knowledge of where quests are and what level I need to be.
---
Yeah, a casual or new player learning about it 6 months ago wouldn't have cared. Now that it's only a couple weeks away, they might be a little more excited to try it out.
---
Fairbanks
---
If you like you can head off around level 18 to Redridge, or grind to 20 and go Redridge/Duskwood, or straight to Ashenvale. Rotate through Redridge, Ashenvale and Duskwood and do the lower level quests, then you can head to the Wetlands. Once you are into your mid 20’s you can go back to those three areas to do the higher level quests.
---
Lol played in vanilla. Everyone said dm for dire maul. The o ly confused look is on my face when I read your post.
---
Weave a melee hit between two autoshots, either by running in and out on the same mob, or meleeing a mob in melee range+shooting another mob farther away. 
---
The issue was that meleeing would cause a delay on your next autoshot until the melee swing timer was reset. It has recently been fixed.
---
Is this norwegian community a guild or an open community?
---
i wan to play tank warrior..
---
normally i love to play  gnome but the agro in classic and +1 swords is something i am not sure i want to pass on.
---
Even if gnome looks dope
---
Slow leveling. Enjoy the journey.   
---
No auto-questing (get ready to read to know where to go).   
---
No LFG ui (you'll have to join the lfg channel and search in cities, then run to the dungeon).   
---
The best world pvp. Town raids, hillsbrad, STV roaming.
---
Exactly ;)
---
Leveling daggers is a waste of time, combat daggers at 60 is perfectly fine. You could go into MC with Barman Shanker and do well.
---
You can actually re order your character list this time around.
---
Both are solid. Mages won't dominate PvP till geared, but I think you'll have a slightly easier time finding groups for dungeons and raids for the ability to make water and port.
---
They're very different playstyles though, so you should make the choice on how you like to play. Rogues are very positional and timing based, especially in PvP. You can usually stun lock casters from 100-0 health if you time things right. Mage is a kite machine, and is more about keeping the other player in bad positions
---
That video was a bigger joke than you on private servers and that says a lot
---
It’s only aoe threat, damage is only to the main target.
---
&gt;Seth Rohan plays wow?
---
James Franco: Gondor calls for aid!
---
My holy/disc priest skipped it when leveling in a duo with rogue. 
---
Made it to level 20 before I noticed I was still carrying around starting water, cause I had never drank any.
---
by 40 the only time I had ever drank was healing in dungeons.  
---
I made having good wands a priority, so it meant natural regen was plenty.
---
The poop knife is if you ran out of football socks while levelling and it's a bit long for a standard sock, trim the line and grab another sock.
---
everyone
---
Dont play
---
I want to say I reached rank 14 back in the day.   
---
But I can't.  
---
Because I didn't.
---
\[The chryo begins to loosen.\]
---
I know, but try to imagine that servers were only spanish, and you guys were forced to play in these servers, because there are no more.
---
How would you feel if all spanish comunity were talking shit about you comming to play with us? I mean it would not be your fault, because there is no other option.
---
If it is hard to read a chat for you, who are going to be 90% of server pop, do you think is better for that 10% of spanish pop?
---
Just give it a try and we'll see. If it's so catastrophic, maybe blizzard will open spanish servers.
---
100% True Jedi
---
Yeaahhhh. Fuck that. I’m not spending 2+ hours on a UI
---
You can take enchanting and also chase a wand from someone else. The earlier the better
---
Mother of god. It’s become a verb
---
True. To be honest I probably would have dropped the price pretty quickly. I would have been really happy with just enough gold for one month of game time. Oh well!
---
I looted it on my Troll Rogue when i was level 58(?). Sold it for 500g and bought epic mount instant on level 60 =)
---
You're part of the crew steering the ship. I love how you're downvoting me every time you respond despite the fact that I'm asking for civility. Top tier douche who wants to keep the status quo on today's meme/apathic community eh?
---
If you buy on craigslist or equivalent you’ll get more bang for your buck. Hell, you can even buy a used gaming desktop with that budget.
---
I honestly can picture the q on Herod being somewhere around 8 hours. I wouldn't be surprised. Everything is speculation at this point. 
---
I've never had a smooth release for any of blizzards games so I am rather pessimistic.
---
If I'm ganked while levelling I'll return the favor when I'm max level. The cycle continues...
---
Maybe the post wasn’t meant for you then *thinking*
---
Is that an insane Dr Manhattan in that vid?
---
Hope you have an awesome time with your friends 💜
---
Yeh I caught that too once it was uploaded, I'll keep an ear out for my future vids
---
And this is why you're banned from the sub.
---
I don't really think so... like the memes run rampant in the discord.... but I'm not going to lead raids like White Goodman.
---
We can't really pierce through the narrative until the game comes out and everything speaks for itself.
---
Blizzard and Retail players are being dragged along begrudgingly. All of the crticisms of retail always fall on deaf ears and good point are always swiped away with arguments like "it's just nostalgia", "this isn't how you make a profit with an MMO", etc., etc.
---
What happens over the next year with classic will decide how this argument finally plays out. Can we snap people out of their damn delusion with cold hard engagement? That's what remains to be seen.
---
J. Allen Brack says that it's exceeded expectations so far? They've seen nothing yet. I'm going to play this game until I'm fucking dead in my chair.
---
I took skinning for the stress test and it made me some decent silver from vending for the first few hours. Lots of animals laying around to skin. Free money.
---
You can already do that. And there are very simple add-ons for bag organization.
---
Basically this. I was able to get Iris on Herod and Faerlina Monday afternoon. I didn’t know about this new server last night, saw it this morning. Iris is already taken on Stalagg so I’m not too keen on switching now :/
---
They already are.  Even blizzard asked people to move.  That means the server was beyond even layering capacity by it's design.  It won't take long for people to recreate when they log into a 35k strong queue that doesn't move nearly as quickly as the login server que did.  
---
Your talking hours per slot opening, instead of minutes to create a char and log out.  The queue will literally move 10,000% slower than the name reservation queue.
---
Then there is the risk of layering being extended on Herod due to server pop post phase 1.  Though unlikely, we don't know Blizzards plan, this might become reality.
---
Whats wrong with you. Its not "shit information". I clearly stated everything anyone needs to know, and also i dont expect anyone to follow reddit comments blindly. He can make his decision himself. From auberdine to if is under 15 minutes so its under half an hour back and forth and thats without hearthing. You are giving wrong information here.
---
The only part I enjoyed was the centaur questline. I thought it was so cool that they gave you a choice and the choice mattered. The zone itself looks like garbage imo
---
I think people forget that the ranks are bell curved. The first few rank 14 will be the easiest, with an increasing difficulty curve for all those that come later.

Until the top guilds put Nax on farm that is.... then they can roflstomp BGs. Assuming of course that everything works like it did back in the day.

It's funny how private WoW servers and anyone playing on them have been shunned and looked down upon in the past, yet without them and those same gamers who are a small minority compared to retai playersl yet kept the spirit alive to this day, it's doubtful to say the least that an official vanilla WoW would exist today.
---
People are just blowing it out of proportion, as usual.
---
If it's linear to most other games, we are only looking at about 15-30% of players actually going to play being subbed already... possibly less
---
The vast majority of my old school friends in vanilla didn't even know it was a thing when I reached out to them.  Nearly everyone I talked to has decided to come back.
---
The game hasen't even released yet, and blizzard is being forced to make new servers.  That writing is on the wall.
---
&gt;	I’m better than giving Blizzard money than you are
---
It's been a looong time since my early days playing a night elf in vanilla, but I when first looked at this I thought of only two things it could be: a.) either that one outpost in Ashenvale where you're likely to meet your first horde/alliance encounter; or b.) that Den in Teldrassil with all those furbolgs or whatever inside that gives you PTSD.
---
I was in your old gf's shoes. Back in vanilla my bf ignored me and his family for WoW. He quit college for WoW. At the time I didn't have enough self respect to leave him, so what did I do? I joined him! I stopped going to classes to be on WoW as much as possible. We would stay up all night and most of the day playing. Ignored most social functions because they got in the way. He still continued to ignore me outside of the game in many ways but thats a different story. After we broke up in 2006 (finally got tired of being ignored when someone else gave me attention) I was still addicted to the game after moving back to my parents. Id call in sick from work for as many days in a row that I could fake a flu. Eventually over the years I detached because the game lost its pre BC wonderment for me. Now I am a mid-30s mom of 2 and a wife. I am getting my 11 year old into WoW a little so that we have something to play together. I am almost worried I may be putting my son on the wrong path. Anyways, I am super excited for to play Classic and hoping I don't become obsessed again and start ignoring my husband lol.
---
Graphical improvements and more customization options.
---
Its the other way around tbh, the swedish guild in nordicclassic.jinnis.se are moving but in all polls ive seen for "regular players" outside of these guilds shazzrah is still in the majority. even on the fb page run by the same people that are behind the coalition project had more people answering shazzrah.
---

No friends playing Classic WoW?

Maybe not, but neither is OP's example..?
---
It literally destroys the game, I'm only willing to accept it for a short time due to starter zones being too full; I'd prefer it was only level 1-10 zones really - I'll defo stop playing

I hope more people do stuff like this! I started a playlist as well, good start for yours! lol

Play a shaman. Be an ele Resto hybrid. You’re good support. Can provide excellent heals and excellent damage. Although your mobility is rather weak. You won’t be running around healing everyone Nd rooting/cc like a Druid but you’ll be very useful for bringing strong heals and damage.
---
Not every server had a cheat system.
---
A warlock got Grand Marshal the same week as me on Executus, and I didn't even know they existed. There was at least two other teams (one Horde, one Alliance) also competing for R14.
---
Off topic: why would having two R14s on the same week be an issue? Isn't that just more efficient?
---
Some truths are hard, and this is one of them.
---
Stop this "Nordic" nonsense garbage. 95% of the guilds on the website are Swedish.
---
Also they took the decision to roll on Gehennas without the other guilds agreeing to it. They just put their foot down and said fuck everyone else.
---
Wanna trade friends? I miss IF already...
---
But hell yeah on alts, Also maybe for leveling war... they need all the help they can get
---
Probably. I'll provide look for or join a raiding guild that starts earlier in the evening, 5 or 6 pm est.
---
You know, I think that's why people are looking forward to classic
---
you aren't the savior of azeroth, hero of thousands of battles and slayer of titans, old gods and other meanies

you're just a dude. Now kill some boars.
---
Alright, thanks for the info!
---
I play both alliance and horde on retail, but always had my horde characters as my main. I'm changing to alliance because I played horde in vanilla, and also so I can play a paladin. If tauren could be pallies, and dwarves could be shamans, I'd just stay horde honestly. The only good thing that alliance has going in for it is humans and night elves, the horde races seem more interesting to be honest.
---
6 pm EDT happens when this comment is 7 hours and 57 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/zV6S4kFjm
---
I would like them to keep classic servers and then copy your toon over to a bc server and then same for wrath and be done there. That way everyone can play the game up to when most people quit and then stay on whatever expac they enjoy most.
---
St Louis here, with others coming along as well.  Rolling on Stalag most likely.  Originally Herod, but the writings on the wall for that server.  We are hoping Stalag shows shorter quest, but new influx will still slap us with them later.
---
My wife doesnt like the combat but she will be fishing and herbing for me while I'm at work :)
---
Hopefully not
---
Right, but compared to the Classic Winterspring grind, it's a breeze.
---
I used to raid and PvP in SM/ruin build as a lock.  That was ok. Mm, those instant shadowbolt crits.
---
How so?
---
Also they're already saying Q times will be significantly high on Herod in today's blue post:
---
&gt;Due to very high demand, we will open a new WoW Classic realm for name reservations at 5:00 p.m PDT (8:00 p.m. EDT) today, Wednesday, August 14:
---
&gt;Stalagg – PvP – Eastern Time
---
&gt;We suggest that players, especially those on the Herod realm, consider creating characters on Stalagg. We expect that other PvP realms in this region will otherwise experience significant login queues when Classic launches.
---
&gt;Thank you!
---
So if you plan to play week of launch, I would suggest jumping to this new realm. I am highly considering doing so myself.
---
Wouldn't that require you to look away from the monitor though?
---
An unacceptable level of distraction.
---
I think TBC is honestly my ideal version of nostalgic wow aside from flying.
---
I created one but auto mod deleted it. I sent the mods a message asking them to post it though.
---
My bad, I thought you were the person before asking me the same question again &gt;&lt; 
---
My fault that time. We all need to get along in this world... The world or warcraft!
---
Is any racial really enough to justify spending 240 hours on the road to 60 looking fucking *smol*?
---
Yes, everyone made sure to establish Deadmines as VC, in anticipation of another dungeon to be released 4 (US) or 1 (EU) month after release which may also be abbreviated with DM. We all came from the future to play WoW.
---
This is the most br thing ever. "Claim" a server, thus ruining it for any non-br and then roll Faerlina anyway.
---
I can be your HE-ROD baby !
---
Yeah, I agree, a reason why leveling a warrior will be disheartening to new players. I'm not going for fastest anything so if someone wants to be a dick I'll just log off if I'm not an even match!
---
You just get a few friends, drop some sappers and then drop the streamer and all his special followers.
---
You will likely use addons and macros a fair amount if you make it to end game.
---
Addons: these typically change the user interface in some way. Say you dont like the mini map. Well you can change it with an addon. Make it bigger, move its location etc.
---
Macros: these perform an action you have decided. I use this one as a rogue on a lot of abilities.
---
/startattack
---
/cast sinister strike
---
I use this for two reasons. First if I have no target it picks the closest target to me. Second, even if I dont have enough energy to cast sinister strike I get my auto attack going.
---
Scripts: I'll be honest I dont know the full power/limitations of scripts. But here is an example of one I used pretty frequently for a while.
---
I was farming lock boxes for rep with ravenholdt. I would pick pocket tons of mobs. I would get lock boxes, health potions, food, and junk items. The lock boxes are all unique so they take up a lot of bag space. Space that those other items would also take up. I had a script that would delete every item except the lock boxes out of my inventory. It automated all the are you sure boxes and everything. Just a click of that script and everything was gone.
---
I would argue that you likely dont need any of this stuff on your way to 60 for the first time. But it wouldn't hurt to dabble it either. Good luck!
---
You should get a bidet attachment for your toilet. Wiping is a big exp waste.
---
I agree with most of what you said and I believe that Classic will have more success than BFA and it would already be a big big achievement and message to Blizzard.
---
It will just not reach the height of Vanilla and become the cultural phenomenon it was. (but it's not like the game has to to do that to be a success)
---
No, I meant that 100 kills is exaggerated to make gold farming seem favourable.
---
No, they won't. WoW has always had a problem with people from certain countries refusing to speak English and forming insular communities on servers. Though Sweden isn't usually one of those.
---
If the proportion of members of some non-English speaking community reaches a certain threshold, the server stops being English speaking and becomes non-English.
---
I definitely had a lot of World of Warcraft themed dreams during my push to R14... :|
---
I haven’t talked to anyone I played with back in the day for years. And all my friends nowadays aren’t really gamers.
---
dun morogh 2
---
People simply don't understand how MMO launches work, much less most likely how Classic will play out.
---
The first batch of servers were all filled up. People got their names, entire guilds locked in place. To risk moving or telling 40 people to do it again is just not a thing. This means most people on Herod will STAY on Herod. Stalagg is LITERALLY a, "Well, here you go" server. Very few established guilds will go there because.. well... they already picked. Look at the Server Creation screen: Stalagg is still Low last I checked and Herod is still Full.
---
This only gets worse on Launch day when everyone else can play. They're going to see Herod, Fairbanks, and Whitemane as Full. Stalagg as Low/Medium. Why would anyone go there and risk an empty server *especially* when 50% of the population is probably going to quit before hitting 40?
---
I wish people on Stalagg the best but the delusional thoughts that it'll be as full as Herod are simply untrue.
---
I think this'll be a fantastic addon. 
---
* It doesn't really undermine the AH, because the AH can host your shit while you're away, meaning the AH will still be used. 
---
* It adds an RP element. 
---
* And it gives you a reason to be AFK in the cities more often. I.e. cities could remain more lively throughout the day.
---
While I’m rolling PvE I’ll give you my take: PvP adds another dynamic to the game. On PvE servers gearing is very cut-and-dry, no real chance of interesting things happening while leveling and less of a need to team up in the world.
---
On a PvP server not only do you have the threat of mobs, you also have to take enemy players into account. There’s more variety in talent specs, items that would never be used on a PvE server suddenly has a use despite not being optimal in instances. Yes PvP will happen on a PvE server but not to the same extent and I reckon most people wouldn’t even bother joining because there’s no real reason. On PvP servers you’re forced to either join the PvP or go away, which means you have to respect it.
---
I don’t remember flying really ruining the game for me like it did later in the series. It seemed like there was enough pvp events and things to do on the ground and iirc mount time was longer so it was harder to run right after you res.
---
But this is exactly why they created layering. Otherwise, what's the point of it?
---
Rejuv is outhealing the wand but that's it.
---
Stalagg 2 - Electric Buggaloo
---
How many times do i have to watch it now?
---
So I guess JAB was wrong this whole time
---
Lots of Swedes left on Shazzrah though!
---
Oh no, the 4channers? I created my characters on Whitemane. What does this mean for me?
---
What're you buyin' stranger?
---
Show us the Video! :)
---
What's the advantage of pfquest over Questie?  I'm basically just looking of an accurate questing add on that tells me where all quests are available (including ones that start from items drops)
---
It’s kinda hard to explain, but I played the last stress test on max and have been playing BFA the past month, and their graphics look distinctly unique from one another. Maybe it’s all the polygons, maybe it’s the character models.. but what really feels different is the camera. 
---
For some reason, the camera feels much more “set” behind your character and closer (even after increasing the max zoom out distance. I’m not sure if it’s just me, but you definitely won’t get confused about which game you’re playing based on graphics if you boost them up. 
---
Classic looks good, though.
---
Herod was full in a few hours because it was basically the only east pvp server. 
---
I actually can’t believe you exist. Use your brain mate. I hope you realize that the people who paid to early reserve a name is tiny compared to total population. There’s gonna be hundreds of thousands of more people subscribing over next two weeks. Stalagg will be full. So will the next server they open up. It’s not gonna be a 4-6 server game. They need to and will add more servers.
---
FWIW the massive spike seems to be more Wrath than release, but you're right
---
classic wow doesnt have default cast bars, the addon is called ClassicCastbars I believe.
---
Breakfast ramen? Absolutely barbaric
---
I disagree. I think itll be the opposite. After spending sometime on a private server for the first time ever a few months back, Just to get a refreshment in what vanilla was like, I played 15 hours straight without realizing it. And in turn, I remembered why I fell in love with world of warcraft all those years ago.
---
Best: Teldrassil  
---
Why: Enchanted envoirment, lore, music.  
---
Worst: Durotar  
---
Why: Feels so plain.
---
Thanks, appreciate it.
---
It has been predicted from the dawn of times.
---
Only thing to kill WoW, was WoW himself.
---
Classic WoW will annihilate Retail WoW on 27th of August, see it as an implosion ;)
---
Managed to accidentally get two Grand Marshals on the week I earned it.
---
Myself and a warlock I'd never heard of, only realised he also got it when I saw him in the PvP hall also buying his weapons after the reset.
---
Only 1 warlock was required to share blood pack with the tank.
---
&gt; People will be speaking English on these realms.
---
Yes and no, people will speak other language then english, just as they do on live servers atm.
---
People are worried there be like 90% spanish on a realm, that would make it hard getting a guild (if the spanish is speaking spanish) etc.
---
But there is not 90% spanish so its no problem, i guess people just have a preference of playing with some specific nationalities.
---
Yea but Fairbanks is West Coast. East Coast servers are kinda limited since one has the BR zerg and another has all the streamers.
---
They don’t have to use bots when they have people willing to hand-farm gold in order to feed their families.
---
Resources like Devilsaur leather will be camped by zergs of Chinese parties and with layer-hopping they’ll be able to farm them with ease. Instances like this have occurred in MMOs for decades and there really isn’t a way to stop it.
---
Well, if a mod decides that it's a duplicate, let it be so.
---
Estonia is not set on Gehennas, or any other server for that matter. Final decision will be made days before launch.
---
Back then, at least in my guild, every Warlock was on imp duty in either tank or melee group.
---
Dude yeah this leads into tons of qol issues so gonna have to say no.
---
This is not a valid argument to OPs request at all.
---
You act like it's a slippery slope, it ain't mate.
---
I played an undead mage at launch in 2004.  It's a fun class, your biggest issue is you're forced into Frost spec to do Molten Core because every mob resists fire.  PvP on the other hand you usually go Arcane/Fire so you'll either have to pick what you want to do at Endgame or pay lots of gold to keep switching specs.
---
It is a very versatile class though.  Great DPS, great CC, solo and group ports to every major city.  You'll also be a water/food vendor for your guild for raids.
---
I would not waste a debuff slot on immolation trap.
---
Question, does this factor in Seal twisting as well?
---
Hey where can I get the free epics for doing nothing? Is it too much to ask?
---
60 after probably 5 days. Hopefully fully geared a week in with BIS gear
---
Or Tips
---
Give all the people that never wanted layering exactly what they always asked for.
---
Maybe 30
---
Get a laptop, don't miss anythign about the trip - see the sights eat the foods have fun Bali is amazing - and then when everyone else goes to sleep you don't! If you are playing on an east coast server you are literally on the opposite side of the world with a 12 hour difference - if queues turn out to be a big issue (I don't think they will but IF) you won't be suffering like the rest of us.
---
I'm using internet rule #17 and assuming you're in the US...
---
That’s what this one does
---
Teleport isn't super spammable, other classes can catch up unless you CC them.
---
I feel like if they were to implement new classes the only way it would be fair is to "demake" them to fit 2006 class balance philosophy. So if they add monk, then the specs have to be revamped so that almost all abilities are baseline. Then take mobility abilities like roll and put them on longer cooldowns. Then you gut brewmaster so that it can't tank raid content without being overgeared, and tune windwalker down until its DPS is noticeably sub-par. Then put some raid-critical debuff deep in the windwalker tree  so that you have to bring one anyway.  All the tier gear is itemized for Mistwalker and the first tier isn't even good.
---
Layering side effect is that helps with go live.
---
The point of layering is that they don't have to open 200 servers on day 1, and then merge away 100 of those servers 2 months later.
---
I hope to one day rediscover the zone between my wife's thighs, but until then... LETS GO BOIS!!!! FLING AROUND THOSE BIG D's!!!!
---
I'd be interested in a source for that, because I've heard the opposite: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-character-transfer-between-accounts/253429/4

So like... Did you run every single Dire Maul wing every time you got enough people by spamming LFM DM?
---
I was going to get an R3, I’m so glad I went with a bigger bike. I probably would have been kicking myself if I got the R3.
---
It's not about  what is hard, just basic QoL. It's a massive time investment  for someone or people to sort that kind of thing.
---
FYI a new Shazzrah discord has been made with hopefully better moderation team that are actively banning racism, porn etc.

Last week this sub only had 170K ....

I think you over estimate how many people use reddit... 
---
I read somewhere that resubs to wow when people though they would get beta access went up by like 1 million.
---
Nice, now do one for Thunderfury and Atiesh.
---
How about the fact that before Guild Banks, account sharing between guild mates was rampant?

Not sure if anybody has pointed this out but I can hear clicking on the video, probably when you click to stop recording voice.

God I’m on vacation now and i cant stop thinking about this damn game from 2004. Its insane how an old game like this can make my gaming feeling tingle again ehehe. Love it
---
Swtor was dope. I got the collector’s edition too. 
---
They just kinda ruined it over time, imo. Changing up companions, giving you advanced classes at level 1, adjusting the flashpoints so you don’t even need a group.. it all just lessened my interest as time went on.
---
60 on main char and 35 on alt.
---
You can tank dungeons in DPS spec, shouldn't be a problem :) and if you have to respec once in a while, grinding the money for the respec will take you less time than having to level to 60 on another character.
---
What is that head piece?
---
stacked with melee is a big exaggeration. Probably roughly 4 melee (2 warriors + 2 rogues) per run, and one of those warriors is probably gonna be prot (prot wars chasing draconian deflector and gyth's skull of \_\_\_). If anyone has either half of the sword set the competition is greatly reduced for that piece. Are you gonna get it in 2 runs? Of course not. Maybe 30 runs in a worst case, where you are running with randoms every time.
---
I stacked armor on my first toon because the tooltip said it reduced damage, and I was sick of dying so much.
---
I was a hunter.
---
Ah, to be naive again...
---
I'm impressed it's still a thing.
---
I expect to be about level 20 (ish).
---
Thanks man, I'll think about it!
---
Level 60 with 300 Alchemy
---
Like what
---
As we say in Missouri 
---
Never again Missouri
---
Not that I don't believe you but do you have a source?
---
Hunters too, warrior tank, rogue or two in the group, maybe a second Hunter... Seeing this sword and winning the roll is difficult
---
Someone mentioned CCwatch as a viable addon for this
---
M’Lady
---
The starer zones are still like that... The undead zones are literally you just doing quests for people and helping deal with the remnants of the scarlet crusade.
---
No, the glow existed in Vanilla. Was added along with Dire Maul, I think. The glow was actually way stronger when first added and got toned down a little during Vanilla.
---
I have zero clue why all the private server people are used to it being off.
---
It’s 100% a shaman. No other troll starts with a mace and shield.
---
Yeah it's harder when cooking for more people. Even gennaro uses  butter in some videos with carbonara. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to improvise.
---
I agree with you.  Guild banks were a tremendous QOL improvement and eliminated the need to have multiple bank alts (possibly on multiple different office accounts) holding hoards of valuable material.  Ninja was much easier.  Guild bank also had BUILT IN functionality that now people are bragging about doing on their own like tracking all deposits/withdrawals or holding a literal deposit of guild gold.  
---
Guild Bank is a sensible change, everyone.
---
Agreed but there isnt much shit like this in vanilla it was mostly in retail after cata. At least from what I remember. Jagex does it way worse the shit they do pisses me off.
---
I think RPPVP servers are more for Horde v Alliance and "hero" RP, not fucking in goldshire although im sure there will be plenty of that as well lol.
---
You escalated  that real quick.
---
How do you get from someone wanting guild banks because they're a more secure way to do something you can already do, to suggesting they want free epics for nothing?
---
Just before you auto-shot. Auto-shot doesn't affect GCD, so you can pop and shoot immediately.
---
Yes once I hit R14 I laid siege to the Crossroads for several days and was Rank 1 the following week. 
---
Busted my way back to Private, just like my man Zim.
---
People sleep on untamed blade but it can hold its own very well. I used to pvp with a fury spec.. was very reasonable to see 3k+ crits with it. Its also the best looking sword so theres that :D
---
25-30 since lots of ppl doing same quests as you and respawns are slow
---
An alternative is to just buy some speed. Not only will it help you level but it will completely reduce your appetite; no meal-prep necessary.
---
Cringy, sure. But fake? Nah
---
It won’t be full, but since the other servers are “claimed” this will probably be a popular fallback for whichever faction starts losing control of Herod.  
---
Stalagg will be a long term solution. A lot of people are ok with medium populations. Not everyone wants to be swimming in a sea of people when they’re trying to quest or farm.
---

---
I played horde and wanted a guaranteed spot come BC, so I rerolled to pally. I leveled as Prot with a flurry axe, lifesteal on a weapon, and a shield spike.
---
No I’m looking forward to WoW Classic because of talent trees and no longer missing 90% of my warlock spells.
---
Female trolls would like to have a word with you
---
The thing is you never know if it will be your turn to have this super random occurrence this time gearing up. 
---
I play tank, therefore I always reserve one item that I need and I get my groups just fine. 
---
But I wouldn't run UBRS jed/rend runs past truestrike shoulders if was a rogue or fury warrior, because going for the swords can just be an incredible waste of time. You may luck out and get both weps in 2 runs or you may not and "waste" time, because every time you do this run for half an hour you could've farmed another 25-35g in a secure and safe way. 
---
If you don't get the swords in 10hours of farming UBRS (20 runs, probably less because of the traveling there, waiting for key service etc.), you could already buy a sword of zeal or a cheap Krol.
---
Farming the swords outside a guild group is rarely worth it.
---

I remember looting a world drop epic while leveling. I spammed trade until I got a buyer, he told me to COD it to him and I didn't know how it worked. So i ended up sending it to him without the COD selected. So i ofc never saw a copper from that Axe. sad times
---
I mean this is a blue post, I don't see a more clearcut answer being given, especially by another blue that's directly contradictory. Just wouldn't make sense.
---
That said, it ofc is possible, but I'd say this is the best source  and most likely scenario.
---
Pros: More space for guild stuff so you don't have to have an army of lvl 1 alts to hold guild resources. Better accountability for guild resources since the entire guild can see when anyone takes from the bank; won't prevent a salty officer from emptying the bank, but will advertise that fact.
---
Cons: lvl 1 bank toons with guild banks....makes gold farming easier?
---
thing about druids is that although they're hard to kill, they're very slow to kill. Sometimes you just wanna bust in, gank, and gtfo
---
I said they would impact the economy, not that it was the exact same.
---
They *will* impact the economy.  People will farm items for them instead of selling them for profits for themselves.  People will buy other things for them, to help them complete hard crafting objectives for example.
---
They *will* have a massive economic impact and if you don't realize that you're naive.

I'd prefer better graphics all over. The graphics are not the nostalgia for me. It's everything else. I'd be happy with new models or even an entire update to all the models that exist. Provided they didn't impact the gameplay beyond offering better visual cue's, I'm happy.
---
Would love some of the new spell effects and critter/pet/demon models etc.
---
Yeah...
---
Pretty shit personality on display there, plus I think it's totally valid to not wanna pay $15/month ($180/year) on a game that's 15 years old at this point.
---
Hopefully 30; wont take time off from work, but Will play the whoooole weekend after launch.
---
Warrior,  two hunters and two rogues sounds like an excellent group composition.
---
Yeah 2 years of development by a separate team at Blizzard to release a game WITHOUT ANY microtransactions for free is a pipe dream my boi. Those private servers you're playing on also have to make money and are only free for the people requiring no support, or needing absolutely no in game services.
---
They will never admit that classic is more popular than retail , even with almost no marketing.
---
Javisst min grabb!

Hi, /u/Nmagane

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqqhz8/can_you_disable_the_clock_under_minimap/).

My first toon was a hunter, I was around level 30 before I realized I could use my pet's attack to send him in first, and let him get initial aggro, and then use my shots, so I didn't have to eat to full between every kill.
---
Was a brand new game after that
---
How many marriages do we think this game will end this time around?
---
This definitely ruins class identity if you can switch specs willy nilly. Imo, dual spec is very anti-vanilla. The feature is already there if you're willing enough and if you're not or can't afford it then it adds that extra dynamic to the game of having to figure out how to live with and own your main spec.
---
The resistance gear you got into the Ironforge bank
---
Aiming for the 40s week 1, hopefully with fishing/cooking + skinning/tailoring in a decent state. Taking a full week off from work + the weekend.
---
Ideally i want to be in between cinematic pre render and ingame pre render
---
It interferes with awareness. thats the main problem
---
Blizzard has no reason to announce something controversial right now. A Guild Bank isn’t even really required until Phase 4 or 5. I am almost confident that by the time those phases roll around, Blizzard will announce a stripped down version of the Guild Bank for Classic to combat account sharing. No gold collection, no repair via guild funds, just a few bank tabs with permission settings at various guild ranks.
---
People play MMOs in different ways. 
---
WoW is an amusement park MMO.
---
More people than you think quit after capping a character and finishing the story arc, especially in retail where you don't even have to interact with people to complete group content.
---
Big Regret: Becoming somewhat bitter about my guildmates wanting to merge my guild (I was GM) with another large guild for raiding progression purposes in early 2005. I joined with them but didn't bother raiding with them much and essentially stuck my butt into World PvP and Battlegrounds, meaning I missed a lot of later stage PvE/Raid content. The great news is I reconnected with a bunch of them on Monday and we are all rolling Whitemane and I plan on rectifying this regret.
---
Small Regret: Being way too frivolous with my gold. I am going to play the AH more and save my gold a lot more this time around.
---
Shazzrah confirmed dutch server
---
I saw one in Thunder Bluff, so I think they will be available, likely at launch.
---
This like... isn’t even good reasons. Honestly just kinda racist. This guy definitely supports trump.
---
Either would be a great choice for a casual PvP class. Not as gear dependent as warriors, warlocks, or hybrid DPS. They both have CC and utility that can allow them to survive decently even when they're running around with 3-4k HP. Rogues are probably superior for world PvP, mages are definitely more useful in BGs.
---
No. All realms are going to be awful come launch day, but Herod has a good amount of pserver and hardcore players rolling on it. Due to this, you’ll have higher retention rates than all other servers that leads to overpopulation and layering for a long time.
---
Mushroom lives outside of this silly, cyclical balancing act.
---
Or they farm it for him, you can't even get to the nodes.
---
I never said negative impact, just that they'd have a large impact.  We're playing classic for that classic feel.  This taints that.
---
I'll bite off yer kneecaps! I came here to drink beer and cap LM, looks like I'm all out of beer!
---
But the Golemagg discord is fucking cringe. So Shazzrah it is.
---
Is this guy teaching us how to breath?
---
No. It’s night and day between the two.
---
I mean the trend literally started at name creation so yes it is pretty new.
---
I was in a guild run for LBRS. Robe of the Archmage Pattern dropped. I was sure that we had more Mages in the raid, and clicked Greed. Turns out I was the only Mage, and some Paladin won it. 
---
It dropped for me again in the next run though xP
---
There was also this time where I was with a friend, and we were following a Hunter on his epic Bow quest, making sure that no Hordes will mess with him. So he found that demon and started to fight it...being a noob, I was trying to help him, which caused the demon to disappear. "Thanks a lot" were the only words I can remember from that scenario.

Hi, I'm spellweaver's turban and my friends briarwood reed, band of rumination and dragonrider boots would like to chat with you.
---
It's a retail orc.
---
I'm.. sorry.. lol.
---
Untamed Blade is another underappreciated 2H, the 300str (600ap) proc is ridiculusly good.
---
Me and my friend group had decided but are now thinking of switching considering our decision is only cemented by a couple level 1 characters and switching would be trivial.
---
everyone knows dogz is a shit guild xd
---
I was so pumped for this to play with my wife but then I seen the price of subscription ;( big rip. We can maybe play an hour or two a week if that so there's no way I'm paying that kinda money to play a game.
---
I just got an ASUS ROG laptop from best buy for 950.  Ryzen 7 CPU, GTX 1660 TI, and 500 gig SSD.  
---
Look for Dell G3, G5, G7 , ROG, ETC. on amazon with the keyword renewed you will find something with some good specs for cheap....  
---
Or go to newegg and get some ram, a ssd, and new graphics card for your latptop
---
You all deserve my upvote
---
Use Clique and the Blizzard Raid Frames, works better anyway.
---
All joking aside this is seriously important for you health. It's one of the reasons people working in busy offices get frequent headaches.
---
Love this idea. I will totally get this add-on when I start playing.
---
Both old and new male models suck, lol. I'm gonna play human female anyways.
---
Duly noted.
---
Yea just because some coalitions move to 1 server doesnt mean that countrys playerbase is only playing there.
---
All 3 realms wil lbe full.. all 3 realms will have a large mixture of nationalities.
---
ITs getting out of hand
---
Find what you’re looking for amongst the dead?
---
Biggest mistake was rolling warrior for my first character before I knew what I was doing and getting fucking stuffed lol
---
That being said, of all the times to finally get a live-in girlfriend...
---
Interesting; I have heard the contrary as well as the same, and another report that seal twisting doesn't work at all. In a blue post it was confirmed to be an intentional thing/ creative use due to spell batching.
---
Seal twisting would make it so some weapon procs, like Nightfall, have the highest uptime. If you're suggesting Nightfall as BiS anyways, it doesn't affect gearing. Or it could, it just needs more theorycrafting?
---
Ultimately it requires some testing to flesh out more, just curious if you've done extensive testing or even considered it in your guide!
---
This reads like school courtyard talk.
---
Everyone should remember Frewdis if you were on Deathwing
---
Sounds great!
---
I played an enhance shaman in TBC and honestly never really liked it but never tried ele or resto.  I've been messing with ele on pservers doing BGs the last couple weeks and it's been a ton of fun.  Definitely recommend from that side, but from what I hear raid wise they're mostly wanted as resto, so fair warning.  I'm sure there will be casual guilds that take ele and don't care though, just depends on how hardcore you plan to be
---
Just need a wow sub. No need to buy the game.   
---
[wow - classic](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic)
---
More Swedes have decided to stay on shazzrah than make the switch. The coalitions own fb polls confirm this.
---
In terms of high end raiding, shamans are typically relegated to an off-healing spot and used primarily for their totems. However, leveling and PvP are super fun as Shaman.
---
Warlock is one of the best levelers and dps'ers in the game and surprisingly has a lot of sustain. If you count tapping life for Mana and using a drain to refuel yourself, they can be pretty long lasting, albeit squishy. 
---
I guess it comes down to what you want to do really. If you're okay with not being in the top tier progression clan, go shaman since that's what it seems your heart is set on. Worst case scenario, leveling a shaman is more difficult than a lock, so you can always level a lock as an alt.
---
Don't play dude lol
---
wow, that's bad luck.
---
but go to Bali.
---
Was his name blakesbank like it should be.
---
Warcraft 3 campaign play through til your boys get on then do online custom maps
---
I know right! Was actually kind of cool to check it out by region/nation.
---
No, you pay the 15$/mo subscription fee and get access to both classic and retail. They at least understood that buying 7 individual expansions with indefinite plans to make more is a bit stupid and honestly very few people are new to wow, most are old subscribers who come back for one reason or a other so blizzard didnt really make much money off those sales, and they only served to increase the barriers to entry for those people who are totally new to wow.
---
I think this was all coherent, im pretty faded.
---
I am going to level my Dwarf Priest first on Herod. Probably take mining and tailoring. 
---
Instead of going deep shadow with Wand Spec I think I want to try a Disc/Holy Hybrid with 5/5 Spirit Tap. (21/25/5)
---
1. 5/5 Wand Spec and 5/5 Spirit Tap first
---
1. Followed by 5/5 in Holy Specialization for the Crit and 5/5 Divine Fury for faster casting.
---
1. Next pick up 5/5 in both Improved PW:F and PW:S (probably shield first?)
---
1. Maybe pick up 1/1 Holy Nova but probably 1/1 Inner Focus and 3/3 Meditation first
---
1. After those three are capped I will grab 3/3 Inspiration
---
1. At this point I am pigeonholed into putting 1 point in both disc and holy to get to the next tier. I went with 1/3 Improved Renew and 1/5 Unbreakable Spirit 
---
1. 5/5 Mental Agility so I can get to 1/1 Divine Spirit which should really help mana.
---
1. 2/2 Holy Reach and 3/3 Improved Healing
---
1. 5/5 Spiritual Guidance to wrap up into 60. 
---
Does anyone have any experience with this? I do not plan on leveling with any friends at the moment but I usually always group up especially if I have guildies in zone. 
---
My goal is to be able to use the quest to both quest and dungeon all the way through and at 60. Mana Regen is really the name of the game to keep downtime low.
---
Plus the combat is a lot "clunkier" than retail so your actions have more consequences. In retail you're able to correct your mistakes a lot more often than in Classic. If you fuck up in Classic you're gonna die.
---
I'm so elated that we get to go bacta vanilla. HAHAHAHAHAHA ^(I'll show myself out)
---
True, but that was mostly due to people only creating characters and then logout
---
Maybe they won't be in but the (customer support) guy is totally wrong. I myself transfered to a new server in Vanilla days...
---
Okay!
---
TIMMEEHHH
---
You really gotta ask yourself one thing... What does it make you if you lose to a "Retard Patrol"?
---
But yeah, the whining (and insulting) due to being ganked on a pvp server is really sad and pathetic.
---
There is if your goal is to work together to save everyone gold.
---
Will do! Thanks!
---
It seems fair to expect a community to want to communicate in their language on a server that is set to their language. 
---
There are no rules stating that Spanish people can't speak Spanish on the server, but it's hardly extreme for English speaking players to search for a server that primarily consists of English speaking players. 
---
You're playing a game that depends entirely on players ability to communicate with each other over text, given the size of each community I'm confused as to why Blizzard don't make servers that give Spanish players a chance to speak to each other without organising groups outside of the game.
---
Deciding between healing with Druid and Paladin. 
---
Friends will be Rogue and Warrior on a pvp realm.
---
I plan on raiding and want to farm effectively during downtimes.
---
Yep. This is what I mean. You buy yourself 0.5 seconds to cast auto shot where the mob is standing still
---
Sounds like a Tauren Druid in the making (if you're okay with Horde). If not, Pally is where it's at from the looks of it.
---
THE HI NTERLANDS!
---
STVietnam
---
everquest 2’s and lineage 2’s art was awful. but the engine was better. this is not a share about the quality of the design. it is about the quality of the engine and its lack of use of advanced tech features in almost all areas of the game. it was painful to look at.
---
Did you just call that guys joke out for being "wrong"?
---
Literally guild banks solve QOL issues, not the other way around.  I'm curious to see how he responds =p
---
&gt;6% mace stun is very bad
---
This just seems ridiculous to say. You don't ever remember the stun being extremely useful?
---
Yeah, go to a low pop server
---
Most reddit browsers definitely aren't tryhard enough to have a set for spirit swapping.
---
Just call them out for it. It's like a hunter taking a melee weapon over a warrior - sure, they can use it but its value is much lower than it is to the warrior.
---
Love my hand of rag....
---
Its times like this I wish I had a serious drug addiction. But noooooooooo, had to get addicted to wow.
---
If a few guildies (especially with a tank) wanna do that it’s absolutely fine. Don’t like it, don’t join.
---
People wanted Vanilla/TBC/WotLK servers.  Blizz responded with that.  Everyone rolled their eyes in unison.
---
i haven’t kept up to date with WoW much, how much is really different between classic and modern?
---
Chill for the next 11 days or make a leveling guide if you haven’t yet?  Plan out a leveling route on a private server? I haven’t had a desire to play other games for months but at this point I feel like another few days is nothing
---
This gives me PTSD from my CSGO days.
---
More Swedes left in shazzrah than on gehennas.
---
You don’t have to brag that you have friends.
---
I'm pretty sure you can all group together, it'll just have very  long wait times at launch.
---
Definetly, warlocks still won't ever outdo the mages. Early on you don't have the hit to keep up, later on when you start getting hit the mages switch to fire and just pull even further away thanks to how baller Ignite is.
---
60
---
Should have said stormstrike instrad of wf to make it more accurate joke
---
A guild bank does not save anyone gold.
---
Keep the game breaking bugs and I'll back off my humble bank.
---
They are independent of each other.  The que was occuring on server login(micro), not account login(macro).  This is why you would get a queue for Herod but could instantly log into Grobulus.  
---
It's also important to note, layers are not infinite.  There are a lot of limitations still in place.  While hardware is without a doubt vastly superior to what was, it still has overhead and limitations by interface.  Specifically Layer 1 on the OSI model.  It's very very important to know that the cloud compute servers they are using still have limitations in bandwidth and capacity.  This was illustrated recently by Blizzard themselves, when they said if people do not move from Herod, the que times would be extensive.
---
i hope level 30 shadow priest with skinning.
---
You can tank with deep arms spec just fine sub-40, some will even say until 60 with the right healer. You can also look into a hybrid dps/tank spec.
---
Not garbage, there are much better options, which are relatively easier to acquire.
---
Yeah obviously those outweigh a blue post (however blizz is notoriously good for having their blues only post viable info, this seems to be a rare example where that is not the case), and while they did say that the service was originally in vanilla (referring to realm xfers with stipulations),   it wasn't a sure statement like you're making it out to seem.
---
He specifically says "it's something we *might* support"
---
Now, we can assume that it will follow suit with everything else and blizz will at least attempt to make it vanilla-like, but who knows for sure. Activision is much more about the $$$ then the classic wow team is, so I doubt that paid transfers will never be in .
---
Tirion at the time was in exile, protesting the fact that Argent Dawn leadership hogged all the chairs in Light's Hope. You'd have to write to Maxwell Tyrosus (who himself didn't come there in time to get a chair).
---
You've got a week off? Unless you're completely useless you'll be higher than 30.
---
He is outright wrong when saying character transfers were never a thing in vanilla. Paid Character transfers were released sometime around June of 2006. 
---
[Shane Dabiri](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-realm-transfer-details-unveiled/1100-6153087/?utm_source=reddit.com) interview about the release of the feature.
---
How many iterations did Brady games do on these guides? I have one from the battle chest that's different from those.
---
Did you ever play Vanilla? I don't know if they're sticking to regular raid formulas or not, but with 40 man raids, plugging was not really a thing. 
---
Once you have adequate blue gear, dungeons become useless to run. Just fyi.
---
***LOK'TAR OGAR!***
---
My buddy ended up with it on Lightbringer.  He got hacked years later and always laughed as they stripped and sold everything from all of his characters, but left Hand of Rag as a kind of respect I think on his account.
---
I can relate to the worry here. I was addicted, and still have an addictive personality. Have a beautiful wife now and two fur children and a great job. Praying for moderation!
---
Thanks for writing this.
---
I'm hem-hawing on it now. I didn't read the phases before making that comment. Pre-BC raid gear was the best PvP gear. So with that in mind:
---
MC, Onyxia, Maraudon: no honor.
---
Dire Maul: Honor system, PvP rank rewards. MC gear will be dominant in world PvP
---
Blackwing Lair: BG's start (WSG and AV). I don't expect the first rank 14 before this point and the leading raid guilds will dominate.
---
Which guy? Sorry I lost ya
---
But I thought Trump was evil. Isn't the horde supposed to be evil? ;)
---
I know you've been waiting to interview me, so I'll let you know I'm finally ready to be heard. I'll answer any of your questions.
---
Actual
---
That's a strawman argument at best. The state of retail is a result of appealing to the stockholders because WoW has to be a competitive game in a completely different gaming market than it started out in. The shift in philosophy from developing for the whole game experience, to a focus on the endgame experience at current content is a primary driver of a lot of the changes we see in the game currently. Not a bunch of QoL changes that were implemented every so often.
---
I have 7 days committed to WoW in total.
---
Your argument is that this change will prevent account sharing.
---
I am saying, be careful, because your STYLE of argument can be used for gold tokens and character boosts.
---
Drink
---
Non-Americans have them, I hear.
---
I mean sure, I just don't think random ganking is that conducive to RP, especially when it's happening while you're in the middle of some other RP thing. I'd prefer a normal RP server and flagging instead.
---
Yea but the thing I dont really mind if a minority in a Server speaks a language I dont understand I can just ignore Them. And Its not just the toxicity that frustrates me about germans I can't quite put the Finger on it but in the past I have learned I feel more comfy in the english community
---
I loved my pet to much to ever get a second one; as a result I never leveled up his Claw1 in all the time to 60.
---
Urg.. I hated that part. I remember a quest from the blacksmith in Goldshire sending you to Loch Modan and that was a hard and painful run. Died so many times.
---
I took Wed. the 28th off.  I hope I'm not too drunk Monday @ 6pm for launch.  If I am I will try not to make the same mistake Tuesday, but I don't plan on sleeping.  Hoping by bed time Wednesday to be 40-ish.
---
Man, that poor rogue has probably never seen the unkillable machine that is a SL specced naxx geared warlock.
---
Well god damn it, that's just not very thought out.
---
This is a *huge* part of why I'm stoked. No need to rush to keep on the treadmill, no pressure to do anything but go back and enjoy the process over again. 
---
That, and I was impatient to get to 60 before, so I'm gonna slow down and read quest text/level lockpicking/cooking/fishing etc. this time.
---
Agreed. My point is refuting people's idea that rolling different realms to have a smooth launch is probably wrong.
---
To your point though, I think there are positives and benefits to higher retention rates and long term over population. I will stick with Herod and assume blizz will offer solutions like free transfers if the problems start outweighing the benefits, might move.
---
Feral is one of the fastest leveling specs in the game. Balance and resto are impossibly slow and grueling. Your choice.
---
PTO?   
---
I'm going to be streaming the entire experience. 😂🔫
---
The wetlands run is for noobs who don't know they can swim to dun morogh and drown, then ress in Kharanos.
---
This is the essence of Classic
---
Not true at all. Maybe in PvE if you only spam frostbolts.
---
But in PvP you need to react fast and sometimes cast a different spell than you are planning. Also sometimes you need to target another specific player and that will surelly make your clicking even slower. Even in this video you can see that he's not using a spell every GCD because all that clicking is making him be slower than normal
---
I'd like to point out that you didn't offer anything.
---
You are a person who have a friend that want to start a guild.
---
You're looking for members and members that can lead your members in raids.
---
The question is what join you and not anyone else ?
---
*(Im not even Horde. Just wanted to point out what your post was missing. For future posts.)*
---
Deadmines, wailing caverns, shadowfang keep, etc.
---
I guess they're gonna changed status to offline before the release.. 🤔
---
I would not waste PTO for the Tuesday IMO.  Let things settle.  Rather start Wednesday PTO and add a day on the back end.
---
I'm confused with this line of reasoning, but it's too much of a tangent from the original point that it's probably not worth arguing.
---
they still don't have nearly enough servers to ever remove layering
---
I'd be very very cautious of running this(if your virus scanner wasn't enough of a warning). I looked over and compiled the github repo and scanned it online(https://virusscan.jotti.org/en-US/filescanjob/hwv6rjr19l). No hits.
---
I did get an invalid string that wasn't attached to anything during compile.
---
&gt;Form3.Designer.cs(114,56): warning CS0414: The private field `DesktopApp1.Form3.backgroundWorker1' is assigned but its value is never used
---
Compilation succeeded - 1 warning(s)
---
which leads me to believe the Github was scrubbed from all the dirty code.
---
Yeah I can imagine that’s probably annoying af. 
---
I have no doubt classic’s launch will be a nightmare lol
---
¿Qué es esa ortografía? Q u e u e
---
Level 18-25 on my Paladin, level 10 or above on my Warlock.
---
Are there any guides for leveling as a paladin? I heard reck bombing doesnt work because the /sit macro isnt a thing.
---
Yeah yeah I've got my night elf druid fleshed out in my mind. I am so fucking psyched for all the original format! Definitely fun looking forward to it, will be just as great starting him fresh.
---
Doooope
---
No. We already know it will prevent account sharing. It’s not an argument, it’s a fact proven by history and has nothing to do with WoW tokens or character boosts.
---
Nothing wrong with a few nose beers
---
One of the better warriors I used to pvp with was a gnome. Seeing a gnome with ashkandi two shotting massive horde characters was always a delight.
---
Dude shut up its reddit, you know what im saying. Find something to do with your time
---
Blizzard has never locked a realm ever. It just means there’ll be a queue on launch. Your friends can still make chars
---
Is there a source for this?
---
This!
---
There is not a big difference in dps and efficiency between frost and fire for levelling.  Don't discount fire or elemental.
---
Tips for NE Hunter? Path to follow?

I took off the 26th - 30th (whole week)

So I will have 7 full days to play
---
As a horde player i like this post. Get them severs to 50/50 so you dont have an excuse when i stomp you
---
Gnome warrior's moveset are cool af
---
How far we've come...
---
Que???
---
if you go south from Dire Maul you enter the world of Azeroth and since you enter Deadmines from the world of Azeroth this effectively makes VC part of DM:South.
---
yeah, thanks
---
I remember how long Firemaw took us to learn (and then relearn) since we had to have a lock death rotation plus a pally assigned to OOC rez (pre combat pulse integration). 
---
Also Hunters even with their relatively low dps had to Feign Death on a relative rotation to not pull threat and this was with a MT with Thunderfury in BWL.
---
by slaying them
---
Cleared up to 4hm and got blocked due to not enough warriors but nice try loser.
---
how much HD does classic require?
---
Yeah I remember it always been "bad graphics" compared to other games that tried to be graphically advanced. Now if you look at those "advanced" games, the graphics are laughable. But then there's WoW that doesn't feel dated because it's always been dated in a way. 
---
Realistic graphics in games only last as long as the technology is advanced. Certain art styles are forever though, just look at Cuphead.
---
You cared enough to reply. Imagine that.

---
Lol yeah, you better not pull 2 more mobs than you thought the gear check will get you.
---
I'm going to make [Homemade Hot Pockets](https://tasty.co/recipe/pepperoni-pizza-pockets) because that best encapsulates playing Classic to me!
---
Problem is that doesn’t work great if you conceive of your character as being more of an ordinary joe. You’re kind of forced into being this great hero. Your only option if you don’t want that is to just not participate in the majority of an expansion’s story and content. 
---
Also IMO it doesn’t really work great in an MMO for the player characters to e a specific important lore character. 
---
Not saying you’re wrong for your view but those are some of the reasons why people have issues with it.
---
Electric Boogaloo
---
Ran past a dead Tauren in dusk wood, it was a FD 60 hunter, he poped back up and killed me
---
What? Lol what a silly question.
---
No changes
---
VC = Viet Cong. Stop confusing people. But for real, DM is Deadmines. If you aren’t referencing a wing, you aren’t talking about Dire Maul. Nobody randomly did Dire Maul. There was always someone who needed something in a specific wing, so that was the instance you were going to do. Even then, people only did it because they needed something specific. It was not a popular set of dungeons. Contrast that with Deadmines that Alliance players probably ran a crap ton due to its high place in the early leveling experience.
---
My flesh is literally rotting. I don't think a bath would help very much.

That would be the point. But I srsly envision myself never being grouped.

yeah people seem to think 55/45 is “close enough” because hey its only 5 off from an even 50/50 what more could you ask for! but in reality it ends up being so atrocious and unplayable that it leads to a snowball effect of people in the smaller faction rerolling. the truth is 45/55 is a death sentence, whatever the difference is from 50/50 you have to double to get the true difference, so at 56/44 you’re looking at nearly 25% difference in faction numbers. that means any contested zone will have HUNDREDS of more horde than alliance. as someone who played on the 45% faction this will be devastating and is one of the main reasons im rolling grob which i anticipate will be the closest server to 50/50 we get. they are not prepared.
---
Use boat rides and flight paths to walk around and stretch. It will help a ton and make blood flow in your legs.
---
Guild banks are awesome.  Only downside is that folks will join 1 man guilds and use it for personal storage between all their alts.
---
This is low quality b8
---
I’m out of the loop, could some explain this?
---
You like never played in the Warsong BG back in the day. BR servers are not enjoyable. I'd choose a streamer server over BR.
---
I got “guildbankalt” on Whitemane
---
Nah WPL is low 50s EPL is 56+ 
---
They're the northern most *accessible* zone in Eastern Kingdoms. 
---
South of where Quel'thalas would be , east of UC.
---
Nahh uhh, we get to kite dragon kin on Razorgore.
---
..so, for someone who has been off the WoW train for damn near a decade..but also was in deep with OG Wow up until Wrath of the LK..what can I expect? 
---
Also, what kind of “setup” would I need to have to be able to run Wow Classic?
---
All of this nostalgia talk has my interest peaked even tho I swore off the game..
---
Danger adds risk, and risk is exciting. It's world of WARcraft, a war between two factions. You shouldn't be able to hang out at a war front and not feel like your life is in jeopardy. If you're farming anything, why should the alliance character get to take it because he got there first? No, its a fight if you want that herb dawg, sorry.
---
Ooga gang?
---
Good ole ignite where it was one shared stacking debuff with every fire mage in the raid when the first one with a crit and thus the ignite got all the threat
---
Dm took over as dm after it was released. Deadmines became vc. Also horde never did vc so that's why they never called it dm in the first place.
---
The q on Herod will be wayyyy longer than 30 mins. I bet it's closer to 8 hours.
---
My strategy will be to vendor most of the stuff from 1-50, but to have a level 5 enchanter alt to disenchant green weapons 50+. Greater eternal essences are likely to be more valuable than the weapons themselves. Disenchanting everything leads to massive amounts of illusion and dream dust which is not really going to be worth as much overall.
---
This is true, hacktavision only has one game these days and thats Call Of Duty.
---
Meh been there done that content.  Give me some new fun stuff.
---
Would be pretty clunky to do, since you need to drop combat to drop traps so you'd have to use Feign Death to drop the trap.
---
And typically you want to save Feign Death so you can use the combat drop to cycle between different on-use trinkets during a fight. Or to save a repair bill and run-back in case of a wipe.
---

Pinkertons!
---
Same here, I was going to ask aswell. 
---
If you find a solution, please share it!

---
LFR was QOL. LFG was QOL. Removing class quests was QOL. Removing the need to buy ammunition was QOL. Feeding pets, soul gems, flying mounts... All QOL. All not classic.
---
Whether the DPS is normalized or not, skills like Mortal Strike still uses the weapon damage range (not dps) in it's calculation.  You'll want slow because of that.
---
We’re not talking about what classes should or shouldn’t roll on, we’re talking about what classes do roll on.  Dal Rends is pre BiS for hunters, which means hunters will roll on them.
---
If at a roleplay server, just open up the conversation with “Mom, dad? What are you doing in my bed? I told you last week I moved here.”
---
Let the conversation flow from there.
---
Exactly! I had the memento myself for awhile, and I was getting tired of it not selling, until I finally sold it at 90k. I just didn’t care that much anymore waiting for it to sell at a higher price.
---
I can't wait for someone to run it on a smart fridge lol
---
You shouldn't. High would be great. Full? Not so much. 
---
Fairbanks is listed as medium now. By the time launch hits, it will probably be high or full.

I knew about D1 but had no idea about WC
---
All around good points.
---
The damage contribution from your attack power is normalized to a set speed.  Your weapon is still a significant amount of damage added to your instant attacks, so slow weapons contribute more.  The other reason you want slow weapons is due to the nature of proc per minute abilities or trinkets.  For example, paladin seal of command (which is also weapon damage based) is 7ppm.  For anweapon of 3.8 speed, a paladin swings hit 15.7 times per minute.  That means for a 3.8spd weapon, the proc chance is 47%.  If that paladin chose a 2s attack weapon, he would only have 7/30 or 22% chance to proc per swing and at a lower damage.
---
Tldr slower weapons contribute more to instant abilities that are weapon damage based, and proc ppm abilities better for some classes.  So the most important factor is the damage range on the weapon.
---
For Dwarf/gnome: At what level is it best to head to west fall? Do you try to do all of loch modan first?
---
It's running on the base BFA/Legion client, wouldn't it have the multi-threading capabilities of those clients?
---
Logically speaking, it's pointless. I'm sure someone can explain this logically, but I can't, and it'd still be stretching to get points across. 
---
But emotionally and mentally, Vanilla feels epic. Everything means more. Gear hasn't been overvalued yet, so being decked out in greens is a real achievement. Getting larger bags is this large feat. The mobs have giant aggro ranges and more are leashed so more pulls go sideways. The entire game, every aspect is harder, so it all feels that much more satisfying to earn. 
---
There are no Quality of Life improvements in Vanilla. Pots stack to five, they have a two minute cooldown and most fights are 4+mins so you can chug as many as your bag space allows. Mining takes repeated attempts to get all the ore. Early tailoring gear is a crazy mix of nearly useless and nearly priceless. First aid is *really* useful, even for healers. Getting places takes effort and time, there's so few flight paths compared to Cata+. 
---
I went from an ezmode private Wrath server where I paid a sub for the game to be super easy, to a barebones "Blizz-like" Vanilla server and had way more fun. The increased difficulty makes some players more empathetic so groups are easier to get and accomplish more. It's just a completely different social and gaming experience than retail is and has been for a long, long time. And that's what we want.
---
How you could have had as much time off as you wanted:
---
In May when the release date for Classic was announced, you should have told your office that an unexpected pregnancy had entered your life, that she was due in early September, and that while you know federal law allows you up to 12 weeks of time away, you value your team and work too much and only think you'll need a few weeks to get the baby settled in.
---
If you're married or otherwise in a relationship, just have her take some photos with a pillow under her shirt that you can casually admire around the office. The reason you waited so long to announce was because there were health complications and you didn't want to spread the word until the doctors gave you more confidence.
---
If you're single, just say that you're a man of principle. Just because birth control isn't 100% effective doesn't mean you're going to let a child grow up without a father.
---
Over the summer, whenever you wanted to play the Beta or Stress Tests, just tell the office that you have to pick her up for an OBGYN appointment across town. That should let you take the rest of the day off because picking her up from home, loading her fat ass into your car, getting into the hospital, performing all those tests, and then getting her back home takes fucking forever.
---
August rolls around, the whole office is excited for you, your responsibilities have been pretty light the last couple months because they know you'll be gone. They throw you a potluck and send you on your happy way.
---
Classic launches, do your thing.
---
After hitting level 60, announce on Facebook that the previously mentioned complications resulted in your new baby child being stillborn. Give it a name, Thex will work, and quietly thank everyone for their condolences. Then send a solemn email to your boss saying you can come back to work whenever, that you think it will be good for you to get your mind off the tragic event. Or just take more time off to mourn.
---
Once you get back to the office, everyone's your pal. No one fucks with you even when you screw up, you're practically immune to being fired and will likely even be put up for a promotion. Whenever you want a break to go play some WoW, just say you have a grief therapy session across town.
---
And your new WoW habit? Well that's completely explained by your need for an escape from reality.
---
And his characters name... Albert einstein.
---
This is an understatement. We need to setup meetings for those of us who suffered at the hands of this mental image
---
That's a good joke. You must have missed that "Krol Blade" has purple text. It's VASTLY superior.
---
I did Gul'dan Mythic... I was living in Alabama and played on Aegwynn - EU - German. It was doable!
---
New eastern pvp server stalagg was announced last night. Lots of people have not heard of it yet. Please consider rolling there. Herod will be insanely over populated
---
I loved Dark Pact back in the day. My imp was just free mana and it didn't require using the healers instead.
---
they did it on insta as well- covering all their bases
---
Before weapon normalization - the formula for instant attacks had a modifier that took top end damage and applied that weapons weapon speed into it. I believe it was multiplicative but regardless this resulted in some weapons having ridiculous instant attack damage (like the Barman shanked for rogues) that actually out damaged some raid weapons. 
---
That is now normalized.  All you really want to care about is your top end damage as two handlers are normalized to 3.6 and I think one handers are normalized to 1.8 or 2.0 or something in that range. 
---
In any case - slower weapons are always better assuming item level is equal because your instant attacks are...well instant. 
---
That being said - if you have a faster weapon that also has a higher top end damage due to it just being really good for that item level etc. then use that.
---
This guy and my Apple Watch are in cahoots
---
Really?  I think their preparation has been the most solid effort we’ve ever seen.  The last stress test was really stable,.  What makes you say this?
---
its been a while since i was reading about all this stuff, but wasnt it established that tanks were able to provide more threat on pservers because of the boss parry chance being so low?
---
Yeah, somehow people think this sub is the majority. Most of this sub hasn't even subbed, and that's only a small portion of the community. Not even going to bother going back and forth on it though, it's extremely simple
---
This is my exactly dilemma.
---
I think I’m going to go Shaman rather than lock though. 
---
I do like healing 5mans, and shaman enhancement and elemental can be pretty fun in PvP for a change of pace. 
---
Whereas lock is ‘just’ dps. Fun, but single minded.
---
I wouldn’t be concerned about finding a raid spot as a non-healing shaman. The raid lead would of course prefer you to heal. However, if you get the gear you’re suppose to, and can follow directions being a warm body that can buff a Melee group is almost as good.  
---
That all goes out the window if you’re trying to be bleeding edge raiding, in which case you need to min/max.
---
I am not willing to pay 30$ a month to play a few hours with my wife. Yes you are correct. I'd pay a one time fee of 200$ no problem but I want access untill the servers are shut down.
---
At a certain point you have to go to other starting areas (if you don't want to straight grind mobs).  As an undead eventualy you go to the Barrens and do some of those quests.  Many quests send you from one area to another anyway.  I can think of one Silverpine quest that you turn in (final step) in Barrens and one Barrens quest that you turn in (final step) in Silverpine.
---
This requires more planning and traveling, but I think it is worth it.  I mean as an undead warlock/mage you are going to want the Crecent Staff reward from Wailing Caverns, which requires prequests in the Barrens and Org/TB.  I rarely rarely grind mobs.
---
Once all your quests are brown/red, head to the equivalent zone on the other continent.  As you bounce back and forth some quests will be grey.  Some of these are pre-quests for a chain that you will have to do - others are gust grey quests that you will skip since you won't get xp obviously.  Good luck.
---
There are already changes, you lot already died on that hill so roll down it so others can make a stand.
---
the new cataclysm quests were pretty fun though.
---
BFA got it in 8.1. Classic is using the Legion client.
---
You can't even get your epic mount until phase 2, and it will cost almost as much as a regular epic mount and has a long quest tied to it.  The only advantage you get is your 40 mount for free.
---
I'm so conflicted... I played rogue during classic and loved every second of it, but I think I want to give something else a whirl and am stuck between:
---
* Hunter
---
* Warlock
---
* Druid
---
* Warrior
---
A little about me:
---
* Can't no-life it, will play a few hours a day. 4ish times a week.
---
* I just want to PVP end game. I don't care about raiding at all, maybe I'll join a few?
---
* I want ez mode, but some flexibility. 
---
* I'm trying to convice myself to not play Rogue again because I'd rather not burn out.
---
If agi actually affected want speed, but it doesn't.
---
We did the same thing on Rexxar to people who called it VC. They were immediately noobs.
---
What does this do?
---
Prob worth your time to explore guilds on the server you’re going to play on. I personally plan to raid but not “hardcore”, so I’m hoping to level to 60 and find a guild that I can raid with once to twice a week
---
Our guild of over 100+ will be switching if we see stalagg numbers rise over the next week
---
That’s what I thought but wasn’t sure
---
I stopped playing wow right before WotLK dropped. Just didn't have the time or money. 
---
With classic coming out, I plan on really getting back into the game. I honestly haven't been this excited for a game in a very long time.
---
Ahhh so I won’t see Classic WoW underneath versions drop down until I pay $15 and become a paid subscriber. I will try that when I get home then. Don’t have an issue paying 15 just though I might as well get the $15 free if I could.
---
It looks like it's from SWTOR mmo
---
Have:
---
**Shazzrah** \- Ally, Sw, Class
---
**Golemagg** \- Dk, Durotar, Him
---
Hit me up if you are interested, im open to other names on those two servers, bfa gold, and more
---
Suck up to the guild leader and/or raid leader if they are different. Suck up to officers. Try not to be super obvious about it, but if any ask about needing a body for a run for them, their friend, their sibling, their spouse, whatever.  If They're trying to farm a pattern drop from a dungeon be in that group that runs it over and over to try and help.
---
Show up to raids with \*EXTRA\* consumables. That other guy in your spec who shows up less prepared. Don't handle it thru whispers do a /guild or /raid and say "I have farmed a bunch extra of \*insert potion/oil/food\* Anyone need some?" Sure it's going to be expensive, but it makes you look like someone who goes the extra step for preparation.
---
Sure, you could go the sit back and let the damage meter speak for itself approach if someone else doesn't buff up as much as you, but even though more expensive the extra-consumables shows both your preparation and your willingness to want the guild to succeed.
---
Don't trust some random guild on reddit or discord with big promises. That's the worst thing you cna do tbh. Just level fast, meet people while you level and join guild that seem to fit your level of dedication.
---
Did you just ASSUME their gender???
---
[http://gph.is/1A7KbbA](http://gph.is/1A7KbbA)

Probably got down voted because you're asking for a game for free. I understand not having enough money to pay the subscription though. Being broke sucks.
---
Not sure if there is a addon yet but you can do that with a macro:
---
/run local t={1,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,16,17,18}; for k,v in pairs(t) do PickupInventoryItem(v); PutItemInBackpack(); end
---
This will put all items with durability into your backpack if you have space.
---
A month or two down the line you will be able to assess the situation for yourself
---
Nope. Can't play on any official blizzard vanilla server. try a private server.
---
Full = you can still create characters but there will be queue times. 
---
Locked = no more characters can be created.
---
I want demon hunters, flying, and titan forge gear :( :( :(
---
Oh shit
---
Too much booty competition.
---
Normal subscription amount. 1 sub gives you current and classic wow.
---
Tier 0.5 is just for people who don't want to raid.
---
I see don't see much reason to spend a lot on this if you could get Sword of Zeal for a third or quarter of the price (assuming you don't want to farm or get unlucky with Dal Rend's swords from UBRS).
---
Relative to their peak results. So classic wow had a score of "100" at some point, and every score of classic wow past that point is using that 100 as a statistic benchmark.
---
It will be as close to vanilla as possible, with content scheduled into 6 phases I believe to make it more like the original release

Unless you have beta access there's no way to play on Blizz servers until the 26th.

No because I have common sense.

 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Normalization](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Normalization) 
---
Yep. It's in place. Slower weapons typically have higher top end damage, and will still do more damage though. When it comes to calculating damage, weapon speed just is less of a factor now, is all.
---
The formula used to be;  damage = base\_weapon\_damage + (**weapon\_speed \*** Attack Power / 14) 
---
Now is;  normalized\_damage = base\_weapon\_damage + (**X \*** Attack Power / 14) 
---
 Where X is...
---
* 1.7  
---
 for daggers
---
* 2.4  
---
 for other one-handed weapons
---
* 3.3  
---
 for two-handed weapons
---
* 2.8  
---
 for ranged weapons
---
Notice the max for 2H is 3.3. Where as pre1.8 and MS'ing with a 2H with 3.8 or slower swing speed was... crazy strong.
---
I’m so excited! I didn’t play in 2004 as I was only 5, but I’m hoping it’s a lot more fun than retail. Nobody talks in retail it hardly seems like a social game
---
For some. Depends on luck. RNG is something people often forget in vanilla. It took me at least 60 UBRS runs to get the mainhand back then and a week later I got a brutality blade from MC which is superior.
---

---
&gt; was introduced in 1.8 and made it so weapon speed is irrelevant when calculating instant attack damage like mortal strike.
---
That's true. But the Weapon damage is still the big factor.
---
Math:
---
* Pre 1.8, instant weapon damage used for instant attacks:
---
    damage = base_weapon_damage + (weapon_speed * Attack Power / 3.5)
---
After 1.8 (for a 2 handed weapon specifically) :
---
    damage = base_weapon_damage + (3.3 * Attack Power / 3.5)
---
They replaced the *weapon_speed* with a *fixed value per weapon type*.
---
So now the weapon speed is not a factor in the damage calculated... BUT STILL, slower weapon have higher **base_weapon_damage** by nature.
---
So you get a slow weapon for the base damage and not the weapon speed.
---
No need for a ring! Digital games aren't old-fashioned like that. Get the game a nice new GPU instead ;-)

Just level up first dude. If you're not looking to be in a guild that's competing for world first kills then make sure to be 60 pretty quickly and you'll be able to join basicly any guild you want.
---
It's so much talk from people claiming they will be 60 and ready for raiding in x amount of days. Very few of them will actually live up to that.
---
Anyone can make most arguments  compelling and I agree the style can be pasted to more game changes. But this is purely a QoL change. Many people are confusing it with game changes like a 60 level up and gold exchanges.
---
They are the least gear dependent, competant in pvp, good moneymakers just by being hunters.
---
For someone pvp focused without time to gear well, it's the best option followed by warlock. Druid can pvp great, but it's by no means easy. Warrior is too gear dependent, you won't have time to gear it to the sweet spot for ages.
---
Yeah I'm not the one pretending I'm a fortune cookie.

Start now. Join guild discords and start chatting with them. Gives you more time to know their expectations and if they mesh with yours.

There will be many guilds per server but there may be only 1 or 2 hardcore raiding guilds that you want to be in.

Raid times

Loot distribution

Class openings

Etc.

Cata heroics were the best 5 man content Blizzard ever made, arguably even better than Vanilla. It's a shame they completely abandoned it in favor of speedrunning for some reason. First with that Challenge Mode thing in MoP and then with Mythic+
---
It kind of ruined 5 man content for me. I like challenge, I don't like GOGOGO.
---
&gt; Rogues only minor issue is they have no class based source of money.
---
Just curious, what are all of the class based sources of money for the other classes? I'm new to WoW.
---
I'd really love healbot again

I strongly recommend using WoW farming as punishment for your children.  Didn't do your homework? Farm me 20 Elemental Fire immediately.  Got in a fight at school?  10 Larval Acid please.

How do people not realize that there are thousands of people like myself who wont reserve names because they don't care. Combined with new players waiting for release... No realm will be dead, it's likely even more realms will be created. Just go wherever you want guys!

Nope and I really hope they dont. The old ones have real character. I love them. The new ones look okay but they would look out of place in the old world.

This, the good guilds arent even recruiting right now. Only zerg guilds with big dreams.

I don't see why /u/Nukiwolf2 couldn't add features where players could /w a query to the user about items that they have in stock and the addon could /w back.

i.e. like

---
/w BuyerPlayer You're in luck! SellerPlayer has 100 Linen Cloth in stock for xx gold.
---
Remember that warlock and hunter pet pathing isn't great in vanilla, so unsummon your pets if you're jumping off a ledge.
---
Let’s assume Classic does great and Blizzard plans content updates for it. Whether it is re-releasing expansions or all new content, doesn’t matter for this point.  
---
If they can add content to Classic between Retail expansions it’ll help prevent a content drought for a lot of players. And the same can be done for Classic. With new Retail content released between Classic updates.  
---
It is like having the summer and winter Olympics on 4 year cycles. But staggered by 2 years.  
---
It doesn’t help those who only want to play Classic much. But would be a benefit to a lot of other players. And keeping subscription numbers up means more WoW in either form. Which is good for all players.
---
Top end damage was never a thing for dps. The only reason top end damage would matter in any way was that it made for potentially bigger damage spikes in PvP.
---
Am i the only one who doesnt care about language barriers but more concerned with potential latency issues?
---
I play retail in the morning times (i'm NA) and when i group with aussie or south american folks my latency gets past 300ms making the game really tough to enjoy.
---
True. Good thing my English is decent. But I'm fully expecting to still get roasted.
---
Sounds like you're leaning male. 
---
I'm going troll male for the cool bow animation (going hunter) and... I like blue .\_.
---
5 level 30’s with near bis gear farmed for that level is a big difference than 34’s in leveling gear..:
---
Yep dire maul is indeed dm.
---
&gt;this is purely a QoL change
---
The things, it isn't. You get access lo like a hundred extra bank slots. It's a pretty big deal actually.
---
If you can come up with a system where people can share a bank alt but not get extra bag slots and not share account it would be reasonable.
---
What do you recommend leveling on the side on a PVP server?
---
Rogues might be it for you! Only downfall is the amount of competition there usually is among rogues which may make it hard to gear and get in groups. Top tier DPS, excellent solo class. Great PVPers. Pretty good farmers.
---
Warriors are also nice but in PvP need some type of healer to unlock their full potential. They're extremely fun. Also top tier damage. Also extremely difficult to get into groups unless you're a tank. More so than rogues.
---
Rogues can't use axes in classic.
---
Yeah, that's my big concern with all the guild recruitment posts. 90% of them all sound the same and really offer no proof that they can deliver on their promises.
---
That would be blizzard
---
coldridge mail delivery requires doing 'dwarven outfitters' and i'm not wasting time waiting for wolves to spwan.
---
The classic and BC cinematics are still my favorites tbh. I get more hyped up to play the game watching all the playable races, our characters do cool shit rather than watching the big bad have a speech for 2 minutes.
---
&gt;arenas will not be in classic
---
Wait what???????? I was sure they existed in Vanilla? Fuuuuuuck :(
---
An Italian complains people don't want to play with Italians, despite not wanting to play with the Italians himself.
---
oh, thank you! I had forgotten that. Useful information!
---
Yeah but your main rotation changes by level I.e some spells are more efficient at certain levels. One thing to note is I believe if you by the top rank it automatically buys the lesser ranks, therefore you can save a bit of gold especially if you are a Lock buying the SUmmon Demon spells.
---
They live only for our happiness
---
Harsh working conditions... Oofff... You'd hate my job then
---
I think i was one of the most lucky persons in the world to find two of these. Sold em both and was only 50g away from my epic mount &lt;3
---
but now you can level in 2 boars instead of 4.
---
Unless I'm missing something, is there supposed to be a drop down for class/spec?
---
I manually typed it in and nothing changed.
---
LOL. Right on....I’ve heard that from a few people too. Had someone say that they are going to grind so they can the sweet level 14 weapons. God Bless you....because I have no interest in banging my head in BGs for 1,000 hours. According to the old system it would take 12 weeks of absolute no life grinding to make Rank 14 at a minimum. Nah, I’m good. I might grind the Rank 11 mount if I find a good pvp group, but yeah I think you will see a good fall off.
---
My first toon was a dwarf paladin. I specced into the holy tree with I think a few points in prot. I did not understand how to use judgement. I literally auto-attacked everything.
---
I got to 40, got a mount, and rolled a new toon in disgust. Blew my mind how good the other classes were.
---
Basically spend 10+ hours a day minimum farming gold/mats.
---
Most "hardcore" people will be filtered by who is willing to do the actual farming needed.
---
I hope so! Yeah that's another thing, I think a lot of people aren't going to be able to play nearly as much as they think they can.
---
Bloodrazor is basically just a Thrash Blade with very slightly higher dps and a much worse proc, really no reason to get it
---
Gotta get that sweet, sweet 850xp, right?
---
&gt; because it's simply a much better game than current version. 
---
Have to disagree with you there.  Both versions have their pros and cons. There is a lot of great stuff in current WoW.  I truly love both - although end game isn't my favorite right now.    
---
I'll be playing a lot more Classic, but I can appreciate some of the good things added to WoW after vanilla also.   
---
Classic/vanilla is great, but not perfect or without flaws IMO.  I love the spells and classes in Classic wow.
---
lol np =P
---
You will gain more gold by powerleveling and exposing your character to higher level loot.
---
Food prep. I will have my fridge full of lunchboxes containing healthy food, ready to microwave.
---
You do it on a lot of alts, by the time you have leveled every one of your alts to 3, most likely the first one will have more rested xp.   
---
Its free real estate.
---
It can be a great way to earn gold. You can also consider doing herb and skinning leveling up then drop the other profession for another such as alchemy or leather working.
---
i feel offended.. but at the same time I agree lmao
---
Neither were bnet chats and a lot of other things, does that mean you won't play classic because it's not 100% authentic?
---
I installed WC3 last night to see how far i can get in that.  Need...something...to...distract...me....
---
Actually did a damn good job of it this summer and kind of cant believe were only a bit over 11 days away at this point.  That last stress test took a giant fucking shit on that, though &gt;_&lt;
---
Or better yet, tank instance runs in the feral leveling gear you already have!
---
Don't make my class decision even harder :P
---
Not so well known? Extremely well known. A lot of Ally Warriors opt to skip Berserker Axe because of this. Pretty much a necessity as a Paladin. Rogues all do this as well for Sword of Serenity.
---
I haven't played since WotLK. I saw classic was coming, so decided to try out private servers. I'd rather pay for the authentic experience. Most people that are on private servers are the try hards. I want servers full of terrible players having a great time to balance out all of the min/max crowd.
---
Syllabus week is cake anyway
---
then you havent played legion or bfa launches they were really smooth
---
Right click report this person before they can assume any more genders.
---
I wish i had bought one of those back when they were relatively cheap :(
---
some.... BODY once told me
---
It actually changed. They started using a BFA client for Classic.
---
ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN, 
---
I'm looking forward to going full neckbeard, booked time off and peddled this shit to my friends like heroin
---
Let's talk about you and me (sing it, sing it)
---
Let's talk about all the good things
---
And the bad things that may be
---
Do you ever go to the movies?
---
Do you find this funny?
---
Just standard corporate speak really
---
Duskwood, because it’s the best grinding spot for my Horde Rogue.
---
its pre-bis for like 2 months, and then is not anymore. Its pre-bis for fury war and rogue forever. There is a big difference.
---
kind of feels like the terrain is a little softer, a little richer, a little brighter... just enough to make the overall horizon and landscape feel more appropriate but not enough so that it actually makes a change that one could immediately look at and know "that's not classic".
---
The first R14 will be like 2 months after phase 2 drops at most, can't remember the math with 14k per reset, but it's relatively quick.
---
I'm highly doubting we get 2 months or less of phase 2.
---
Undead rogue or mage for pvp server?  
---
I like mage gameplay better, I don't care about class popularity and will mainly play pvp with some raiding to gear up. I'm torn between them because on one hand mage is more comfortable for me and is better in group pvp, but rogue is way better for wpvp both for leveling and general pvping/ganking than mage especially at cap.
---
You don’t like the geezer glide?
---
This is not an addon, this is default in Classic Beta
---
Appreciate the replies!
---
Not everything is about 100% efficiency.
---
Spriest for pvp good, for pve no spot, thats what everyone say...
---
I am 90 days sober today
---
Nah, cuz it will be reserved in my groups. GL spending all that time farming both swords, and then being stuck with subpar weapons after DM drops.
---
This is a self cast/looting bar, this is my character looting Cactus Apples for a quest.
---
Felwood. I don’t know why but I always loved that area, maybe because we kind of saw it get twisted in WC3 
---
That and Ashenvale, leading up to the barrens... amazing transition
---
cute butt
---
hmm..That makes a lot of sense.
---
Oh okay, I didn't know that. I thought full meant that it was at max cap. I guess full means there will be a queue then. Kinda seems like you're looking for an argument
---
Very likely, although my troll shammy started off with just a mace; no shield &gt;:(
---
The person who did just search gave him a link to macros that won't work. It's actually kind of difficult right now to know what will work because you have macro stuff from retail, macro stuff from private servers, and macro stuff for classic, and they don't mesh 100%
---
Yeah, it makes sense. I'll be seeing what kind of groups my guild can piece together. 
---
You think there is value in questing with a healer as mage? I see why it makes a lot of sense for warlocks since they have life tap, but I figure with a mage you'll both just be drinking a lot.
---
I have little hope for the integrity of Classic in the future if the philosophy held towards graphics in this thread is in any way representative of the philosophy towards the game as a whole going forward. It proves all the people who declared, "You think you do, but you don't" 100% right when, if given the choice, you actually want what wasn't there instead of what was. Everyone has 'their limit' on what can change and what can't to maintain their preferred experience, and that cacophony of  opinion (if heeded by Blizzard) can only lead to some unholy Classic+ amalgam.         
---
          
---
I will be using the oldschool classic graphic option.
---
The quest doesn’t exist until AQ does.
---
I will look into it, thanks for the help ^^
---
You would still need to buy the latest expansion (Battle for Draenor?) to play that, though, right?
---
I also showed this to my girlfriend. She did not laugh.
---
Depends... in the new troll zone you do 3 quests then are sent to talk to big boi voljin and have him give lore u shouldn't know then go fight in a huge battle against Naga and kill Zarjira
---
Not sure about NA, but OP is talking about EU where at least 70% of the population will be English speaking
---
Me and five mates all re-subbed early just for names!
---
.3 repeating, of course.
---
I'm kind of stuck between playing a hunter and a warrior. I want to raid, but I can only put about 20-26 hours into the game a week. So I was curious if due to this a hunter would be a better idea?
---
The only thing that concerns me is later down the line when hunters drop off and warriors continue to grow will I be missing out?
---
Is that month extra levelling to start with, with a warrior worth it for all the benefits it brings later on?
---
Thank you for any responses.
---
Both are very high DPS, and both will have plenty of spaces in a raid group.
---
Other players dont fully resist spells very often but bosses are going to fully resist around 10% of the spells you cast for quite a while till you can stack spell hit which is a pretty rare stat. Only like 2-3 spell hit comes from outside of raids.
---
This video shows you how at the end. https://youtu.be/r0XSL4uBipw
---
???
---
Then where is the gold being deposited to the guild bank from completing Guild dungeon and Guild raid challenges coming from?
---
Mage, rogue, warrior are always the best dps imo. With mage you have the extra of food, water, and portals. Might be something to look into
---
but NE booty is best booty?!
---
Never give in, never surrender!  Fuck your friends, you can make new ones!  There will only ever be 1 horde.
---
Just based on what I'm hearing, a lot of people aren't moving because they expect everyone else will.
---
&gt; Come on man, you didn't look very hard. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
&gt; "our concern is what's that going to do to realm communities as some server populations dwindle over time. That's where we're looking at using sharding in a limited way"
---
&gt; "... while making sure that in the long run, as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population"
---
In that video he also said they leveraged the sharding technology to ensure that the playing experience is smooth (i.e. you won’t have thousands of players in a single leveling zone).  He made a lot of points discussing how sharding is going to be important to ensuring players can enjoy the game while they level.  He also never said some server populations WILL dwindle over time, he said some MAY dwindle over time, which is a valid concern with any MMO with multiple realms all competing for players.  I don’t think this infers that he believes a majority of the player base will quit within a couple months, seems like a pretty big conclusion to jump to in this context.
---
&gt;That's just the one I found quickly. Read between the lines and apply some common sense. Think about how many people are going to play, and think about how few servers there. The game world is simply not equipped to handle that many people. In 2004-6 it was only a few thousand concurrent, on Nostalrius it was about 13k concurrent and while fun, leveling got so bad that they had to make their own dynamic respawn system, it was completely not Blizz-like.
---
&gt;Think about it like this, based on what we know:
---
&gt;- Ion confirmed the Classic servers are "huge", way bigger than the original ones
---
&gt;- He also confirmed that each layer holds roughly the same amount as an original server (about 3.5k concurrent cap)
---
&gt;- Blizzard want layering turned off before P2
---
&gt;So if you don't think the majority of the server populations are going to quit, what do you think's going to happen..? They remove layering and then the servers are rammed with tens of thousands of people making the game unplayable? Or do you think there's barely anyone playing Classic? What do you think happens when the gates of AQ open and every level 60 is in one zone and there's no layering..?
---
Blizzard has also stated they plan on progressing increasing the amount of players each layer can have.  Which makes sense from a leveling prospecting, while leveling you don’t want it to be over crowded but as players branch out to different zones and hit max level the need for 3.5k layers decreases and it makes sense to increase the amount of players in a layer, and eventually remove layers.  You make a good point about what should they do if the realms are over populated, I think we’ve already begun to see what their approach will be.  They just released two new pvp realms yesterday and are encouraging people to migrate to these realms and are going to put queues on the full servers.  If all servers become full then they will make new realms and encourage players to roll on the new realms. 
---
For things like AQ gates opening, well we’ve seen it on private servers where you have 10k concurrent people playing and I think most people feel it makes the experience that much more epic.  I’m not sure what blizzard will decide on for server caps but I think most of the community would agree something in the range of 6k-9k concurrent player caps would be optimal since it keeps the world alive but isn’t too large to negatively impact gameplay.   
---
&gt;Yes, layering is going to alleviate start zone pressure but only because Blizzard have made the decision to make the servers hold drastically more players than before. They could have just had dozens of servers with 3.5k concurrent caps like they have in the past. Do you know why they haven't done that? Because it's exactly what led to dead servers and server merges before, and they want to avoid that. They're well aware that people are going to try vanilla for an hour, day, week, month, and give up. They don't want 24 very low pop servers, they want 6 high-pop ones.
---
It makes a lot of sense to not release a ton of servers.  First of all blizzard is in uncharted territory with classic.  They aren’t sure how popular the game is going to be.  They seem to be going with the approach of trying to make as few servers as possible and if demand exceeds the capacity of those servers then they release more servers.  It makes a lot of a sense they just released two pvp realms yesterday because the demand was high enough to warrant it.  If the demand increases more duing launch I expect to see them continue to do this approach of creating new servers and putting a hard cap on full servers to encourage players to migrate to the new realms.  It’s interesting that you say they want 6 high-pop realms but then believe they will use a 3.5k server cap.  I think in this day in age 3.5k is not really consider high pop, so if they really wanted 6 high pop realms they’d have to increase the 3.5k cap which I think they will.
---
I don't really buy that, and I don't think it's a factor.  You don't play (or not play) something because of an attachment to a character.  In my mind, you play a game if you enjoy it and you stop when it doesn't.
---
My thought on attrition for vanilla being worse is that pservers have a higher burden of entry.  You had to go seek it out, install the custom client and make an account on the pserver.  All that extra effort would imply that most of the players were ones a little more serious about playing.
---
I think in classic, we're going to see a *huge* dropoff within the first few months.
---
And of course it's up for debate, until you show me some numbers that prove it one way or the other.  Both of our arguments are fairly subjective.
---
I average 140ms to cenarion circle, which is not east-coast.  I've rolled in the NA RP server which *is* east coast, so I expect that ping to be better.
---
Yup got me, at least I’m not some retail chump that thinks anything is viable.
---
Classic has to be close to his heart. He's responsible for the losses, if any are incurred. 
---
Gotta love the suits.
---
Loch Modan everything is so far apart that you will find it becomes a better idea to go to Darkshore. Westfall is really more if you want to run Deadmines eg melee classes for gear.
---
Blizzard is releasing a polished version of world of warcraft circa 2004 in less than 2 weeks and people are hyped. There has been a significant population of people playing on illegal private servers all these years for the original warcraft experience and blizzard had been playing whack-a-mole shutting them down while claiming no one was interested in a 15 year old game. They finally gave in and made "wow classic" and everyone is counting down the hours until the servers open.
---
Probably going stalagg myself. Dedicated healbot and buffwhore.
---
just be excited for others!
---
But it's nowhere near Classic.
---
I thought you were talking about him talking about Bwomsamdi. The conversation with Garrosh isn’t hidden or lore people really shouldn’t know. Cairns and Voljin made their hatred for Garosh nice and clear to everyone.
---
1 gold, then doubles every time until 50g IIRC.
---
No, never please.
---
You can wait for phase 2, then farm DME lashers with holy nova.  Wont need a respecc I believe.
---
Yeah, that was supposed to be the funny part. You guys got real serious.
---
He says he expects to be in the mid 20's not that he is intentionally staying that level lol.
---
I liked them, but I think that LK heroics were superior. Pre argent tourney of course
---
I loved the Jedi Knight and Sith Warrior stories so much, and I enjoyed the hell out of the game until KOTFE came out.
---
I don't know why, but those expansions just killed my interest in the story
---
there's a difference between ''sylvanas condones use of the plague'' and ''sylvanas secretly planned to plague bomb EVERYONE, including her own allies, and pin the blame on people she was allied with, and raid her own city, and make herself look untrustworthy for no reason other than Being Evil Is Fun.''
---
Yeah sorry we forgot. No one know of anyone that you don't know of.
---
Playing WoW for all these years has just been preparation for this moment.
---
I wonder what's after classic?  In like a year or two.  What if they made an expansion for it?  But not TBC, something entirely different that spirals into it's own path.
---
Sorry, couldn't tell if you were trolling. Arenas were added in TBC and won't be in classic.
---
it is retail with timegated 1.12 content
---
Yeah, gotta prepare for that frostbolt spam in time.
---
People are afraid of QoL improvements cause that's what started the downfall, but I'm sure we don't need to be so black and white about it.
---
Blizz just needs to be smart about it. Guild bank is good, balancing the game is good, horizontal progression is good. Flying mounts are bad, LFR is bad. QoL improvements aren't necessarily bad, they just need to think past the first few layers and think about what it would take away from the game. I hope they slowly improve classic keeping it what it is, but also not shunning away from easy improvements (i.e. take away the good things from BC and Wrath and consider adding it to the game).
---
Retail: "What, classes use mana?!"
---
Not playing until TBC last month. :(

Recipe looks good except only using one clove of garlic in it is a crime. 5-6 at least
---
People could also do this if you ride the motorcycle in public.  This is a silly Craigslist tinfoil hat thing.

Blizzard got blocked like a week ago I think someone got caught at one of our offices lol
---
12 days my son
---
My bad haha. I used the pencil tool to scratch out her name and pic but ended up just cropping it
---
I played a bit, dont remember much but my whammy had those set fist weapons that gave 1k haste so I must have played quite a bit
---
Haha thank you &lt;3
---
I think he meant you can dps more if the tank has tf because threat is higher? That's how I understood it
---
Rebuild the Dam!
---
I feel like you answered your own question here.
---
Hey, coming from r/all and noticed all the hype here. I was a pretty hardcore WoW player back during burning crusade but I'm very lost here. Can someone give me  quicky on what the hype is? Is this update coming up kinda like what the end of the movie is as far as timeline?
---
Honestly I'd imagine the level 30s would have a harder time than the level 34s, just because of how likely you are to miss your attacks, and how likely the tank is to be critted or crushed. BIS gear won't be much of a help if you miss 25% of your attacks.
---
Think about it this way, a mob at level 41 has 205 Defense. At level 30, your weapon skill is about 150 (maybe slightly more with weapon racials and/or talents), for a difference of 55. The formula for miss chance when the difference is greater than 10 is
---
&gt;7% + ([Difference] - 10) x .4%)
---
Therefore
---
&gt;7% + (45 x.4%) = 25%
---
Thus you'll miss 25% of your attacks. At level 34, the difference is only 35, so your miss chance drops to 17%. That is a huge difference, especially if you're a tank trying to hold aggro.
---
Why does anyone want to play original wow? I don’t understand
---
Yeah I really didn't take many screen shots. I have others but they aren't as interesting.
---
Try telling this to the people in my office or classroom.
---
I remember cata launch, got to 85 in the first day, my guild (fairly strong raiding guild) had our GM, main tank, and top DPS doing heroics immediately. I was our Holy Paladin and heard my GM who was a disc priest complaining about how hard the heroics were, I went in and easily pug'd them. When we went into the first raid all of the other healers had severe mana issues while I was still around 70-80% and topping the healing charts. It was a wild first couple of weeks until they nerfed Divine Plea.
---
I don't mind new models but the new animations are shit. I don't want to be a bouncy Dwarf. Idk why blizz took away the option to use old models on retail :c
---
Except the time you took to run to the inn and back to starting zone (or grind level 6 mobs as a level 1) is more time that it will take to level to 3
---
I'm actually rolling druid myself and have went over all your same doubts. We are in this together :)
---
MAYBE in a private server that allows 1.13 clients to join. If there even exists one.
---
Cleared by whom? One might meet him in 2 months. Others never will.
---
Come to Fairbanks!
---
i was universal whilst hating them
---
WTB bone chips
---
Prolly 0 as I won't be able to get gametime before the 1st :D
---
Right, but not TukUI from what I gather.
---
Either I'm jaded or you're just really sensitive. Clearly a joke m8.
---
Curious, what about the new spell effects do you not like? It was really the only reason I gave BFA a shot because the spell effects are so cool. I would loove it if they updated the spell effects.
---
Thrall's Horde and the horde of the 1st and 2nd wars are not the same. They are as different as Germany in 1942 and Germany in 2002. (Obligatory Godwin's law reference)
---
Don’t worry dude. I know you were joking
---
For you there is, for enemy players / NPCs, no. You'll need an addon for that. In this picture it's just the OP's self-cast bar, so that exists naturally.
---
can u link it?
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
People are scared of queues, thinking other servers will have lower queues... I would rather queue and be on an active server than roll on a low queue server and it be dead in 3months.
---
I mean, I tanked it at 35 on a pserver with inflated damage values with a group ranging from 34-38 for the dps. It's doable since the mobs are 36-40 up until the last boss which is cake, but not efficient by any means.  Had a few times where I had to hamstring kite to stay alive during the actual cathedral pulls.
---
Can someone help me decide PvP vs PvE server? In the past I've generally played PvE, and I reserved my name on a PvE server, but I keep reading from commenters on this sub that there's so much fun to be had on PvP. 
---
I just really don't want to hate my time leveling if I'm always getting ganked. I plan on playing fairly casually, but with the option of becoming more serious (I can definitely see myself getting really into it). Can someone help me pro-con this?
---
Vanilla raiding is a joke. any heroic clearing guild on live will have absolutely no issue clearing anything in vanilla. The only thing that will stop people from clearing bosses is finding 40 people to be online at the same time, and farming appropriate resist gear and gearing 8 warriors for naxx.
---
If you think you require a "hardcore" guild to raid with in classic to be successful, you don't. Only 2 pieces of gear drop per boss for 40 people THAT will be the limiting factor, not skill.
---
The old Barrens await us! Those were my old warstomping grounds!
---
Just remember to watch out and not get ganked by Aean Swiftriver and her roaming rare pack of alliance outrunners. They haven't been in the game in some time, so I assume a lot of folks are going to get munched up by them. 
---
Or get buff and get revenge on them and nab the quest, thats always fun too.
---
Since I have a sub now I looked at retail. I'm still trying to find my druid's mark of the wild. I think thorns was moved to some pvp thing. I was lost. 
---
Plus I had to pick my talents and those every 15 level talents, that's the reason I quit. I loved the talent tree.
---
i wasn't saying that it was hidden or that people didn't know about it. i was only bringing it up in response to people saying even now the starting zones are more ''low key soldier adventures'' i agree that's true for some of them but obviously there are exceptions.
---
normally you don't just join the army and immediately get an audience with the leader and insight on the upper level personal conversations and political plays
---
Shadow is a DPS spec.  Stop being obtuse.  Disc had no place in Vanilla as a spec at all.
---
Yeah, gonna need 300 hours of clicking frostbolt
---
Same, it had been out for about a year when a friend gave me the hand book the game used to come with. He said "read this and if you don't want to play after, fine". I read it. I was addicted before I even played the game. I have since amassed 330 days played inside the world of Warcraft over the past 14 years. I could not be more fucking excited for classic.
---
Ah fair enough, probably not worth it on a fresh launch then, but for an alt balance would be faster.
---
Their PvE dps is pitiful dog shit trash tier level. 
---
However, some guilds would bring one if they had at least 4 warlocks because of the shadow weaving debuff. 
---
What usually ends up happening though in a min max setting is just having one holy spec into shadow weaving and just mind blast on cooldown to keep the debuff up and continue to heal. 
---
In PvP they are gods 1v1.
---
Everyone is talking about rogues and mage but u know warrior dps is op ;)
---
Spine isnt broken, then hunch as a sign of respect I think it was, so they dont stand tall over everyone.
---
Warlock or Hunter, do you want the mage fantasy or Hunter fantasy is what it boils down to.
---
Cool, thats a neat one!
---
Thanks a lot.  Lots of love from this subreddit, I understand it much better now.
---
Herod is already listed as 'Full' on the server select. Not sure if that's the same as 'Locked' but it may be because I already have a character created on Herod.
---
Paladin...”melee damage”. I mean I guess you can call it that.
---
&gt; I mean you could just say “get naxx geared T3 with thunderfury super easily by just getting carried!”
---
No I can't say that because you can't clear naxx with and AFK who's also stealing the gear of other people.
---
But I can clear SM with an AFK that won't steal any gear because the Axe that's he's looking for is a normal quest reward.
---
Finding x4 non butt-hurt players that just want to get the group going is pretty easy. Which makes it "easily" obtainable.
---
Most likely he just grabbed the name without customizing the toon when the reservations opened.
---
And now he thought it would be safe to leave the name up for grabs for the minute it takes to get the right race/class/looks for the toon.
---
Op just got really unlucky I guess.

You forgot Adderall. This is essential.

If I popped molly I'd wanna sit back and listen to music/dance, not play WoW lmao.

FWIW Hunters always have a spot in raids simply because in any given raid there is at least one boss who needs to be Tranq'd.

Dwarves have stoneskin which is better for pvp and humans have axe and sword hit which is way better for pvp. Gnomes are sub optimal all around.

Okay. 👌

I work 80 hours a week and 6-7 days a week. Skilled labor work. Nice assumptions. Take it easy

Quests, at least in beta, minus your level specific class quest we’re acceptable from level 1 in any starting zone.  Keep in mind some areas have no trainers for certain classes.  Druids for example can level in Dun Morogh but there’s no Druid trainer.
---
Ran there as a gnome on the stress test and I got every quest in shadow glen as if I were a night elf.
---
set the expectation high so if it happens, they can claim they were right otherwise no big deal.
---
same thing happens with hurricanes since Katrina. last month we had a tropical storm/cat1 and the media was saying flood stages were going to be at 25' when it actually peaked at 7-9'.
---
Which server/faction will you be playing?
---
Please tell me someone has a working version if Xperl for classic. I tried like 7 different files, 6 didnt work at all and 1 looked scuffed, character portraits greyed out and I was unable to open the settings.
---
Why is tank not something he'd want to do? DPS spends way more time having to farm consumes just to be able to powershift for reasonable DPS, tanks just need a few MCPs and tank consumes.
---
It's such a pain in the ass to get there on alliance. Even to get the bone biter quests done. The equivalent quest on horde is just walking to UC. One of the many reasons I rolled horde. (Because chain spamming SM is the only way I go from 30-40 as a warrior).
---
Not a retail player, nice try
---
At first I read 'do' more drugs and I was like why keep those around if you're making all these other positive changes...
---
Good on you though! I'm using classic as a way to distract from smoking cigs as I have set my quit date for the 27th. 
---
I will not, however, stop smoking weed. I worked too hard my whole damn life in federal jobs with drug tests so I could get an awesome enough job that doesnt whiz quiz and allows me the disposable income to enjoy it as a middle aged dude.
---
Plus it helps with the immersion for me.
---
Blizzards system in retail (recent time) is exteremly well at finding gold sellers and botters. There won't really be an issue with that in classic.
---
He's incorrect. You can do all the starting zone quests.
---
\#nochanges level - grandmaster.
---
Go PVE if you are going to play casually alone. Go PVP if you already have a group of friends you plan to play with and level together that are ready to have way slower leveling experience.
---
You can always flag yourself for PvP in a Normal server.
---
I guarantee you that everybody who has 1 1/2 hours to spend will meet ragnaros. After some time, when MC is basically farmstatus there will be rnd MC groups, just like on private servers. Then everybody will see and kill him.  
---
And how should i know who exactly will kill him, but i bet it wont take 6 months.
---
You have awakened me too soon, Executus

Disc doesn’t exist in Classic in any appreciable way.  You’ll want some Disc talents in either Shadow (for PvP) or Holy (for PvE) at 60 but while levelling a shadow build with wand specialization will have no problems healing dungeons and will greatly speed up your levelling overall.

Cat form + druid armor looking way better on night elves compared to tauren druids alone is a reason to go alliance if you intend maining druid
---
I've tried to get into WoW a few times over the last couple of years and it never stuck. How different is vanilla? Pride and accomplishment?
---
If you haven't downloaded an addon from before and don't know how or forgot how to then i suggest you to search youtube "how to download addons wow"
---
or you can download the twitch app and it will auto detect world of warcraft retail and classic and you can download addons from there in an easier way, you can also search youtube "twitch app wow addons" for that :)
---
after you download it, the addon comes with default settings that you can change from ingame if you press Esc on your keyboard and go to addons tab you should find it there
---
sure, it's always the workers' fault!
---
Too short didn't read
---
On speed kills your melee is doing all the heavy lifting anyway. 
---
Second, dps is over the course of a fight. Sure in 60 seconds they can do good dps. But a 5 minute fight and they are dog shit. 
---
Guess how often fights are less than 60 seconds?  Once everything is on farm and you can steam roll everything it doesn’t matter what dps they can do because it’s a non factor at that point. 
---
Argue it any way you want - they are only brought to help the warlocks lol.
---
Can you tell me what deol stands for?
---
Too much effort.
---
Wont happen... They need that feature in TBC to boost sales.
---
I really cannot wait for the "virgin x vs the chad y" meme to die.
---
I may have an unpopular opinion here, but if blizzard ever decided to visually upgrade retail wow old zones, I'd be pretty happy if they would optionally bring that retextured world and maybe new character models to Classic.
---
Er'e I was drinkin ale tween cuttin lumber fer the Alliance when up the hill comes this walken cowperson, and bony McBeardless. They say gimme yer flag and no one gets hurt. Well I think I've seen bigger pieces of korn in my krap dan them, say walk on thru yah mangey scoundrels and I'll ferget the smell o yah. Well bony McBeardless casts this spell where I start walken on all 4's bleetin my arse off. Of course I drop my beer, that was their first mistake. Walkin cowperson tried to turn into a cat and run when I picked up my axe, musta noticed the snot n spittle runnin from me mouth. Hackin McBeardless to pieces may have played a part too. Never make a Dorf drop his beer. Ever.
---
There's a spot for one healing priest who put the minimum number of points in shadow to get shadow weaving. That priest spams rank 1 SWP or mind blast when necessary to keep shadow weaving up and otherwise heals like every other priest.
---
If you consider that a "shadow priest" then okay.
---
Not sure if it's just me, but raid zones seemed huge back then compared to newer stuff.

**GROB MOB GROB MOB GROB MOB**

I picked up Dark Souls: Remastered when it went on sale a month or so ago. It and Guild Wars have held my attention pretty well. So much so, in fact, that it'll break my heart to drop them both when Classic launches.
---
What in the seven hells is that?
---
I'm interested as well &lt;3
---
This was my thought too
---
That’s actually such a good idea for Classic. I’ll be looking for this on launch.
---
You still gain rested when not at an Inn it's just 10 times slower.
---
It caps out at a level and a half, which at level one is like what ? 3 mins on a non-launch day.
---
So no big loss.
---
You're not correct. I do them all as a Human Pally.
---
Streamers roll on PVP servers and complain about getting ganked. Who could have known?
---
Don't forget that shapeshift forms have thir own action bar and you can use the mouse scroll wheel to switch action bars as well.
---
I am not him but shadowbolt is the big one for me. The old one is a skull with black, purple, and green effects and sounds like a freight train. I love it. The new one sounds like screaming and is happy purple.
---
But undead is better than orc for locks
---
I vote we start a petition to call all denizens of Stalagg "Stalaggots"
---
How much is the graphic improved over the old vanilla version? did they implement some of the retail graphics into classic?
---
Hit us with the chilli recipe
---
I wouldn't call it jank.  While leveling and in WPvP you definitely auto attack a decent amount.  Omen of Clarity by itself is likely to get more bang than improved thorns or nature's reach.
---
NFC tbh, I just want to have fun and make good memories.
---
The ceiling is much higher by staying ahead of the profession curve and catering to high demand items. Higher level loot is far more RNG dependent.

Play horde. Enjoy

Definitely Horde. Alliance has Gnomes
---
Never said it wasn't a bad post. Just pointing out how big of a difference level makes in classic. Lots of people seem to have forgotten how huge of an advantage three (or more) levels can be.

Yea that wouldn’t fly in my groups lol, sorry hunters
---
Yeah that's a good point. I have one friend that I'll be tentatively playing with, but not a group. So I guess we should stick to PvE
---
I'm just kidding man, the whole thing just seems way out of proportion to me.
---
Druid. Lol
---
Of course human is fine. Just not bis.
---
Rogue won’t have a harder time grouping compared to any other top tier dps. No easier, either.
---
Neither is a great leveler and some people even hold the opinion that rogue is nearly as rough as warrior.
---
I really don't get why people are against this. The argument that it gives alts access to more slots is idiotic due to mailbox storage. And trusting an officer or leader is still there, the only difference is you can see the stuff in real time, but can still get cleaned out. It in no way negatively impacts the sense of community and communication, since you still would need to communicate with people who have access to get items out.
---
There isn't one good argument against it.
---
So you're saying he should level to 10 just to delete it and spend like 2-3 min max, to get better looks? Seems like a waste of time tbh
---
I don't disagree with your points but I do think some people were considering to viability of racials even if they weren't looking for the 100% mathematically best and in that regard troll racials were weak. Berserking saw a lot of changes over the course of Vanilla, including not existing until 1.1 and needing to be critically hit to activate it until 1.9 meaning it was pretty useless in PVE and situational in PVP for a large chunk of vanilla's lifespan.
---
Ugh. I pooped wrong last week and blew out my O ring...had to use vacation time to lay at home with an ice pack on my butthole and now I can only take one or two days off :(
---
Holy shit. This had to win. What did you even do?
---
https://classicwow.live/leveling
---
Easiest leveling guide. Just open on second monitor or tablet and you are good to go
---
Taurens is Horde. Therefore Horde
---
Just place an alt near a vendor and send them to yourself. Searching for a mailbox on your main is easier than finding an arrow vendor.
---
I've got a raging Thex right now.
---
Stalagg will likely be at least high pop come launch day. Id actually be surprised if any realms were below high pop on launch. I actually think blizzard needs at least 5 more servers to handle the demand for classic
---
For a while back then, I played on a private server where that prepatch lasted for weeks. So many people rerolled paladins, it was a crazy time
---
Yeah, it's a little frustrating because from my point of view, they've hit the sweet spot. I don't want anything further than what we already have. No new models, no new textures or spell effects. Just keep it as it is and I'll be happy.
---
Yeah I ain't about that robe life, haha.
---
&gt; Might be nice to do to check out the differences in feel to the new/old game.
---
Nobody ever said it was bud, stop jerking.
---
If he wants to try classic he can download the client and play on a PServer.
---
No habla Brit, señor!
---
All you can do is mess with graphics and sound settings
---
Only those of us with a girl in our life understand I guess 😂. See you in Classic, friend.
---
Guess you play Vanilla. Pff play Shadow 1 year from launch and post here your expirience then. Cya.
---
I think they're gonna have to add at least one more pvp server. Right now all the NA PVP servers are listed as 'High' or 'Full' except for Stalagg and Fairbanks. And we've still got another week and a half before launch, so there are probably lots more people that are gonna jump into classic that haven't created characters yet.
---
Situation: playing with my long time 3v3 and RBG partners to focus on PvP, with just enough PvE to gear and stay relevant.
---
The problem is I *want* to play Ele or Warlock, but they've decided on Priest and Hunter.  Thus, we have no tank for 5 mans or elite quests in our little group.  
---
Should I go Druid for the versatility of having a tank, offheals, flagrunner, and Feral or moonkin DPS?  Are Druids as bad as everyone says?  Will I be useless when not flagrunning or healing?  RDPS is my primary role, but I've been successful/had fun on mobile versatile melee as well (Enh and WW).
---
Should I just bite the bullet and go Warr?  It would give us a tank, raid dps, and Warr/ranged/healer is a serious wrecking ball in BGs, but the solo experience kinda blows.
---
I vaguely remember Shamans being able to tank non-endgame 5 mans with Shield + Rockbiter.  Was that ever a thing?  Could it *be* a thing in a good group?
---
I wouldn't even go into the barrens because it was some orc place and I wasn't an orc. Some people I grouped with ran through there for something and I saw a bunch of orcs and turned and went back. I had gone into an 'orc place' in Ashenvale and got one shot so I thought the same thing would happen there. Sometimes I look back and facepalm at some of the stuff noob me did.
---
why not both??
---
It's still possible to do, not saying it's likely to happen. But go ahead and post your license plate on 4chan if you're certain nothing bad will come of it.
---
Questie works, but it has some bugs.

Which would be great *before* AQ20 - AQ 40 and not *after*.
---
I mean I'd never dispute that but it's not really what I'm talking about.  The Horde that drank the blood weren't tricked and anyone that says otherwise, whether they're a character in the game or a player talking about lore, would be wrong.  It'd be like 2002 Germany saying that 1942 Germany was tricked.
---
cant open the windows at night because it's still 90⁰

You're comparing the very first day of name reserves to an unexpected new server that came out under everyone's radar.
---
Good game but not goty. Goty was without a doubt odyssey!
---
I was forbidden to play WoW for a while, so I would use a cheap laptop to play trial editions with character names such as jwdajksdd. Private servers were the holy grail for me

a few days of playing and you'll stop noticing it
---
That’s exactly what popped in my head when i first read it.  Takes me back to the old EC days when all you could do to sell was “WTS all on me. Torch 3!”  I spent many hours in that zone just window shopping.
---
Shadow Priest probably does the lowest dps of all dps classes.
---
Yes you can install them now
---
I do. It's still my least favourite part of the game design (especially in pvp), but there are things I love about Classic that outweighs some of the negatives.
---
I'm not to worried about speed,  I mean I'm not looking to be world 1st or anything like that. I want to enjoy the experience,  I want to get out and explore the world since I didn't get to at the beginning.
---
This needs to become copypasta
---
I think they added a ton of great content after vanilla, unfortunately the game as a whole became unenjoyable for me, due to a slow erosion of the core gameplay. It's probably not a bad game by absolute standards, but it's not what it used to be. Around late Cata I knew they missed the turning point and after unsuccessfully trying to advocate servers without lfd, lfr, weekly nerfs and garbage like that, it was goodbye forever for me. Well... until now that is ;)
---
I don't think vanilla is the perfect version of the game, but it's good and you know what you get. Secretly I still hope that they will actually do some new developments, lead by people who understand the spirit of Classic, should it be a success.
---
Not really sure what to play, because the stuff I enjoy in retail doesn't exist in Classic.
---
So in retail I spend most of my time on monk, and to a lesser extent DK and survival hunter...What do you think I would enjoy the most in Classic since those aren't available?
---
I was originally thinking warrior, but apparently they can't charge in combat and that sounds awful. The different stances don't really sound fun either.
---
Maybe ret paladin?

Clicking is literally harder than using keybinds, especially in classic with fewer abilities. So they're just dumb people, not casuals.

You can ask the guards where to go. Talk to a guard, and they will put a marker on your map.
---
It's another QoL vs Immersion thing.
---
Hunter DPS is strong early on when no one has gear.  Hunter dps only gets worse because everyone else scales much better with gear than you do.  You always need 2-3 nunters per raid for Tranq Shot, even when their dps has really fallen off in later expansions.
---
Hunter gear is easier to get than rogue gear I believe.  Rogues have more competiton for a lot of their pieces.

https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/itemization-in-wow-classic/160757
---
&gt; Here’s an example of progressive itemization. The Tier 2 warrior Helm of Wrath originally had Spirit and Agility on it, as well as critical strike chance. In Patch 1.5.0, the helm’s stat budget was changed to Stamina, Strength, and Defense, along with elemental resistances. Then in Patch 1.7.0, the amount of Defense on the helm was reduced. In Patch 1.8.0, the 5-piece set bonus that included the helm was fixed to work with Whirlwind, and in 1.9.0, it got a better look with an art update.
---
WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12.
---
&gt; This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and **stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions**.
---
Didn’t they already say this was fixed? Your footage is old.
---
&gt;horde ~~has~~ ugly ~~female characters xD~~
---
I played on the Unofficial Swedish server on an English PVP one (Shattered Hand). It was completely fine and almost everyone spoke English. If you joined a group with a few I just requested that they said important things to do with the dungeon etc in Ebglish and it was fine
---
Exactly why I said it's not worth it if you're ahead. If you are head there are no people to do the dungeon with. If you're in the third wave of people which is like a bit ahead but still in the mass, then it would be worth.
---
The Fire Stone strats are real :O
---
Clicking is more like idiot mode than chill mode, it's harder and more effort.
---
In Retail, everywhere I go it's, "hail Champion" yet I'm still collecting flowers and killing pigs for the basic quests.
---
My point exactly =)
---
Not for all, I named my druid Melithar who is in the night elf starting zone.
---
When you think you need to be a full time WoW gamer to using keybinds - lmao.
---
I would play a minecraft character in wow before going alliance. 
---
**FOR THE HORDE!**
---
When I played elder scrolls there's a map you can filter by lots of different object types. If anyone knows of something similar for wow I'd love to have it, too.
---
I do remember in Kharanos there are guards that give directions so if you see them in an outpost there's probably trainers near by and you can just ask the guard.
---
Humans are the best rogues because of +sword passive
---
Tbh both are hell to level, warriors being slightly worse
---
Rogues are tough to find groups for because you share gear with fury warriors, most tanks won’t bring rogues/hunters/ Paladins  to groups because they would get all the gear if they don’t 
---
You can’t have both ally &amp; horde characters on a pvp server.
---
For the horde!
---
They're starting to roll out YT ads aswell on EU atleast.
---
I really do. When i played vanilla i only got to see MC, ZG and AQ20... so basically the easiest raids. Back then i had no clue as many did not have any idea.  
---
1 1/2 year ago i started playing on a private server. And the difference was huge. Every week there where multiple rnd MC, even BWL run and AQ20/ZG rnd runs. Sure sometimes raids did not go too well but in 8/10 raids were a success.  
---
As soon as good guilds level their twinks and such, i bet there will be rnd MC runs available. I don´t know how much of classic you enjoyed but raiding was really something else back then (in terms of difficulty).
---
im still in love with the female human character
---
I do wish they had that toggle too. There's no real excuse not to have it either. EQ2 had a model toggle way back in 2007 or so after their Asian release, and that game's engine was even less functional than a bicycle made out of lard.
---
If you want advantage in PvP go horde. If you don't want BG queues to be 30+ minutes later on go Alliance.

Isn't the whole game just a big time / resource drain :P

Gotta get dat main tank slot tho - best of luck

Well, I mean he is I guess. He was targeting any streamer on the pvp server during the beta and for making videos the bigger/more known streamer the better. Soda took it the hardest and now he's targeting him. I imagine if there was a bigger streamer on the horde side we'd see Rich hunt them as well.

dam
---
Are the basic oil's going to be available at launch? I figured they would not be added until after Zul Gurub came out like they were in vanilla when they were added with the world dragon patch in 1.8 i am pretty sure.
---
I remember doing runs in vanilla where we would let whatever enchanter loot all the unwanted blues from each dungeon run and DE them for shards and then we would roll or split them up as evenly as possible at the end, but yeah they will be important.
---
I was speaking specifically to the Druid part. You were saying *druid* tank is not something he'd want to do because he'd have to commit to healer/dps as Druid. That just seemed like really weird/bad information. I agree that Druid probably isn't for him but to say you'd HAVE to commit to DPS as Druid but that Tank requires 100% commitment so he shouldn't run it is kind of oxymoronic. Even worse when you consider Druid DPS will always require way more commitment/effort in and out of raids than Druid Tank.

Take a look at Joana's leveling guide, you might like that as well. Great guy who got the fasted /played time back in Vanilla made the guide, and its updated for Classic wow, he also streams on Twitch.

I've included a blank tab, as well as a tab that has my hunter keybinds.
---
no biggie :P
---
I'm about to release version 1.2 with a bunch of new features too. Unless people find bugs, will probably be the last version for Classic Launch. Made myself a nice markdown will all of the features / configurations

Good strategy for a paladin, not so good for a warrior. Dps and tanks will get miss/resist/glace/dodge/parry at a way higher rate against higher levels. 3 levels above you is a raid boss. 6-8 lvls above you is just not reasonable, at all. At this point, you're either getting carried by the rest of your group, or not clearing the dungeon if the rest of your group can't carry you.
---
Since your heals aren't modified by your target lvl, you can heal dungeons while underleveld pretty easily, only missing at the worst 1 extra rank of your healing spell and a few points of int/spi, which isn't a huge deal.

---
Ahahahahahha
---
This is awesome. It reminds me of the first guild wars. We had no AH so trade was only made from player to player with a similar system that your addon provides. Would love to have that in classic.
---
Dwarf is arguably the best PvP rogue race on alliance. Stoneform removes bleeds and poisons (including Blind)
---
There are no realms hosted on the east coast, only Chicago and Los Angeles and the realm’s timezone doesn’t always mean it gets hosted in the closest data center.
---
Yes you have to wait.
---
Sorry kid but the loot tables are progressive. For example perdition's blade will not drop from Rag until a later phase. 
---
That's progressive itemization. You wasted your time.
---
Isn't that how all night elf players play wow?
---
Nope, im from Russia. Soory for bad english.
---
They melt face in pvp.
---
What about Fortnite? Checkmate atheists.
---
You'll be good, from my experience on an rp-pvp server on retail most people just go about their business and most of the rp happens in guild or by events. As long as you aren't ruining other peoples rp most people won't care what you do. If someone does come up to you and tries to start rp just simply explain in whispers that you don't feel like it atm or something.
---
What realm you on my man?
---
Wait there’s text on the right side?
---
I expect getting to 5 to be the hardest part of launch day. So many people in the same small space. Doing it 3 times day 1 sounds painful. Day 2 and 3 will have far less people in say deathknell. Making it much faster to get your quests done and get to 5.
---
The original class design for the Warlock was a hybrid melee/caster that wore leather.
---
With this scenario if you want to heal the answer is easy... go Shaman
---
Both Mage and Lock are pretty even when it comes to world pvp. In the early phases Mages would be more desirable in raids while Locks bring a lot of utility
---
You are correct.
---
I wouldn't mind it if it was capped at a more reasonable price. Like 5-10 gold. It was to keep inflation down so i'd be happy with a small fee for it
---
Spriest and Ret fight for the lowest dps.
---
You can play both factions on a PvE server, not that I'm recommending you do that.
---
Personally I found the rogue class to be much more fun in Vanilla. They are more self sufficient than a warrior and I disliked relying on a healbot in pvp. Rolling as a tank will be the quickest way to get groups though. Rogues can get groups because their dps is top tier but not nearly as easily as a tank. 
---
Basically, I would start with whatever role you're more enthusiastic about. Go warrior first if you wanna tank a lot. Go rogue first if you'd rather pvp/dps.
---
JFC I hope this is a shop oterhwise you are a fucking asshole.
---
I'm hoping 40 but that depends on the early economy, I might sidetrack a bit spending time on professions so 35 is also a possibility.
---
Couldn't imagine being this much of a purist. Just enjoy the game brother.
---
And this is why the alliance is a shit faction.
---
Pay your god damn workers man.
---
Do what I did. Just play a bit to get your 1-10 leveling down. Play a character you don't plan on playing in Classic. Don't level anything past the teens. Think of it like the stress test where the character is getting deleted.
---
And i want playable Murloc
---
How to find this superior class discord?

What's your thought on not having the newer models?
---
hell no.
---
Same would be nice. I’m not saying we should just keep recycling games but it would be hard to argue that an updated Diablo2 engine with a modern battle net lobby wouldn’t do far better than d3. People want new classes and new content but maintain the integrity of the game. Counterstrike is literal proof of this. They tried changing things with source and people stuck with 1.6. CSGO went ahead and just gave us 1.6 with better graphics and people came roaring back and played the updated version. WoW has the opportunity to do this. Keep the same systems in place as vanilla. And if they want to expand on it they can
---
I never played WoW but if it's anything like the 2007scape servers being released it's going to be insane for you guys
---
That music though, so different nowadays
---
You only get 3 minutes
---
to be honest, after playing vanilla for years I am still unsure how those boat routes go.  I usually pay a mage 1g for a portal
---
They are in the game from the start, but be warned the reputation values given by quests are significantly higher on private servers than what they will be in classic. I am planning to get my kittty mount as a human but it wont be as quick as all the private server numbers are far too high. Expect to be close to revered or a little into revered after every quest. Alot of cloth will be necessary.
---
Yup, all alliance characters stand straight up, all horde characters have kind of back problems.
---
Alliance streamers seem a lot more chilled about being ganked.

---
My 2nd kid is due 4 days before release. I'll be playing on a laptop at the kitchen island wearing a baby sling rocking back and forth. I'd say that counts as exercise.
---
The expectation is the population drops enough so that layering is removed and queue times / server population are manageable.
---
Thank you !
---
Best thing to do is a quick google search
---
Bottom line per the OP's question -- no, they cannot compete with mage or rogue DPS. If a priest is in the raid using shadowform and mindflay and stuff, it's for some social reason rather than for a gameplay advantage.
---
Anyone who wants that one shadowpriest DPS spot, it's going to come down to who you know and how much they like you or how good you are at playing the butt of memespec jokes for everyone else's entertainment.
---
Most guilds will not be using a bear at all.
---
Can someone explain to me the relevance of this post? I played Wow for maybe a year, before the first expansion came out....I've been trying to get back into it, but I only play the version without the expansions (or at least I didn't pay for any of them). Does this have to do with what's called Vanilla?
---
&gt; or layer forever.
---
This actually terrifies me.
---
Is that possible?
---
I have narrowed down what I want to play to either rogue or mage.
---
My only concern is what I would enjoy the most since I will have limited time to play(5-10 hours every week, probably closer to 5), although I will have more time to play at launch.
---
I enjoy world pvp and dungeons, and will probably not be able to raid much at all, apart from the occasional pugs.
---
I love stealth, and being able to walk around unseen. I also love being a mage, having many tools to control my target and the utility in form of teleports and food/water.
---
I'm leaning more towards playing rogue. 
---
My questions are: will I have a bad time leveling as rogue over a mage, given how slower they are and my limited time to play? Since I won't be raiding that much, will I be that much worse for it, than if I were a mage with similar gear?
---
Uh nowhere only has two servers.
---
No, most of the guilds being premade before release will fall apart, wait til 60 and join a guild that is ready to raid
---
Thank you so much for your work.  When I found out pfquest wasn't ported to Classic, it was a let down.  I know nothing about coding so doing it myself was not an option.  But then I found your port!  People like you are the real heroes.
---
The Chad logical reasoning vs The Incel nochanges smoothbrain.
---
Nobody playing classic wow is 12. You can't use that excuse anymore haha.
---
It's not just about "better" it also about being different.  Although I think you could argue some things are better.  There has been some great content, like Timeless Isle.   Many of the newer zones are beautiful and well designed (like Pandaria zones and the WOD zones).  The Darkmoon fair is great. Some of the holidays are nice. Pet battles are a nice side game if you like it, and can be totally ignored if you don't.  I feel like some of the skills and class design are improvements over plain vanilla.  But you could also say there are pros and cons to the class systems in different expansions.   I think some itemization improved after vanilla, and the low amount of gold you have in vanilla to buy skills, etc. is both a pro and a con, but not necessarily better.   I can see a lot of improvements by the time they got to WOTLK.    Removing some of the grind was good, IMO.    I think having more FPs and making you spend less hours just running places is an improvement.     
---
Many of the newer quests are much better than vanilla kill 10 X quests. Some of the quests with vehicles are good.  Many of the small newer areas can be very challenging and have rares and strong mini-bosses in them.  I would say some of the areas in MOP and later are well designed.  Many quests are well done.   This is a big improvement: the story quests and cut scenes in later expansions are good (WOD, Legion, BFA).  The story telling is good at this point with some nice cenematics and cut scenes that you are put into.
---
no not me specifically he spewed his shit all over a public place that includes me.  I think you got some on you.

---
My footage is from the last test in date, it's not old and it is a new one, the old ones are fixed yes
---
Yes. Tested myself on the final stress test.
---
On that note I take it the duskwood wolf rare is going to be the nerfed version at launch? In otherwords not having attacks dealing shadow damage rather than physical.
---
classic won’t have a smooth launch even with layering, dynamic spawning and queues.
---
I’m gonna be playing on a 10 year old hp laptop my family found in storage and gave to me lmao
---
haha yeah that music was very quintessential WoW video in the early 00's
---
Think I’m gonna speed through the tournament of power in dbz super to pass the time
---
My Hunter ended up having no friends on pserver. My priests in vanilla, Paladins in wotlk all had huge lists of proper wanting to group.
---
Just play alliance my dude. Quest in Darkshire. Best zone in the game
---
How not with queues of 30.000+ per realm? And what if you get disconnected while waiting?
---
"clicking is more like idiot mode than chill mode."
---
Yeah I don't think I'm going to listen to something someone like you says. You can see yourself out.
---
Yeah that would be fine, too.
---
Lol. Locks at lvl 15 with a full duration fear kill anything. Fear is busted at that level. You did before you can do anything haha
---
You think you do ... but you do. You really really do.
---
I dont know, maybe ask them. But the 10.5k queue that I waited in took less than 10 minutes before I could login and create a character. Maybe actual release will be a different experience, but I can't imagine it being far worse with the layering.
---
I'll be porting my add-on Focused to WoW Classic once it hits: [https://github.com/haggen/wow/tree/master/modern/Focused](https://github.com/haggen/wow/tree/master/modern/Focused)

Im pretty sure the sever is full so Im not sure how new players are going to join ya.
---
I will if my name is not taken. Otherwise I'll just deal with it.
---
it's too long and contains nothing clipworthy are my main issues.
---
I think they waited until the recent BFA patch was out for a while and the world first race was over. They would rather have people play BFA because microtransactions but now it’s time to ride that Classic wave.
---
Well Naxx had 15 bosses, and AQ40 was HUGE! having to walk around there at 1st hoping for a mount drop was annoying

And the lords of the underworld!

---
We're going home boys.
---
LOOOOOOOL!! That right there is World of Warcraft.
---
I have the same dilemma and I think I'll be going with Rogue. I really want stealth, and while Mage is absolutely awesome, I just really like the freedom of rogue. But at the same time, group pvp is way more fun with mage... and rogue it gets harder the more people show up.
---
It's incredible how the entirety of Classic takes up a couple of GB. It runs great on my I integrated graphics laptop.
---
I'd still like the option of high res models+textures for my desktop PC.
---
Not necessarily, given the dropoff most people expect. If the dropoff has been overestimated they will just open up free transfers and/or new servers as necessary.
---
Either way, layering is being removed so it’s not a big deal.
---
Leeroy
---
How will I find this, when it is out? :(
---
Basically before 40 that's what you would do anyway, none of the shadow talents past spirit tap are very good before you get deep enough to afford shadowform.
---
Post 40-45 your spec is going to be a lot slower.  As for the talents, imp renew sucks because it is on the base value, so no +spell power is affected by the talent.  Your priority on mana talents is misplaced in my opinion, because spirit tap is sufficient to go all the way to 60 without having to stop and drink a single time so long as you properly pace your fights (which is mostly just not casting too much, and wanding so that the 5 second rule triggers before the kill).  Crit is also not very good early on because it's super difficult to build it.  At the very least you should go another 2 in shadow and get the extra 6 seconds on SWP because that is a huge efficiency boost, roughly 30% more efficient for the same mana. 
---
I guess I wonder, why are you doing this?  You can heal just fine while lvling as shadow.
---
Why wouldn't 144 be feasible? I hit 144 at 1440 no problem maxed.
---
Why do you want to play horde AND not leave the alliance? What's your draw toward alliance? Simply rolling 2 toons is manageable so you can do both.
---
But all I want to do is play WoW and I don't have BfA :/
---
You mean like a list of where all the dungeon quests are at, and their locations?  
---
What quests lead to a great upgrade?  
---
Where to get all the keys and attunements for everything that needs to be unlocks and summoned?  
---
Best route to level for each level for my class and race?  
---
When and where my friends should meet up and start questing as a group then splitting up again?  
---
Why would I plan all that out ? :P
---
Yes the work the same way as retail except theres no focus frame afaik.
---
Not that I now of.  I either bind mine to numlock keys like nerdfleks, or to the keys I don't use with my normal keybinds on the right half of the keyboard. Ex. y,h,b,u,j,n.
---
Did they ever fully implement the action cam? I used it a couple of times but heard it was still in 'beta' so didn't bother with it.
---
Very nice! I'll check it out on release.
---
Yeah, it was unfortunate the Shift click tradeskill that links to all your trained skills was removed for classic wow.  I was trying to tell people what I had to trade in the stress test, but I gave up because of the work involved in a temporary character.  I just gave away as much as I could.  Then when another person asked me what enchants I had to offer, I said I couldn't link him the skill and that was that.
---
I still plan on launching Classic the vanilla way, and NOT through battle.net
---
This is the real answer right here.

---
This is my goal. I only took two days off of work so my time will be limited compared to others. If I had the week off, I'd say 45.
---
I sure hope my gtx 1080 and 1440p can do 144fps at ultra. Definitely a max graphics kind of person. Heh
---
How? It's 100% max for me, and the game is in borderless
---
The Nikk--- I mean Blackrock Slicer!
---
What is even more impressive is the whole guild having no fucking idea about agi affecting wands.
---
You will feel much more powerful if you spec shadow for leveling! 
---
5/5 Wand Specialization is a much though. 
---
If you want more inspiration, look out for Lezonta’s streams/videos - the guy is the priest GOD! 
---
Good luck out there!
---
No you can still roll PvP
---
but expect que times
---
There is no harm in joining a guild beforehand, but I would not put too much stock into any preformed guild that is not actively raiding together right now, be it on private servers or on retail. 
---
Regardless of joining a preformed guild or not, I will try to stay in contact with players I could see myself raiding with. See where they end up with, and if they're happy with their raid. If they are, maybe there's a chance to join with their recommendation. Or they know of an opening in another guild.
---
I assume there will be a lot of shuffling going on before BWL release. By then, I think, the people still playing will keep playing, and most will have found a guild that works for them.
---
Got voluntold to go to a course during the 26-29 so I won’t play very much initially, but I did take the 30th - September 8th off.
---
I would ask them if I could lol. The difference between name reservation and launch will be that people were logging off after they had their names, and weren't actually logging into the game. Even though servers are layered, there will still be a cap on how many layers a server will have I'm pretty sure, and people won't be logging off nearly as quickly.
---
I was recently pondering on similar problem. The number of priests around is ovewhelming, I think it may have something to do with all the pserver expert guides on classes. Telling people that priest is the only way to heal so all the healers who didnt play vanilla and dont know better, are inclined to roll priests
---
Thank you for reminding me this, I shared it with our warlocks
---
Feralas was always my favorite zone...!
---
You might wanna go to the doctor and check your hormones, you might have cancer

Most rare would probably be female tauren hunter. Most common would be a toss up of human/orc warrior and undead mage.
---
GL with that. Extremely rare.
---
From my experience, the people that had the most fun with PvP were the people that were good at PvP not certain classes etc. You'd do well to study all classes and know how to counter spell A with spell B etc. If you do this then you'll have great success with any class. Failing that play a rogue and sneak up on people 😉

Not really. If you overtake your buying base too much it will be useless because people won't trace capital to buy.  If you want to make gold, fish like a maniac. Oily fish and deviates always makes money.
---
I never lasted past level 5 on private servers because it felt meaningless. That private server could be gone tomorrow and then all those hours playing was for nothing.
---
I can now properly relive classic, my character wont disappear the next day and I get to play everything in the best vanilla wow way possible. No weird private server shenanigans.
---
My first toon, a night elf hunter. I almost quit the game altogether when I got here, I was convinced the difficulty was going to continue to spike and couldn’t take it. Luckily once I got my pet all was good.
---
As a shaman,  this title was a whirlwind if emotions
---
It just doesn't suit them, feels like a weird combination. While I'm against most class/race combos they introduced later I think dwarves make better shammies and monks. Maybe if the dwarf rogues could throw kegs.
---
Overlord Ramtusk
---
So what do you *like* about Classic?
---
FYI - 30 bars is max rested XP, thats equivalent to 1.5 levels, it takes 10 real time days of your character resting to max out(one bar every 8hrs).  So every 10 days burn that rested XP to maximize.
---
Yeah that's probably true. Still I will probably do it on day 1. I'm not rushing leveling my main so don't really care if I waste time. Also I believe the servers open at midnight 24.00 CET. Will be sleeping then and not playing until later the next day. Hopefully lots of people stayed awake so the starter zones have less people.
---
That was much more simple than expected - awesome :) Thanks a bunch
---
Sure.  So just look at your goals and do what you want.  Many people in vanilla were altoholics and never even got to 60 with a single character.
---
LAYERING
---
Pretty close.
---
Especially this!
---
So would you say level as something else the whole time and then respec to holy at max level or?
---
Apparently so :)
---
This sounds amazing but please, whatever you do, don't implement a auto-say function! It will be clogg up the cities with auto-ad spam and the experience will be less because of it. If people want to advertise they can do it manually like before.
---
&gt;The last few things I saw were some major bugs like people being put into different shards than their party members etc.
---
They added a timer after combat, xp, looting, or honor so that you couldn't switch layers. Which means if you join a party during the countdown, you can't instantly hop to their layer, instead you have to wait out the cooldown, keep doing the action, you keep resetting the cooldown.
---
This is to combat the problem where 1 person has a group in every layer, and just picks a herb then joins next layer, picks flower, joins next layer, etc. It also solves the problem where you fight in the arena and then before you die or get into serious trouble you accept group invite and vanish from the layer.
---
So not a bug, working as intended.
---
Rogue can farm really well with lockpicking runs in BRD.
---
I was thinking more aesthetic/feel than convenience.
---
Increases wand damage too. Its literally the best stat priest can have
---
Thanks, will try it!
---
One day someone was classifying the various dungeons into different types.  Basically, you have the wide-open pathless dungeons (like BRD, etc.), and then you've got the "on rails" dungeons that only have one possible path (Scarlet Monastery, UBRS, etc.).  In that moment I immediately realized that was the sole factor that determined which of the Classic dungeons were my favorites.  I hate all the wide open ones, and I love all the 'on rails' ones.
---
You only need one lock to give blood pact to the tanks. 1.12 warriors have higher base tps generation, too. It's true that tps will be lower compared to pservers, but unless you do more dps with that spec or you're assigned to give blood pact buff, there's no point in getting threat reduction.
---
Hehe I feel the same about orc rogues. Just feels wrong to me.
---
Unfortunately, our camp was compromised, so we had to move it. I'll mark the location on the [map](https://discord.gg/aKbNQzR).

I’ve not seen any evidence of that but if it’s true I’m not mad. He was good at GTA RP and his community is pretty chill.
---
MC will be full cleared by week two, MAYBE week one if some of the crazier people really push.  It will most definitely be cleared week two though.
---
I would add to my reply that Guild Banks also make the 'personal guild' a lot more feasible.  I loved having all of my alts (I'm an altoholic) join my own guild once they introduced it and you could access ALL of your common stuff from your bank alts from any character.  You had to pay a lot more for it, and you lose the privelege of being in an actual guild so it was only useful for alts, but it was a great change for me to efficiently move stuff around between alts, have a common gold source, and consolidate important stuff in one place.  When you have 6+ alts all with random crap everywhere it can get extremely complicated.
---
you know in a way i understand you. Alliance has a more clean view, whilst Horde is more...sloppy. When I go inside stormwind or ironforge, i feel like im in lord of the rings. When i go inside orgrimmar, its like mordor. and undercity minas morgul
---
&gt;the disappearing platform from the lich king
---
That was the easiest part of the fight 
---
The hardest part was your tank not getting 1shot lmao
---
I intend to yeh, I really like that zone. Partially because it also provides the first taste of world PVP :)
---
&gt;Kratos is so whiny
---
I don't get this at all. The only time I would consider him whiny is right after the second boss fight. Even then it was short lived.
---
MC will be full cleared by week two, MAYBE week one if some of the crazier people really push. It will most definitely be cleared week two though.
---
Bye.
---
If you didnt move your mage, how'd you get those post-vanilla bags?
---
&gt;Every time somebody caught him in a legitimate 1vs1, he died in seconds.
---
That's exactly the moment when a reasonable human being spends a minute to think:
---
"Hmmm. I want to PvP but running at people solo makes me dead. Hmmm. What if. What if... Hold on a second what if I don't do it solo then?"
---
If someone is worse than me and 
---
 gets their ass handed to them every time, engaging me in a fair combat over and over is usually just dumb. And avoiding me is wasteful. If there is a way to wipe my smile off of my face, go for it. Get a friend or five. Wait for a right moment. Pull 20 mobs on me. Be creative. 
---
Being cunning, unfair and shady is literally a part of rogues' class identity. PvP server = no rules and a lot of blood. Not a series of honorable duels. People will gank you, people will kill you 3v1, people will wait until you're low from fighting an elite, then kill you and steal the elite as well. That's a part of the game. You have every right to be mad at those people. But they have every right to continue doing it. And you also have every right to play on a pve server instead if this is too stressful/rage inducing for you. No shame in that. I'm gonna do that as well.
---
You just have to understand that on a PvP server if someone annoys you by killing you, you have to face it in some way. Get better and kill them. Get 10 friends to rip them apart and /point /laugh at them. Leave the zone. Sneak around them. Something. It's a living world full of players. If that annoys you, you picked a bad game or at least a server.

Sammmeeee! I absolutely loved the dungeons and heroics in cata when it came out, and seeing the world redone was breathtaking. Cata stands as my favorite expansion.

Ohhhhhhh

Do I even have to write the joke down

Do we know the rate at which these rares spawn in an instance, and do we know respawn times on the rares outside the instance?

Only if you're in a guild who is really dedicated. That means 40 people ready to go every single day/night.

I think people really forgot how vanilla is not just ez mode. You don't get tokens and just collect loot. There is actually a grind required and certain gear you'll need to progress.

WRONG

You said it best brother!

how much has the gameplay changed? I liked the game back in 2007-08, haven’t really paid much attention to modern WoW. I think i can understand what you’re saying.
---
Nice one brother
---
Oh man I was close :p
---
Oh wow, was randomly googling "the relentless frostwhisper" to see if the old guild website was still around and this message popped up. Hi fellow resto druid from [The Relentless!](https://i.imgur.com/bG0N1Df.jpg)
---
Really important to savor all the quests asking you to collect 10 bear asses. I dont really get why people act like the writing is even remotely good in the quests. Theres a reason most people dont bother reading them.
---
Full prep and cook time will always take a bit if you're picky. You can totally spend the 30min the day before to prep veggies and slice meat while tweaking sauce though. All about storage. Gameday is literally unbagging and throwing it on the skillet. Takes 15tops of you like them well cooked.
---
I wish there was an option for the new Models.
---
I guess this comes down to personality. Are you comfortable with the thrill of ending op in a 1v1 in the middle of alterac? Of course the ganking sucks but in most cases I just res at the graveyard and log off if someone’s camping my corpse. No biggie.
---
Back on Nostalrius I had just got my rogue alt to 60 and had this item drop for me **3 hours** before blizzard announced the cease and desist.
---
True story. It added at least 25%+ to my rage of Nost being shut down.
---
While playing the stress test, I chose a 3.5 speed staff from a very early tauren shaman quest and with rockbiter on that thing absolutely slapped stuff. Hit harder than a rogue's 5pt evis at the same level. 
---
My rogue felt really weak and had trouble with rare spawns til I got garrote and suddenly stuff would melt down really fast. Levelling up felt rewarding.
---
I suspect for gold for mount and (for me at least) enchanting.
---
I think it is weatherDensity not intensity
---
no, layers will be gone before phase 2 goes live.
---
Instead they will punish us with queue times and entice us with other servers, possibly free realm transfers until we all fit on Herod.
---
I like this a lot!
---
Good work!
---
2 hours is a small price to pay for a gorgeous, clean UI.
---
Ye
---
Private servers
---
The Warrior was so good I rolled two. A pureblood Marauder and then a human Juggernaut. 
---
I think the Inquisitor was my favorite story, though. But then the Bounty Hunter and Agent were real good too. I just love the Empire. 
---
I never finished the Smuggler and I don’t think I ever made it past Coruscant as a Consular.
---
I would
---
Like to join!
---
Sounds like a good reason to roll on golemagg to me
---
Bro, do you even PS4?
---
I think it is weather Density, not intensity
---
Ugh I thought I was deciding between rogue and priest, but now you just made mage sound right up my alley with how they play. Plus I want to make some side goal through selling portals haha
---
&gt; privelege
---
Yes officer, this comment right here.
---
If by fun you mean on rails with no player freedom then yeah I guess they're fun.
---
My Dwarf wears a dress :(
---
You can do a lot with 3 hours a day everyday. And weekends. Play what you really wanna play. Join a guild that raids at the times you want to play. Or on weekends.
---
I still kind of wish the new character models were in the game. If they are I haven’t noticed, mine def look lower res. The models just seem a little out of place compared to the texture and detail from some areas.
---
I was disc through AQ40. Made so many close friends by buffing them with PI ;)
---
I will be listening to this playlist all day at work now, thank you lol
---
No bear form until 10, no cat form until 20 and even then you only start with claw and rip...don't get rake until 26, pounce at 36, ferocious bite in the 30s as well. Cat doesn't really come fully online until mid 30s.
---
In the end, obviously you have access to everything and are given intervals in which you've 'mastered' basic abilities to 10 and bear stuff until 20. By 60, you should be on your way to utilizing all of your forms and their unique advantages for every situation.
---
I would go Warlock. Last time around you were doing the supporting, this time I’d advise doing all the damage. Groups love locks for hearthstone and summoning so you should get into raids just fine. Plus this is your one and only time to relive vanilla wow but different. So no point trying to relive your past experience make a new one!
---
Both Rich's highway men and the Oogas are the best. Can't wait to see their shenanigans on real classic.
---
Gtx 1070 could do 144hz 1440p with an i7 8700k so you should be set.
---
good bot
---
No shield? Maybe they didn’t start with a shield in Classic. Idk. I’ve never actually played vanilla and haven’t played retail since, like, Mists of Pandaria.
---
now that's what i'm talking about
---
Turning in my armorless tiger for a shiney one, i was server first doing that, also be the last one to live with the regrets of doing so...
---
Frankly it's disgusting.
---
I just hope it's not dead. I hate this stupid server anxiety I have right now even though there are still tens of thousands of people who still haven't subbed to play Classic
---
who is/was Thex?
---
Ugh. Thank you for making this decision harder. Do we know if server transfers will be available? I think in vanilla you couldn't do pve-&gt;PvP but you could do vice versa. If that's the case in classic, then maybe I'll start on PvP?
---
Implying this isn't what peak pvp skills look like????
---
I can handle wide open ones like Mara, it's ones like BRD and LBRS that drive me crazy.  There are multiple floors and a lot of the pathing is through buildings so the map isn't very useful
---
Thanks, I am not new to PVP in MMO's so I am not scared about that. In archeage I racked in close to 4k open world kills in the few months I played.
---
I think im going to say fuck it and play a tauren druid as my friends are going horde.
---
You forgot how many people in Vanilla didn't know about the all powerful shift click. When I learned about it, it was a magical moment.
---
They already did.
---
In NA, it’s gonna be August 26 @ 3 PM pacific time, 6 PM eastern time
---
Ill be rolling on Stalagg!
---
I'm there right now on an alliance character and don't see him. Either fake or phased :/
---
Who doesn't?
---
Make one for my New twitch channel! 😂😂😂
---
Would you say playing 4-5 hours a day is enough to clear Naxx?
---

---
I'm confused. Pummelers are for Feral and Cloth is for resto.
---
Feral isn't that good in PvP. 
---
PvP on Druid isn't about kills, it's about objectives.
---
&gt; !RemindMe 12 days
---
Help help! I'm being repressed!
---
just say you  pulled a muscle and it's gone bad again
---
NE Missouri, going Ally this time PVE.  Just decided could days back to come back.
---
I may be spreading bad info but I've seen it stated the Eastern servers are actually Chicago based.  Food for thought for everyone in Missouri especially STL area
---
It was one of the interviews or panels. Some other dev said it too in one of the yter interviews.
---
sent you a message :)
---
Yea, I've been going through them like crazy. Only in order of what topics sound most interesting now that I've listened to all the more recent ones.
---
They will not reverse AH transactions. They will reverse trades where someone is being deceitful or malicious but AH trades are final.
---
GDKP PuG runs were incredibly common, and will be MORE common this time around almost guaranteed.
---
Every meme has a lifespan.  Time to euthanize this one.
---
get some meth, adult diapers, and a case of water
---
Yeah tell me the real spots
---
Oh dang. Didn't realize it was that easy. Thank you very much.
---
Yes and the sky is blue. Still was pumping during classic wow times.

PVP Pros
---
- there is nothing like leveling on fresh PVP realm
---
- the threat of fights is exciting and keeps you on your toes
---
- you will play differently and "smarter" to protect yourself
---
- world PVP can simply be fun
---
PVP cons
---
- ganking and corpse camping are definitely real things
---
- depending on the type of person you are, you might never be able to fully relax in the open world. You won't get the carefree, quiet nights of farm you'd get on a PVE realm. And that's the big thing for me - day to day activity has a different tone.
---
- sometimes you simply can't do something alone because someone makes it their agenda to bother you until you log off
---
- you're stuck with it. You can't simply unflag like on a PVE realm. 
---
This is a decision I've struggled with as well. I was initially going to roll PVE but the guild I am playing with in retail is going PVP so I'm going with them. I'm not gonna lie - I'm a bit concerned for my long-term enjoyment of the server. But I'm very excited for the first few weeks/months. As long as I have friends and a guild, I think I'll be fine. 
---
I would advise you to give it a shot if you're really curious. If you're playing casually anyway, the worst that can happen is you reroll PVE after a couple months, having already experienced the once-in-a-server-lifetime launch PVP. Just don't let yourself be peer pressured into it. PVP realms are *not* the only way to experience Classic.
---
Yeah the warrior one has me scratching my head, IIRC the consensus among most warriors is you level fury then switch to arms for the sweeping strikes/pvp/tactical mastery. This has it backwards.
---
I guess not lol.... At least not with this armor
---
Literal god
---
As A guild on Herod. Thank you for leaving. Releasing Stress on Herod will be far better for everyone.
---
I do fear that what you are trying to run away from will follow you. There is almost no chance that Stalagg will not be full at launch
---
This is awesome, congrats! The longer you continue this way the more the benefits compound, delayed gratification is so much more valuable than instant gratification and binge behavior, that I've definitely learned over time (with countless relapses along the way of course). It sounds like we're on a very similar path with a similar history. It won't be easy in the early stages, but that hardworking, doing what you know is right and not what you know is wrong, balanced lifestyle kind of energy is so much more potent than the hardcore all in mindset in gaming, that it can even push you well ahead of the vast majority of players especially as they burn out, you just get there with less time spent but consistently, with higher energy and more of other resources to tap into.
---
where are you playing
---
you said it best.
---
Warriors *
---
lol that dismount got me. Great video!
---
I couldn't agree more. It's gorgeous beyond belief.Hopefully one day we'll get more improved textures, and potentially a toggle for the new player models
---
What's peggle, and is this on curse/Twitch?
---
Can confirm. I have a 1060(6gb) with a 6 core i7 playing on max in 1080p ultra wide res. I get 200-300 FPS. But I play on a 144hz monitor so I can only see the 144fps
---
Absolutely nothing. Don’t google guides or things you should be doing first or anything. Go in completely blind and expecting nothing and you will be surprised and come out with an amazing experience once you finally hit max level.
---
Hopefully they go a different route then just re-releasing the content that got us to where retail is.  Retail sucking is what caused people to want classic to begin with.
---
I hope they create an alternative timeline of content
---
i was so upset when he wasn't shifting into travel form to get out of root
---
Well, yeah - but that's still their down time. Unless you're grinding on top of a mailbox, you still need to travel to one.
---
You dont have to do anything you dont want.  Join a guild that isnt hyper focused on min/maxing.   Im going druid for end game healing.  But still want flexibility outside of raids.
---
I feel like this will happen a lot in the coming weeks... Hope people don't get too discouraged and leave!
---
No where. Feral druids don’t touch anything except their battle rez and innervate buttons.
---
*Laughs in Tauren*
---
Get some addons that fits you , have a plan for leveling , decide what faction and class u wanna play
---
you do what you want
---
This isnt an addon this is legit targeted harassment. Best of luck!
---
No, last chance to test and adjust addons for Classic was during the stress test last week.
---
Oh I have no idea, but yeah finding that info may help your decision.
---
But yeah, personally I just like the added stress/excitement of being out in the world and seeing a way higher level nearby and knowing I need to hide, or seeing someone near my level and wondering whether I can take them down or not before they realize I'm there.
---
I managed to get Annoyance snagged. I'm quite happy.
---
Look for info on classes and just play whatever you feel like fun. Enjoy the ride and don't bother thinking about gearing up for raids or anything, the time will come when you have to.
---
If, after looking at what class do you like, look at how's PVP with it and looks like fun, try going for a PVP server. If not, you can always join a PVE server and go PVP whenever YOU want.
---
Just enjoy the game, it's just the best advice anyone can give you.
---
Torn between druid, mage, and warrior as my main. I am used to playing support type classes over DPS in my gaming lifetime (was primarily a healer in my WoW career) and have been thinking of switching to being a primary tank this go-round to mix things up. I am also thinking of a mage because of how good they will be at farming early on for gold. 
---
I know that mage will likely be the best farmer/grinder, both during leveling and at 60. How do feral druid and warrior (not-prot) compare in terms of level 60 farming? I don't plan on raiding much, I'm more interested in doing old-school rep grinds, lots of dungeons, and other things of that ilk. 
---
Assuming all the characters are reasonably geared for 60, how do feral druid and non-prot warriors compare with mages for level 60 farming?
---
Where's the nearest inn for trolls and orcs in the  Durotar starting area?
---
Not a speed running zone, sometimes you get stuck accidentally running around the 'needles' the long way. Slow Fall is a huge plus in questing because you can jump from the high points into the direction you need to get.
---
you dont seem to like lotr
---
I’m guessing 3-4 months on average.
---
To get away from trolls like you
---
Hm okay, that's tempting me more to a priest then over mage and rogue. Hmmm
---
Why? What rule does it violate?
---
Yeah ofc. Ragni is basically a meme weapon for pvp. Its rly strong but who brings a 2H weapon to a raid when its not called...ahm I can‘t remember the name of the weapon with the ap boost
---
I got this weapon recently on my Warrior at lvl 56 on a private realm, dropped in Winterspring. Yeah i know private server but man was I a proud warrior for a moment.
---
Yeah the environments and atmosphere has always been top notch. Pandaria was amazing, Wrath too
---
I doubt it. When they first made the game. They kinda had no clue what they were doing. I don't think blizzard ever expected the idea that you wouldn't take an enhance into the raid. Or that you would just main line the most optimized specs.
---
This. Just start the game as we all did when Classic originally came out, you'll meet people along the way that know more than you and will bestow their wisdom upon you.
---
yeah, these things happen organically
---
Yeah, I did pally and priest in vanilla. 
---
Best times were ZG raids :)
---
Capitalism
---
They was just a meme and now it’s a permanent fixture made by Blizzard within the game. And this is an insulting and lying meme, so of course it needs correcting.
---
Glad to be appreciated!
---
I played a pure healing spec. A mixture between Holy/Disc. 21/30/0. Yes I was able to kill as a holy priest. I wasn’t the fastest, but I’d out sustain the dmg, kite and dmg them down. The only classes that were difficult to fight was another priest, sometimes rarely a resto Druid, or a rogue. And that’s if they knew what they were doing and well geared.
---
NSFW please, it's got me all distracted now.
---
Check again, bud
---
This reads like a page of denial. Look how many times he is attempting to refrence retail on a specific classic question. Zero inclination to inform share holders that they are seeing a recent spike in subscriptions to classic and trying to interject the BFA patch into the conversation to imply that is the reason. 
---
I am still of a strong belief there is a core company subset largely pissed off that Classic Wow is successful. They could of easily separated classic and retail by subscriptions but that could potentially set them up for failure of details current state.
---
Damn it’s been that long already...
---
That shamans and idiot. He literally ran into the Paladins auto attacks
---
Spriests bring decent overall damage when you take 15% of warlocks damage into account and add it to personal DPS
---
You are really really over estimating the racials there bud.
---

---
We tried AAP for a bit and found it to glitch out from time to time. Having done 1-60 leveling 30+ times at this point, my group is probably just using ClassicCodex and using our brains to make a route.
---
I also think people aren't realizing how crowded it's going to be. That shiny pre-planned route works great when you're alone, but with 500 people in the area, you might need to skip some quests.
---
What Ser\_Wicky said, just go in totally fresh without looking up too much info. You'll have a better experience.
---
Lmao I just learned demon trainers existed from your post
---
Pretty sure it's the second best 2 hand mace in the game behind might of menethil. Would call it more then a status symbol. It's baller as hell.
---
That's the thing that is going to ruin it for a lot of people. So many people think you have to play a specific way and get this exact gear and these talents and that profession. These people may think this is how you're supposed to play, but they're wrong. Enjoy the game. Do what is fun for you and you'll continue to play while these people run out if content in a month and give up.
---
Ah, to have zero responsibilities.
---
I was 16, but it's mostly about your personal taste of music how well you recognize certain songs.  
---
I mostly listened to 60s/70s music back then (which was still 1 generation behind of what I should have listened to :D)
---
StalaGGang represent!
---
While I don't really pay attention to stuff like this all that much, I will say it might be more natural to have both gray by default and have either or become gold-colored when picked, rather than having the opposite choice change color.
---
yes. if you dont farm at least 10 MCPs per day blizzard will forcibly delete your character and double your subscription cost.
---
Female undead is probably the least ugly/normal looking you can get.
---
I don't know where you read that. 1.12 patch is the best possible time to play a Druid. Druids had severe limitations during pretty much every other patch in actual vanilla. But they're in a very good spot for Classic.
---
Happy to hear it! thanks man
---
Honestly, I don’t see why they would be switching from thalnos when the blizzard post mentioned Herod specifically for over pop and thalnos is not even a full server yet.
---
The thing with layers is they can increase them at any time to allow more people in. I would have preferred they added a couple more servers in each region to spread some of it out, but we will see how it all shakes out.
---
Watching that short 6 second clip makes me so want to play classic right now. I'm happy I didn't get the access to beta so that I can experience the game for real.
---
Go outside. Pick up trash. You'll be useless to humanity after launch. May as well make yourself useful. 
---
r/detrashed
---
Decide a class that will be fun for you, turn on auto quest text in your options when you first start, read the actual quests and ask people for help in the local chat.....enjoy and have fun.
---
All of the vocal retail players hate classic because said vocal players are all LFR kids.
---
The retail players who are excited aren't bitching so they don't have a voice in the retail crowd, and are lumped with classic players.
---
Thanks!  Those look familiar...wonder if i saw them months ago somewhere and just didnt save it.
---
If its a PvP server its gonna be horde majority. Better racials and people want easy WPvP.
---
A [shadow weaving](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVrhsVikoZxhtz0x) PI priest brings the same ‘utility’ as a spriest, while opening a slot for a pure dps class. While also greatly amplifying caster effectiveness during burst phases. Ret, enhance, ele, and boomkin are all dps specs. When people play them it’s for social reasons with pvp being the usual culprit. They are suboptimal raid dps but fun.  
---
Let’s not make this into more than it really is.
---
yes why would we be showing any authenticity ON THE FUckin InTeRnEt eh? that would be absolutely mental.
---
Forgot my /s 
---
...rolls eyes
---
Not only that, it was clearly decided that the Reddit community was going to Herod. Sheep followed the heard, they won't all stay.
---
"It's like any other class that has to farm their consumables." Dude I've NEVER thought that way! i was always seeing the bad side! That's make a lot of sense LOL / despite the fact that i probably have to farm the same consumables as any other class AND that weapon... HMM
---
[Shitty edit](https://i.imgur.com/YEGM2Wf.jpg)

Upvoted for SWTOR!
---
I remember back in the day, Bartender4 I think could do this... you just have to look for the settings in the config. Disable some bars to only enable when a certain event happens. This was literally back in the way back days though... lol haven't really played current wow so not sure if it's changed. However, I can't imagine why they'd remove that feature?
---
If you’re trying to rush to 60, yeah I definitely would. Most of your leveling spec should be in discipline until you can spec into shadow form (so healing dungeons would be okay). If you down rank your healing spells in dungeons, you should be fairly ok. Stacking spirit is the way
---
It got dropped because some people were complaining about motion sickness
---
On an unspecified private server I ran with 2 other people who wanted both dal'rends, we kill Rend and he drops both. Rolls fly, and I end up with both. Happy days.
---
Blizzard changed flesh assets to bread in China. They don’t give a fuck. If removing the hit flash along with the blood was the easiest and fastest way to remove the blood, then the hit flash goes.
---
50? Joke right?
---
Fairbanks seems so prime, has Medium pop so its not like its dead, and more will come who want to avoide whitemane. Plus Fairbanks doesnt have some theme or something, its just a pure server that can become what it wants. (theme as in: streamer server, Herod meme server, whitemane meme server)
---
I think armoury is available after certain level.
---
You will be able to ask this person in game.
---
:(
---
Yes. If you want to raid as feral.
---
unless you are in China, why concern yourself with this?
---
Max settings.
---
But I will never play a Druid. The animal forms are 100% fugly.
---
Unless you're really into PVPing a lot, then I'd suggest Horde.
---
So fucking stoked for this. I sold my baby for infinite membership. My baby now works as a blizzard dev.
---
THE most beautiful zone. Going out of my way to get there this time.
---
\*cries\*
---
Attack power modifiers were normalized for weapon speed, slower weapons still has higher damage interval for your instant attacks.
---
Wow. Yep, I see the point now.
---
I really want to commit a lot of time on PVP tough, something like at least 6 hours per day and usually and most probably 8 hours per day.
---
authenticity aint allowed on the InTeRnEt son
---
Ofc they're written. Just not in the game itself but rather in all kinds of content preceding it, like WC3.
---
Oh I didn't even know there was an option.
---
So you can play with Vanilla settings or a higher option? What does the more upgraded graphic settings bring? I am guessing not new models.
---
He can use his native tongue in whispers if he wants, or guild chat if in a native only speaking guild.
---
Hey look, this post again.
---
I leveled my priest as holy for the BC release and it was pretty agonizing. With this spec I am hoping for good healing but still enough offensive talents with mana efficiency for being on a pvp realm
---
&gt; Yes, I know it's also about smoothing out the experience, but again, they only need to smooth it out because of the way they've designed the servers. If the servers were capped like in 2004 you wouldn't need layering at all, it would be completely unnecessary. Hence the reason layering exists is the huge servers, and the huge servers are there because of anticipated drop-off.
---
Well I don't think they are going to use 3.5k caps anyway it’s too low by todays' standard.  If they used 6k-9k caps you’d still want layering in this case, since everyone on private servers with 10k population leveling on launch day was a nightmare, and the launch of a game is extremely important in terms of keeping players interested.  
---
&gt;You have to remember Ion can't sit there and say with a straight face "yeah we're expecting most people to leave because the game's really archaic and most people who try it will hate it". They're a business, they're not going to let him do that. They absolutely know and expect a giant chunk of the playerbase to try it and hate it. Don't forget that Classic is a bundled subscription. Think about how many retail players are going to log in, create a character, prefer the new game and then switch back without deleting the character. Those people also contribute to player drop-off even if it takes them a few weeks or a month - just people toying around.
---
I don’t think Retail players won’t make up a majority of the classic wow playerbase.  Retail right now has like less than 2 million subs?  You are also not considering the amount of retail players that try out classic wow and enjoy it and actively play it.  Let’s say there is at 20% retention rate (I’m making this number up maybe it’s lower or higher) on the retail player playing classic, that’s 400k people that you gain on top of all the people who quit retail and want to play classic.  You’re essentially looking at everything through a pessimistic lens and projecting these ideas onto what blizzard thinks.  I don’t think Ion believes classic is going to flop and I agree with you he isn’t going to explicitly state it if he did but that doesn’t mean you should assume he thinks it will see significant dropoff.  He probably truly has no idea what to expect and I’m sure blizzard is preparing for all possible situations.  In fact, blizzard has stated multiple times that they aren’t sure how big or small classic will be but that they are fine with either outcome.
---
&gt;You're not wrong on a lot of points but the original argument is that layering isn't there to mitigate quitters, which is absolutely is. It wouldn't even exist if it was simply to smooth out launch because dynamic respawns would do all of the work. If the argument is that they simply wanted large servers then They're not turning it off before P2 because people will be "spread out", they're turning it off because many people will have gone. It makes absolutely no sense to think otherwise when they've used Kazzak as an example in the past as a reason layering can't stay. How do you think it would work if they removed layering and there were still 20,000 people per server in one area trying to kill one boss...? They're not expecting that to happen.
---
I don’t agree that dynamic respawns solve the issues of launch day leveling frustrations.  Private servers had dynamic respawns and the early leveling experience was miserable.  The phrase “getting out of the zerg” is based on the idea of getting out of the population mass that is leveling causing the game to be unplayable in a lot of ways.
---
Also if they did remove layering they wouldn’t let 20k people log on concurrently in my opinion, they’ve already said they will have server queues on high population realms. I also think you are over exaggerating the amount of people that will be present for world bosses.  It’s a small minority of the population.  It’s essentially a subset of the level 60 population and the level 60 populaton is already pretty small on classic realms.  I believe on Nost the level 60 population only accounted for ~10% of the server populations.  Most level 60s won’t even know when Kazzak spawns, there will be hardcore guilds that actively monitor the world bosses and as soon as they spawn they kill the world bosses within a half an hour. 
---
I think another thing you aren’t considering is that the amount of concurrent players might decrease but that doesn’t mean the active player base has decreased.  During launch I think a majority of the playerbase will be hyped up and are going to play 12+ hours.  After about a month many of those same players will cut back, maybe to something like a few hours a day.  The concurrent population will decrease but those players are still playing, they just aren’t logged on as often.  Then consider that a lot of the player base are spread out, some are max level, some are still level 30, some are level 50, etc.  This now removes the need for layering since you have less concurrent players (since they are logging on less and some quit) and the players are not all playing in the same zones, they are distributed throughout the world.  I see blizzard progressively reduces the amount of layers and eventually removing them with phase 2 before of these factors, not being 80% of the player base quit.  I also see blizzard actively monitoring the player populations on realms and enforcing queues on high population and creating new realms to filter players into.  I think their goal is to have as many health population servers as possible and phase 1 is the phase where they gauge how popular classic will be.  
---
&gt;The thing is, that last sentence may be a reality. There's a very real chance that not enough players leave, but Blizzard are banking on it happening. We'll have to cross that bridge when we come to it.
---
I really don’t think blizzard is banking on their game seeing significant drop off.  I think they are probably open minded to many possible outcomes and are considering options for each outcome.

Hi, /u/Horkosthegreat

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cqsnc4/anyone_knows_if_the_official_classic_will_be_also/). 
---
Armory for Classic has not been announced yet. The word from Blizzard is a solid “maybe”.
---
He was oom. And even if he had mana it would've been a bad play
---
You can send in game mail or whisper them, assuming they're the same faction.
---
No one knows.
---
And if you believe in polls ... let me tell you a story about an election and it's reliance on polls
---
How can there be facts about a server for a game that isn't live yet?
---
Medical supplies store buy yourself a bottle of O2.
---
Lol its at "Medium" pop just from name reservations. And plenty of people will be down to avoid a Full server.
---
Max graphics of course.
---
See you in Org, friend!
---
Ahh gotcha, I was super confused, thank you lol
---
That is honestly the only reason why this is such a big debate for me. Getting Feline Swiftness is massive and is why leveling as Druid is so much faster. 
---
I really don't think TTK (time to kill) is so drastically different between stacking Agi and Stacking Int considering you have 2 extra DOTs to use (Moonfire + Insect Swarm). Remember I am not talking about casting Wrath the rotation would be Moon --&gt; IS --&gt; Shift into Cat) --&gt; Rake (will get it instantly because of Resto talent) --&gt; melee down
---
Flash on hit is a great effect and was vanilla. Removing it is changes that Im not ok with.
---
Most guilds will bother with it. Maybe you should go check the guild recruitment page. There’s hardcore guilds recruiting bear Druids for tanking.
---
Absolutely, this release has got to be the closest thing to a potential "archaic revival" in my life specifically. The chance to go back in time psychologically (and in the gaming industry as well) to the early stages of my development, and use the potential that was there then and is there now to right as many wrongs in my present and future as I possibly can, this time as an experienced adult rather than a naive kid.
---
The more the hordier! Lok'tar!
---
Dark Edge of Insanity
---
So you didn't? Maybe you somehow actually notified people that you're running only a certain wing? Like... Maybe you said something like "LFM DM W" instead of "LFM DM" to ensure that you get people who want to run Dire Maul West?
---
Dude, I don't have a 800x600 CRT monitor anymore, don't expect me to play on the same settings
---
Ret Paladin PvP absolutely rocks in vanilla with good gear. On private servers you rarely lose to anything 1v1 (besides spriest and sl lock) and BGs are a blast with reckoning.
---
How fortuitous!
---
What happened in the gole discord?
---
It's going to be fairly weak in wpvp unfortunately.  SF has a big advantage with the damage reduction, but holy doesn't have that.  Means you need to heal and hardcast more, which means more interrupts and spell locks and since you heal and dps off holy, it's a big deal.  Also without blackout you lack a powerful talent in wpvp as well.  If you're supporting a friend it's great, but if solo I wouldn't really count on living through many fights.
---
Bless your heart.
---
I honestly think it’s the best unless you’re into the goofy-creepy undead style.
---
You can just /w Muppet on the realm and if they’re not blocking whispers from strangers and you’re on the right faction (confirm with /who Muppet), then they’ll see it. Or send an in-game mail.
---
Glad to hear it man. I understand druid's have to switch weapons between forms(at least the good ones?) to be most effective on PVP,  so i will be able to farm good and solid weapons instead have the "obligation" of farming a "temporary" weapons over and over for the rest of the days?
---
This is hard to top. Holy crap!
---
My hero.
---
Well no, but when I played in vanilla, not private, that's what it was used for, I assume you mean full dps gear or something? /shrug
---
Ye man they are so pissed about all the money that you and everyone else in this sub that hates blizz and retail are gonna give them.
---
They are furious....
---
People have been asking for a Vanilla servers since 2006 just fyi. PServers have been going for over a decade too. The Nost thing was just the tip of the iceberg - the visible bit that did the most damage
---
Also starting with "Nostalgia" is a big turn off. For many people that's a nice bonus and not the main reason. We just prefer this style of game.
---
yes he is joking. its 3000 per layer
---
I believe people farmed that way back in vanilla too.  I never played pservers.
---
[Who I am](https://youtu.be/r0EUxH0aaA8)
---
I came here to be a smart ass guess I can leave.
---
Not gonna lie, it's pretty nice to have some stun resist.
---
But I just think the ~5% heath and on-demand stun (perfect for a LHW) would serve me fine in PVP, in PVE it's really no contest.
---
100% agree.
---
This game does reward min/maxing because of the endless grind, but . . . 
---
Try to have fun! One of the reasons I loved this game originally was the exploration of a beautiful fantasy world.
---
And if you need a distraction, there is this $32 million eSports tournament happening now which ends the Sunday before wow classic goes live. Check it out -&gt; www.dota2.com/international
---
If you are trying to do cat dps, yes. For any other druid role no (can be beneficial for bears though). But since you ask such a question in 1st place, I strongly advise not to pursue cat dps
---
I really want this helmet to be in classic now xD
---
I just added stuff like this to my config.wtf   
---
Will that work?   
---
SET weatherintensity "3.000000"
---
You’re the one making it into more than it is.
---
I've been using ElvUI since MoP and I have never once had it break with an update. That team is *super* good at keeping things working properly.
---
Also, this is Classic... there are no updates.
---
Oh you misunderstood. Insert the sentence into your comment. It was a correction.
---
I see. I can just have a Int Set for Resto to guarantee a spot while raiding, right? You're saying there is better weapons to PVP beside Pummelers? Not on deep feral tough, hybrid balance/feral?
---
Yeah, because people just made their Chars and logged out. But when the Game goes live, people will not just not logout again and Queues won't go down that quickly.
---
Not a lot of information. Ion said that they want to be fairly quick with the first two and ballparked "a couple months" with the others being longer. But they've said throughout that they're going to be flexible and it will depend on the community's progression.
---
Most of this is fixed by the limited layer hopping they implemented in Betaa and they said they would have for launch. They also told us that the layering they used for the stress tests won't be exactly the same as the layering for launch, they just had to do some tests with it.
---
That night elf hunter on the old launcher too. You installed for your friends but you stayed for the Nelves.
---
One of the reasons classic wow just works is because it's all a happy coincidence. Blizzard trying to micro manage the players and their rotations has gotten us to BFA. These strategies such as off tanks using nightfall to help the casters do damage and using thunder clap so the main tank doesn't have to. These are all strategies the fans came up with organically. In modern wow there's a specific way blizzard designs things to work and it just sucks.
---
All I can think of when you are saying it fast is the droid in the beginning of empire strikes back on hoth.
---
This. If you didn’t want to play with none English speakers or streamers, Herod was the only damn choice we had. Of course it filled up first and the fastest. If this server had launched at the same time as the others I’m sure the pop would be much more evenly split.
---
what fiasco?
---
Yeah man SWTOR was fucking awesome back in the day. Sadly it kinda went down the same path as wow. Everything is dumbed down and lootbox mechanics and RNG now. I loved it when you could buy your pvp gear by just spamming warzones, saving up the commendations and then just buying it from the vendor, and you could choose which piece you bought first that was the most optimal upgrade for you etcetera, same as Wow used to have with the honor currency. But now in both games you get a box with a random item inside...... fuck that.
---
Thanks. Yeah I've pretty much accepted that it's already gone. But I'll take a shot at it. Maybe they'll agree to a deal.
---
In vanilla it was 1000. I know of no blue post saying no limit on guild size.
---
&gt; Having a faction of anti-misfits would be a great idea if it wasn't for the fact that like 3/4 of all Horde players were BElves.
---
That's the thing. I think lore-wise BE fit the Horde pretty well... if they weren't a playable race, just a faction of NPCs allied with the Horde. They're supposed to be almost extinct, kinda hurts immersion to see the overwhelming majority of Horde characters being BE.
---
Thats the worst argment ever. But that logic why even have German servers? Thats like the retarded Ion Answer to people asking for High Elfs ("just play Bloodelfs!")
---
Really torn between Rogue and Warrior.
---
I played Warrior exclusively in old Vanilla. I remember tanking end-content, which I loved. But the grind to 60 was brutal.
---
I played a little Rogue and I remember Rogues being so strong on DPS with tons of survivability. Leveling, PVP and non-raid PVE seemed much more enjoyable. But finding a group was harder for raiding, etc.
---
Any thoughts / people going through the same thing?
---
I have more ranks of 1 spell that i cast in classic than i have total spells i cast in retail.
---
That's the spirit.
---
Playing horde Fairbanks , have discord for guild. Pm me. I plan on doing PvP as rogue or warrior
---
Do you have a link explaining how to do that?
---
I might play Tauren, and, imo, their HD model was the best of the lot.
---
26th-10th of September but I have to go to a wedding from the 6th-10th :(
---
yeah im super pumped for stalagg i so badly was waiting for a new est pvp server
---
is classic, not vanilla.  \*pushes you out of the way and stomps across your rose garden while you're trying to smell them*
---
I remember doing this as a rogue as well!
---
Then add to the "not a bug" list.

Right now it seems like that are conspiring to hide this.

Nice summation of one of the core gameplay differences between Vanilla and modern WoW. Also a very well done machinima.

Both blood and hit flashes were present in the last stress test at default settings

Probably like level 10 because I won't be able to play much that first week lol.

Or the PvE'ers who think they can be a Scarab Lord.  They have no idea what it takes to achieve that.

---
I think they're trying to avoid using realm names that are already being used in retail, which seriously limits the names they can use.
---
Oh, right! It's been a long day @_@ sorry.
---
I'm sure whoever gets world or server first for it will sure know it, but I'd be surprised to see guilds putting excess effort towards it. Maybe if the Eye drops early, they'll try to buy up excess mats from other guilds to craft it.
---
Guilds going for world first will typically be putting all of their resources towards content progression. (flasks, consumables, repairs, resist gear, etc.)
---
Totally understandable, I always loved weed as well and still do in a love/hate way, and do not think it is shameful in any way to use. For where I'm at now, I just gotta burn in the righteous fire of sobriety and see how it shapes me out for a good while. Plus, still not legal in my state, I'm done jumping through hoops and not knowing what I get. When society grows up and rids itself of the ridiculous stigmas around it, I'm sure I will enjoy the plant again, a few years away would do me good.
---
Whoever took Strider on Herod pls give.
---
It definitely won't be too soon, tho.
---
Healers can do dungeons at a low level, dps and tanks can't.
---
Hard agree. Took way too many runs just to get the Truestrike Shoulders. I did end up getting the offhand but the mainhand only dropped like twice and I lost both rolls. Not worth trying to grind out in pugs for it.
---
And I'm tired of seeing these posts too. Everyone plays differently, some casually and some hardcore. Everyone can play their own way. Of course most of the hardcore people will be discussing the game here while the casuals are waiting for launch since there isn't much to discuss besides the min max kind of stuff until then.
---
&gt;Ye man they are so pissed about all the money that you and everyone else in this sub that hates blizz and retail are gonna give them.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;They are furious....
---
You seem to lack an understanding of what is taking place. The share hokders and those that have stakes in classic if successful will be ecstatic. Those in charge of retail...not so much. It could mean a variety of things like more budget being allowed to classic or a cut in budget to the retail department. This could lead to there team members being let go or less opportunity to expand on there projects. If you think a company isn't competitive in this regard you are naive.
---
I'm so glad to hear that man! Almost convinced to do it! Just thinking about lurking as a Rogue with so much more mobility makes me excited! LOL
---
Don't start anything with "So"
---
Not really. Tanking in vanilla is more about threat per second than mitigation. 1% dodge does obviously help with mitigation but when you dodge you don’t gain rage. Making it a little harder to gain threat than any other race.
---
This is great lol. I loved the high five bit.
---
To our credit, its only because we elected a black dragon
---
Or more likely, they just don’t care to explain themselves on every single little thing. They have no obligation to be that transparent with you.
---
I've seen a few posts on the subreddit looking for this exact type of addon, where you can simply customize it to only have available quest markers shown. It's also something I've personally been searching for. The features seem perfect and I'm excited to use it at release!
---
This video goes into all the math. It is quite long but very well made with data from the classic beta.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJAkOZ4lXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJAkOZ4lXk)
---
Isn't that why they decreased the budget for stam so they could load TBC loot up with it for everyone?
---
only a fraction of the player base will rush like that  
---
so no, you are not the only one doing the thing the vast majority of players will be doing
---
Have you seen the success of Old School Runescape?
---
Imagine being upset that other people want to be better than you. 😂❄️
---
I'm pretty sure they used to be allowed loads of people used to use them.
---
Because the gain is so minimal it's probably offset by the mana wasted constantly swapping weapon enchants.
---
Yeah guys, thalnos is great! Go there!
---
Oh that's a cool workaround to 'use' the hammer on a caster class. You rolled Blacksmithing just for the Hammer then, huh?
---
The only thing that I know of so far are using chinese models for Undead. It gets rid of the bones so armor isn't broken up and your spine isn't sticking out. :)

you're a union buster basically

usually when i'm a union buster, it's because I'm circle jerking with the boys
---
It's world PvP. You start a fight I'll use every trick to win. Duels/organized fights are different but if you jump me don't whine if I use a potion to win.
---
No it wasnt. Only english french and german
---
So enlighten me what is the proper word for it...
---
Did somebody say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
I think you're referencing to another add-on, this one doesn't show enemy cast bar it only reskins the player's. It did have a slight lag in the beta though which was patched soon after. Swing/shot timer isn't implemented yet but is on the list!
---
Just checked, a similar effect is in retail.  
---
PUT IT BACK IN CLASSIC!

Not sure why it matters. All gear will be funneled to Hunters

https://youtu.be/JwojRc4ZAOM?t=1841

I have it pegged at 30:41. Go for five minutes until he cuts back to the video he’s watching. This was just an easy one to find, but there are gems like this peppered all throughout his stuff. Sure, there are tinges of bitterness from leaving Blizzard on bad terms, but it’s also working on something 11 years to see it be run into the ground that can create some strong feelings. Overall though, I find that listening to him talking about WoW has really informed me.
---
The video he has on Azerite is pretty good too. It made me realize we are focused on the wrong thing when trying to diagnose the problem with Azerite and Blizz is too meaning the solution isn’t going to do anything but shift the problem to being a different kind of problem. He blames ilvl primarily.
---
In all my years as an alliance warlock my mount was never purged.
---
Do you care about the facts or just opinions? Most people here aren't giving you detailed answers as to why one faction is better than the other in a certain way.

---
The issue here is that I haven’t played my toon since BC and missed everything till BFA. If I log onto my character now I’ll be treated like a hero for simply existing.
---
I played priest up until MoP and switched to rogue. 
---
Honestly in classic, it was rewarding playing with people and being a part of raids. It felt like you were apart of team so I played priest to play with people and friends. I think that's where a lot of people's nostalgia come from. Its the community that classic WoW brings. Then the game dynamics changed. So I switched to rogue because I became more of a solo player.
---
So long as you don't respect often, the tab shouldn't hurt. You should really only respect 2-3 times.
---
It doesn't have a dispel type so no you can't purge/dispel it.

Also players: "Why did you remove the portals from Dalaran???"

Blizzard’s answer: yeah... no.

no joke?
---
Dire Maul wasn't even in the game at launch. There was nothing to confuse it with. Deadmines was already established as DM by the time Dire Maul came out. You always specify what DireMaul you want to do anyway, DM N, DM Tribute, etc.  
---
And yes, the boss is named Vancleef, not the dungeon. Are you looking forward to your first raid, Rags? What about the second tier raid in phase 3, Nef? Everything in the game is called by the dungeon name, not the final boss, why would deadmines be any different.
---
&gt;Only two servers to choose from
---
What??
---
Thanks! I'm happy you like it! And yea i met so many helpful in the beta, can't wait for the full thing
---
Back in vanilla it was definitely optimal to use rockbiter on a 2H just to optimize your dps while solo questing.  
---
But that's not as fun, and you cant truly feel your power as you do with the WF proccs, so most people just use WF instead. the difference isnt huge compared to the amount of fun WF proccs can be ;)  
---
iirc weapon enhancements presist when placed into your bag, however, while leveling you wont really have access to two 2-Hand weapons of similar power to swap like that.
---
I've read up on everything I possibly can because fuck leveling and everything about it. Imho there is absolutely nothing enjoyable about the leveling process.
---
Still going to enjoy the game as a whole just rushing through the boring bits.
---
Playing Classic on anything higher than Classic graphics settings is wrong. No changes.
---
It's going to be different on Classic than private servers.
---
Many of the bosses shared cooldowns, had longer cool downs, the idea of just grabbing all the world buffs is going to be way rarer than it is on private servers.
---
So the community is going to learn to deal with it in new ways.
---
In short, don't plan on having them available even if your the #1 guild.
---
SMH, my dude didn’t even mention Druids....
---
Absolutely agree that it will be full at launch. Our worries are more of when they do open new servers on launch day, the type of players and interests they have. We fear the new servers will be rampant with retailers/tourists who decided to subscribe on launch day.
---
Why do I want a capital L on long?
---
There are a few super-insane guilds working up leveling paths and putting together spreadsheets in an attempt to kill Rags before the first server reset. I have no idea if they’ll manage it, but it’s going to be a hell of a ride.
---
I do know enough roleplayers that macro'd certain /s or /e messages to their skills, if that's what you're refering to.
---
&gt; And it only took 5 minutes to get through that queue.
---
Keep in mind this was largely due to people reserving names and logging out.
---
You're suggesting you don't want to put in stupid grind to gearing your characters. 
---
Warriors scale heavily with gear, it would take a long time before they feel "good" at max level in that case. Feral dps is a "meme" build. It is subpar at its job and requires extra work to make it competitive. It's not impossible, but you're in for a rough ride compared to say a rogue which does the same job and less effort/gear. Mage shines with good gear, but it only really "needs" it for pvp. It's also the king of mob farming for gold.
---
Of the classes you picked, mage would be the most satisfying choice from what you've outlined imo.
---
You're not wrong :&lt;
---
Unstoppable... Unbreakable... something like that. ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w

No worries.
---
All they do is advertising Nightelf booty.
---
Ok, but am I the only one that thinks pizza is tasty?
---
You can tank every single 5-man in PvP spec. In some ways Arms and Fury are even better group tanks than prot since they have more options can can bring more damage. Leveling, and gearing, and leveling reputation for two characters just to keep them in different specs is utter insanity.
---

---
You're forgetting about the extra defensive capabilities you're gaining with the shield.  If you don't proc on that first hit then you're still sacrificing the fire dmg that you would have gotten from 2-3 flametongues. That said I like windfury+2h because burst is what wins surprise pvp encounters.

Of course a German made this.

(Nice work tho!)
---
What do you mean by "mobility"?  Druids are usually considered most mobile class as they have travel form and shapeshifting breaks all roots and snares.  Virtually everyone is going to pick up the increased speed in cat form as well, which makes your stealthed speed (outdoors) faster as well.
---
&gt; rolling on east coast servers.
---
No problems with this. They could have conflicts (work or sleep) between 6 and 11pm. A raid at 6pm server time would begin at 3pm PST.

I dont know, i use vanilla graphics
---
Build a time machine, go back and reprimand their younger self 
---
Or nothing bc it was a reddit comment
---
Got ya. Yeah I'm definitely looking for the community aspect as I often play solo and never really make a good connection with a group in game.
---
If not, the difference should be negligible. I’m CST and playing in Fairbanks. There will be guilds doing activities in all time zones and the ping doesn’t matter too much in a game like this.
---
I had two one month trails in vanilla played a hunter. When BC came out I made a draeni  warrior and I thought the most important stat was armor so I would go around buying white gear and replace my greens with white vendor gear cause they had more armor. one paladin saw me in hillsbrad invited me to his group to help me with a quest. He was freaking out cause I didn’t have over 700 health at lv31. if It DOESNT have stamina strength the gear is useless. He gave me his hammy downs that he was gonna vendor. I shot up from 700 to 1200 hp with just a few pieces I was shocked how much easier fighting mobs was after this.
---
Ooh yeah; I just can’t wait to be some flag carrying house cat!
---
keks
---
Mind controlling unsuspecting victims off bridges and stuff is the only plus I see to night elf priest.
---
After I found out they destroyed Teldrassil, I'm looking toward this even more.
---
Oh man, what in the world am I thinking of... Maybe I disabled this one when I heard it wasn't working? I'll look into it then, especially if a nice streamlined small shot/swing timer gets implemented! 
---
Ragnaros will be killed within 3 weeks from now. Within 1-2 weeks from launch.
---
Can confirm.. am idiot
---
So much this. The only thing I'm going to rush is to get the money for the guild charter. Other than that, my guildies and I are in absolutely no hurry.
---
Also, the people who claim they are going to power level to 60 within a week or two have very obviously never played vanilla outside of private servers.
---
True, but there are certain things you should dig up from the lore and others you should not. The panda thing was stupid and turned SO MANY people away from the game. I was thinking about going back to WoW and I when I heard about the pandas I never did.
---
Around level 10. I am on vacation during the first week and will only come back on the last day.
---
I got a few I'll share tonight ;)
---
It actually has the accurate spawn points like pfquest had? That's awesome
---
Middling for warlock. I'm gonna second hunter though. They are THE solo class in the game and the least gear dependent.
---
I think it'll be ok, we all have "what if..." thoughts on classes. But go with your gut on this one.
---
Will be surprised if it does.
---
We didn't all have iPhones yet.

I think they're both hilarious. I tend to like " word names" more than "phrase names" so I'd go with Introverted.
---
A massive amount of people played that game, thing is it was a korean MMO that was barely marketed to the west and by the time it was, it was a dead game.
---
I think for the dps, I just like the idea that I'm taking people down in like pvp instead of just healing others. In dungeons or raids I'd totally be fine only healing.
---
Well then, I guess there will be no problem with this \*bug\* as it doesn't concern 99% of the player base.
---
The Horde will provide better friends. LOK'TAR OGAR

This gave me goose bumps.

Quivers don’t exist in retail, but I think it’d be cool to be able to show off your quiver in Classic personally. As it stands, quivers are only visible to the wearer but no one else.

I don't know how they did it, but they always managed to have one paladin stay out of combat pretty much every fight up to (and maybe through) BWL. Turns out, even if you got selected for the random teleport at the Council in MC, you're not pulled into combat if the mobs aren't standing near the lava pit. Sorcery, I say.
---
yeah dont stress mane itll be great on stalagg
---
I mean it took me 45 min just to reserve a character name. With an artificially low population because them game isn't even released yet.
---
You have to be actively logged in though...  Why would you have a game always logged in and interacting with it so you don't go AFK, but not use your character?
---
There were queue times to pick names. The game will be close to unplayable the first day
---
&gt;You should probably just go ahead and edit the part where you claim there are 4 servers on a rack in chicago since we know that's not how they run wow servers anymore and you corrected yourself in the last paragraph anyway.   
---
&gt;But also,  you are ignoring what happened during name creation.  Herod had a queue when other servers did not.

I would have thought it would be easier to call them

Each to their own but i’ve personally never seen anyone call Deadmines VC
---
It's interesting, I see a lot of people saying they can't find motivation to play other games because they want to play Classic, but I have found the 27th as an incentive to play a bunch of games on my to-do list because I know after the 27th I won't touch another game for weeks.
---
I and many others will just buy gold to play the game the way we want.
---
And I’m talking about the premade finder not group/raid/LFR.
---
You still have to talk to people, invite them, travel to the instance etc...
---
If I could just find someone in my area, that would be awesome!!  As it is, I don't even know how to find someone... :(
---
&gt; I can just have a Int Set for Resto to guarantee a spot while raiding, right? 
---
You'll need to be Resto spec too. Noone is going to bring a feral druid with int gear along.
---
&gt;You're saying there is better weapons to PVP beside Pummelers?  
---
Yes. Pummeler is for DPS. PvP and Raiding are very different in terms of gear, especially for druid.
---
&gt; hybrid balance/feral? 
---
There's no such thing. You're either Feral PvP, Resto PvP/PvE, Feral PvE (either DPS or Tank, though cat form even with Pummeler is trash and most guilds will pass you up), or I suppose Balance/Resto hybrid PvP. Nobody is taking a Balance to a raid.
---
Bro, the shit is easy.  People are going to shatter those records.  And the bulk of hardcore guild players are going to do it in 6-7 days /played easy.  Putting in 16 hours a day minimum they will be 60 by the 10th day of launch no problem.  Lots of people are going to be doing this.
---
Wow nice wallpaper in this b&amp;w style! Great job man
---
From a "hardcore" players standpoint, NE racials really aren't that useful. But for me, a filthy casual who will have to set his computer down often, shadowmeld is super useful for what you said. Have to go all of a sudden cause the newborn baby is screaming? No prob shadowmeld. I guess it depends what you want out of it.
---
Hunter loot
---
Shadow meld is really only useful for mind controlling people from vantage points. It has use in AFKing in open world too. Elune grace is way better than people make it out to be. First, if you aren't being hit then you aren't suffering spell push back. Second, it's useful as a run-away mechanic.
---
Dwarf priest racials are superior without a doubt so I wont get into them.
---
Humans have an anti-caster ability but it isnt great. It had some niche use in PvP of you are attempting to mana drain a caster or healer that is dmging you. The 5% spirit is great, like really really good.
---
Personally, I think it's just the players choice.
---
Try heroin.
---
You didn't ask for my opinion but I think it's great! 
---
I mean look at those paint skills!
---
The amount of queue time is all speculation at this point, but they said there will likely be severe queues at launch.

Holy crap. Shadowpanther is back!

Playing a rogue all through vanilla, this site was \_everything\_

Glad to see it return. Thank you.

Uses the same data as pfQuest.

Classic has a new mechanic that can somewhat "randomize" spawns, but it's still very accurate.
---
Sorry to hear you're having a bad day. :( I hope tomorrow is better!
---
Nights have never been dark since testing phases. Blizzard felt it was unfair to those who could only play at night
---
Jokes about purple booty aside, I never got to explore Classic endgame world zones much.  I think I hit 60 the week before TBC launched, got dragged on my guilds 'last MC run' and then promptly replaced my T1 shoulders I got in that MC with the first green quest reward.
---
I'd really like to see what it was like to work my way through zones like EPL, Un'goro and Winterspring while being on level for the content.
---
Definitely, there will be queue times for Herod.  People claiming it's just some kind of login queue for all of NA are delusional.  If they could have just infinite space why even bother with multiple servers?
---
While no one really knows, I'm just curious at how bad queues will be.  Wondering if we will get the classic experience of 8 hour queues.
---
That's awesome to hear, very happy for you two! May the RNG gods be in your favour :)

I used to suffer from severe depression and low self esteem. Back in the day I got into tanking, it was challenging but somehow it felt achievable. I finally found something I could push myself to get better at. The game gave me social interaction and a sense of self worth back, which I rolled over into motivating me to study and finish up my software engineering skills and open my own startup.
---
I've got a great career and have learned to control my depression. Classic was a huge part of that.
---
Tauren are why hotter end of discussion

Played a dwarf paladin as my first character when I was 10. Got to level 33. But I wanted to play a hunter with my brother, thought I could only have one character at a time. Still remember standing in Astranarr when I logged out and deleted him to play a NE hunter.
---
All add ons go against the spirit of Vanilla. If you aren't willing to play without add ons, then you have no right to scream #NoChanges.
---
Classic is about discovering, being what you want. Pick what looks cool and makes you feel like a badass. Enjoy.
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
Pretty sure old Desolace killed one of my first characters. Its so barren and grey and there's so much death. I find it genuinely depressing to be in.

Not doubting your story, but thats more an example of ridiculously bad RNG. It wouldn't be like that for most people.

Recently had a crisis, was set on warrior as usual but my schedule has gotten a lot more filled than it used to be and I’m concerned I’ll have trouble raiding consistantly. Rogue is appealing to me as another hard hitting melee as well as the potential to entertain oneself with lots of creative world pvp. For someone that has a very weird schedule and not endless time but still a fair amount, what would be better? A fury warrior or rogue?
---
Also I don't know why the bash at streamer is needed in the title.

There's gonna be huge queues on every server when the game first goes live, that's just how it is with game releases. Queues won't be as long after a few days, but there will be queues on the first launch.
---
Fear Ward and Desperate Prayer are extremely good PvP abilities.
---
Starshards and Elunes Grace are garbage for everything.
---
Id say Stoneskin alone is better for Priest PvP than Shadowneld. Shadowneld is actually decent but it doesnt even remotely compare to having desperate prayer and fear ward.
---
Undead Rogue, ganking in westfall and duskwood. Some of my favorite times.
---
I honestly doubt that this would be considered too much automation. But hey, I can't know for sure. If my addon gets so popular that blizz has to break it, then I call that a major win, lol.
---
Feral DPS requires some very specific items. However, the most important requirement is having a bit of the olde 'tism.

The worst part about the new models are the animations. They're way over antimated.

# &lt;Lightforged&gt; [A] [EU] [Zandalar Tribe (RP-PVP)]
---
A brand-new community in the making, aimed at players who want to be a part of building up something from the very start, or simply for players who haven't found anybody to play with yet but don't want to start off alone!
---
**Do you enjoy all or one of the following?**  
---
*  Group Leveling
---
* Dungeon Runs / Dungeon Farming
---
* Raiding
---
* PVP (BGs &amp; World)
---
* Roleplaying
---
Daily action is guaranteed! 
---
**Raid days, for now, will be Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, potentially from 7pm - 11pm GMT.**
---
**Priorities:** The main focus will probably shift over time; Leveling of course comes first. Once we can set out to go and bust up dungeons we will do this on a regular basis and once we're ready to raid we will kick those fiery things in Blackrock out of orbit! Loot system will probably be EPGP, but this isn't fully decided just yet.  
---
All the while we will regularly be a pain for the horde to deal with, in an attempt to build up active rivalries to provoke World PVP.
---
It doesn't matter if you're a hardcore player or if you're only playing casually or on the weekend. There are only a couple of 'requirements', if you will:
---
* Be an active player.
---
* Have group-oriented thinking.
---
* Understand your role, but don't be afraid to have your personal playstyle, spec, etc.¹
---
* Be okay with the fact that your guild leader will be a Dwarf.
---
¹ This is not going to be a guild that will require you to minmax. Sure, that way progress will be faster, but off-specs will be accepted as long as they can be viable, and you won't be shunned if you don't have BIS gear.
---
**Everybody is welcome!** You can find the &lt;Lightforged&gt; Discord here: [https://discord.gg/vZeYtZ](https://discord.gg/vZeYtZ)
---
**A note on Roleplaying:** While I understand that Roleplaying is not everybody's cup of tea, please have some common courtesy towards the server and don't be a disturbance. The way &lt;Lightforged&gt; will present itself RP-wise is not through planned RP events, but rather through their players' characters having, for example, one or two antics/traits that come to show when the player feels like it. We won't force ourselves on other Roleplayers and we won't force RP when it's not convenient. In other words, Roleplaying is NO requirement to join the guild; just respect those who like and partake in it.
---
I don't know about priests, but my sole reason for picking Alliance over Horde was and remains Night Elf rogues being able to vanish twice. Granted, leaving combat and reengaging stealth that way takes a couple seconds (of immobility, at that), as opposed to actual Vanish, but it's still a big asset both on BG and during world PvP.
---
Yeah. I was all over it when it dropped in "beta."
---
It was practically fully functional IIRC. It had a pretty dynamic feel in its default mode, but just wasn't for me. I tweaked it pretty much to be only an over-the-shoulder perspective. 
---
I quit retail back in Legion before it ever became "official"; but for the short time I used the actioncam, it was really impactful and cool.
---
Could you please share the general attitude of having cross-players (or whatever someone who plays a char of opposite sex is called?) in the voice comm? The atmosphere of RP servers sound very appealing to me but I'm a little bit too casual to partake myself, and I want to know how to not disturb the RP.
---
A big reason why my friends were adamant about alliance was undead armour but I  love the look.
---

Is there a server discord or anything. Ps I'm an english Canadian rolling here
---
Vanilla (or tbc, cant remember... pretty sure it was vanilla) had an addon at one point that would broadcast groups through a public channel, I think it was the global LFG channel.  Obviously the broadcast was not public text, it was something only others with the addon could pick up.  It didn't provide the details you want, like ilvl or io or any of that bullshit, it literally just provided an interface of people looking for groups or people publishing their groups.
---
It basically provided a UI for "LFG 1 healer RFD" instead of just reading the chat.  It worked really well for a while, until blizz killed whatever functionality that allowed it to work (I think they eventually just removed the global lfg channel).
---
I would be okay with something like that again, considering it was in vanilla too.  I dont agree with ilvl or io or whatever, because lets be real... you can do any 5 man dungeon regardless of your gear at that level.  It's all pre-raid content.  Even ubrs 10man is pre-raid.
---
I don't see any pictures at all in the linked album that are just the models - there are like 20 examples and they're all in-game.
---
2 months would be more believable than 2 weeks like most are stating. Guess we'll see *soon* enough.
---
That’s how I feel about it. I’ll find the objectives, but I don’t want to walk past a quest and try to backtrack and retrace my steps because I zoned out for a second
---

---
Yeah I’ve played vanilla for 10+ years now so have plenty of experience, my guild also has slots for me whenever I can go. I enjoy warrior rotation and pve more. Do you know how rogue farming is? I assume its not much better than war
---
Other than posting to reddit, what else are you doing to market the addon?
---
This has potential to take off on both classic and retail, you just need people to actually download it so its both usable by the seller and the buyers.
---
I can offer my perspective as someone who played on a PvE server in Vanilla. I *really* regretted it - when TBC came out, I gave up on my warrior from Vanilla and rerolled on a PvP server as Hunter.
---
What I hated most about a PvE server was that the world felt a bit more dead. Sure, there were plenty of folks running around in a PvE server, but there was little reason to return to the lower-level zones I liked so much. In a PvP server, I would often find myself in STV or Tanaris or elsewhere for the sake of "defending" a town under attack. Or if a guild-mate was getting ganked, it was fun to respond to the "call" and assist.
---
World PvP turned out, for me, to be a hugely important aspect of WoW - in fact, it's what I'm most looking forward to. Large battles at South Shore/Tarren Mill, or STV fights, or just invading cities. On a PvE server, I hated that I didn't have that aspect to look forward to. Sure, you can flag PvP - but most people don't. And those that do tend to only do it when it's opportune (e.g. they have a numbers advantage, so it tends to just be stomp-fests).
---
Leveling, PvP is also a lot of fun. I don't usually start the fights, but I love when someone else tries to gank me and I end up winning. It really is fun. I'm looking forward to that, as well. Or the unique feeling of seeing a player on the opposite faction and you both mutually decide not to kill each other.
---
Yes, ganking does happen as you level in PvP servers - but it's not that bad. Most of the time, you'll be killed once and then they'll leave. Or if they do try to camp you, it's generally not too tricky to slip away. Otherwise, these servers have groups of people who love nothing more than counter-ganking. A simple guild message turns a gank into a counter-gank, which sometimes leads to an all-out war! 
---
I really think that if you have any interest in World PvP, you're making a mistake rolling on a PvE server. But if you hate PvP and just want to PvE, then it's obviously a better choice. For me, I hated PvE, but I'm not you!
---
I dont think a NE priest is as bad as people are suggesting.  Sure fear ward and desperate prayer are almost always good, but an extra nuke and the ability to not be visible can certainly be useful too.  I think you can definitely have a lot of fun with shadow meld if you use it right and be creative.
---
Does it make enough money overtop what AHing/vendoring can bring though? Compared to a time gate recipe profession.
---
I wasn't under the impression it was big enough to matter.
---
Classic druids are good at PVP. The main nuiance is that you won't be bursting anyone down with insane damage. Druid PvP is more about grinding down enemy players through attrition. You have to use different forms for different foes and use your whole kit. The thing that druids excel at is survival, you can pretty much get away from most fights if desired, which makes them excellent flag carriers in WSG.
---
Same here. Going to take my time leveling. Back in 2005 for me, I was stoked to get to 60 and see all the awesomeness there but now that I know what is there, I am in no rush.
---
That and the endgame is the endgame. At the moment the end is know so it will still be there a long time from now.
---
Ya, that's all you bro. Wtf.
---
Not really. I haven't had issues with the last 2 WoW-Launches, so I don't see a reason to have issues this time. But yet again your mentality has no prove for anything you say and I don't see what your mentality does better. You're frustrated over an issue that doesn't exist while I'm just happy Classic is coming and my Realm will be filled with people.

They've already said they plan to offer free transfers off of servers if theyre still too full when Phase 2 comes around. I don't understand the confusion.

I read the post from blizzard again.  you are clearly wrong.
---
 "We suggest that players, especially those on the Herod realm, consider creating characters on Stalagg. We expect that other PvP realms in this region will otherwise experience significant login queues when Classic launches."
---
This means that moving some users from the original 3 servers in the region to the 4th WILL reduce queue times for the original 3 servers.
---
I don't think this will happen again because be it vanilla or BFA this is such an organic event but we can always hope.
---
I remember playing this with my father(technically my step dad who got divorced with my mother but we still had a good relationship)
---
I’d come over and we’d take turns gaming and leveling our toons together. Vanilla wow  was by far the hardest game to date,  I remember farming boars in STV just to level up because I couldn’t kill the high level mobs required to turn in the quests! It was awesome and the feeling you got when you upgraded to a green common item to a rare blue was on par with nutting.
---
Hoping to get him back into the game so we can duo and quest together like we did years back!  He loved questing and I was the one who enjoyed dungeons and pvp, he never really got into the multiplayer part but could always decipher the quests back when you had to google everything or figure it out from a third party website. My little brain couldn’t do it but I was 9 or 10.
---
If anything, RP PvP servers were known for doing more organzied wPvP and you had battles that felt like events, as opposed to the much smaller scale wPvP  that happens on regular PvP servers.
---
I think you‘re too blind to understand what I‘m saying. The fact that you asked if you had to challenge to opposite faction to a duel as a joke, makes me wonder how old you are.

I think they'll use data from name day as a stress test to tweak the servers. Would be idiotic if they ignored the data.

There is a lot of truth to this.  I rented a new apartment and the place's air and heat units and below my gaming room's window.  So I closed the window off and put a light block on it.

---
I was just trying to simplify the logic.
---
I was for sure wrong about the servers though, I just read all the blue posts and it does appear that Herod is even beyond the layering limit of these servers, which is fucking crazy!
---
I'm game for queues, don't mind too much. I started 1 new char on Stalagg just in case Herod is just borked on launch.

Is what I’m referring to, and I only said IO/Ilvl to help describe what I’m talking about, obviously it’s useless in vanilla.
---
No if anything it's more efficient.  Compare frostbolt and fireball damage per Mana (dpm) at the rank 4 point.
---
Level 18: fireball (rank 4) is 1.24dpm.  Frostbolt (rank 3) is 1.15dpm.
---
Level 20: fireball (rank 4) is 1.24dpm.  Frostbolt (rank 4) is 1.27dpm.
---
So each spec is slightly more efficient (more than slightly for fire) when it has the most recently acquired a new rank.  And this isn't counting a pyro opener, which is 1.76dpm.
---
True!

This. Early WoW is not about rushing to end game and then religiously raiding on schedule, this kind of rubbish is why a lot of folks left.
---
Early WoW is about feeling happy when you team up with a complete stranger and after wiping a couple times manage to kill a higher level elite quest mob that neither of you really had any business fighting yet, then spend the next twenty minutes exploring the quest area and chatting instead of rushing off to hand in the quest and farm-farm-farm without a word.
---
Your statement makes absolutely no sense as Addons have been there in Classic, too. There is no Retail version of WoW where a heal can be afk while his Addon does everything for him.

That there is some kind of size diffrence.

Shadow is very good in PVP, so you'd likely have to respec back and forth to raid. You may find a guild that would take one shadow priest though for raids.
---
Thats interesting. Confirms that the realm pop indications have been changed to now reflect actual amount of expected players. 
---
Probably its weighted with how many names you reserved on that server. So if you reserved 3 names = weight 1, 2 names= weight 2/3 and 1 name = weight 1/3. Or something like that. 
---
This is actually great. If it says a server is full then they have probably reached the limit of population that will result in a healthy long term population. To avoid having to transfer later, I would definitely choose another server.
---
Stalagg was so weird. Literally why. There are a ton of good names out there.

I think you have spirit and int mixed up. Melee classes shouldn't take int gear since they get very little benefit from it and it's casters main stat. Spirit however is a stat that is beneficial to everyone during leveling, with melee classes getting a bigger benefit than casters. It's warriors BiS stat up until atleast level ~35.

I knew that. I just want to put a double check mark on the list. That way I get hunters geared and then myself.  :)

I played a warrior in vanilla. But I remember our raid leader regularly screaming at our locks to watch their aggro from BWL on. So my guess is that the pserver people have a very skewed view.

This was very convincing to read. Thanks so much for your response:) I'm really excited to give PvP a shot.

I live West coast so I was going to do Fairbanks since it's not already full. But it seems like all the "fun" servers are East. Should I try to play east instead?
---
Blizzard also said "You think you do but you don't." Where they right?Why do you take their word for anything now? Who are these people who are going to get lvl 30 and then quit?
---
The Hintern-lands
---
Yeah Undead win for animations imo, not looks
---
yea, it's going to be crazy.  I did the same.  Stalagg vs Herod will be a gametime decision.  but my friends did get better names on stalagg, so that may be the deciding factor.  good luck.
---
Sounds good to me! :)
---
What is it ?
---
Grob x Princess otp
---
Compared to Stoneskin, Fearward and Desperate prayer it’s useless. Being able to get out of blind as a priest is extremely OP.
---
I translated pfquest into Spanish for shagu. I was wondering if the interface here is also translated? Things like “manual selection”, “hidden quests”, etc. Not just the names of quests
---
Thunderfury would be incredible
---
24 hours a day, 24 days a week? What kinda weird planetary rotation did EQ have?
---
Main benefits:
---
- Precise spawn locations (VERY useful for quest mobs that are stealthed for example)
---
- Internal database (You can search for pretty much anything ingame instead of tabbing out and going on wowhead to search)
---
- Speed questing (auto-accept / turnin)
---
- Customizability
---
What does Questie do that ClassicCodex doesn't:
---
- According to their github feature list right now, nothing
---
- tracker
---
- arrow
---
Unconsciously yes... Thanks for making me conscious about being a pervert.
---
What's crazy is that you could just have a checkbox to toggle them on/off in the options (like we've had in retail for the longest time) so that everyone could have exactly what they want, and people in this sub are adamantly against that for some reason
---
Anyone else concerned that they are setting up too many layers with too few of servers? How can they eliminate layering when 20,000 people are sharing a realm?
---
Nah healing is easy. Have fun tanking 5 man dungeons while you level, cause that's that druids are best at tanking! You may not get to tank in your raids.
---
Because dueling inside the city was there in vanilla and I’m looking for an authentic experience /s
---
It’s actually just because it’s awesome and fun
---
The one on the left isn't a "bug", necessarily, it is movement interpolation. It adds additional frames when you make a turning movement to appear "smoother." It's less jarring but also less optimal for high level, mechanically-intensive play.
---
Whether or not this is intended, hopefully they give an option to disable it or remove it entirely.
---
That's why you should never get married
---
I think rogue could be a good choice. It's also nice for stealth if you need to walk away from the computer for a bit to get something done!
---
There's a whole sticky post about this topic on the front page look there.
---
Alliance.  Not too sure what server though.
---
https://discord.gg/XH7edM
---
I just didnt like his unnecessary reply that's all
---
Alliance - Almost all of the quests
---
Horde - Pretty much all non-gather/fetch quests/Anything that has to do with the warchief
---
If you're ahead on the first two waves of people there will be a minimum amount of players on your level and there will be no point to stop your route to get out of your way to do a dungeon. People don't even get professions like skinning cause it's a loss of time to get the profession cause it's in a major city (orc/troll) and cause skinning itself is taking a lot of time.   
---
Dungeons are good if you're just playing 6 hours or less per day and you don't have a route noted down to follow so you need something to keep you competitive either via gear or via exp. Ofcourse we are talking about doing them once and then going back to leveling, don't bring cleave groups up to this.  
---
A dungeon can take 30 mins to one hour where at those levels you could usually get more exp. Imagine if on your way to get 1-30 in 20 hours, you spent 1 hour inside DM with strugglers, no matter how good they are, if you haven't practiced doing it and if they are not an optimal group (class wise) that's on their heads and just rush it with good game mechanics and knowledge, you're gonna lag behind your lead. 
---
A tl;dr would be: Hardcore players will get more exp with their own ways, semi-hardcore and bellow should/could do dungeon runs since they don't have the time or the effiect routes to get as much ahead as they should be.
---
What? Ive played on CC since it opened (and still do....) and I've never seen anyone call it VC.
---
Alliance side btw.
---
Does anyone actually know if the population estimate is based on characters/accounts online, or the number of characters created, or something else?
---
I just hope IF is the ally capital and not sw.
---
If you wanna follow ecelebs go for it. The population will be very volatile, I doubt the lackeys that follow them will all make sixty. I would rather play with other people that have the same mindset and drive as opposed to someone who donates money to have a streamer say my name on stream. Too old for that shit.
---
I absolutely think they should take classic and start a new line of newly developed expansions. Without adding QoL/pet battles/etc into the game.
---
i am currently reading about the lore about what you said, its inspiring, so far i haveread that the alliance didnt give the horde any land to settle after the third war :O
---
Quality Content.
---
It's okay to just like a thing without trying to tear down other people who like a different thing.
---
Nice one !
---
-Hey mage, can you make me a portal to UC please ?
---
-Sure !
---
*Mage open trade window and proceed to give a rune of portal*
---
There will be multiple layers, but there is a hard limit.
---
There will be queues for the simple reason that Classic is going to be packed with people.
---
good looking defias set!
---
hahah, thanks man im glad you like it :)

[Robe of Winter Night](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14136) is an alternate crafted item, with 6 spelldamage less.

Pvp is a different animal really.  Druid is strong pvp because it has so many tools for many situations.  Pummeler farming is for raid dps.

&gt;Pre-purchase: Warcraft® III: Reforged releases on or before December 31, 2019.

If you go to buy it thats what it says.
---
Anyone know if there is an actual stalagg Reddit? The one I found yesterday r/stalagg seems to have vanished
---
To be fair he did get a huge resist in.
---
cursed, cursed daze...
---
Blizzard removed that option in retail. It doesn't change your model back anymore.
---
I suppose the reason why was making gear for 2 differnt models were harder to do vs just one. Won't have that problem in classic.
---
I am super hopeful that this takes off but at the same time Blizzard has killed much less useful addons in the past. I hope they don't think of killing this one.
---
I’m not crazy about the shapeshifting aspect for druids!
---
I like this playstyle. In archeage I played a class called hexblade, they were not the strongest class but they had great CC. I am not sure if druid has large CC but the shapeshifting seems to run along those lines and I like that idea. [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuYboXx7idI)
---
Why the hell do you think those that are no longer playing the game are going to be immediately convinced to purchase an expansion?   Because they already have a subscription? Don't make me laugh. It might even drop expansion numbers if more retailers are deciding to stick with classic over the current system. A lot of returning players wanted a subscription separate just so they didn't have to deal with the current retail wave.
---
Used a pot in pvp? Tryhard...
---
I had the file containing the translations, but I just didn't take the time to implement it.

It's not the cleavage that's bursting, it is only yourself.

This is after one week from release derp.
---
Using his last bit of mana for a shift, so he can at least continue fighting in cat is bad, how?
---
Survival Hunter is a thing in classic too, you'd be one of the few that play it however. I remember a guy who did survival on a pserver that did really well though, so I think you could do it if you wanted, especially early on. Especially if you don't care about raiding.
---
I downloaded some from wowinterface.com

The kid that died had known medical heart issuers and ignored them. They drank Mountain Dew and other similar drinks plus staying up 24+ hours.

Can you have both installed at the same time or do they conflict with each other mate?
---
Literally no decent players go arcane/fire for pom pyro unless it's just for the memes, its not anywhere near as good as the other ones. They either run 17/0/34 or 0/24/27.
---
I'm sitting here, watching that video and can't see a difference.
---
Oof, flurry??
---
Paw*, he’s a furry
---
The most vocal people I know who play retail and don't want to play Classic are people who played Vanilla when it was current and are happy for the changes to the game that have happened over the years. Their mentality is "I already played that and it was painful and time consuming and anyone who wants to go back to the way it was is crazy." This includes people who raid mythic and hate LFR.
---
It has nothing to do with being in BiS; Beserking is a DPS increase and nothing undead has is.
---
Hundreds of them have been
---
Come to Orgrimmar !
---
Honestly, very little difference between a 1h and 2h.
---
Absolutely no need to complicate things.
---
I dont believe the activate weapon proc switches over (as in the buff, not totem).
---
Totem does switch over.
---
When I leveled my shaman in vanilla, it had little difference between 1h and 2h. It's just preference.
---
&gt; wow

---
does not compute
---
In dungeons and dragons, chain mail gave you more protection and a better armour class than leather. Being unable to upgrade from cloth to leather, or leather to chain, or chain to plate, was only due to class restriction. You always upgraded of you could.
---
As others have said, it lets you "create" items to share with others who also have the addon. What is really unique about it is that you can custom script these items to play music, sound effects, have their own menus, etc... I saw one person who made a remote control robot with it, way back when. It didn't show the model of the robot on the ground, but all of its movements/actions were shown in chat as emotes, so you could make it fight other players and whatnot. It's a really neat addon that doesn't get as much use anymore as it used to.
---
*our lives will end
---
i feel like this could have been cut together better with a side-by-side comparison or at least have the actual trailer footge follow the model where applicable.
---
If you trademarked it before blizz made that character you could. You don’t own anything about your character though. Not the name, the data behind it, anything. You’re merely renting time to play in their server they can do with it as they wish.
---
Oh my days, this only makes me think of blasting We Sleep Forever by Aiden whilst levelling through Trisfal Glades on my UD rogue

It's not hugely important

But Herod in the BIBLE was a boss.
---
&gt;As a final act of vengeance against his contemptuous subjects, he rounded up leading Jews and commanded that at his death they should be executed. His reasoning was that if there was no mourning for his death, at least there would be mourning at his death!

---
With regards to the Priest racial-specific abilities, do we have any further information on these?
---
**Night Elf &amp; Starshards** - Will these have the 30 sec cd or Channeled like in 1.13 and earlier. And any damage coefficient info?
---
**Undead &amp; Devouring Plague** - Damage coefficient info?
---
Interested in playing Priest for PVE/PVP and like to do efficient damage where possible.
---
&gt; And no your not forced to. You can lock your level before WoD and do content before then to your hearts desire, or just skip the Pve and level via PvP.
---
As I said...
---
&gt; You’re kind of forced into being this great hero. Your only option if you don’t want that is to just not participate in the majority of an expansion’s story and content.
---
I'm not saying there should be no overarching story where your character is a hero. But IMO you should be able to participate in an expansions story from the sidelines, especially because it's an MMO and not a single player RPG. 
---
But the way it is now everyone is funneled into doing the same activities, just at different difficulties. It's an on rails experience that takes away from the feeling of carving out your own unique place in the world.
---
So I take it you didn't read his comment.
---
"From?"
---
I've been a druid main on Live since TBC but I never did endgame with one until WotLK. How much of a culture shock am I expecting from playing one in Classic? I know I should expect to be bad at everything but healing, but like how bad are we talking? Is cat-specific Feral any kind of viable for casual play/questing without feeling like I'm a wet paper bag?
---
Have you tried VuhDo? There isn't a grid for names but I think you could shrink the panels down into smaller boxes if you wanted to.
---
who is Thex? seen the name thrown around on here, but im not sure what its always relating to.
---
It will be, at least in the beginning. It's closer to MC &amp; Ony.
---
Stupid fat hobbitses
---
unfortunately, i'll be busy next month :(
---
Answer is: I don't know since I don't use Questie.
---
In reality, there'd probably be some conflicts because you have two addons trying to add a bunch of stuff to your map/minimap, but what's the point of having both at this point?
---
Looking for the name Roland on Whitemane and ateish or whatever.

Salv was always on cooldown as I recall :V
---
And yeah, I was just amazed that they managed it every fight, and just had whoever was designated to hit the boss at like 5% to get on the loot table.  
---
We once accidentally pulled Shazzrah and Geddon and just decided to keep fighting. Our OOC paladin managed to stay out of combat even through that mess, ressing the engineers so they could drop a repair bot, then cycling through the raid group as people died (purposefully or not) in order to repair/drink.  I fee like the hunters asked for particular kind of bot to be dropped for arrows (memory is hazy on this one). Someone had to trade the main tank a grey weapon since his broke during the fight.  
---
IIRC, we won.
---
Watch me.
---
Hell yes.
---
Think both will be viable, it's not like they are turning off chat in game.
---
I know NE priests racials suck, but I would hate myself if I rolled a Dwarf just for FW - caster dwarves are just so ugly. I just can't wait for Felwood, Freewind Post, BRM mind controlling fun.
---
nobody can predict your fun

That doesn't make him an asshole lol
---
Anyone figure out yet which data center each of the servers will be at for classic?
---
And this moderator, realizing that his server is doomed to suck, desperately searches /r/classicwow for mentions of his forgotten server, Fairbanks. Realizing that the realm must be saved at all costs, he silences dissidents by banning them from the tiny Fairbanks subreddit. Unbeknownst to him, the blocked users could not care less that they are restricted from visiting that community. They tried to share a Public Service Announcement and were violently silenced as a result. Their work with /r/Fairbanks is finished - there is no saving that community. They will learn their mistake in due time, and the desperate moderator will see his community dwindle into irrelevance.
---
Good night, Fairbanks. Enjoy your casual dad server while it lasts, until the frightening Horde-Alliance imbalance thrusts your server into a zone of complete irrelevance.
---
It's good but not great. Also, the heal sometimes tips the threat toward you.
---
Its farmed from Scholo iirc which is in my opinion one of the harder and least accessible dungeons for new 60s. Key, mobs that fear, high density, etc.
---
I felt that one
---
I only played vanilla and swear you had to go outside
---
They might have an open stress test that lasts a whole weekend for this purpose.
---
The alliance only quest that gives you a rod that turns you into a furbolg.
---
If you just keep the quest and don’t complete it, you get to keep the rod so you can always transform into a furbolg for 1 min.
---
Once you turn it in, however, it is gone forever.
---
Funny how it fits warriors to just think about themselves like that! "Im sure he wouldnt want to di anything else than pocketheal!"
---
After going to your class/profession trainer a few times it becomes second nature and you won't even have to think of where they are.
---
I still look frantically over my shoulder..
---
Agreed! I love having the need to check every house in a town for quests.. Makes you play with open eyes.
---
So much better than only following the map. I dont know why people want to finish Lvling asap. Its the biggest fun factor for me in the game. Take a chill pill guys. Enjoy the game.
---
Diablo 1 was that game for me.
---
There was a glitch where you could duel under a staircase in the military district. Don’t know if it’s still there
---
Like all games, the longer they are out, the more toxic they get.  We have a subset of the population that has a  well developed meta and understanding of the game that they will expect people to understand or follow at some level.  Will that ruin the game?  I doubt it.  It will certainly fill up the ignore list though.
---
People would use discord even if pservers were never a thing. Expect people to use available out of game tools regardless of the year.  Yes your 2019 vanilla experience will be different than your 2006 experience though if you didn't think collusion was happening back then you're crazy.
---
That actually sounds like a damn good plan. One question though, how do I lvl engineering without mining? Wont that be a pain in the ass?
---
will your personal experience be ruined?
---
i dunno, you'll have to play, then do some doctor strange multi-future-peeking and see the quantified amount of fun you'd have had otherwise
---
private server players' experiences in private servers will affect their experience on blizzard classic
---
your pre-launch expenditure of energy and emotional investment will affect your classic experience
---
i'ma have fun
---
Those forearms are at least 18 inches. And look at that muscle separation.
---
Except the question was literally about both Classic and Rise of Azshara, which legitimately is seen as a good patch by many retail players, and has genuinely brought some people back who were frustrated by BfA launch.
---
Savory deviate delight recipe, cheap to get horde side, expensive on ally side.
---
Deviate delights (cooked or raw) , get more valuable as server gets older on both sides.
---
Any of the Faction specific pets, e.g cochroaches from Undercity sell pretty good on alliance side. However it's been a long time since I played without a toybox, no sure how willing people are to part with inventory space for a vanity pet.
---
White kittens from Ally side sell good on horde side.
---
While your in booty bay might as well pick up the fishing book to sell on your home auction house.  It's funny that people will pay extra just to not have to fly over to buy it.
---
I have a ton of experience on both warrior and rogue and I definitely enjoy farming more on rogue. Just get herbalism/engineering at 60 for good moneymaking and a bis pve/pvp profession on the side. Herb is super nice as a rogue, you can stealth past mobs, you can sap, distract to stop mobs pathing into your aggro range, if you go imp gouge(common in both pve/pvp specs) you can gouge and instantly grab a node before the mob comes out of gouge. All of these apply to members of the opposite faction too so you can easily win nodes by being an a... a rogue.
---
Yes still a thing. If I remember correctly they split it up for every expansion. So you gotta DL Atlas Loot and each expansion as a Plugin.
---
the bigger problem that I see is that this isn't only on the chinese version, such as the bread you are referring to. this is on our american version as well.
---
Ashenvale and Hillsbrad can be rough at times. Hillsbrad alliance are usually a handful of levels higher. Stonetalon can get lit too
---
What sort of effect do you think it will have? I'm imagining a server where half the people embrace discord, and the other half don't, so you have two disconnected communities on the same server.
---
I don't have a full screen option! Just borderless or window?
---
Totally. Movie trailers are usually shit and rarely give a good sense of what the movie is about. Just trashy special effects to hype up the ADD kids.
---
Most of the private server players were more or less casuals, the game will have stuff for everyone. Dont feel put off by guilds speedrunning or using a ton of consumes for raids and so on. The game has a lot of stuff for everyone.
---

Wont be introduced till ZG since it was a boss debuff.
---
Different add-ons from pservers, so that won't help.  I think your last chance was the stress test before naming.  I don't see them opening it up again.
---
All Pserver players are going on pvp realms. So Play on a pve server and your problem is solved. Or I guess you can also go RP-PVP, those tend to have friendly communities.
---
Anyone know how much vanilla will cost monthly and upfront?
---
I disagree. For the style that it's in, it's very well done. They've nailed it imo.

Yeh. To be honest if you make that kind of mistake you don’t deserve to have it reversed.

A department can be budgetized and most commonly are. You will see cuts to one project of a department while others are given more resources. They don't even need to beat the other department just show a increase growth. This is all standard for a business.

Why did i read that like the detotated wam person

Check out "bug-a-salt" on amazon  you're welcome.
---
Some of my favorite parts of vanilla and tbc were attunements.  I can understand hating it if you have 5 alts but as a mostly single character player it always felt very rewarding to work my way into new dungeons like that.
---
The no change group will fight you tooth and nail on this one. However, I agree with you. An optional toggle for those things would be nice in the future.
---
The amount of layers is anything but irrelevant. It directly indicates how many people are active on the server. If a layer has a population of about 3k then having 100 layers means there's about 300k players on that server at the time.
---
I have a friend that would power lvl to 60 in about a week back in the day. Course now he has a family and full time job so I doubt that'll be the case this time around. Isn't the record 5 days or so?
---
Pservers have amazing communities.  Back in 2005 we were on irc , also 'colluding' with the opposite faction.  It's not like it was the middle ages back then.  We had Ventrillo, Teamspeak, irc, MSN, plenty of social media.  We also had guides, Allakazam, Thotbot, Elitist Jerks.  
---
The fact that the game is well known and some players will hardcore speedrun it, does not have a great influence on the community.   Casuals and ultra hardcores are just the  extremes of the whole spectrum, they can coexist peacefully with enough room in the middle for all kinds of shades of grey.
---
Most likely I’ll keep everything maxed out save for the water, because I prefer the character of ye olde bubbles that Vanilla had.
---
Oh my favorite thing as a hunter even post the combat pulse was Feign Death-&gt;trinket swap to Defib-&gt;res attempt...had it save a boss kill at least a few times cause of a clutch healer res
---
Look at it like this. You're leveling speed is broken down into three parts, kill time, recovery time and travel time. In balance/resto, you probably do get slightly higher kill speeds, but your recovery and travel time are both much higher. In feral your kill speeds are still good, but you have virtually no recovery time and faster travel time too.
---
My friend saved me the character name I’ve used since vanilla, when I got home he deleted so I could take it but the servers were being laggy, and you couldn’t recreate any characters. 30 minutes later I tried but then someone else already took the name:(
---
wand spec and spirit tap to speed the leveling process.
---
Sounds pretty dope. Was planning herb eng for both either way. Is there a spec that works with both pve/pvp. Also, swords or daggers
---
Can you do that pretty please 🤗
---
Just tried the new client for the first time during this last stress test. The game blew my expectations away. I was honestly expecting it to look kind of bad in 4k, but for a 15 year old game, Classic can pull off 4k HDR. It's a pretty good compromise between old school flavor and new school graphics.
---
Hold up, those are old and have mistakes. Here: [https://imgur.com/a/jasUkRu](https://imgur.com/a/jasUkRu)
---
These are the updated ones.
---
Can't wait for Desolace and WPL to be good and *dead* again.
---
And closer to Menethil Harbor and both Plaguelands.
---
Menethil gives you access to Darnassus, Felwood and Winterspring with the Auberdine boat, as well as Un'Goro and Silithus from Theramore. 
---
If we're talking about endgame utility, there's no real benefit SW other than better access to STV and Blasted Lands.
---
&gt;Classic is something that's really close to my heart.
---
Fuck out of here with that bullshit.
---
Its still there
---
I literally have no idea what the fuck you're talking about 👋
---
is he? or just a smart marketer to generate revenue from kids parents wallet? /shrug
---
The word profession never left the dudes fingers.  So you definitely did not read his comment.
---
It was nice speaking with you.
---
There is Azeroth Auto Pilot. It's a setup route with GPS and basically leads you anywhere.
---
So would you say you expect it to be not really much different from the split between hardcore and casual players back in vanilla?
---
Every NPC refers to you as a hero or champion, the storylines all revolve around you being special. Unlike Vanilla where you're just an adventurer.
---
And the one where you could duel in front of the bank by going behind the pillar and starting the fuel.
---
Doubt it, if anything streamer communities will ruin it for you before PS players.
---
Times change. Things evolve.
---
I think I may be happier as a rogue too just because it's the type of gameplay I normally go for, but that's also why I'm wondering if I just push myself out of my comfort zone and do the complete opposite and heal.
---
Though I've been reading some people talk about mages as well and now I'm being tempted by them haha
---
Were you around for the EC tunnel days?
---
Yo those fist weapons were so amazingly unique, good choice. I remember the sound clip that would play when someone with them got the proc, it was bugged for a while so it would play the tiger sounds super loudly to everyone in the zone even if you were far away.
---
And for some the journey starts at the end ;)
---
Thing is, nobody is going to make or read a guide that just say 'play whatever at your own pace'
---
Of course all we'll see are minmaxing and speedrunning guides, but that doesn't mean everyone will do it like that.
---
Settle down leroy
---
Brox is the most heroic character in the lore. Change my mind.
---
They do Rend runs because a lot of people don’t care about the rest of the instance and you save more than half of the time. Doesn’t mean Dal’Rends are particularly hard to get, their drop rate is higher than a lot of the other prebis in this game.
---
It’s mostly the cancerous pserver crowd that’s rushing to 60 to get the world first in a 15 year old game with 15 year old content. Same crowd that keep saying only warriors can tank or only priests can heal. Just play the game and have fun. Fuck what these people think.
---
Ultima Online had this even before Everquest. If you had a house somewhere, as part of the "placeable furniture" you could put a vendor NPC in your house or outside on the steps/porch. Then you could load this guy up with anything, and set a sale price.

This is how a lot of people sold their Vanq items because it was more secure than personal trade with scammers.

Vanilla was so much about the journey for me that by the time I reached the destination (raids), BC was right around the corner. Definitely going to take my time and enjoy leveling all over again but I also want to partake in what I missed out back then. My guild literally only did BWL once right before BC was announced and then everyone quit cause what was the point.
---
It's been canon for a few days. It's an NPC now. Also he got his name.
---
Ahh I guess I assumed you knew how to make gold at a low level like fishing. That was my bad I shouldn't assume.
---
Think our rogues were the ones with engineering, but they did the same thing. Usually just for recovery though -- good luck pulling a rogue away from the boss' backside during combat &gt;.&gt;

Naked Drunks From The Trailer Park IV
---
This is great lol. Really does capture one of the biggest reasons why I don't find modern WoW compelling anymore.
---
The female night elf torso is half the size of her legs...
---
No. I played then. Elitist jerks was a thing, logs were a thing, sims were a thing, omen threat meters and dps meters were a thing.
---
People knew how to play the game.  Hardcore raiders knew how to play the game. Maybe you sucked back then, but my guilds sure didn't.
---
Private servers are not vanilla wow.  And they aren't classic wow either.
---
Sort of.  The definition of hardcore has changed, but casuals are pretty much the same.
---
Anyone else here not gonna no life it? I plan on taking over a month to level. And I'm gonna enjoy it
---
I mean yes. They should be able to just add more layers and take in an arbitrary number of players but I don't think they want to do that because that would mean that they will not be able to achieve a healthy population with a single layer down the line. 
---
For that reason, and this is just my own theory, they might add artificial queues to make people roll on other servers. That way players will roll on other servers because the queues are too long but if you really wanna join (to play with friends) you can.
---
I think a streamer server would be fun.  They will have community events and more than normal servers, be active in it.
---
Every server is going to have the bad guilds/players.  This server, you just know who they are.  
---
World PVP will be quite a adventure for sure!
---
If Blizzard wants to update Classic after launch with new things, the most welcome and least disruptive change is going through all the old models and updating their fidelity. Some of this is already done in retail! And then for those who wish it, they can enable the "Classic HD" mode. The unchanged game, but with HD graphics.
---
Lots of people will play relaxed. I know I will, and I know there will be a lot. But as is the nature of that sort of game-play, we're not posting much. You end up seeing all the posts of people concerned with max efficiency, fastest paths, etc because they have plenty to figure out. Those of us who are laid back about it, well.. see you in game.
---
Maybe if you had a large and robust frame to absorb high amounts of damage you would be less sensitive.
---
Bad troll is bad troll
---
So true. My all time favorite memory from Nilla was at roughly lvl 44-46 I was in the searing gorge. Questing along with my first character an Orc hunter. I see at max visibility two alliance players coming towards me. All three of us just stop walking and stare at each other unsure of what to do. Both of them are my level and I figure I’m in trouble. We both kind of walk side ways to create distance from each other. It’s a warrior and a priest. The second we get parallel I see them start to turn. I instantly send my pet in on the hunter and lay some traps down. Freeze the warrior in place before he can charge and root the priest with my spider. Blasting both of them with Arcane shots and Dots alternating and cc-ing who I could. Playing my ass off, timing everything out perfectly. I don’t even think I was breathing, holding my breathe. At the end they both lie dead and I had about 10-15 HP remaining. I felt invincible at that moment. Best Classic memory hahaha the good old days! 
---
~FOR THE HORDE~
---
While that mage was out there studying the arcane arts, Jordan had studied the "I'm going to whack you with my staff for a third of your health bar"
---
Sure of course the amount of layers will be proportional to the number of people online. But that will vary over a single day with more at the peak time and less in mornings and so on. 
---
For me it easier to speculate in how many total players there are at launch vs how many online players there are at a given time. Blizz obviously has some prediction models for that and thats what they base the low, medium, high off of. 
---
The number of layers will follow whatever the online population is.
---
I did that in 2006. Not gonna do it again.
---
Can someone please explain this to me?
---
**TASTE THE FLAMES OF SULFURON!**
---
Did you mean to reply to me?
---
Low gear pvp i definitely prefer daggers, carry some thistle tea and have fun. No good PvE spec is "good" in pvp, you can still kill people but you're missing out on lots of control and escape with double blinds, sprints, vanishes, evasion etc.  
---
I love to run 16/12/23 on a new server. You have good damage for dungeons and insane mobility and burst in pvp. With vanish breaking roots/slow, and sprint doing the same AND you can pop them twice, yeah its a good way to absolutely decimate a mage. If you get good swords like CTS/AQR I'd definitely go hemo though.
---
What's the default settings if you want to revert it without deleting WTF folders, etc?
---
Are you me?
---
Noh, nowy tends
---
Zero but you need an active retail WoW subscription.

And heres the 5th repost of the same video.

Looks like a right Chad, as they are
---
I'm just a curious college student working on my computer science degree, what kind of job do you have where you can afford all this? I'm just curious.
---
You'll probably end up tanking more raid fights than druids will :D
---
Gonna be making them up on character creation before I log in to play, all the alts I'll intend to play at some point.
---
Father Keto? lmaowtf
---
exactly, with more 'in between' variants as well
---
You can buy race changes, so I find it easier to level as a human, but endgame you need to be dwarf to raid as a mage.
---
Racial passives are pay to win.
---
As long as you have a subscription to the current wow you'll be able to play wow classic
---
Found the salty night elf.
---
True though :/
---
Oof
---
I am so damn excited to do old Sunken Temple. I know that's a dungeon not a zone but, when they revamped that dungeon that was when my hardcore love for the game died and it's been deteriorating since.
---
"making a mage drag a box over while he spams 1 button will never happen, did i mention i like the smell of my own farts?"
---
&gt;ard wow classic?
---
NE best choice, confirmed.
---
I made a new one that includes the new servers. NA only though.
---
https://forms.gle/Jnm7xtNEDVra2ExM7
---
How is that different from it has ever been, in every MMO?
---
I want to say that is private server mumbo jumbo.  I quit when cata dropped though so it's been so long.
---
I too haven't been satisfied with other games in anticipation for Classic. Something I did have a lot of fun playing around with the other day is the Stormwind SteamVR enviroment.
---
It's pretty epic to walk around classic stormwind with my frostmourne in hand (find it at the main gates). If you have a VR setup I highly recommend you give it a spin.
---
[Steam Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1785833257) if anyone wants to give it a try 👍👍👍
---
Love the warlock responses. I think you’ve helped me make my mind up
---
You gotta get to lvl 60! 
---
Seriously, go to Bali. I haven’t been on vacation for 3 years and I would give everything to be in your shoes! Besides, family won’t be there forever - games will.
---
Sounds like everyone’s divided in that server into their own little groups instead of just playing the game.
---
I started in WotLK and have been an altoholic ever since. This time I am determined to choose just one character and play only them for Classic. :D
---
You literally save Azeroth countless times and kill an Old God in classic...
---
It’s an elaborate trap
---
Got it on last pserver I played.  Took hundreds of runs.  Finally I was talking to someone and he said the trick to get it is to disarm emp right before he dies.  Did this just cuz why not, and guess what it fucking dropped that run lol.
---
Another what class should I play question.  I played a little at the tail end of classic but mostly played as a druid raid healer in TBC.  
---
I think I want to go Human priest bc I like healing pve.  What do people think? 
---
I like warrior as a class but apparently they are hard to level, plus repairs are expensive.  Mage is another I'm considering, mostly for their mobility around the world map and just as a solid damage dealer.  I really like druid but I feel they are weak in classic, only having been improved in TBC.  Thoughts?
---
Im right there with you.
---
But there will be a maximum amount of layers, which is how a realm becomes 'full'. So if we knew what that was then we would have a better indication of the total amount of players.
---
Because you're holding names people might actually want as a bartering tool and that's shit. It's like being a scalper.
---
100% using this
---
I dont know if I could handle rolling on molly during the launch. It might make the experiece of queing alot better tho
---
Exactly same scenario as you. Hope we can make a wise desicion xD
---
My only concern is that people may get a little over carried away with elitism and trying to force everyone to play hardcore at all times. Doing something not approved by the elder guides is treated harshly. Seems too many people are in the mindset that if you aren’t farming Naxx or Top 10 in pvp then you are wasting everyone’s time by being a waste and bad team player.
---
Boi you suc, normie.
---
Back in 2006, when I had too much to drink, I would inevitably find myself in a BG channeling starshards on people and shouting “for Elune” in vent before dying horribly to dagger wielding zombies. So it has some uses...
---
Fuck I thought it was the 27th. I need to take Monday off now too.
---
Ooh, say hello to Stitches for me then, I love old Duskwood too!
---
I think that makes sense. I'm not very good at pvp myself, and I'm totally thinking "wow, if he can pull this off, maybe I can too".
---
Rogues in STV.  What a shtshow haha.
---
Does anyone remember how Orc vs Undead rogue racials changed in TBC?  I remember in TBC there were tons of undead rogues in STV.  Vanilla was more Orc.
---
I think Orc stun resist gets nerfed from 25% to 15% correct?  And cannibalize + WoTF &gt; 15% hardiness right?
---
Bring on STVietnam!
---
I'd say something here but the mods would delete my post.
---
Then you have certainly earned it! Thanks for your service. I'm nearly 29 and still have a ways to go to do something as impactful and disciplined as that. I skated by school fairly easily while playing WoW heavily, took something like 10 years before I couldn't play the expansions anymore, started improving myself through college a bit but really  only enough to get what I wanted (girls/friends/fitness/partying), graduated with Bachelors of Computer Science. And then the big moment, I got a job testing slot machines, burned out of that after 1.5 years or so after paying down student loans to a reasonable level and investing in Bitcoin/Ethereum, made a relatively small fortune while learning how to trade, then played tons of video games and smoked tons of weed/drank tons of alcohol while self employed for a few years. Can't go on that way forever without earning my place in the world a bit more as you have.
---
[ClassicCodex](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccodex) was updated today, u/devildanger added some cool features.

Any chance you can implement the arrow? Questie makes it really convenient for when you want to mindlessly grind Qs!
---
only the chosen who actually got good names are allowed to start them
---
Crazy? If you think it is crazy that people have different tastes and opinions you need to go outside more and see the world, lol.
---
Anyway, the models thing should be very easy to appease everyone: just make a toggleable button in video options...
---
Depends! If you find you're more free at like 6-9pm, East isn't a bad call. I feel like raids tend to happen from 9-12pm - generally - so that'd translate well if you wanted to raid earlier. Otherwise, I'd stick with your own timezone. It'll just make things a bit easier. Easy to forget when someone says "come back at 6pm" that they actually mean "3pm" for you!
---
More servers. They'll keep adding them. They'd rather start small than end up with dead realms.
---
And it tells you to round up other heroes for raid quests. It's the same thing, all that's missing is the title of hero.
---
I’m sure I saw something the other day about downloading the questie add on, but making the markers for everything but the quest givers (items, kills etc) really small so that they don’t appear on the map. I’m trying to find the post but can’t remember when it was. Maybe somebody can elaborate on this.
---
Aka 5 hours queue times fuck that
---
Well that explains why I only hear nothing more than just the character creation. Unfortunately I won't be able to play until semester ends. Hopefully I can find time. Thanks for the information.
---
They don't even have basic understanding of warfare. Their operational security is so not on point.
---
You mean they look like elves? Shocking.
---
You've just made an addon that turns you into an NPC.
---
That's... that's amazing.
---
Probably 18-21
---
Sounds good, ty for the help. Would a decent plan be go for core hounds and perditions then reroll into a dagger spec (doesnt seem like many good daggers until AQ) and spam out some dope pvp
---
Should have chosen a quiet hour of the day - like super early in the morning.
---
Only for level cap.  Below that they're generally all terrible.
---
I'd love something that gave me bis 20-30 I can get from quest rewards as an example.
---
Int does increase the speed at which you level skills - notably weapon skills. Unfortunately I'm not mixed up - I've seen plenty of people planning on rolling melee classes saying they wouldn't think twice about rolling on int, spi, or spi/int items with the logic being that they can use those stats so why shouldn't they?
---
\+dodge, +armor, and +crit from agi are awesome for a priest levelling out in the wild but pretty useless for a priest healing a dungeon. +regen and +weapon skill levelling are awesome for a melee class levelling out in the wild but pretty useless for a melee class tanking or dpsing a dungeon.
---
The point of my post was to contrast how Reddit (in general) responded a priest taking the agi gear vs the rogue taking spi/int/spi-int gear.
---
Gotta love when they concern troll with a passive aggressive comment, following a healthy and coherent post. That's how manipulative and dishonest people function.
---
There are already people offering money to buy specific names, so I would say that it has already begun.
---
I doubt they will do that... although I would wish they would fix the classes that "aren't working" (which would it make easier for me to chose druid) it would piss off A LOT of people that specifically return for "the classic experience"
---
I don't see it happen
---
Scale, mostly. But some other people made some arguments as to why it's not really that different and I think I can agree. There has always been some divide between hardcore and casual. The fact that there is a large group of people that have been playing for 10 years makes it a little bit different but as long as pserver players welcome other players it won't actually cause any problems.
---
Battlestar galactica.
---
Yeah but i can avoid streamers and south america
---
This sounds a little like *hurr-durr technology bad*, but I'm pretty sure you don't mean it that way and are just trying to promote discussion on the topic of modern chat/group options vs. just using the game.
---
People have been using world chats, private channel chats, AIM, Skype, Ventrilo, Teamspeak, Mumble, et cetera, for years in this game. Communication within WoW, or even outside of it for in-game purposes, isn't exactly new. It's just that it's much more common than it was during WoW's younger days. Heck, until MoP I avoided joining people's voice chats with relative ease (constant chatter gives me headaches, I don't like chatting in voice chat just like I hate using the telephone to talk to people), but they're pretty much a staple now, and you're expected to have Discord and know how to use it.
---
I think it'll be different, but I don't think it'll be bad. I have no desire or willingness to join random people's discords for dungeon runs, but if whatever guild I join has a discord server, I'll probably join that (I can just mute my mic/not join voice channels if I really want to avoid it).
---
Discord is interesting in that people tend to use it mobile a lot, so if you're on your guild's discord server, you might be able to get to know guildies quickly/chat about stuff during work/etc and so on—something that was downright impossible with Ventrilo and without smartphones/tablets. On the downside, getting to know guildies outside of the game, and chat being available more or less 24/7, could have some negative effects\*, but overall I think they'll be positive (especially if you find a really good group of like-minded people to play with).
---
\*I mostly mean that being available 24/7 can be draining/annoying. Thank god for the ability to mute servers!
---
Think you'll be able to add warlock pets before release? Love and use all your stuff!
---
Huh thank you for the detailed answer m8. That’s very useful to know.
---
For the Alliance!
---
When people say that Druids are weak, they mean in a raid setting. Feral cat Druids are perfectly viable for the casual play you’re describing. 
---
For professions, as a Druid you should consider enchanting for Smoking Heart of the Mountain (an incredible tanking trinket for Druids).
---
i7 4770K OC'd to 4.4 Ghz and a GTX 1070 gets me 135-150 FPS on my 3440 x 1440 ultrawide. Quality 10, with AA and low-res water because I think it fits the theme better.
---
Non OC 4770 with an AMD RX 580 4GB model gets 100 FPS at 1080p. Quality 10, no alterations AA turned up.
---
Yeah that's what I meant, there isn't much to talk about right now if you aren't looking for guides or advice unless you're an absolute new player.
---
INFINITE AS MAX AS THE SERVER CAN HANDLE
---
 7.5 billion USD REVENUE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE MORE THAN SOME SERVER HOSTED IN SOME GUYS BASEMENT IN FRANCE. 
---
But I GUESS NOT!!
---
I don’t have the exact number but it’s around there
---
Aepocalypse did a detailed answer if you’re interested. You are apparently a bit incorrect.
---
There were queues just to make a character name. Now imagine launch with everyone actually trying to play for hours on end, not just spend 5 min picking a name then logging out.
---
War never changes
---
If Minecraft Steve was available to play in WoW you can catch me in my block fort.
---
More likely they'd just shift work onto retail because they'd already have a lot of transferrable domain knowledge. It's a hell of a lot easier to keep someone who's already an expert than to hire someone with no knowledge of internal systems and processes.
---
Even in the most cutthroat business minded perspective, what you're proposing is idiotic, that Blizzard would fire someone from Classic and hire a new, different person, or shift shared dev resources from one "side" to the other in a way that would cause internal conflict. 
---
From the ground up, the Classic has been structured to be a feature of WoW and not a competing product, and that includes how it's monetized, how it's marketed, how the dev team is structured, and even the technology used to make it happen (building it on a shared engine, taking advantage of the enhanced file system to share assets, making it a drop down in the launcher, even down too making them both install into the same folder). Someone working at Blizzard getting upset that it gets less attention/budget would be like someone getting upset that pet battles haven't gotten as much love in a given expansion because fewer players were playing them. Even if you're literally "the pet battle dev", there's a lot of other things for you to work on without them just firing you and hiring someone else.
---
I don’t know? That’s the reason you write me off? Right before you make a statement that You don’t know anything about either. We will have to see to be sure, but to underestimate vanilla wow would be folly.
---
Sounds like some ez kills
---
Makes sense. I’ll be sure to try it, come release!
---
Was a joke, my dude.
---
No there is not a single person here who will, or single example of a post exactly like yours anywhere on the sub.
---
I have a slider but it goes max to 100%
---
It's not. Plus, you can get WW at 30.
---
Yeah I roll priest and realize how big wands are for leveling, but everywhere I've ever looked says wands are excluded from agility bonuses and as a priest you're only benefit is the armor/dodge. I'll have to do some testing.     
---
Yeah gear wise, sucks that the vanilla priest experience is essentially gearing everyone else is more important.
---
A thousand layers??
---
If each layer is 3k that would mean 3 million players per server. 
---
So with 30 servers world-wide that would mean 90 million people playing classic wow :p 
---
I think wow at its peak has had like 11 million at most.
---
Another reason answers will be mixed is that some guilds will require an off tank to have the same spec as the main tank, while other guilds will be fine with off tank being DPS spec. You'll have to wait and see what kind of guilds you encounter on your server
---
Fast and short? Oh I know what the ladies like

Thank you! This seem really interesting addon, especially that internal database part.
---
This is ridiculous. The term 'wow' became 10x time more researched suddenly around late 2004 and you're gonna tell me that it's not because of Vanilla? like people suddenly started typing 'wow' in google back then for unrelated reasons? that it's totally coincidence that it follows subscription count? Ok then how do you explain "world of warcraft' research show mostly the same? https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=classic%20wow,wow%20bfa,battle%20for%20azeroth,world%20of%20warcraft
---
Well they said they expect full realms to have extended queues, so that would indicate they have a limit of players that they're going to allow on the server.
---
Sewer Beast :)

Many startups have a single network. Not everyone works in government or companies with enough department budget to spend thousands on network equipment and pay resources to set it up.

Of course having segregated lans is ideal, but is out of the question a lot of times in many companies.

I leveled as a feral/resto druid.  It's a blast and you can fill any role in groups.  Your tanking is not as good as a warrior's, but it's fine for leveling dungeons and good enough for lvl 60 5-mans if you know what you're doing.  If you join to heal, your healing is fine, but your role will need to be complemented by a DPS who can rez like a shaman or ret paladin, or the group must be very careful to not die.  Your DPS as cat is mediocre, but you bring nice buffs and off heals to make up for it.
---
You can also join up with some rogues and do BRD/LBRS stealth runs to farm bosses for gear.  I had some friends who did this a ton in classic.  Three druids and a rogue at lvl 60 can farm LBRS easily and quickly, probably Dire Maul as well.
---
Build multiple gear sets to specialize in your given role.  A hybrid resto/feral druid needs a set of +int/spirit for healing, +stam for bear, and +agi/str for cat.  With careful mana management and a good set of gear, any group you heal will never know that you dumped a bunch of points in Feral.
---
As far as solo'ing, this spec is quite good.  You're basically a rogue without the fancy tools, but you can heal to full between pulls, so your survival is still just as good, if not much better.  No, you can't vanish, but you can root+heal/run.
---
For raids, you will be most likely relegated to a healing role, but might possibly be asked to go bear for OT.  Cat and Owl are right out.  Cat's dps is just not very good, and Owl doesn't have the sustain to last an entire raid fight.  But fear not, your ability to solo or tank, even if you go all the way down to Innervate, is still quite good with a gear set to buff the relevent stats.
---
For production professions, Leatherworking or Alchemy would both serve you pretty well.  Leatherworking can help fill out gearsets for casting or melee, and Alchemy can give some nice buffs to whatever stat you choose in the form of elixers, and they all stack with Mark of the Wild.  And you can have as many at a time as you have mats for.
---
I can't share tactics but yeah, week 1 rag will happen. My guild does not expect to be first or even first on the server but unless something  goes really wrong we will get week 1 rag.
---
You can also just put things in trade chat or AH, point is with this addon you can setup your character as a vendor when you’re not doing anything
---
Its DMN DME DMW and DM tribute. DM is deadmines. you dont have all your cups in the cupboard do you
---
Your #4 is a bit misleading.
---
MCP is borderline necessary for picking up initial threat once your raid is in Full BWL gear+ (likely not til AQ), which is also the time warriors begin speccing fury-prot and taking off their shields for 80% of the raid (for initial and sustained threat) .
---
For the druid though, this really only applies to a bear main tank, which guilds usually only run for the luls (or baked into their guild roster by design) outside of a few fights.
---
Everything else is rock solid though, just wanted to clarify.
---
As opposed to permanently sitting in roots being killed by rank 1 frostbolt lmao.
---
Oh man, I have a bunch of those - figured they'd be worth something one day, think I picked em up for 50g each.
---
Thanks for the idea
---
That fearthepib guy sounds like a smart feller.
---
I see night elf male increased in legion. Where do you see decrease?
---
👉🙄
---
Just like fuck
---
Looks like a hunter weapon to me
---
I played prot warrior through all of vanilla.  You will gear up far quicker and easily get groups if you just start off tanking.  You will get gear on the side for dps because odds are you won't be running with any other melee dps unless it's a rogue.  I'm speaking in reference to dungeons/10man.  You are essentially doubling your gear progression time the way you describe.
---
Pfft. Casuals.
---
Jk, most people are just going to play the game naturally, only a vocal minority will be try-harding like you see on Reddit.
---
Felwood. &gt;:\]c
---
Yes. Sorry guy :(
---
Yes, they are using layering so that there aren’t 30k people in the starting zones. But there will be queues because of how many people the server can handle. 
---
This is just speculation from me, but a census report from someone’s add on showed 30k people on just on the alliance side. That would mean that they can hold 60k people on each server. There will be queues because say 80k people created chars on said server, but only 60k can play at a time.
---
This guy ☝️❤

you can have way better quality water in the current classic than what was available in vanilla.

Shield spikes do not proc seals.  It's just a flat damage amount that goes back.  There is an overall "block damage" amount that happens though, like if you have blessing of sanctuary AND a shield spike you only see the net damage done (Blessing of Sanc + shield spike) rather than two separate numbers.  I don't remember if holy shield is added onto that total that you see displayed or if it's a separate number too.
---
Interesting idea, but it's really not much different than spamming in trade-chat.
---
Shhhh dont tell our secret. #banks

Thats dead tho
---
I'd forgotten Shadowmeld was Improved AFK in Vanilla. Not the Vanish Lite of retail.
---
He got enough mana when there was less than a second left on the root, and if he didn't use that mana to heal he would've been dead. I don't see how this is even debatable
---
No i havnt heard of VuhDo, i will look into it. 
---
Thank you for the suggestion
---
This is legit a fantastic idea, been meaning to replay it anyways
---
Dude u heard theres a new mobile diablo game, i heard its really good!
---
Uhhhhh I hate all the resistance gears ....

*classic fever* I've got it too
---
Well met, citizen. Hopefully see you in Stormwind!
---
You can kick a paladin and school lock him so he can't mount.  So that's fun.
---
Isnt Thunderfury BiS for Fury or am I mistaken?
---
I had to replay it to make sure I wasn't hearing things haha
---
Yes, I mentioned that in the post. I did some questing in Barrens with the smallest options and the results were that 1) the loot icons which showed where your zebras with their hooves where became tiny specs, unreadable, yet it still somewhat ruined the look of the map, and 2) kill and collect icons were still rather small, but readable enough to give away the quest locations. Again, I do wonder if one can just simply delete the unwanted icon files from the addon without breaking it, as that might be the easiest solution
---
Looking forward to giving this a shot. Thanks for the work you put in
---
source?
---
enjoy!
---
It's hard to say what kind of impact they will have on the server since streaming never existed when vanilla did, at least not in it's current form.
---
However, what we can look at are trends.
---
Jump on an asmondgold stream when he is playing retail wow. What does it look like? How many people are following him around? What does chat look like? How many people are showering him with free everything? Will that impact the economy? How overpowered will one streamer get because of this?
---
These are only a few of the things to take into consideration.
---
Other things to think about:
---
What happens if that streamer decides to quit classic? How many of his fans will also stop playing the game leaving a possible server imbalance?
---
Again, it's really hard to say just what kind of an impact they will have on a server. All I know is I don't really want to play on a server where some eceleb is going to have a stupid unfair advantage because his droves of fans will feed him gold, items, carries, you name it.

I want to read the quests, too. I've been trying to read the novels for a year or so. Just started War of the Ancients.
---
Do you mean set it to windowed the click to maximise the window?
---
Sharding makes more room, but still a server has a limit of players it can handle witouth problems
---
I won't say they shouldn't exist, in fact I think having a little of that helps the world feel real. But I think it should be happening mostly through hints of off-screen events and occasional cameos.  *My* time spent in game should be focused on *my* story, and it shouldn't be about how I was named champion of some other characters cause.  We went from being adventurers to being employees. 
---
I think this gets to a bigger question, one about **whether an RPG world should be static or dynamic**. There's no right answer, but I have noticed that mostly-static worlds feel bigger and more alive to me.  It feels like the problems and organizations are big and my single character's contribution is small. If the whole world keeps shifting politics and geography every time I (or an NPC) complete a quest, things start feeling like cardboard cutouts.

The reason I’m asking for an off-tank is because between school and work I may not have the time to dedicate to being a main tank for my guild. I kind of want to be more expendable so I’m not holding the group back.
---
Do to Server [name] having long queue times we’ve decided to offer a 50% off sale for those wanting to transfer off the server. 
---
We’re listening!!!
---
Well there you have it. I'd suggest OP goes with an appropriate name if making a character. Luckily I don't play retail anymore so my names shouldn't be disruptive to the server

Alright, thanks for the replies. I thought it was probably too good to be true lol.
---
i mean even if they were super on rails they had good stories that were funny. a prime example being the day deathwing came in badlands, and honestly all of badlands (i’ve only played through the alliance side there idk if it’s different on the horde)
---
Golemagg it is then. Seems to be the only reasonable option.
---
Would be more impressive if he didn't bring several other players like a little bitch.
---
I'm all for killing streamers, but at least fight fair, you pussy.
---
Yeah, my theory is they will artificially make a hard limit on the servers so that the queues will make people go to other servers. That way they can try to keep numbers down. Just speculation. 
---
I mean if they wanted I'm sure they could make an arbitrary number of layers and take everyone in without queues but they don't want to.
---
I feel that too. What if so many people join Herod that we have an unbearable queue, like an hour plus? I'd almost expect it for the first week, but what happens if we still have the same queue in two months, and we've already put a lot of time into leveling a character on that realm? Maybe it won't be that bad, but if Blizzard comes through on their promise to quickly end layering, are we going to be jam packed into Herod with 10k plus people, AND suddenly a queue since it's all in the same layer? The most reasonable option to me would be to offer free transfers to lower populated realms when they do away with layering, with the understanding that you may not get to keep your name, and let the players know this before launch so choosing a realm doesn't feel like a life or death decision.
---
Exalted with darnassus is required (unless you are a night elf) for tiger riding, i would advise you to level from level 6 at the nightelfs starting area because grey quests will give you alot less reputation, and will save you alot of runecloth aswell.

Well this solves my question whether to go Gehennas or ZT at least
---
Night elf cat form? It’s awesome. Sleek, nice color, nothing too out of place. Same goes for their bear form. Moonkin form is whatever but doesn’t matter.
---
Tauren cat form? If I wanted to look at a balding monster with a nearly detached neck due to awful posture I’d just put a selfie stick on my back and aim the camera directly at my bald spot.

They’re all on one server so...

There's no point in running two warriors. Unless you like torturing yourself. Just tank the low level 5man dungeons in any spec.
---
When your project is completed, will you release it on you tube? I’d love to watch it.
---
Hello all,
---
I played a bit at release back in the days, but stopped around level 20. 
---
I'm a super casual player. Interested mostly in the lore/questing. Planning on doing group dungeons but not raids.
---
My brother is a veteran player, he is going to be playing a Healer Paladin.
---
I'm interested in playing a paladin because lore and free mount. But I don't want to play a healer.
---
I will be playing with my brother. I know warrior tank would mean a great combo.
---
So I'm leaning toward paladin dps or "tank" but from what I read they have a bad rep. 
---
I'm also interested by the hunter class.
---
Do you guys think I should go for paladin ? 
---
Thanks in advance for your answers
---
Some have a big enough following that they can crash a server just by saying meet me at ...
---
That's pretty much what everyone is trying to avoid, being at the mercy of a big streamers whims and giggles.
---
For the most part most streamers aren't so bad, just a dude/lady getting paid to play a game they like, running around doing normal things and talking shit. so no different than the rest of us.
---
Some of them even make an effort to raise the community,  saying things like. "they are just learning, they will get better, just give them some time" instead of "that dude totally sucks"
---
leaks in some source code enabled fans to fill in the blanks and create the best they could.
---
Lots of guess work
---
I will, its about the journey not the end for me.
---
Blackhand isn't in classic. Maybe pick someone from the movie that's in classic like baby thrall
---
the only purpose of layers is to help prevent dead servers after launch.  and just cause they said that doesn't they won't change their minds.
---
You can quite easily obtain good daggers preraid (Barmans shanker is great in pvp) but u cant use it in raids due to the debuff slot it takes up. You can solo the boss that drops it too so super easy to get early.   
---
Yes, ideally you want perds MH and cht OH, bwl has no good dagger (vael dagger is okay if you dont get perds before that). With perds and some t1/t2 you'll wreck faces, daggers is super fun early because everyone is squishy and you have insane amounts of burst. If you happen to get the sword from ony, hemo is a great option with such a slow MH with 240dmg chance on hit on top of that.
---
Need some context, what's the purpose of the project? We used to get given a statement of some kind for a project and went from there.
---
Tends to be a holy disc split spec unless they go deep disc to buff a mage in raids.
---
The comments on the pvp videos are always hilarious- apparently everyone is a rank 14 god that doesn’t lose, and someone always snickers and says how they would have done things better and differently.
---
The issue is blizzard would lose more people who won't wait for a dead server to be merged. It's easier to transfer a few people not attached to their server than to merge them. All in all, dont worry about it. If you lived during vanilla wow, you'll just have heavy queues during raid hours and be fine the rest.

&gt;Spy will record when you make a killing blow against an enemy player. Likewise, it will also record when an enemy player makes a killing blow against you. These statistics can be seen in the tooltip that appears when you hover over the enemy player's entry in the list.

No problem, hope you enjoy classic friend! :)

I really REALLY want to heal, I'll have a group to level with but I don't know what to play between priest or paladin. I'll be doing some solo leveling when my group isn't around and I'd like to have a somewhat easy time doing things by myself.
---
"internet addict" Ahh 2007, a simpler time
---
I'm very confident I'll be In the 40ish range.
---
you're being wishful honestly.  What about all the other streamers who hop to a new game just because it's new?
---
i wont be suprised if servers get adding at launch when other servers are having queues
---
That laughing actually got annoying.

They literally are.  Will they stay there? Time will tell.  But they’re all there at launch.

---
Overwhelmingly people's raid times during the work week start sometime after 6 and before 8. Probably around 90% of recruitment postings fall in that 2 hour window.
---
Meaning if as a PST player want to play week days, but don't want to be that rush - I have a very limited window (10-20%) of guilds to play with.
---
Alternatively if I was a EST player, I could play PST and have many more options available in that later night slot - meaning much more likely to find a quality guild compatible for me.
---
Any videos?
---
*followed by All Along The Watch Tower*
---
Most of the private servers are actually restored off the burning crusade code - not vanilla. 
---
There’s a ton of work that the private servers put in to manually script things etc. 
---
A lot of it was guess work or looking back at footage, data collected from back in the day etc.
---
Yeah that would be helpful. I suspect if the server is full, you definitely will have cues but there is no telling how much above full the servers are. 
---
Since we can expect even more people later that haven't reserved names yet I would definitely consider going to another server but. You could always just wait and see how it looks on the 26th and decide then.
---
ah yeah great point.  I forgot they're kinda competing against themselves if they advertise too much.
---
Leveling my warrior, everytime someone asked for a tank in my guild I reset my spec to tank EVERYTIME.
---
My guild master level 60 was intrigued as I was so slow to level up... He bought me a mount at level 45~ and explain that it was kind but stupid, and not needed....
---
I will roll a drood feral this time ;)
---
That's why you invite a random person and have them act as your pet until lvl 10.

Appreciate your reply. I am thinking along the same lines as you re the frustration with melee. I hate that my decision is being made for me in the long term.
---

The females just look way to leggy from my memory. But it wont stop me from playing the best race!
---
Roll warlock. You can banish one, fear one, and seduce one for the 1v4's.
---
Half vs half is very different from 1/10th vs 1/10th vs 1/10th... etc. There is a lot more opportunity for two large groups that are roughly equal to each decide that the things they like are the right things and then hate the other group for not liking the same things. When the split among a larger number of smaller communities they tend to recognize that nobody really has the "right" answer and that different people just have different ways of doing things. Those communities look at each other as similar groups just doing whatever they can rather than looking at them as a threat to their way of doing things.
---
In vanilla, the target for hatred was the other faction, and smaller groups could work together and unite against them. If you get half the server on discord, across both factions, the target for hate can easily become "those plebs that don't use the discord" as I've seen plenty of demonstrations of it already with pserver players hating everyone who didn't also play on a pserver.

What is Blizzard supposed to do, write up dialogue, quest text and all other kinds of content for every single possible scenario of a character missing some kind of content in between? 
---
No, the only viable option is to design the content (dialogues, quest text etc) as if the player character completed all content before the current content. And that definitely makes the player character a hero for defeating Ragnaros, C'thun, KT, Illidan, Arthas and all the other baddies....
---
I remember it costing upwards of 600g on my server. A friend of mine sold one also for even more and got his epic mount from it.
---
can you please please do stalagg i want to make a poster for the server to get more people interested but all of the photos of stalagg are shit quality
---
Currently I'm trusting Reddit to market it as I'm busy with development. And I think that it will also spread if people are using it in field. Because now it's just a myth and many people don't care for addons yet, because they can't test it without Classic not being released yet
---
More than enough roleplayers choose a a character of the opposite sex - Mind you, nearly everyone I know only really roleplays in chat and not in voice comms. You'll have no issues blending in and if you do want to roleplay, then you can be whoever/whatever you wish to be regardless of gender. (Though within certain realistic boundries, as roleplaying a rock elemental doesn't quite fit the appearance of a gnome mage)
---
Off topic for a moment, this reminds me of a low-level warlock I used to roleplay as. I always had a demon out (imp or void) and would usually respond to spontanious roleplay as if the warlock was "controlled" by whichever demon was out. So essentially, roleplaying something else than your race/class is possible in some scenarios.
---
Back on the topic of how to not disturb RP - Quite easy: You either don't directly engage with any RP happening, or you excuse yourself (in character) from any roleplay that you do end up being involved in. Usually the second is followed by a whisper to the involved player(s) explaining you're new to an RP realm and taking things slow.
---
Scenario 1: You're running through Stormwind for a quest and enter the Cathedral - A player dressed as a guard near the entrance tries to stop you from entering as there's an important meeting going on between high-ranking priests and paladins inside.
---
In such a scenario, you can just run through and they'll automatically shift gears (this player isn't interested/on auto pilot/not worth effort), however, there's a second option. 
---
You can stop briefly, say something like "I have an urgent letter for &lt;Questmob&gt; that cannot wait, please let me through."
---
Usually, you'll be immediately permitted to pass, and on rare occasions you might even be escorted or even invited to parttake in further roleplay. Even if the guard is a bit obnoxious and demands you wait, you can just go ahead and argue or run in at that point.
---
Scenario 2: A group is assembling at the dungeon entrance and waiting for the last members to get there. They start introducing themselves in-character. You can always /w people or say in party chat that you haven't experienced many roleplays before and aren't sure how to go about it. Worst case you get (unwanted) tips. Maybe they'll just treat you like your character is naturally the quiet type. Either way, you should be fine. Plus, if anyone's ever less than friendly with you, just hit that ignore button like it's NEED on your BiS weapon in the game.
---
Hope this helps you a bit. Let me know if you have any other questions.
---
Blizzard confirmed they're the right size in a post a while ago about bug fixes.
---
This is me but with servers. I wanna roll Fairbanks but all my friends want to go Herod for some reason and I cant convince them to avoid that over crowded, far off server.
---
Thanks for your input. Appreciate your honesty. I think I’m just going to have to put up with the frustration while overseas and then when my ping is better the real game can begin. Maybe a hunter would be good to get my gold base started anyway..
---
Every pvp server you see now will be full during launch, so stating that you'd rather be in a full server infers that you think the server stats now from name reservations will be indicative of them at launch..
---
It's a wind runner without wings dude it looks dope as hell. If you want anime cat that's up to you, live your life.
---
When you play a game (any game) third, fourth, etc time, don't you want to do something different and more efficient this time?
---
That's pretty much what we're doing. I have 1 character one 3 different servers. If the queue on Herod is like 4+ hours then I'm dipping.
---
&gt; Who gets it? 
---
The one who does a bigger Need roll.
---
No no you misunderstand.  That is wow streamers.  What about all those others streamers that play a game just because it''s hype?  They don't go by a code lol.  They won't care about rep.
---
But, they actually talked to one another in BFA.  That never happens.
---
Skip Ancestral Spirit skill above the base Rank 1.
---
Keep Mana Spring, Stoneskin, Strength, WF, Flametongue, Fire Nova, Magma up to date.
---
Take Tremor and Earthbind, Poison/Disease Cleansing totems, and Grounding Totem.
---
Skip all the other totems, including resistance.
---
Take Water Walking/Breathing. Take Ghost Wolf, Reincarnation, and Astral Recall.
---
Skip frost shock above base Rank 1
---
Skip Farsight
---
Skip Frostbrand Weapon
---
Take all your Lightning Shields, Lightning Bolts, Chain Lightnings, Flame Shocks, Earth Shocks, and Heals. Take all your Flametongue Weps, WF weps, Rockbiter weps (if you're going to use RB). Take all your Purges on PvP server.
---
Skip everything else not listed. (stoneclaw is good for the first 15-20 levels, but stoneskin is better. You can take SC totem if you want).
---
What you're describing was a well-known glitch, not an intentional feature.
---
Thex isn't hunter. All loot goes to Thex
---
Well, There are a few options. I chose the model set I wont mind looking at for 600 hrs.
---
it was there because of a glitch. it wasnt intended.
---
This is also you secure free items and free dungeon runs.
---
No, but lore is way down on the list of things I care about
---
I also think he should be uploaded
---
No unnecessary changes to the game. Only ones viable to upkeep from a business perspective should be done. Layering, not too many servers, using new client, phases vs patches for content and some bug fixes are okay.  Remember, this cost money to set up and get working and unlike expansions, cost nothing but a service subscription. 
---
They cant go over budget if we want what we want and the future expects as servers.
---
But you do have a race who sole purpose to be a tasty BBQ for hungry alliance.
---
No it wouldnt
---
You can have best of both worlds. Wotlk was great, because it slightly improved upon old models and improved upon the hideous druid forms. I would love to play druid this time around, but the disgusting looking cat/bear form really turns me off.
---
I had improved druid forms installed when I played on pservers and loved playing druid with them.
---
Well, unpopular opinion, but my feeling is that people are going to play for 1 month and realize this is a very different, very hard game.  And there will be a core group but will it be enough to devote resources to maintain?  Because now they have to have developers recode all the crap the coded before, 10 years ago, things like tokens, LFG, etc.   Or they could just say "nah we're not doing that", and you'll be stuck in vanilla forever.  
---
I guess i'm in the majority that says this is probably going to fail, and it's not as fun as you think.  There was A LOT of grinding in vanilla.  An ass ton of travel.  Very little story continuity.  Everything was hard, tedious.  My point being is that this is a very different game than modern MMOs, and i don't think there will be a sustainable population in say 6 months time.
---
Gold
---
Only Night Elves can be druid on Alliance.
---
So it’s about including everyone, except those that don’t speak English. Still doesn’t make sense to me my dude.
---
Wasn’t that Everquest?
---
Why would that be impossibly hard to achieve?
---
I wouldn't worry.  If you enjoy the slower pace of completing an average of 0.9 quests per hour, you will be just fine.
---
I don’t think you understand what decent means.
---
That's actually a really good comparison, which makes the answer a a pretty obvious "of course not". Thanks.
---
Yeah there's a lot of pros and cons to both builds. It's definitely stronger in 1v1 scenarios but you take a large hit when being focused in group PvP. Though the playstyle is more fun (imo) and has more outplay potential.

I started with near ultra, then went back down to the Classic setting. There was just too much grass and the water actually looked like warm bile on those settings. Even if I were to run ultra, I would set water at LOW. It looks best that way, in this peasant’s opinion.
---
I will continue to tweak ~slightly up from the “Classic” settings without straying too from the way the game originally looked. One thing I really appreciated though was the GAMMA setting with a bit of contrast and brightness adjustment. Oftentimes in WoW you can’t even tell it’s night unless you notice the starry sky or the moon icon on the mini map. I was down in STV doing some fishing and by tweaking those settings, it really looked and felt like I was night fishing.
---
Wanna play warlock mainly for pvp, but i'm unsure about one thing. How to manage soul shard in bg ? Will i need to farm between bg to refill ?
---
Level 40
---
Different reasons as I will play several classes.
---
1. warrior - duo leveling with a mate who I **may** have convinced he wants to play priest with me. Rolling troll as the animations are ok, language is funny to me and racial is best for tanking later in the game and it's for dps good too if I want to
---
2. warlock - going undead as this whole dead and demon thing just fits best with undead imho and it was my very first char back then
---
3. rogue - orc as racial is too op to pass up and maybe I want to do lvl19 pvp at some point in time so I reserved the name
---
Farm or buy your mats, then tip your leather worker.  Shouldn’t be crazy expensive.
---
Well, of course it will, he's me.
---
Holy fuck somehow this doubled my already maxed out excitement.
---
Resto Shaman is unique in that it is one of the few (only?) healers with consistent AoE healing.
---
Add into that all of the utility it brings, it definitely offers a very unique healing experience.
---
If that appeals to you, go Shaman, otherwise Priest is the safe pick.
---
Do I do this once and it works? Or do I have to do it every time I log?
---
Oh yeah it definitely happens
---
Part of the problem as the parent comment has indicated is that for the addon to work you need both parties using it.
---
I understand the QoL for seller, but what incentive does the buyer have to download the addon? Anything the buyer wants is in the AH already.
---
 **/console ffxglow 0**
---
Yes, it’s similar to how it works in Eve Online (if you ever played that). It’s a good system actually. 
---
Even if you made a lot of money in Wrath, you might find it isn’t enough, as gold has inflated with every expansion. I can’t actually remember the price now but I think it is around 190k gold for a token.
---
You're saying a server that just been announced is already dead?
---
Ouch
---
Seems like a good way to have disciplinary action taken against you... I don't know where you work, but where I work if it's not already blocked your traffic is definitely monitored.
---
Really?  This makes my day if true.  I went through a ton of work to get a controller working on N**Dale and it was still a shitty experience.
---
It’s 96° and feels like 131°, so no.
---
There are literally new speed leveling routs discovered as recent as a year ago. The undisputed best feral build and BiS was theory crafted after vanilla. There are so many things that players are just better at now and with more knowledge. Don't fool yourself.
---
That'd be great. I mean I'd never play it because of the obvious hell it would be, but It'd be great to be there :P

This. Personally I think these servers have a much larger capacity then we might be used to. Not saying they are bigger than retail but it does strike me as odd that the RPPVP server, that was demanded heavily by the community, is still only "Low". I feel like they are planning to keep it to a few servers but have them be larger than your "average" server to prevent them from dying 2 months after launch.
---
That tasty BBQ is for all races. I mean we even have race with a \[cannibalism\] racial.
---
Gotta save those for pet attack and pet return
---
You can easily create a macro that will send your pet to attack your current focused target or a specific named target. That way you can keep your pet passive and manually send it in. 
---
You could also combine it with another ability like auto attack or arcane shot for example.
---
You got sniped bro. 
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Resto kitty does fine, I leveled 58-60 that way after leveling feral, and farmed a lot that way at 60. I wouldn't stack int, kitty doesn't hit hard enough without str/agi and regen is fine in melee dps gear. Also shifting out a lot won't accomplish much other than OOMing you, unless you're planning to take the mana reduction talents in Balance?
---
The neat thing about Druids in Vanilla is that none of the specs are particularly powerful so you can move interchangeably between roles very easily. I've healed as feral, it works fine. HT hits decently well in mediocre gear, you just need a semblance of a mana pool while leveling. The specs are *extremely* gear dependent, because the talents aren't that strong, but that also means a gear swap is sufficient for a role swap. 
---
Finally, remember durid iz 4 friends!
---
Just want to say right away, the stigma that Druids are weak in Classic is false (especially on the 1.12 patch).
---
That said, they do suffer a bit from the 'hybrid tax', in that you can do everything, but wont be the best at anything.

You don’t get to tell others what’s their authentic truth my friend. And maybe one day you’ll find that building others, not sending destructive energy, is the key to wellbeing. I can only point you in that direction. You will have the walk the path of truth yourself because you decided to seek it.
---
You're playing the game in english on the english server, so either you don't know what you're doing the entire game or you understand english.
---
Depends what you buy on the auction house and what you farm personally
---
What gonna be great is the tribalism of these servers when we end up with xrbgs.
---
Thanks for your answer, I'm worried about something else if I do a protection paladin. Apparently it's hard to find gear with stats corresponding to this spec. Do you know anything about that ?
---
What about the people who like druids the way it is tho ?
---
And what about pvp class balance ? Make just one change and all the balance might change.
---
I might.  It wouldn't be too hard and there seems to be enough interest in it from people.  It will end up like Hunter pet abilities, where I can't really know if you've trained it or not so they will always be displayed in their own section.
---
Ah is that Will? Of the Forsaken?

---
what is this 2004?  just download an addon to pick BIS talents spells and keybinds for you
---
Doesnt hurt to throw in some melee attacks if you can, but it really depends on who you're fighting.
---
You obviously dont want to melee a melee class, you should be trying to kite them. Also hitting a plate wearer with a melee attack isn't going to do much damage.
---
but a mage with shields down? hell yeah, you can chunk them
---
Don’t give him challenging questions, it’ll fry his circuits

Only upside of CAT was the graphic improvements... but boy they butchered the Talents... game was never the same
---
The problem for herod will be phase 2 and it's going to be a huge problem. Supposedly they will get rid of layering, so will that server be able to even support 20k+ peaks from a hardware angle? Vanilla isn't able to support that many people all playing the same time zone. Nost had 15k peaks on the weekend, but its na pop was around 7-8k . 
---
Herod will be forced to do server xfers in phase 2 tldr
---
Orc is BIS with stun resist and attack power buff which you can cast in stealth. UD is right there with them tho
---
Hoping 40+.  I'm going hard over labor day weekend.   Then I can help my buddies with aspect of the pack if they aren't 40 yet and able to get mounts.
---
And? Clearly they’ve anticipated demand and have additional servers ready to deploy should they be needed. Early name sign up just gave them a chance to test demand.
---
I never said there weren't amazing players. The average tank in vanilla had trouble generating enough threat to allow the raid to push all out. This would have led to threat mitigation being the most important thing, which is why everyone remembers MD/Ruin as the best warlock spec. Whether this was just because the game was designed for it to be hard or because tanks didnt know the best techniques and it was harder to get informed of them, I don't know. So I don't know whether classic will go back to MD/Ruin, or if the private server specs will end up being better.
---
I will be the first to defend the best vanilla players as amazing players who did some amazing things, but as someone who languished in a tier 1 raiding guild that couldn't progress or recruit very well, the average vanilla player was pretty bad.
---
You‘re gonna be able to easily max out classic, while still having solid performance. It‘s not like in retail, where the new zones are much harder to render.
---
I can't wait for my first group to fail at reading the lore text and ask where they're supposed to finish that quest.
---
Similarly forgetting the Ratchet quest items for the Blueleaf Tubers.
---
Or prematurely starting the Belnistrasz escort in RFD.
---
Ahh memories...
---
Wtf is this?
---
&gt; I pissed in a containet. Someone will empty them later.
---
That'd be pretty cool. As long as you keep your gear though.
---
There's really no reason to ever drop dual gathering.  You can just buy what you need with all your extra cash.  Aside from the cool engineering gizmos, I can't think of anything you could craft that you can't also buy and use.

Well since everybody is different I think they would be at different levels of fine

It's funny how they call Czechs Eastern Europeans

Grobbulus has been "medium" for two days now. The mobbulus continues to grow!
---
Followup question then... Where did they get the "burning crusade code"?
---
yeah but the beta had instant-40's 
---
maybe he's playing a class he hasnt touched in 15 years?
---
Who cares? lmao.
---
There is a private server which has that. It’s a very customized wrath client that has classless classes- you can pick skills/talents from all classes. Pretty cool. I didn’t play on the hardcore loot drop server, sounds like a nightmare tbh.
---
if it was between 1080@144Hz(or 165Hz) I wouls ay 4K but 1440p is the sweetspot of not as noticable detail but much better refresh rate of 4k@60Hz
---
No data on those.
---
It’s like going to a museum version of classic where the historians have rewrote history.
---
Because they changed the algorithm for the pop indicators. Before it probably just showed how many people where online trying to reserve names. Now it supposedly shows actual population. In other words, how many people have reserved names on each server. 
---
lol ok.
---
More like pulled the boss FD and get the healer killed.

If you form the group, you can just not invite other warriors. You can tank dungeons without going deep prot. Usually you form groups in the city. Just say you are tank. If you don't suck, no one will question your build. There is no inspecting talents in classic
---
oh no thanks with how hard it is to obtain good items, I would never turn this on. Maybe at low levels?
---
I'm in the same boat. Most of my alts have some history to them so I feel bad for not playing or at least getting max level with them. Its liberating knowing I can play just my spriest in classic without those thoughts in the back of my mind.
---
this right here, picked female orc over male orc because i cant deal with my character being hunched over 24/7

I know druids are awesome flag carriers but are they also good ' pocket' healers in BGs and wPVP?

Just follow a warrior around and keep him alive.  
---
Or am I better of going for a priest for that?

There’s a huge difference between reading it well enough to understand by context, and talking(typing) it well enough to form coherent sentences.

You obviously don’t speak multiple languages

---
So like Ultima Online or Asheron's Call?  Then you have 20 valuable dresses in your inventory so those drop instead of your worn gear.
---
Paladin tanking is absolute meme status and requires smart players and good gear to be even remotely viable and even then it’s a stretch. Places like stratholme where you can do holy damage are a lot more suited to Paladin tanking, but don’t think for a second you would be preferred over a warrior or Druid. 
---
The raw answer to “can you do it” is technically “yes”. “Should you” is a resounding no unless you and some buds want to goof around.

It's not a realm queue it's a login queue.

&gt; It doesnt hide the very well known fact that Cassic Wow was devoloped to attract a subscription from those that dont want to play retail.

This is LITERALLY the definition of a SUPPLEMENTAL project rather than a competing one.

To put it another way: you don't fire the guy working on the factory floor at the Coca-Cola factory because Diet Coke starts outselling Coca-Cola Classic. You just shift more of the line to be diet Coke. And the guy on the factory floor isn't going to be angry that now he has to help make diet Coke just because he doesn't like to drink it.

---
I thought the ghost thing was neat! 
---
When I was reading about it (after discovering it was valuable) I found out that at one point they had to change the item, because so many people had them and the ghosts constantly spawning everywhere were causing servers to lag.
---
Which one is this? I'm thinking of the place where there are 3 or 4 clickable objects that you have to find; you start by going down a long curving staircase/tunnel, and then there are bridges and stuff, and it's hard to keep track of where you've already been.
---
That’s fucking dope dude but don’t forget your epic helm, both on the bike and one for the ladies.
---
To my knowledge pure dungeon grind (basic mob grind too I think) is a bit faster than questing. 
---
Do what you want, but I really don't recommend it, as at least I personally want to enjoy the leveling experience by doing questing with zone related dungeons in between.
---
You must really hate yourself.
---

---
So going Warlock... I've read around and watched some vids on them and just want to know.. is it really just being a curse bot and SB spam? No dotting due to the 16 debuff limit??  Really not feeling being a mage.
---
The question to ask here about the population is: is it people moving from one server to another, or new people still signing up? 
---
From what I can see, and I'm just some idiot on the internet, the populations are rising across the board in NA. We don't have *any* low pop any more, and whose to say the mediums last much longer as some servers that were rarely talked about are already at high.
---
I'd hope they add a few more, probably what they'd estimate to be enough until launch. I just don't see anyone leaving servers their already on like Herod or Faerlina as most people who jumped to those servers did it for reasons. 
---
After launch though? They will probably throw more at us if the rising population trend continues, and we know there will absolutely be a flow of people joining after launch and the weeks that follow. 
---
The marketing has been quiet, the server are filling up, and only blizzard knows their actual capacity so there's not much you can do but just wait things out and watch for some updates.
---
Lol the fucking hyena growl and the daze dismount! Best part.

Grinding is generally better 20-40 (of course supplemented with quests) because of the travel time without a mount (i.e. running through multiple areas). The opposite is true 40-60 (questing supplemented by grinding).
---
Both are good, just place emphasis depending on level.
---
man if her goal was to take retaliation on the lich king she probably should've supervised this a bit more since they barely aimed in his general direction and instead flung the barrels directly into the living armies, thus achieving the Supreme Revenge of Giving Arthas A Cough
---
Ret, Seal of Command Rank 1, just point and go. They're pretty tanky and honestly you just kinda run mob to mob and kill kill kill move.
---
Will you die? Undoubtably, could the entire zone become a massive war zone? Without question.  Will you struggle through it and make friends through hardship?  Probably.  Will you remember it fondly 15 years later...most of us do.
---
When they opened Stalaag they advised people to switch from Herod to avoid long queues
---
Honestly, I was just surprised as you. Pleasantly surprised, as I'm off work Mondays. Can't wait to sit in the queue on my day off!
---
It mathematically is better. Both high end and low end weapon damage surpass the ww axe which means weapon damage based attacks such as mortal strike hit for more and it's a faster weapon as icing on the cake.
---
Ok thank you for your answer, what about paladin dps/retribution ?
---
Catch me in SM between 30 and 40
---
Yes and no, in retail it‘s much, much easier to render the old world maxed, than it is to render bfa maxed.
---
I can for example push out a lot of frames in Azeroth, Outland and Northrend. Legion and BfA zones on the other hand are more difficult and I have to turn down the settings down for those. Not to mention BfA Azeroth is (everso) slightly harder to render, because it‘s post cata and they did improve upon the world a bit.
---
Classic will propably be a cakewalk.
---
Skin LW is great for Druid as you end up making a lot of your own gear. Skinning often provides free materials from animals others have killed and it goes hand in hand with a Druid being self sufficient. There are also few of them at end game so if you get some patterns you can do well for yourself.
---
You can go the Sandbox route but I think only the beta client is published. Not the launch client.
---
What's your budget?? $$$
---
Woop woop!
---
Completely agree. It's one of the things that immediately turned me off from pservers.
---
The smooth clean graphics, animations and gameplay together with classic mechanics is too good to be true
---
I just got it from twitch.
---
Addons were in classic but they were nowhere near as sophisticated as they are now. In 2004 we were tabbing out to thottbot, not using some in-game quest helper that puts a big arrow pointing to your quest objective. Ever use Whispercast? I'm sure that type of addon won't be needed anymore.
---

1-5 with shift and ctrl modifiers is enough for most on-demand abilities. Then add Q E R T F G Z X C V plus their shift/ctrl modifiers and you've got tons of options.

In Classic yes.

But what about TBC?   I thought Undead was BIS with WoTF and they dont have the healing debuff?

I don't think that word means what you think it means.
---
its at about 140k rn.
---
&gt;What about the people who like druids the way it is tho ?
---
I'm curious as to if the people complaining about classic class balance integrity are druid players. Because what would be the worst thing to come from them being buffed?
---
IDK, the whole thing just erks me in a way I can't describe but here I go... I really love Ele shaman, I didn't get into ele shaman until wotlk, but I've played it on retail since wotlk all the way through until BFA. Every time Ele got a buff, as an Ele sham main I was super happy and excited to play the class even more.
---
It made the game more engaging to have a class that could be improved on and became more enjoyable as time moved on. Sure each iteration had its flaws, but each one was enjoyable because of the change.
---
If class balance doesn't happen on classic I honestly can't see many players sticking around too long, because these games need to have some sort of change.
---
I seriously wonder if the people who complain about the integrity of classic have the overall state of health this game will be in after a couple of months, because if people are being denied entry into groups and guilds because of a class they dedicated 2-3 months to leveling... they'll just leave.
---
I doubt there will be 20k by phase 2.

Candy Crush netted them $800 million in Q2 if I am remembering the transcript correctly.

There's a very long and involved elite quest chain that starts in Blasted Lands and culminates in a fight against a demon lord after roughly 15 quests in the chain.

The Ancient Egg line -- the first step is killing some wind serpents in Feralas and the last step is collecting tablets from LBRS. It sends you through several different dungeons and also heralds the ZG raid.

I really haven't enjoyed questing since BC. The only zone that I actually remember thinking they did a super good job for leveling was Shadowmoon Valley in WoD (of all expansions, I know). I kinda hate the newer streamlined cataclysm zones especially. It didn't feel like an RPG anymore.
---
Corpsemaker is a really respectable and somewhat easy to get axe, too.

Whatever do you mean, Champion? I love being Champion! On retail. Yep a Champion! One of the millions...

Or just do like me and get your husband to play WoW Classic with you!  I had conceded going Alliance for him (classic only) since he played vanilla alliance and I didn't start until BC, but today I've won him over to Horde for Classic because I reconnected with some old friends who will be playing.
---
Well I wanted to roll a Tauren Druid but my fuckhead friends want to play alliance, so I’m rolling alliance again :/

That's a WoW Classic period specific word. Back when people used to keep all their songs as mp3s on their computer, there was some stupid software that was supposed to, according to Biz Markie, "auto-magically" identify and tag the mp3 files correctly.

Questie works without issue?
---
It’s one of the first unprotected zones.  And you can get their early in a servers life as a lvl 20 Horde, when nobody expects you. Plus, tons of places to gank with a lot of cover. 
---
We used to love taking a hunter and have them train a beast and rename it to whatever the NPC tag was so that newbs would attack it. Not necessary for ganking, but it was just fun. 
---
Also, there used to be an elite that roamed the road that was hostile to Alliance, but he was friendly to Horde...so if we got revenge ganked we would just drag them to him.

CC wise, druid isn't that great (mainly root against melee that is good). You mainly avoid damage by kiting or tank it in bear form and heal yourself while your enemy is slowly dying.
---
I remember that super sad Duskwood quest chain :(
---
Will be playing Horde this time to avoid it
---
As a mage I’m going to have to force myself to also hit things with my staff. I also need to let Myself get hit a few times to level my defense skill so that everything isn’t a crushing blow at level 60. Good times.

I like the rep bonus

The sword/mace skill is nice

I think they look cooler
---
The Dwarf racial stoneform is amazing, but it loses some luster when playing a Paladin, as bubble removed everything anyways
---
Generally speaking the spirit bonus isn't that good for Paladins, but since I will frequently be playing with a Druid friend, it'll make Innervate a bit better.

You know it lol
---
Your concerns are the reason why I switched from Herod to Stalagg! There's no way I am willing to deal with a large queue and neither are my casual friends who are all experiencing Classic for the first time. My server anxiety is that Stalagg will be dead but I'm definitely overthinking it.
---
My only problem with free server transfers is that I missed out on a large part of building relationships and a reputation in the server's community. If I'm creating a character before or on launch, I want it to be on a server I'm staying on for the entire duration of Classic and beyond
---
They are missing spell hit until later phases so will lag for a few phases in boss dps as a result.
---
31-5-15 is what I used back in the day and it was awesome :D

Layering dude. Don't worry about it. Every server will be full on launch

This discussion is pretty good and touches on some of the off the wall itemization in Vanilla. The 2 main points in favor of the wonky itemization was:
---
1) The weird itemization is there to give players a broad canvas on which to play and experiment with what works and what doesn’t. He makes a point that I’m inclined to accept that part of the magic of experimentation is the moment when things click and a person figures out for themselves some combination or some item that really has an impact on their results. If they itemized like we have it now, there’s not as much exploration. You just mindlessly equip the higher item level piece and move on. Yes, Azerite actually throws a wrench in that, but the complaints you hear now are wanting to go back to straight up ilvl determining best item and Ion speaking to that effect in the past. If the items weren’t in existence to allow such experimentation, then there would be no way to do the experimenting. And that leads to satisfaction in figuring something out which he argues is important from a design perspective to make sure players can experience that.
---
2) He also mentions that there’s truth to the notion that there needs to be some bad gear in the game to show you what good gear is. If all gear is good and suited specifically for what you need to do and the next item is just a little bit better at that, it makes getting “good” gear feel less satisfying. In this way “bad” gear helps to define “good” gear by creating a contrast and setting the lower part of the range on the gear quality gradient.

I still think Vanilla’s itemization was superior despite its many flaws and gaping holes for certain specs. But for sure, I couldn’t name you a piece of armor I’m wearing right now in BFA, but for sure I know the names of items from Vanilla that played a huge role in my playing and still capture my desire. They had personality and that’s a quality of magic that you can’t just spreadsheet into existence. They aren’t math problems. They are more than this.
---
He has his fair share of faults and definitely made mistakes, but what I get out of his discussions are a philosophy in game design that isn’t as prevalent anymore and that’s a shame, because it’s this philosophy that led to the explosion in success of WoW and it’s the abandoning of it that has led to the sharp decline.
---
Brazilians it is!
---
I work 80 hrs a week, but mostly game the rest of my time off... Will getting pvp epics be possible as a shadow priest? I know it's going to be tough getting that one raid spot and I don't really want to heal.
---
Otherwise, I'll just roll rogue which I mained in vanilla.
---
Check amazon for gaming laptops.
---
Mid range graphics very possible with your budget. 
---
I would go with a laptop for flexibility.
---
Yeah this is something I noticed too. So much for the fabled dark nights of vanilla :(
---
I'll be on Ateish. If you won't be on there, then let me know if you can put me in contact with somebody.
---
itt: people not knowing know about Fire Emblem
---
I like that idea. What if there was a way to synchronize with other shopkeepers in the same zone as you, so that someone could message one of them, and if that person didn't have the item, then it would say "I don't have Linen Cloth, but 'Rognar the Destroyer' does, and they're in ThunderBluff as well." Maybe sellers could configure their own messages, so that they could direct customers to their shops?
---
For example. Shopkeeper A is selling cheese, shopkeeper B is selling cloth. Shopkeeper B sets up their "redirect message" to read "I don't have [item], but check out Shopkeeper B's shop. He's standing next to the bank." Then, if someone messages Shopkeeper A (or C or D or E or F) asking for cloth, then it would show the message that shopkeeper B wrote.

Medium Rare
---
This is CLASSIC man, forget everything you knew about TBC! 
---
But on a real note, I’m not sure how the two changes in TBC
---
There's more to do now on a daily basis but word I hear is people don't like it too much as it feels like filler content. The world is a lot bigger with all the expansions but much of it is done solo. Even the group content and dungeons and raids are largely void of any coordination or discussion. Like waiting in line at a fast food counter. I'm sure the graphics and environments and enemies are stunning in appearance and the stories are epic which is why I compared it to amusement park ride.
---
All this is what I gather from twitch streams, YT videos, and people's opinions on social media. I quit just as the raid finder dropped in tier 2 cataclysm. TBC and wrath were great but the seeds for ruining group content were planted in wrath with welfare epics, dungeon finder, and no trash raids. I missed vanilla the first time.
---
LF: Mom &amp; Dad (faerlina server).
---
A warrior with a healer would beat any class solo...
---
I would go for the recommended specs of BFA (retail). You won't need it, but why buy a computer specced to play just one game?
---
I'd watch out for Macs, because that tends to limit what games you have access to. Plus they're more expensive than similarly 'geared' PCs (as defined as running either Linux or Windows). Plus they've cheaped out on the parts from my understanding; basically they 'went corporate', and no longer put priority on release a superior product as they had under Jobs's leadership.
---
As for PC types, you might want to go for the 'shoebox PCs' (literally the size of one). I believe the official designation is ITX form-factor. That is if you're looking to keep a small footprint like you get with laptops. - Obviously portability is out the window unless you want to lug around a monitor. :P
---
Maybe this is good advice.
---
My feeling is that wow classic is not a new thing and we all know how it goes. Not being new will actually make this less critical to play hardcore. This game does not force anyone to play daily, or pay to win. In fact it even gives value by not playing (rested experience).
---
I for one took a couple of days off of work for it. So did my wife. We're going to go wild for a couple of days and get sick of it. Then we'll play from time to time, just like all other games. The need to have raid gear asap just isn't there. I've done that already. Getting a purple just wont have the same excitement.
---
The same people who will let classic wow destroy themselves will allow nearly anything addictive to destroy themselves. Drugs, gambling, porn, hamburgers. They will find another way.
---
You can't distract a target in combat.

Good to know :)

I’m curious how the community on Herod will be.  It will be awesome or super toxic.
---
I have no clue dude! 190k gold sounds like a bit of work though. Is there lots of antique stuff like Haunted Memento that sells for much more than it's worth?
---
I looked up xhenophobic.. Seems normal human behaviour to be wary of strangers?
---
I saw that somewhere, could you go into more detail about what choices are made in the 31-5-15?
---
Can anyone tell me who APES are and why people want to avoid them?
---
Same. For me, it's the journey, the experience, the repeated gankings in STV.
---
That’s what got me so frustrated by a bunch of these retail wow podcasters. They thought private server people were just too broke/angry to pay blizzard $15 a month and that’s why we preferred classic instead of BFA. $15 is joke money, they couldn’t be more wrong : /
---
No. Blizzard already said at Chinajoy that the cap would be at least 10k.
---
If*
---
My point was not that it's equivalent to real world harassment and I never made that point. The point I made was that when your definition of fun is ruining someone else's fun, you would consider it an asshole thing, no matter what the context is (unless it's one where the objective is doing so). The point of my comparison was never to take harassment as a concept and say it is the same in the real world as in a video game (eventhough the same principle of delibirately ruining someone else's fun still applies just as much, whether that fun is a day at the beach or a video game someone is very invested in).
---
And I never said throwing sand on a person. I said throwing sand on an object someone's fun relies on. This is a very big difference.
---
Being within ToS does not mean you are not a dick. That is a ridiculous argument. It's the same as saying in the real world you can't be a dick while not breaking the law.
---
Honestly at this point just say "Yeah, I am a dick for doing this but I accept that". If you are gonna be an asshole at least be a man about it instead of trying to mpve the parameters of dick just so the things you want to do don't fit in it.
---
I do care about the graphics, but as long as it doesn't look like shit I'm happy.
---
I do have a work laptop but this one I could use for independent projects etc., but it's not my primary concern.

---
Fat, hairy in all the wrong places, and can drink their own body weight in beer every couple weeks.  
---
Ive actually gotten much more into the Dwarven culture in games/movies over the last 5 or so years, so when i went back to playing alliance on Retail 4?ish years ago i went Dwarf and never looked back.
---
My first toons on WoW when i started in Wrath were Gnomes, too....so IF has always been my home anyways.
---
Yes, very satisfied.
---
Because now I know your guild will be dead the moment they give you the first binding.
---
Unless you are actually raiding with 39 friends, all of whom like you enough to gimp their own game for no better reason than to stroke your ego, the 30ish people in your raid who are not friend&amp;family will abandon ship the moment you get it.
---
Afterwards, you will have no raid, and you and your brothers/cousins will have a trashed reputation as people who put personal greed before the good of the raid, meaning no rebuilding, and no joining another raid. So for the remainder of Vanilla, what you will have is not TF, but a worthless binding in your bank, that you can look at while pugging ZG.
---
great use of LOTR !
---
[you're welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjkT5Z8JP8)
---
I can give you the alternate perspective. I played PvP and will be rolling PvE this time. I do not have the time to invest into the game to fight in a PvP server so I'm going full carebear.
---
u/ChokingVictim is right that it's far more immersive. Open-world battles happen, and you will see some amazing stuff. One of the most memorable things for me was when our nemesis alliance guild tried to stop us in Silithus from getting Thunderfury. 40 vs 40 at least battle. Then to counter we corpse camped their healers in BRM on raid nights, with the Thunderfury lol. Man did we ever hate each other.
---
But be aware that it becomes a time and numbers game. Those who invest more time and have more numbers are going to win. If you're on the short end of this, you're going to get run over hard every time. Ganking happens, camping happens far more than you will want, and wPvP is not fair. You really do need to be in a guild that you have a good relationship with, and invest the time to gear your character, and actually fight back and make zones safe. Simply being on the wrong side of faction balance can make it that much more frustrating.
---
I did a test run on a pserver and found that my sessions were mostly 1-2 hours throughout the week, and I would get incredibly frustrated logging in and getting corpse camped by a skulled enemy player 1 shotting me. Sometimes I would be camped the entire 1-2 hour play session. Sometimes I'd fly to another zone and get ganked their.
---
I just admit to myself I don't have the time or patience to put up with the bullshit of a PvP server anymore.
---
Also, roll a rogue if you're going PvP server.
---
Beta was capped at 40, then 45. No one did these.
---
STL resident about to finish last semester in Rolla. Alliance side on Herod. Hope to see you all out there soon.
---
I mean if it’s just classic wow you can run it on a potato at this point. But honestly prob like 600-800 is the price point if you won’t be doing much else. Check out  pcpartpicker.com they have good builds a different price points and will link you where to get the parts cheapest

I hopped in literally within a second of the server opening and my name was taken :/ same story for Herod and faerlina. If anyone out there has the name Smooth on faerlina let me know

Maybe you could find a way to mark on their unit frame when you select a shopkeeper? That way it's a little easier to tell when someone is acting as a shop

Must be tough when a new film comes out that both you and your wife are really excited about and have been waiting years to see.  Do you bootleg it so you have it forever or just wait until its available on blu-ray?
---
I like this answer :)
---
You don't even have to stop streaming! Just put on a 3 minute delay!
---
Don't worry, the individuals who start at launch isn't going to pick the only two pvp realms with hour long queues.
---
Yes, allow 2 hours maybe plus travelling time for UBRS and DM
---
Only thing we know for sure is that there will not be duplicate world bosses. They were very specific about that. I don't like either of the two most likely scenarios, which are extended layering or megaservers. But expect the worst, hope for the best, right? :p
---
He just didn’t feel like setting up keybinds for a templates character that’s going to last 4 days?
---
1. You can do that with sharding. They wouldn't need to invent an entirely new system that layers *the entire world* just to alleviate starting zone pressure. They'd just shard the first few areas. There'd be zero need for layering at all, just zone shards and dynamic spawns. Done. 
---
2. Man, you can't criticise for "looking through a lens" while just straight making up numbers. There's nothing at all to indicate that 20% of all the retail players that try Classic will stay. I doubt it's going to anywhere *near* that high.  
---
And it's not about the game flopping. The game will be successful. The difference is that a ton of people will *try* it and then bounce off - that's not a flop, it's just a hype and then the "actual" playerbase being left over soon after.
---
3. Ehh, you can use your own example of Nost here to say otherwise. 13k concurrent players on a *weekday.* That's not at launch either. Sure, a lot of people will stop playing as much but a *lot* will still be on every single day.
---
I think this conversation isn't really going anywhere, we're both making vaguely related points. I just don't understand how you've not picked up on the idea that the Classic team is relying on player drop-off. It's literally what layering is relying on for it to be successful, I think you've deeply misunderstood what layering even is honestly, but let's leave it there, we'll get nowhere.
---
My prediction for the really hardcore ones, 2 weeks.  
---
Everyone talking week 1.....I dont think, when you need at a minimum of 5 days played to get to 60, week one not going to happen.  A handful will do it week 2.  Most folks looking at 3+ months.
---
What is the "retail" you speak of? 🤔
---
I'm very aware of this of course.  Your tanking weapon contributes a great deal of armor in Dire Bear Form though.  MCP can be used for threat generation I suppose, but honestly the guild would be better off just using a warrior MT instead.
---
Don't buy a Mac.
---
I remember this. Idea from stupidvideos.com
---
My first character I tried leveling was a holy priest. I healed myself and fought everything with a mace. 
---
Sidebar. I had a dope ass purple mace with the face of a skull for its head so if anyone knows what I'm talking about let ya boy know
---
No I mean for ping/latency
---
Noted! I have a couple ideas for macros now that I've properly learned a bit about them.  Ill probably have one for my pet to attack my target, both on autoattack and for whatever is my most comment starter ability of my rotation, and then ill try to keybind anything else relevant.
---
The best part about vanilla leveling as opposed to heirloom leveling and retail quest leveling is that the gear you get from dungeons sticks. I leveled my first character decently slow (rogue) due to making alts and getting them to 20-40. But what I enjoyed the most was messing around in battlegrounds on my way leveling on my rogue. I made sure that I was dungeoning and grabbing good gear. When I dinged 60 I was ready to raid without intentionally gearing to raid. I was lucky enough to grab dal rends before entering mc but I spent an odd amount of time dungeoning. My friends who were hardcore 2am on a school night raiding and pushing server firsts thought I would never hit 60.
---
It has 3 things...I remember that picture that needs 3 things...throw some text on it! WOO I made a funny!
---
You could in vanilla before patch 1.4 but the classic is using 1.14. 1 which is all the improvements by patch 14 with the. 1 being changes for classic.
---
So all our class balancing is done as if we were RIGHT BEFORE like the night before burning crusade expansion comes out.
---
They become more rare as a server ages. Mostly by the time the core server has their pre-bis. 
---
That’s when tanks get to charge for runs.

---
As noted in my other comment, champing is a different mouth motion, whereas chomping is definitely biting down on something (I don't 'champ' on pizza or chicken nuggets). The idiom hasn't changed as much as people have no idea what 'champing' means and thus have substituted a similar word that still sounds like it makes sense.
---
It's like how 'peaked my interest' is similarly understood, but 'pique' is correct. 'Whet one's appetite' is correct, but many people say 'wet' because they think of salivating. Deep-seated/seeded, wreak/wreck havoc, I could go on.
---
The only major benefit of retadins in raids is their buffs, the DPS is very lackluster. They'll be there more for utility and whatnot rather than pumping out meter-topping numbers.
---
I do, dutch, english and german. If every european nation speaks their own language on the english EU server there will never be a community but all seperate groups.
---
The NA client has Korean in the options.
---
You expect the server to be adequately populated weeks before launch?
---
You think that's bad? There will be servers popping out on launch day without any notice.
---
I just hope people from full PvP realms won't get on RPPvP, just because there's no queue.
---
I'm having the same problem... My friend is starting a guild on thalnos horde but he's known for quitting stuff pretty fast... I'm not really into pvp and also wanted to play alliance
---
Sir, this is a Wendy’s

Nostalgia is hitting everyone hard. WoW’s current state is nothing like it was 15 years ago. People miss the RPG elements of the game that were removed.

Yes. Normal to me. Or you bend over for strangers with pants down?

Yikes, 40.feels like 80 though
---
Updated ones?
---
Classic wow is the best game ever made
---
Wow changed throughout each expansion. IMO after wrath of the lich king the game sucked.
---
People have been playing private servers and loved it. Now we have real blizzard servers trying to recreate the game and make it extremely accurate to how the game actually was. 
---
It’s gonna be fun. Definitely download it and play
---
These level of events happen all the time on RP servers in modern wow. Look up Tournament of Ages.
---
Activision is motivated by money, no more than the owners of private servers.
---
Totally fair.
---
Yeah Ive generally enjoyed it more when I dont over do it
---
It's internally rendering at 2x 1080p (= UHD-resolution, i.e. 4x the number pixels) and then downsampling it back to 1080p. It's essentially 4x SuperSampling AA, giving you an extremely clean image without any jaggies and flickering textures.
---
He acts like my grandpa who is pissed he has to live in a nursing home.
---
This statement is true, I will add one thing to this, you're not the greatest pocket healer for a tank like a warrior, you're better off with a stealth cap squad in AB with a rogue (or a few) for the element of surprise can be lethal. You won't have the tools a priest or paladin has, but you can work better with a rogue.

To my knowledge, it’s mark kern (grumz) and Kevin Jordan. Kevin Jordan streams much more frequently.

---
The people in the first two waves and the people that struggle in DM are two separate groups of people. Almost everyone in those waves will be in a guild making up a part of that wave making grouping easy.
---
Billions of people have lived and died on the planet Earth but only the lucky few billion of us have been alive to witness the launch of vanilla wow twice.
---
Good stuff dude!
---
did they even allow server transfer in classic?
---
I’ll be doing this as well, I don’t understand why a lot of people are planning on having 50+ addons for leveling to make everything as easy as possible. Seems like it would shit on the whole point of classic but different strokes for different folks I suppose.
---
Man the days have been dragging!! I cannot wait until classic launches...the days are moving so slow. 
---
I haven’t been this excited for a launch in so long I don’t remember this much excitement ever! I even plan to try and play retail slowly levelling up my warrior but my heart is with classic.
---
I never truly played classic I came in mid TBC and full WOTLK but Im excited for the community to be back and a bit of a challenge! I mean I will add some of the add ons for features I like in retail! But Im ready, my wife has laughed at me because  Ive told her Im no lifing launch!
---
Oh for sure, what matters most is what you enjoy doing. I was talking about time gated things like mooncloth though not gathering. They make money over time for basically zero effort. Drops off longterm, but it takes a while before everyone's sated on those types. Pretty sure there's a metal one as well.
---
Every expansion someone has you collecting bear shit or something, I don’t know why people act like you get treated like some kind of god all the time.
---
Me too. The issue is I can't fucking decide what class to play haha every time I think I know, another one gets thrown into the mix
---
I don't know much about WoW addons, but wouldn't it be possible for  the addons to communicate on some custom channel name with others on the server and list everyone who has something. i.e. you open a query window and search "Linen Cloth", the addon communicates on the chat channel to everyone running the addon that's also monitoring it and says anyone have "Linen Cloth"? and others can reply in the channel automatically. I have this many for this price, and the addon could direct the buying player to the correct person that actually has it in stock?
---
This is way out of scope of the authors original intent I'm sure, but if I was designing it, I'd want something like poe.xyz.is (poe.trade) rather than a npc shop.
---
&gt; People were really bad 15 years ago
---
People keep saying this. Over and over. Again and again.
---
I mean, OP said he cleared half of naxx. The (very very large) majority of the players back then didn't do this. If you put some shit in to context and think for 10 seconds, suddenly the "players were bad back then" isn't nearly as reasonable to say everywhere, everytime.
---
It might be relevant sometimes. This thread is discussing something entirely different and I can't quite see how players being bad or not is relevant in any way here.
---
TLDR: Players were bad? So what?
---
I don't even know... I was just reading their github page's feature list and saw that.
---
I'm guessing its a custom quest tracker that overrides the default tracker's maximum 3 quests at the same time?
---
&gt; My only worry is about groups being hard to find as a Rogue.
---
Good rogues = always find groups.
---
If you REALLY want to make people scream in the open world - Druid. (But you won't be shattering meters as a healer, but you'll still have a good impact)
---
thats not a thing.
---
Bnet launcher has an ad up about classic name reservations fyi
---
Vitamin D - Check,  Socialize with neighbors - Check,    Fertilize Lawn -- Check, Fresh Air - Check
---
The "excuse" is that many many people don't want the updated models available at all, that's how much we hate them.
---
LOL.  Take my upvote.
---
I've literally never seen anyone with the mentality of "plebs who don't use discord", the only time where people get in tizzy about other not using discord is if they list it as a requirement to join a pug raid or a pug high key M+. In those cases, the requirement to join discord makes sense because of the need to communicate effectively to the group/raid for this content.
---
It seems like a lot of the pserver elitism comes from the fact that people who are in pservers believe that vanilla is the only true version of WoW, and that retail players are scrubs. Should't be an issue since their dreams are coming true with Classic coming out.
---
To be fair, that's true of every class except healers. Never required, always useful if you're willing to give up the cash/slot for it.
---
My guild members don’t want to jump :( lf new guild
---
This. 100% this.
---
What does that have to do with phase 2?
---
&gt; Your tanking weapon contributes a great deal of armor in Dire Bear Form though. 
---
No it doesn't.  [Dire Bear Form](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=9634/dire-bear-form) = Shapeshift into a dire bear, increasing melee attack power by 180, armor contribution from items by 360%, and health by 1240.  Also protects the caster from Polymorph effects and allows the use of various bear abilities.
---
Only a weapon that has armor in it is going to contribute to your armor.  Even if it does, I already said it's just a stat stick, meaning you don't get procs or anything.
---
There will be plenty of new players, you'll pick it up in no time. PvP on a basic level is quite simple. Classic is not about end game, the levelling experience is fantastic and you'll experience some unforgettable moments. The game is about community and being an adventurer in a big world.
---
End game is great in a different way, just don't try and burn it to 60. If you wanted to give yourself the best options possible you could play a Priest or Paladin. 
---
Alliance imo has more of a wow factor for new players just because the initial zones and cities are so good.
---
Good luck and enjoy, jealous you'll be getting to experience it for the first time!
---
i played the beta for lineage 2 (used unreal 2004 engine) and the demo for everquest 2 (used some other engine). both were much more technically capable than WoW.
---
Just make sure your coc is in range and hits before the fb!
---
I’m not rushing that’s for sure, gearing is gonna be real tough until phase 2 when they release DM.
---
Jawdropping
---
I guess I didn't realize that there was a technical difference between camping and chomping.
---
But "peaked my interest" is just flat out wrong /r/boneappletea material.
---
Currently have a rather large group playing - only issue is that everyone is DPS. I would love to go DPS but am also fine with tanking/healing. Trying to decide between Tauren/Orc Warrior or Undead/Troll Priest.
---
My experience from retail WoW tells me tanking is severely hindered in terms of PvP, which is what I will be doing mostly. I was a Druid so I could easily switch to be a B-tier DPS or healer. Now I won't be able to as easily. But healers can participate in all aspects of the game as one spec. Thoughts?
---
Drain soul as somone is about to die, getting pounded on by a warrior = easy shards.
---
There were a few times I would farm in between (and typically I was able to do so between queues), when I was destruction and using soulburn and soulfire a decent amount.
---
Alright, we gonna have to agree to disagree.  Good luck in your struggles.
---
Simple. he doesn't need it
---
Wait is it really medium pop! Let's go
---
Got it.  Thanks again for all your help.
---
I think for most groups it will be similar to how it was back in the day except without as many lag issues. You may have seen people saying how easy dungeon grinding is on the beta but that was partially because players were at the beta level cap for so long they had time to basically "twink" their characters. They were in way better gear than someone just leveling up and doing dungeons as they go.
---
You don’t need to be full Bis to start raiding, like 30-50%, so guilds will start MC  right when they hit 60 and start getting Mc gear.
---
/guild hey, anyone else want to do the sm prequest in desolace?
---
Finding a partner or two to get the quest done is really that easy.
---
Congrats on dodging the Spanish plague!
---
I don’t think the mods are alone in disliking useless posts like this.
---
Hopefully i snuff out a few of those smelly tauren lives in 12 days.
---
In raids...yes. Personally this never really bothered me as a raiding warlock and it was a small price to pay for how much fun the class was out in the world. But if you're looking to play a dps that is mechanically interesting in raid content, warlock is probably the single worst choice.
---
You will probably be beginning or early revered with about 18,000 to go before exalted. Best way to catch up is turn in cloth or find quest hubs that give reputation

Rerolling druid for OP staff action.
---
HoW Do TiMeZoNeS WoRk?!?!?
---
Yeah, I’m having trouble deciding too! I have narrowed it down to a mage, warlock, or priest. I’ve played and enjoyed them all in the past. But it’s so hard picking just one! I still think it’s worth it though to just stick to one (at least for myself personally). :) Depth rather than breadth!
---
The answer is yes, you will be totally fine
---
Gotcha, so your add-on utilizes the default tracker then?
---
&gt;50+
---
Stock up on extra poop socks.
---
Yeah, I think that was Blizzard's philosophy prior to TBC -- a class that had multiple viable roles would suffer a 5% penalty to each of them.  So Pallies weren't really the best at any of their specs, and weren't viable tanks, and only OK healers, druids were again only OK healers, damage dealers, etc., etc.  
---
I think in TBC they sort of reversed that with their "bring the class you want to play" or whatever.  They might have gone a little overboard with druids.  I remember druids in TBC being awesome -- lifebloom x 3 + MP5 stacking meant you could heal a main tank with a dot refresh once every 6 seconds, while still being able to top off others, plus you had the swiftmend and nature's swiftness oh shit buttons.  Lifebloom stack refresh was so good that it was nerfed in Wrath of the Lich King.  As tanks they were great too -- mostly, from what I remember, due to the armor and hp multipliers meaning you could do things like get trinkets and rings with armor and have that multiply.  I just thought prior to TBC, they were kind of meh, with warriors being "the" tank and priests being "the" healer.  But I don't really know -- I never played endgame content in Classic.  I do really like druids, not just for endgame, they have so much versatility, including while leveling.  I just think.. I wanna try something else out for classic.
---
Definitely Winterspring. There was something magical about the atmosphere of that zone, something very comfy and calming. Also it's an endgame zone so it's different from Durotar or Elwynn Forest we have now seen again a few times during beta and stress tests.
---
1 goulash please.
---
Druid are equally useful when not tanking if not more. Can dps, heal, decurse, innervate and battle rez.
---
Having a bear instead of another warrior make all your tank gear faster because the bear don't need plate shield or weapon.
---
On specific fight (or if you need more threat), druid is better main tank than a warrior.
---
It depends on the class and spec, as well as phase.
---
Hybrids are typically the ones who wear blues, since raid gear wasn't designed for their offspecs. Sometimes the item effects are just too good to pass up, such as Wolfhead's Helm and MCP for feral cats (both low level blues being BiS from phase 1 till the end of the game).
---
Most casters will wear blues or even greens in phases 1-2. Since spellpower values are low on MC gear, but a green *of shadow wrath* will have a ton.
---
But some classes will go for *mostly* full epics in phases 1-2. Hunters, Rogues, and tank Warriors will have full epics minus a trinket or two.
---
And when BWL comes out in phases 3 then almost every class will be going for full epics.
---
For you.  Cause you don’t like a challenge maybe..  it’s not like you would even have to play those servers.  It’s easy to make a hardcore server for a select group of people that obviously would not include you.
---
Just freeze yourself until WoW 5 comes out where every single action, ability, item drop, dungeon clear, PvP setting, is won by a single click of a button when you log in then it logs you out and says "you win!"
---
“What’s this do?” *clicks on the kegs in the Grim Guzzler/candles in BFD*
---
“Huh, it doesn’t do anything.” *clickclickclick*
---
Yeah hopefully they are a minimal impact on the server
---
Swampletics
---
In raids? For damage, yeah, pretty much. But you bring a lot of utility to a raid by being a Warlock.
---
For soloing and leveling, you'd be among the best in the game, even able to solo farm dungeons like Maraudon later at level 60.
---
In PvP, it really is down to your playstyle preference, but Warlocks are among the best and are nigh unbeatable in 1v1 scenarios.
---
RIP! Discord is a good place to evaluate your options and get to know some of the other folks in the community. Maybe your guild mates would be willing to jump in there and at least get a feel for it.
---
[Here's a build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/303050213525100001-05-502501002) I made quickly.  Its very flexible, and there are a bunch of different variations to the build you can do depending on many factors.  Main things to keep are Anger Management, Imp Overpower, Impale, Sweeping Strikes, Mortal Strike, and Last Stand. 
---
Skarm Tank on YT has some great video's explaining warrior tanking in vanilla if you're looking for something to binge on while waiting for launch.
---
Yes druids can tank pretty well in 5-mans, and quite a few bosses in vanilla. With high armor and health pool works great for a number of bosses that hit like a train.
---
So absolutely, you'll be able to tank no problem for your friends, or even groups outside of your friends.
---
As for raids, primarily a healer, possibility of tank sometimes.
---
And as for popularity of druid.... less than 8% of the total population play druid.... you'll be fine.
---
It's a long story but I think it culminates to something along the lines of her not being considered a proper heir due to her gender. Then she really hit it off with Thaurissan, they shared political views on unifying the dwarven clans and fell in love.
---
No mind control or anything.
---
People want classic+ but what they will get is Classic VR !!!  hahaha
---
it will be an overflow of joy and stories of dungeon wipes and random world drops and pvp glory. it's gonna be good to not have to circle around the same 5 topics over and over.
---
A strong private server guild that dominated a recent server so hard people blame them for the massive faction imbalance. The biggest problem with them is that many big guilds are afraid and will either roll another server or roll the same faction(alliance) on whatever server they end up choosing. So there's a big chance server balance will be affected by them.
---
ZG was not considered a valid raid with DKP, teamspeaker and other sorts of serious stuffs. Back in the day ZG was reserved for alts to gear up or GDKP to earn some cash (GDKP means auctioning off the loots to wealthy strangers outside the guild who were invited to spend money. At the end of the raid MT got a bonus and the rest of the money divved up to everyone).
---
OMG I forgot about mind control kills.  All the sudden warlock may not be a lock for release
---
Nope. It's DM east or DM west if you want to be specific. Just DM is you mean dire maul in general. Deadmines is vc.
---
As it gets closer to launch more people will begin to sub in anticipation for launch, and they will mostly gravitate to lowpop servers. All servers will be full. Who knows how long that will last though .. check to see if any guilds are planning to set up on your server that should be an indicator for long term
---
Is nobody playing the free retail content? I think it goes through the end of Legion.
---
Honestly I wish they'd go back to that in the next expansion of retail, I think they've gone too far though
---
Not 100% sure, but I think it was the  **Fiery War Axe.**
---
Because people had a week of prep time before that to choose those servers. 
---
Every server (currently available) is going to fill. Probably ones that haven't come out yet too. I'd just be wary of ones that come out after launch.
---
&gt; everyone
---
Obviously not.
---
On a side note for someone new to vanilla, how much time did the lvl 60 dungeons and the first raids take? Would a raid split MC on two evenings when starting out? Is going ubrs/lbrs a serious time commitmrnt like taking on a raid night in retail or just a slightly longer dungeon?
---
And they murdered the queen
---
Wait...
---
That's Illegal
---
It will be but I doubt it’ll makeup a majority of the population. I’m betting a lot of classic wow players aren’t terrible people just a vocal bunch.
---
Got to earn that rested XP from the get go.
---
That was the very first thing I did. It's bad.
---
Its evolving. 😳
---
Really Great!
---
At least with MC its more of "Send the Expendable Adventurers in" for Alliance Ony is a grudge match.  
---
I did miss a bit of the story lines once Cata dropped but when did the Hero adventurers get given actual command of Faction Forces, was it before WoD or were we just randomly promoted for that xpac?
---
Yes, this version is working.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24944-WeakAuras2Classic.html
---
reddit didn't exist in vanilla
---
Literally never heard it not be called vc again after dm came out so...
---
faction collusion had very little to do with it. Sure they got devilsaurs and even elemental fire under control but it wasn't just them and it's nothing new to do.
---
The biggest thing was just premade pvp. Apes would win every single game even against the best premades which drove away a lot of premades from queuing, which in return meant shitty alliance premades formed so any hordes making premade would have to be able to beat the shitty ally premades fast in order to get decent honor, this meant there was only 1 horde premade for 3 months(and after that the server went full AV retard mode).
---
yo that dude is nakey tho
---
Prepare myself to do STV without being ganked endlessly because I can finally play on a PvE server.
---
Yes.  You will have to go back for your level 10 quests though.  Or you can all meet up somewhere at level 10 after you do your level 10 class quests.
---
What's a chad role or class then?
---
Yeah, it can be hard knowing if you’re making the “right” choice! I actually decided to download an old Vanilla client and play each of them on a private server. That way, I can test them out and see how they played in Classic, so I can more accurately make a decision. :)
---
I had the same thing happen, our guild would have rerolled to a lower pop server but only about half of us were aware in time before it happened. 
---
By the time everyone got home from work and word spread, no one wanted to chance switching over and losing their names
---
If we had a day to talk about it I can assure you about 50 of us in our guild would have switched from herod to the new server
---
you all get upvotes lol.  i appreciate you response lmao
---
Naming a server “Thaddeus” would instantly solidify it as the “Chaddeus” meme server.
---
But hey, I wouldn’t complain about that.
---
I Only remember being ganked by max lvl players during lich king/cataclysm. Hope i get to participate in more equal-lvl fights when I go there in classic
---
That already is a server.
---
I played feral on private server and had great fun. I don't think the class should be buffed because it's one of the most versatile already in pve (being able to heal tank and do decent dps). Sure they could be a few change that would be really nice in pve but that could disrupt pvp balance too.
---
There is also the slippery slope argument, if you give something to one class, then all the other class players will also ask for something. Change after change it won't be vanilla anymore.
---
3pm pst aug 26 is 27th midnight in Europe
---
??
---
It is spreadsheet data without world Buffs.
---
The repair costs are mostly exaggerated, but are definitely a consideration.
---
That said, the more you get hit the higher your repair bill will be, so if you're not a tank it won't be as bad.
---
I mean isn't that where all the pserver bro's went?
---
Yeah during classic and pretty much all of my wow played time. My main was always my paladin. But im really leaning toward Hunters this time around for leveling purposes. And because pally tanking really sucks in classic ;( But still on the fences. Because DPS is going to be everywhere but, Tanking and healers are always going to be in high demand. HALP MEEE
---
Wording on Vanilla tooltips is someyimes very misleading. Looking at you, Anger Management.
---
Opposite for me so...
---
I regret this as a competitive player, but not as a person.  
---
We had a person in our guild that "had a lot of gold".  He was always helping our guild, he, for example, bought all the elementium, we needed to craft thunderfury.  I thought some people took advantage of his kindness.  He claimed to be independently wealthy, but I was pretty sure he was running up cc debt.
---
For some reason, I think the guy thought we wouldnt be his friend or something, which wasnt the case ever.
---
He offered to buy me the 18 slot bag pattern.  I never had any money in classic.  That pattern was 2000 gold.  I would have been one of maybe 2 people on the server that could make that bag.  I probably could have paid him back in a couple of weeks.
---
I knew what he was doing with the credit cards.  I always told him he didnt have to do any of those things, as I was his class lead.
---
Ultimately I dont regret what I did at all, but I always ask myself, how much easier my experience would have been, with essentially bottomless gold.
---
We are a group of friends waiting for release before paying sub. We will choose Gehannas. I assume there are more slow people like us out there.
---
Accuracy 100% confirmed.
---
You mean the ones with 50 billion micro transactions? Lel. Fuck them.
---
What is this bible you speak of? I only know of one bible and it was published by Blizzard Entertainment.
---
I do pretty much exactly this. Torture.
---
Easy answer: Shaman.
---
If you want a more casual approach, go healer. You won't have to compete for a DPS slot, raid slots come easy. PvP is pretty fun, totems are a REAL game changer.
---
(For the record healing isn't that hard in classic, it's mostly mashing 1-button while playing wak-a-mole, and watching your mana drop)
---
Ty bro
---
*You smell that? Do you smell that?... Flamestrike, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of Flamestrike in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill Pyroblasted, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' elf body. The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like... victory.*
---
And it was his pet that pulled the mobs that killed you in the first place!
---
Please let me know if you find the source because that would ruin the game.
---
Anyone know how does this work with MonkeyQuest? seems monkeyquest is just modifying the quest tracker and not much else, will it be redundant or conflict with ClassicCodex? thanks!!
---
And yes, shit post.com.

---
Blizzard is releasing the first version of WoW (the original, before The Burning Crusade) on 27th of August.
---
Yes, you can group starting at 1. It'll take longer for gathering quests and you may have to hop to other zones due to EXP to makeup.   
---
Yes, you and your friends can do your class quests in Dun Morogh.   
---
But remember that server is NOT TOXIC. Amirite?
---
I'll be on this sub during work to get my fix. No worries, fam
---
He's either joking or doesn't know what he's talking about as layers are not zone specific but continent wide which is one of the two reasons why there were so few people in cap cities during certain points of the beta and stress tests.
---
Callin' it now. Mass posts over one's first grey shoulder slot.
---
### [Gehennas EU - Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/jjPpZc) please?
---
Welcome fellow Uralic language speakers.
---
Dungeons were never hard, players were less informed and less skilled, with the millions of “how to do .... in classic wow” videos on YouTube the game will not be as difficult as it once was in 2004. 
---
But yes you still need to sap/poly targets, until people are mega geared and everything can be aoe pulled.
---
Just be sure to not go it alone and make a group for the Nesingwary quests. Doing things solo like wpvp tends to suck for most classes, and for everyone when a zone is populated. However, waiting for the elite spawn for the end point on the hunting quests with a group of five while another group from the other faction is sitting there as well is absolutely exciting. You could fight them now to clear the area, but then if the mob spawns during the fight someone else could grab it or you could win without the ability to kill the mob if enough people die. Or you wait for the spawn, let them try to fight it, then descend on their group with the bonus of a bigass elite tiger on your side. Or you try to tag it first knowing that you can kill it quickly and then fight their group with a slight disadvantage but with the mob dead and looted or you can handle their group alongside the mob (even using its attacks to make sure you don't get cc'd). It takes a really routine thing and makes it very exciting and fun. Its why the outside of Mauradon trying to do the five khans quest on a fresh server is my favorite experience.
---
That makes sense. I didn't think they would sell something with data on it.
---
I guess we’ll find out in phase 2.
---
Bone slap the teeth, friend.
---
One thing to remember is that players will drop off. A server that's only medium is essentially doomed. High or Full is the only option to make sure that your server won't die off.
---
Chewie...we’re home.
---
Grindr
---
Oof, troll confirmed. Get lost.
---
I think his point, and the relevancy is that stuff like this won't happen in Classic because the raid difficulty reduces how excited people are.  When a server first clear happens after months of waiting it's a huge deal, when it happens the week of release, it's more a novelty about who did it, but overall, not a big deal.
---
Jesus fuck, people will complain about anything and everything.
---
Dat bootay
---
You're going to be drinking all the time. Might as well eat too.
---
Stalagg will be full on launch day after Herod is locked.
---
It happened :D
---
These are the exact reasons why pugging was not common in Vanilla.
---
Thanks for confirming! Does this change the quest text?! I can read all the quests in Korean?!
---
Nope. If the class is available in that zone, all classes from any race will have their class quests available. Only exception to this is the priest racials.
---
Chucknorris will save us all !
---
and Red Defias Mask!
---
Looks like this dwarf took the slayer oath.
---
You will all spawn in different starting areas. So level one ist not really convenient, but the first few levels are very fast, so you can meet after that.
---
Well I just figured out it releases 8/26 NA, holy shit
---
Lots of Tool and Coheed and Cambria.
---
My plan is to run SM for gear/LVs and then hop into stv just to pvp lmao.
---
You think you do but you auto-magically do!
---
That was a good change. The game has too many portals and portals should be almost exclusively for mages.
---
no but it tastes like
---
That's awesome! Me and the wife lived on little ceasers pizza and wow during vanilla. We always had fun. We can't wait to get back at it.
---
Interesting.  I wonder how long it is?
---
So what happens when you join your friend in a group when he signs online, but you cant see him, because you cant layer hop?
---
This ~~meeting~~ 43 minute video could have been an ~~e-mail~~ concise text post.
---
That was changed
---
This helped pay for my first level 60's epic mount. Sold one to my guildie. thank you whoever that rogue was
---
sixtyupgrades.com is what you're looking for
---
Never going to be as good as Hello Kitty Island Adventure though.
---
Great video man 👍
---
In max threat situations fury takes equal damage to feral and doesn't get close to them in threat. The only situations in which fury can bridge the gap is if they either out gear the feral immensely or during recklessness uptime (which is a 15 second window every 30 minutes.)
---
Overall, Feral= best threat and Warrior= best mitigation, unless your fighting non boss mobs then Feral= best threat and mitigation.
---
They said layering will end by p2 at the latest, whic is went world bosses come out. so they shouldnt have any issue with that.
---
Too bad its not for Jury duty. You can get out of that by telling them you'll fight for jury nullification.
---
Gnomeberg
---
wanna trade for monopolyguy? I'll even throw in Park Place to sweeten the deal
---
Imagine complaining about not enough servers and getting another server a couple of days later and still being pissy.
---
Because Herod will have horrendous queue times. It doesn’t really matter what the population of the server is if you can’t get into it. Also every server will have a very healthy population once everyone else picks a server. People fail to remember that there are so many people who don’t have a sub who can’t pick a server yet and there are people who have a sub and still haven’t picked a server.
---
"eli5" jesus fucking christ shoot me now.
---
That's probably the best way. All too many times, I've just burned myself out on an alt trying to level it quickly and never bothered with professions. Then repeat the process after about 10-20 hours on each new character. I started WoW about 7 months before TBC released and I tried rogue and got frustrated b/c I couldn't figure out how to get that debuff to come off that makes it so you can't stealth. Man, that was so many years ago now.
---
It was 8 at start of vanilla and 16 by the end. We get 16 in classic but its still not enough to just throw up every subpar debuff in the game.
---
Not everything in the phases lines up with vanilla release. Many things will be in their 1.12 state despite getting raids and honor system later, gear, quests and bugs will be fixed already.
---
But we can always hope classic has it's own bugs and creative players can turn those in to memories as cool or maybe even cooler.
---
Well of course my first play-thru is just going to be wow music, but alts and grinding I'm gonna put putting on some metal!
---
I have a bad feeling that people/trolls are going to start shit in chat about how much they don’t like it
---
Shadow spec is great (and fun) for levelling. And if you will have a warrior around, Priest-Warrior is one of the best levelling combos, from what I remember.
---
(In no small part because you then have the two most important parts of a dungeon group covered. Add some dps and go get blues.)
---
Warlock is not something you want to play if you're worried about blandness. Their are mechanically pretty simple. I think you overestimate pally, they seem to be a lot less fun than shamans from what I've gathered.
---
My impression from the way you talk is you're doubting the fact that you really want to go shaman again. Sounds like you don't actually want to play something else to me.
---
thotsauce, for dancing on the mailbox
---
Can you change game files so you hear vietnam war songs in the  background while in stv? And would that be banable?
---
&gt;My question is, what if I only ever plan to play between 4am - 6am? Will I dodge most of the server population between this time window and be able to AOE level?
---
No. Lol. So many of us are shift workers, my dude, then you have to factor in the NZ team.
---
I plan on doing the same heading to teldrasil at level 4 going to try and not go back to train till teldrasil is done in f i get a lesser magic wand should not be a problem. Once i get to darkshore i will go back and train every 2 levels only if there is a spell i need.
---
For a long time I was 100% sure I was going Orc female, for the classes that could, and female UD for the rest
---
Orc female just feels like the perfect balance between human male and female. Not as stiff and boring as the males, and not as thin as the females
---
But recently I’ve considered troll males. Good PVE racials for all roles including lvling (I’m not that into PvP), I don’t find them that ugly anymore, and they don’t seem that common so I would be a little special. 
---
My biggest worry is if I would get tired of the troll look, where the orc female is the safer bet
---
My current pc will only play in classic settings.
---
When I build my new rig I will be dabbling with maxed settings
---
Thats me!! :3
---
Oh absolutely! Just wasn't sure if I was pulling info out if my ass
---
LOL. Shazzrah is the Scandinavian server, only the scrubs switched to Gehennas

Good point I will have to remove those, I actually did not get a chance to test all the functions of Leatrix before the stress test went down, so I haven't gotten rid of the other addons that it can replace.
---
GehennASS
---
Not sure that many players would survive the layers..
---
Turned it to max, never looked back. It still feel like classic.
---
Most likely they'll open new servers at that time.  They generally don't allow pve to pvp.
---
Of course everyone is free to play with whatever settings they find best.
---
In my opinion the game looks better with the glow on, even on an LCD. (I think a lot of people just have theirs set to too bright and/or use completely uncalibrated ones, that's why they have a problem with the glow.)
---
I think they've underestimated the demand completely.  Look at how the servers went full in a day...
---
And say for the sake of argument they have, and they are left with 50k on Herod at the beginning of phase 2, WHATS THE PLAN?
---
I lost it at the “Dope AF sword”

hahahah soooo true, sorry alliance xD

I would like to take a chance here and encourage czechoslovakia community to move from Shazzrah and Golemagg onto Gehennas as well. Thank you and hope to see you there.

Even when i started in Wrath i spent waaaaaaaaaaaaay more time in IF than SW.

You will want a quest route and practice to get even close to 60.  Ill be doing 1 - 37 in one sitting but thats with alot of trial and error and practice over a good period of time
---
I'm also looking for a site like this, to share with the Guild Leaders of Atiesh, so that they can fill up raids and have a tool to track people on that are interested. It would be really nice if OpenRaid would come back for Classic. I could def seeing them getting traffic for it.
---
Mankrik has one
---
Ima stick to herod.  Eventually it’ll get to the point retail is at where if you didn’t roll on a52 illidan or tich, enjoy the dead server or pay out the ass for xfers.  I’ll deal with the ques for a week.
---
cheers, i'll try to catch them sometime
---
Where's the music from? Not the LOTR music but the guitar music at the beginning. I recognize it but just can't figure it out, it's from a cartoon I'm sure.

 Aaand you must be the monopoly guy!
---
&gt; you have to decide if you really want to complete things like Dartol's Rod quest. There are a bunch of little breadcrumb quests that you can't get if you get too high of level (the "go to this zone" type quests).
---
We are us, comrade.
---
No. The game was completely changed in a "cataclysm" expansion, including the starter zones. You would need to download the 1.12 client and play on a private server.
---
More people confirming class quests are universal: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cog68i/i_had_been_told_that_we_would_need_to_go_back_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
So again, fuck off.
---
Just watch a leveling guide.
---
The choices are so limited you won't get to be a special snowflake. Your options are warrior, rogue, lock, mage, and hunter. Traditionally there are fewer locks and hunters in group but everything is going to be popular.

Is it possible to get debuff timers to show on enemy mobs in classic? I noticed in the video that your frostbolt showed the debuff on enemy frames, but didn't have an indicator of how long until it drops off. I was looking for an addon during the stress test to do this, but didn't have any luck.

The entire map is different. You generally need to kill some stuff though. Practice right mouse button clicking and pressing 1 on your keyboard while your PC is off to prepare.

If you really want to gimp yourself, go Boomkin.

What the hell this is hilarious, how is it possible there were no quality machinimas for years and as soon as Classic gets close they appear.
---
Feral (assuming a spec that is capable-enough at tanking dungeons at a minimum) is a decent-enough solo farming spec at 60? Not trying to put it at mage levels, just getting a sense of capability.
---
Tauren females are the best Moomiees &lt;3
---
Level 60, will go ham with the boys
---
Phase 2 is ~2 months after launch, not 4-5. Ion already said this. We’ll be in BWL by January.
---
They will add servers as needed. It’ll be hard to find a low pop pvp server, and I think pve would make more sense if you want to battle the environment and without many other players. I’m mostly concerned that Stalagg will just have all the leftovers and no big guilds or communists come over to make it more sustainable.
---
Then test is wrong.  I did the troll priest quest in Vanilla and it was race locked.  Just like every single one that is shown there.  That *were* race locked in Vanilla.
---
Trading Herod Names PM ME
---
Where do you think he got the content from?
---
I appreciate the caution. this isn't us just doing napkinmath though.
---
Nope you got it right. It is enough that things like 1 shadow priest for shadow weaving in lock heavy groups will be a thing though. It wasn't really early classic.
---
Thanks for the idea. I'll ping you if I get around to making it!
---
Sounds like Spongebob.
---
Nope.
---
Lol thanks I'll get right on that. How long should I leave hot pockets in the microwave?
---
They didn't want larger groups of users to switch. They open a server for new players. People who are already rolled on a different server have to choose to switch.
---
Congratulations, you take the cake. 
---
Think of all threat warriors could generate if they simply took of all that pesky armor, too. 
---
Do you have any idea how much mana you Dave your raid with 1% dodge while keeping threat pinned?
---
Most of the current players didnt exist in vanilla.
---
Are you American or you don’t know the EU countries yet to consider as stranger? 
---
Shazz discord is a shithole full of trolls.
---
Yes they did.  I had six sixties on one server when BC hit.  There absolutely *were* race locked breadcrumbs.

Might be, will check it out at launch. As for the hide thing in Questie, then no, it is not what I am looking for, as it hides everything, instead of hiding specific ones.
---
Thats what I was thinking 
---
But this guy seems to like breaking the rules.
---
He is very smart i wasn‘t implying he is a retard in a mental way, I just don‘t like his behaviour, his wording and his general appearance. Just a personal thing of mine, I would love to see him ganked till he shuts down his broadcast.
---
An imperialist war that was purely defensive for our allies?  The US didn't even try to invade the North and could have easily crushed them with another Fat Man and Little Boy.  Did the US make mistakes, sure, but you are reading too much propaganda if you call it imperialist.
---
This is part of why WotLK is so special to me. I had played since vanilla, and by the time it came around, I was really and truly ready to be a serious raider. So, I cut ties with the guild I was treading water with, applied to a few guilds, and landed in a small, solid 10-man heroic guild. We went on to compete for server firsts, and had a lot of fun doing it.
---
Cata/end of Wrath comes along, and LFR starts to interfere with server-side raid progress. It wasn't long before you couldn't recognize anyone running around the major cities anymore. The connection was lost.
---
Thank you Grobby, very cool!
---
Dagnir, LothBane (Bayne), Barghest
---
Hope it helps, a little at least.
---
Sounds like a delightful place
---
Am I doing this right?
---
Thanks for the input, appreciated!
---
No, players will have to choose if they want to move instead of waiting in queue
---
It's not the class I'm concerned with, it's should I go solo or join a realm/faction that I'm not too keen on just for my friend and his guild that I don't know too well.
---
I just want to get ahead of the massive crowd at the start
---
And reading the tryhard comments of reddit users who don´t understand how you can have fun this way.
---
You shouldn't tell people to fuck off if you don't want to be considered vulgar.
---
I'm not suggesting that the color or design changes, I'm suggesting that the form be given some dimension so that the chestpiece looks like it's plate (like the shoulders do) rather than a tunic.
---
And I am totally in line with those, meaning Vanilla, TBC and first half of WotLK being great. Although, I would argue they should be on each their own servers, not developing vanilla servers into TBC and TBC servers into a WotLK servers... because wouldn't that just be repeating yourself trying to obtain something different than the path of retail? And you know the Einstein quote on that :D
---
Ok, I'll check it out. Maybe it needs to be updated for classic before release because I'm pretty sure I tried ClassicAuraDurations and it wasn't working. Thanks for the reply.
---
I mean, I was pretty happy to be doing that quest again for the first time in years.
---
Ret paladin :)
---
This is the type of stuff I’d like to see from Blizzard, numbers. Lots of numbers and data and graphs and charts.
---
Edit: seems BFA is also Batchelor of Fine Arts.
---
Just for posterity, almost all of these are coming to Questie post release. Didn't have enough time to get everything in before launch
---
We've got a few devs who are going to be working pretty hard after launch to get everything cleaned up.
---
3 minutes to give the internal lava some time to cool down. Please be advised though, cooler lava is still lava. Be cautious.
---
If it really did they wouldn't need to constantly rework and remove systems in an attempt to balance.
---
Yea I noticed that /u/hakurai arrived at Goldshire with 2-3x the amount of silver I did, and that "Bounty on Murlocs" has a prereq too it, I don't remember which quest. I only had stress test so could only check 1-15. Also the buzzbox 827 in Darkshore I could not get a quest from.
---
We already know you have no fucking clue what you’re taking about, so either go find Vanilla-era video of someone attempting to pickup a class quest outside their race and failing, or kindly take your hands off the fucking keyboard.
---
Obviously
---
read the sentence again
---
I smell zoomer.
---
This is stupid. Upvote.
---
Your Shaman talents are a bad idea, mate. You can't get items that support that playstyle. You say you'll get spell crit, but those items come attached with spellpower and int, not strength and AP. Your melee investment goes to waste because you'd be stronger just casting lightning bolt. I think Elemental Devastation is a cool concept too, but you're better off dropping Elemental Fury to take Storm Strike. 
---
Beyond that, the real problem with the playstyle is that spellcasts reset (not pause) your swing timer. This means that if you have a 3.5sec 2hander, you're going to have to wait the full 3.5 seconds after your spell procs Elemental Devastation to swing. Because of that, there's not really a great use-case for Elemental Devastation. 
---
What's your best-case scenario? When would it be better to switch to melee (while in spellcaster gear) rather than spellcast? You just can't mix the two.

Private server bug.
---
It is? In what region?
---
We've been working hard to make sure Questie is compatible with every addon, including this one
---
&gt;No one cares about keeping classic graphics, it's all just about the design and mechanics of the game being so much better than retail.
---
Unfortunately there are some people that are irrationally headstrong about no changes.  We're more practical about it, it's not like being able to mail 12 items versus 1 changes our vanilla experience.
---
That's why I really wish they'd allow for AOE skinning/looting too
---
BoE
---
What's his philosophy other than "I (was) better than you (and I'm desperate to be relevant)"?
---
You can't wave Vanilla's itemization with the Bob Ross wand (there has to be bad to appreciate good). It was all bad. All of it. There was no deliberate balance of some good and some bad. It wasn't just "some specs" -- caster loot was all shit. Throwaway items with spellpower turned out to accidentally be way fucking superior to anything deliberately designed, which changed all future design. Diminishing returns were introduced on downranked spells because "oh fuck, we didn't think of that." Melee itemization saw the same thing. Patch 1.12 blues are better than all of original MC gear, and that's not just because it was changed as catch up gear, it was changed because devs had to learn from theorycrafters how to fucking do their jobs. The nicest thing that can be said about Kevin Jordan going after itemization is that he's speaking outside of his field, like the engineer inexplicably invited to a barbecue who would have you believe he's a medical doctor.
---
No, you know how test works.  I know how Vanilla worked, and WoWhead backs me up.  You're wrong.
---
This was really funny, and sadly accurate. I still always try to help people out when I see them in trouble, or just to be friendly.
---
Perhaps being like everyone else is High Fantasy for Alliance players! ;)
---
If you’re already complaining about the possibility of pvp on a server it’s probably going to not be a good fit for your, in all truth.
---
Q fucking Q
---
You shouldn’t act like you know something when you don’t. That’s how you get put in your place.

I really want to root for the paladin, especially because I play a paladin, but that name makes it hard to.

I don’t know how many of the german people only resubbed for this, I didn’t because a name is not worth something like 7€ imo and I don’t think I am the only one who didn’t. 2 Server for the german community won’t work out.
---
Should be the “60s”
---
Verkar som att bara vissa av svenska guildsen switchade. Och många är kvar på Shazz, inklusive norge och danmark. 
---
Vart en massa prat om det på reddit sedan de announcade flytten.
---
I've surprised myself by actually settling on one class. Just like i did in vanilla. Before BC, when i drowned my life in alts.
---
Posting in a world of warcraft sub reddit about your search for a kinky goth girlfriend is both out of place and creepy. Thats the authentic truth my guy.
---
To be clear, the Classic build of Questie is using the same database that pfQuest was using, it even uses the same DB tool. Along with a lot of manually corrected data (base pfquest database does have some problems)
---
Heh, my memory is garbage too. I barely remember last year :P
---
:O , haha, then I think Id like to join ya
---
And our social life will end.
---
Wowhead has lots of incorrect data, they even say so. And you know nothing kid.
---
Medium in classic = full in vanilla almost, you need to realise the server cap now is a lot bigger than that of Vanilla.
---
Van discord?
---
I'm listening. How many people does the norwegian server concern? And can you name a couple of danish guild that also join Shazzrah?
---
And lore based names.
---
Nobody is called an item or a meme.
---
the beauty of it is that its so versatile u can make it with whatever or just simple
---
I just put in whatever leftovers I got in the fridge
---
In what country do you live for a WoW sub being 7 bucks?
---
I was hoping WC3 would be out early in the year and is what was gonna gold me over until Classic. Instead it'll come out after when I'll be too busy in WoW to enjoy playing custom games all day and night :(
---
&gt; I was the smartest hunter theyve ever seen with all that intellect 
---
Best payoff in the thread
---
No I am check testa
---
join us stalaggots
---
!Remindme 11 days
---
Those devs are brave to add features post launch! I'm gonna be enjoying my gametime as much as possible.
---
Good work on Questie though!
---
Maybe that’s just his RP story? PvP doesn’t need all heroes.
---
I think its still worth it to roll PVP. the whole idea of Horde vs filthy alliance is kind of the point of WoW :)
---
That's not how decommissioned server blades work
---
It’s not so much shunning as the practice if running private servers especially for monetary gain is kinda infringing on a ton of rules so ya.
---
Open the battle.net client click above the launch/update button there is a small drop down menu, you can select classic wow then download it. I’ve had it installed for a while now An have no subscription i can log in an see populations of servers though.
---
&gt; hybrid melee/caster
---
actually that was the priest. Thats why disc has armor buff.
---
title of this Post is WTB gf, it is on topic yall
---
Na this guy just lives in the Battlestar Galactica mindset. Anyone in power in that show went by Sir
---
Ya I would be quite surprised if it takes less time to actually log on, than to just name a character.
---
my list is rogue priest hunter
---
will prolly play all 3 and just not tryhard one of them
---
Depends on how good your tanks/guild were to be honest.  
---
I raided as a warlock back in Vanilla, I was personally rolling with SM/Ruin and we had three other warlocks, two of them being DS/Ruin and the third was specced into being the GM's girlfriend.  
---
Never had any issues with threat at all, mainly because we all knew how it functioned and how to game it properly without overdoing it, and we had stellar tanks.
---
BFA launch was shit for me too, couldn’t authenticate. They even made a blue post about it.
---
https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/commit/dc1944a1c4ebe689274b47793c03f2877fd7216a
---
This was just added to Questie a couple days ago actually. It was in the 1.12 version, but it's one of the things didn't make it in during beta. We're gonna be doing a bunch of work post launch to finish things up, it should go pretty quickly
---
ok I'll edit, but your life sure died when you were online
---
I have the names Victory and Judgment on Herod looking for similar names for paladin.
---
I remember reading stories about parents neglecting kids for days while they binged WoW sessions. I wasn’t a parent until the end of WotLK where I quit til WoD, meaning it was super casual time so it wasn’t bad
---
Fortunately my kids are old enough to get food from the pantry and won’t have to sit in days old diapers, though I like to hope I wouldn’t be near as bad as the extremes.
---
I'm so tempted to play each for a bit to see how much I like them, but I won't have a ton of time to play so I'd rather it all go into one character. Though I'm running out of time soon. May just have to pick at random at this point.
---
If you have four other RELIABLE people, yeah absolutely.
---
It's fun
---
The end of many social lives (present company included)
---
It could happen, but the vast majority of players at launch, and for a few months after launch, will easily outnumber the private server tryhards. Nothin' wrong with being a tryhard, but the casuals and semi-casuals will be a much higher percent of the population. Most of us will use ingame channels/avenues for finding groups.
---
I think there could be a divide in the community down the road, but discord is extremely popular in general (I've been using it since WoD, but I've noticed shittons of communities use it for stuff now, not just gamers; roleplayers use it, people use it just for chatting like they did with Skype, etc an so on). I think it'll be popular for guilds to use to communicate outside of the game; it has its uses for alerting them if you'll be late, or something came up, or whatever. 
---
So while there are realm servers, I don't think they'll be that popular overall. People tend to not like crazy busy discord servers (too easy to get lost in them, too spammy, too many different opinions/ways of thinking, etc). They're much more likely to just friend people there individually and stay on a guild server to be in touch with guildies.
---
All these poor newbs that will go there in the early 30's to continue their solo experience, boy will they get one
---
Anti aliasing on max too? What are your specs?
---
And thrown weapon specialization /s
---
this mage is bad
---
That or he was secretly the maker of The Room.
---
Oh, hi mark.
---
I dont have a sub and I installed it. I think oyu just need the latest bnet client
---
Exactly.
---
Horde in WSG: "Lets team up!"
---
Alliance in WSG: "Shut up, you don't pay my sub!"
---
Okay, well go to them with your lack of proof and see what they say. In the meanwhile, stop spreading misinformation.
---
A weapon progression order is exactly what I came into this thread to ask about. Any of them you'd recommend?
---
Sorry man, we Bohemians have already claimed it, and unless you're planning to kidnap our king while backed by a bunch of bloodthirsty Cuman mercenaries IDK what you can do it about it.
---
Welcome brother!
---
This is horrible. Take my upvote!
---
Ohhh ya
---
It is as the name suggests.
---
Lots of people playing haven’t created a character yet and more will start playing after launch. I don’t want to start my subscription yet cause I have 2 names I feel that won’t be taken, and if they are taken oh well. I bet the new server will reach high or full at launch. 
---
I feel lucky I’m playing on a PvE server so it won’t be too crazy.
---
That may be true, but a number of people are reporting the sub is required and Classic does not show up prior.
---
Either way, it’s a bad idea to wait until the 27th to sub anyway
---
Is WoW gold farming still lucrative ? I feel like it was a serious problem in Vanilla because this was the biggest player on the field and the target audience was huge, so the ROI was worth it. 
---
There seem to be so many other games that could be more lucrative for gold farmers to ply their trade in.
---
Your memory != fact.
---
Fury or Arms can easily and effectively tank any 5 man dungeon with average gear. Just ask your dps to CC and mark targets.
---
can be technically, I dont know the exact time frame to be one, but it is the heart that matters.
---
lmao, can't wait for that
---
I'm rolling need on that one, sorry!
---
I think I'm just gonna try out an undead mage on Thalnos and hopefully the world pvp will end up being fun for me
---
Most addon devs weren't lucky enough to get in to beta, a lot of things are gonna come out post launch
---
Don't worry though, we're gonna be enjoying the game too, coding stuff while playing is pretty chill
---
I’m aware? Lol
---
You won't get ahead of them if you've never done Vanilla. Many of the people returning already played through Vanilla and know the ins and outs. Also with so many logging in the first few days, almost everyone is gonna have a server queue and often times a shortage of quest mobs to kill.
---
Or if you actually know what you're talking about, it's more like they're viable for 99% of vanilla, are better in some cases, and single target threat is insane with or without MCP. Spread the word, tired of battling ignorance.
---
Rightclick -&gt; Report -&gt; Globally Muted -&gt; Problem Solved
---
That's probably, mostly a healer vs dps thing
---
I did not know that.
---
Then I assume he means Fairbanks the NPC, not Fairbanks the realm.
---
Nope, at the Name Reservation it was Realm-Queue. Login-Servers are not the problem. We are not in fucking 2005 anymore, no WoW Expansion Release ever had Login-Problems and since you can already login there will be no login-queues. Its all about the Realms, because they will have a Hardcap since you can't let 30.000 People on the same Server, even if you could through Layering.
---
Blizzard will do what they can and it is up to us to help police the servers.
---
This pic would be a fun alternate back story

You have to weapon and spec swap for PvP no matter if you are tank or DPS. Warriors should generally be DW fury in PvE, and 2h Arms in PvP.
---
PTO Tuesday/Wednesday. Yes it'll be a shitshow. Yes I want to be a part of it.
---
Yup. Just gotta embrace it.
---
yooo prontera vibes coming in hot
---
So? they want to play the game so they need to choose a server. Realisticly what is the chance that you will encounter them when not actively looking for them? like how much of a "problem" is this really.
---
Im going in to classic, by not reliving the memories, but creating new ones. I have always played Horde. I know all thier quests and cities. Therefore I am not going horde this time, and I am picking up a class I have never played, even though my heart belongs to Thrall as his fellow shammy boy. 
---
Many may be going for the nostalgic route, though I am more open for exploring Azeroth all over again.
---
Theyre not fine though, you said druid is fine because it can keep up with hunter when the reality is no one brings hunters for their damage. So you can barely keep up with a bad dps class and you bring no utility. 
---
Have fun playing a known meme.
---
I mean... I'd play Classic VR. It's got about the same potato look as VR games.

---
What happened to good morning Azeroth and DefTalk? I miss those shows.
---
This picture really sets in the fact that in some ways, the game looked *better* back then. The armor was still ridiculous, but *believable*. Now the armor is unbelievably wacky and the mounts are all over the top.
---
I saw a vid with the developers that said that trading gold is okay so long as it was earned without using an automated way to earn the gold/play the game.

If you are just talking about message spam, then you can just right click and report.

Can’t aoe farm efficiently in a group of people. Being ahead of the main group means playing 18+ hours a day for the first week or two.
---
it was ALL GRIND. Questing was a nightmare. Had to talk to NPC and typing special words(from memory) And you didn't really know who gave quest or not.
---
I remember grouping with a necromancer in, Highkeep (I believe) That guy was grinding mobs all days long and he gained me a few level while I slept.
---
For me, it was all grinding to level mostly.
---
Get 40 and go sword and board for aoe clearing
---
Geeze I don’t know how I missed this! Thank you!
---
Q fucking Q. No druids allowed.
---
Gold farmers will be a thing in Classic. And I will be their best customer.
---
Don‘t forget that many of those things like switching specs and lfg were wanted by the fans back in the day. I hope we learned from that mistake
---
I like The Barrens for the general looks and music, I never had trouble with the quests, but what you point out is more of a convenience than anything else. It feels as though it was a convenience for Blizzard as well to make it this way too - less effort.
---
I prefer the Alliance counterpart, because you have 3 different zones - each with its own appearance and theme for quests. Elwynn Forest - Defias, Gnolls and Kobolds, Westfall - Defias and farms, Redrige - Gnolls and Orcs, Duskwood - Necromancers, undead and curses. The Barrens has like a couple of sub-zones, the pine tree area with the harpies, the sludge area with the Goblins, the oases with the centaurs, eastern Barrens with the goblins, palm trees, pirates and Alliance marines and southern Barrens with the scorched (from heat?) land and the Razorbacks. The issue is that they don't look that much different from each other.
---
I know right, we've already forgotten about Goldshire dog and the office gifs!
---
It was his destiny.
---
Loved that elite boar getting absolutely murked. That's really how it is with groupfinder. Not a fucking challenge, just a chore
---
I too would love to see this.
---
Imagine having to run Gnomeregan for 6 hours just to be on par with someone (for 1 hour) who forgot to bring consumables. Don't make this mistake people.
---
Thousands is fine.. a cap of 50 in a city is not. I am used to seeing more than that in just the auction house.
---
The serious gold farming sites sell in game currency across multiple games. The pservers that don't sell gold themselves have gold farmers on them as well. Classic will definitely have gold farmers.
---
Yep it was with ElvUI I wanted to mess with
---
For some reason we couldn’t get it to work for my friend. I think it was because we were trying to do the name reserve though and it wouldn’t let him until he subbed.
---
\#nochanges?
---
Yeah you've clearly run UBRS like twice and never as a rogue hunting for those swords. Or maybe you've just never pugged it? 
---
Either way, being surprised at 2 rogues and 2 hunters in a 10 man group? lol.
---
Your beta != vanilla.
---
The problem with STV is that you’ll spend 80% of your time as a ghost and you can’t quest as a ghost in WoW.
---
Are you kidding me? Fresh server launch gold farming would be insane. 
---
If your one of the first to 60 and grinding with mage or hunter that's quite a lot of cash. Especially for a 3rd world country.
---
Must have sucked to have played on such a backwards server. Sorry you went through that.
---
Because it's the process of building the emotional investment of 15 years of gaming that appeals to me more than the end of the investment. So I'm doing it again.
---
I will edit to clarify what i meant.
---
They have no idea what percentage of *future Classic players* are downloading early / active on old accounts.
---
For example, they might see 100k downloads.  But obviously all that means is at least 100k are going to play.  They can't really use that to see how many people beyond that will play.
---
This is great, amazing for RP elements too. Hopefully we can start setting up shop somewhere.
---
Have you ever been to Vietnam? I've crawled the Cu Chi tunnels and have done my research, so while it's my opinion, it's not baseless...

not till p5 you're not
---
I read the entire thing and only at the end realized it's from 2004... F
---
Buddy there will be 60s in the first week lol.
---
Around 25. Courses only start 6 days after launch, I plan to no-life it for that time but not gonna go too hard.
---
I don't mind lfd, ok the other hand, I hate sharding and crossrealm stuff
---
Literally everyone: NIGHT ELF ASS OWO
---
That is called ”paraphrasing” not tl;dr ;)
---
Oh those magyars...
---
you came from private servers and Didn't play the stress tests, didn't you.
---
Any of the stress tests which would have told you, that private Servers != Classic, no matter how vanilla was or might have been at a certain release point, doesn't help OP, for classic go live, this is how the game actually is now.
---
at least he didn't join a cult
---
It was beta or one of the stress tests. It releases on 27th.
---
I'm picking tauren because I want to be a horde durid
---
 If troll durids where also where available I would pick that instead "my main in BFA is a zandalari durid"
---
No u
---
Link to the work?
---
The good thing about playing on Horde, I'll always have numbers on my side in STV.
---
This area and the other lvl 30 area in Kalimdor have me PTSD on private server. I hyped myself into Classic after annoucement but stopped playing since leveling abover 35 consisted more of coming back from the graveyard than actually playing the game. Love Vanilla, hate PVP Servers.
---
Possible. I can install it but I cannot log in since I dont have a sub
---
I've never played on a private server, but I'm willing to bet I leveled more characters than you have in Vanilla.
---
Add like 3-4 hours at launch as "Waiting to log in through all queues and diconnects" and it will be more accurate one.
---
How old are you hahaha wtf
---
Yeah, I get the sentiment and agree to a point.
---
It's loosely defined as being born between 1981-1996.
---
Is it really not that good without a certain itemization theshold?
---
What about that spec that goes 0/30/21 for iceblock?
---
Because he's too busy wielding Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.
---
My advice, play a rogue. You can generally get through any area and any situation fairly easily. It allows you to choose your fights. I also think it enhances your RP opportunities greatly. If you see lower level players fighting, you can assist "in character" and play through a scenario if everyone is also RP'ing. I speak from experience as this is what I did back in vanilla days, played rogue from 1- 60, then into BC etc. If the zone had a ganker from Alliance, I would also go and do sentry work to try and catch the ganker, again, "in character". I had some good times.
---
Yeah, Naxx is exactly the same!!
---
Does farclip increase the distance noticiably?  People and mobs are loading in, what feels like, way too close.  It's immersion breaking when I'm running through Mulgore and see things loading in all the time. 
---
I know in Vanilla this was done server side, as shown by private servers reducing draw distance to reduce server load.  But, is there a way to make things load in further in Classic?
---
Shaman warrior.
---
How viable is a warrior in open world or battleground pvp without a friend that plays a healer? My friend will be a rouge so I wont get any healing and I hear all the time that a warrior without a pocket healer is getting abused really easily in pvp. Will it be a chore? I dont know if I should pick a class that is more viable in pvp solo ?
---
:) there's only 12 of us!
---
It's been a while for me so I'll definitely read most of them on my main character, but a lot of players will have gone through most of these levels many times before.  On top of that, some people love the leveling experience, while some can't wait to start doing the end game dungeons and raids.
---
If anything I'm going to be making a bunch of level 35's, as that's the minimum level requirement for rank 300 professions; I.E. transmute alts
---
Oh so thats why there was so many Brazilians in tibia!
---
I stopped playing on a private server cause I couldn’t stand it. It was literally unplayable:)
---
Reddit apps use imgur, res opens inline imgur links. It's easy to upload the pic with Relay.
---
He's talking about raids papa
---
And your proof is “I remember it differently”.
---
Why is it so good? 20 energy is half a cat ability. I guess with 15 rage on bear switch you could feral charge into bash, which is kind of cool, is that the big draw?
---
I played a ton through the second half of BC to the end of WotLK and the introduction of dungeon finder was like flipping a switch for me. I pretty much completely stopped being interested in the game, it was so incredibly boring to sit in Dalaran and just queue for a dungeon, get automatically thrown in with random people, and then repeat 10 minutes later after finishing that run. At that point I played only for raiding and even then I stopped playing almost entirely before the Ruby Sanctum filler update. I tried again when Cata came out but the community feeling was pretty much completely gone by then.
---
You’re nuts if you think that abomination of a tauren model is better than the original.

Any idea why the overwhelming majority of player NE durid characters are female?

I think you got Bilbo and frodo mixed up..... 
---
You were insinuating Bilbo is the hunter, Bilbo snatched at the ring and didn't get it, so it would make more sense if you were trying to say Bilbo the hunter tried to snag the loot but frodo the warrior won...
---
Plus you have Bilbo in the nameplate with Sam as a pet, which wouldn't make any sense. if anything Sam is frodos pet.

---
Well this isn’t a Vanilla subreddit and you’re not answering a question about Vanilla. This is about Classic WoW you fool. And in any case, you’re wrong.
---
just turn on some music what the fuck lol
---
(but yes you can)
---
Are you daft?  We are talking about predicting "ahead* of launch.  *In advance*.  *Before*.  Is that such a difficult concept to grasp?
---
Also, since when has anyone, ever, had a problem subbing? lmfao.  I love how you just made up that problem.
---
God you're such a shill it's pathetic.  Always licking their boots on every topic that comes up.
---
Free, one-way, transfers from specific high/full pop realms to specific low/new realms.
---
I agree. I'm not a big streamer fan but I think there is loads of fun to have. They need events to create content, so if you wish to join in then it should be fun. Will make the world seem more organic.
---
If you wish to not partake, I can't see how it would affect you. Not unless they have some big faction war and you are caught in the crossfire.
---
Because I like the old formula better. I dont want the rush rush aoe everything style of retail. I like threat managing mechanics and kill orders and cc usage and a real sense of achieving and not being given something. 
---
Of raiding in a simplier time where you could kick back and have fun. Not worrying about memorizing a dozen mechanics for a single boss and watching a half dozen timers and moving around every 5 seconds avoiding something. Of loot being so rare you dont expect and feel entitled to it every time you play. It's a byproduct, not the goal. And not having to constantly filter through loot because you picked up 5 pieces in a 2 hr raid.
---
A lot of other things as well, but these are the ones I think about the most.
---
Why on earth would one play pve in classic??
---
If you're not the main tank, you don't need to put a single point in prot, except for progression for a few particular encounters (4 horsemen come to mind).
---
Generally, just spec fully for DPS, and acquire tank gear for tanking and equip it when needed.
---
Always be willing to tank.
---
I don't recommend this for new players, but, be ready to pick up aggro and pop defensive cooldowns and tank if the main tank dies. I've saved the raid from wipes doing this. If you're in full plate dps gear, and have a good sword and board, this can sometimes save a wipe and get the kill if the boss is low on health.

---
I never really understand these posts. 
---
It’s always like these special snowflake builds and they are always complete fucking trash. 
---
For some classes it depends on what kind of gear you have to determine if a spec is optimal but let’s be real here...
---
Vanilla is VERY cookie cutter in a lot of ways. 
---
There are usually only a handful of optimal builds. You can choose not to run those builds - but you’re just objectively making your PvP power worse. 
---
That being said - gear goes a long way and you can fuck people up with garbage talent choices if you out gear someone enough. 
---
Long story short here - recommended builds exist for a reason. They are just simply “the best” across the most scenarios. 
---
Vanilla isn’t quite Rock Paper Scissors but there is some truth to counters here and there and most people can’t afford to respec every day so you need to pick builds that keep you viable against as many enemy combinations as possible. 
---
Picking some niche garbage spec is just dumb imo.
---
&gt; and then run allllll the way to the gnome/dwarf starter spot passing ironforge and their secondary spot. Which my guess with inevitably dying 10 times from higher level mobs will probably take the poor night elf a 2-3 hours to make it there. 
---
Or you can skip all that, [drown yourself after landing in Menethil harbor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d27HDO253Hc) and get from Teldrassil to Kharanos in less than 20 minutes.
---
The tryhards keep incorrectly using the words "optimal" and "viable" interchangeably.
---
Yes. I've leveled 5-6 characters to level 60 over the years, but this time I have a job to keep. My girlfriend is cautiously trying it, and loves the lore. So I'm going to read everything to enjoy it with her and challenge myself not to grind too hard
---
I feel like a teen again just when Burning crusade came out and we were waiting for the Outlands gate to open!!! 😄😄 . Classic is as exciting but with a pinch of nostalgia on top.
---
Cannot wait for world pvp / defending crossroads and jumping noobs in STV.
---
Draenei girls but they didn't exist in classic
---
To be fair to him. He did point out useful ones and why they were useful. It was a good video.

The chat log is more than fine.  Though, you can always edit the .ini file in the WTF folder if you want.
---
Rogue warrior
---
Mage lock
---
Priest mage
---
Hunter anything
---
Lock anything
---
Warrior/Shaman, WF and Heals.
---
Rogue/Druid, Stealth on both, super good.
---
Rogue/Mage, lots of control, probably the best if you don't want ANY kind of heals.
---
&gt;The druid is however susceptible to crits and crush, which arent really a problem considering the much higher armour and health values.
---
This is inaccurate. The higher armor value doesn't mitigate the damage of Crush/ Crits enough to make the Druid a better tank after phase 2. Why you ask? Your avoidance cap can never be met because Druids can't block. This simple fact means as a Feral tank you can MC, you can do ZG, you can even tank most of BWL( except 2 fights). But that's where it ends. AQ40 and Naxx runs would be %150 harder with a druid tank doing the bosses.  Your avoidance falls off at that point. Hope this helps! (Also another point... you can only build threat on 3 targets at a time. Which sucks big time for larger trash pulls.)
---
its a "world epic", rarest bracket and only drops in mc/ubrs
---
It's not super intensive, especially with a few macros. But endgame you really only heal if you want to raid, so its not super comparable to Mage or Warlock
---
I just liked getting decent gear while leveling
---
I hated wasting rested xp, so I would always try to level two toons simultaneously.  One parked in an inn for the week, while the other was out getting that sweet, sweet double xp, then switch when one ran out.
---
The problem was that it slowed tings down so much, that I would always lose interest in one or both amd abandoned them, only to try the exact some thing a month later. I have about a bajillion (gi e or take,) toons sitting around level 40 that I can't bear to delete "just in case I want to go back one day." Which will never actually happen.
---
I will be powering to 60 this time... I hope.
---
There are no Warlocks in Northshire Abbey, they hang around in the graveyard outside.
---
I didn't loot everything. Don't ask.
---
Led to me having to lend around 40 gold from the guildies, to buy a mount.....at lvl 47 -.-
---

On another note, i had a huge crush on her as a kid lol
---
This hype train has no brakes
---
Why wouldn't they have the same issues?
---
There is no solution. 
---
They deal with it as it comes.
---
Don't buy gold and you wont ever be affected by it.
---
I'm no changes to 99,9% , but my enjoyment of the game does not hinge solely on graphics so I will probably up the graphics. I would be fine with the original too.
---
No new models and animations though, ew. Glad they went with the original. Would've been an absolute deal breaker.
---
very well made. Nice touch with the warrior getting dazed.
---
Then you should be good. I did import an old export I made from retail and it works.
---
But then I spent the weekend testing other addons and on Sunday redoing my profile and exporting it for safe keeping.
---
LF39M BWL - full on hunters.
---
Except the roll on the side of the screen shows Bilbo won it.
---
I have no data to backup my claim, but hunters are better than people make them out to be. I played one on private servers and I was competitive dps early on and in leveling dungeons. 
---
From what I hear they don’t scale well in later raids like a wand naxx when compared to mages, warriors and rogues.
---
Its 'champing at the bit' (I made the same mistake today in Discord, TIL!)
---
That does sound awesone
---
I've only ever played horde and was tossing around the idea of alliance...but it seems too foreign to me.
---
If you'll have me I'd join your guild. I dont know how available for raiding I'll be, because of the kids and wife and work and dogs and home renovations but it would be nice to have a group to talk to since I have no idea whether anyone from the guild I raided with in LK is playing.
---
What u dont have a phone?!?!?!?
---
Why would you need more than one?
---
For a moment I thought about The Den for Horde...
---
&gt; Nope. If the class is available in that zone, all classes from any race will have their class quests available. Only exception to this is the priest racials.
---
Incorrect. I could not get human pally lvl 12 quest in IF, and my dwarf pally friend could not do the SW one.
---
Some are eligible for anyone, (lvl 2 imp for example) but others are not.
---
If I was playing solo, I'd go a lot faster.
---
But I'll be leveling with my g/f, who hasn't played since early MoP, and also with my 77 year old father, who has never played before but has always expressed an interest in giving it a go. So it'll be a slower pace for sure.  :)

---
Oh shit. Well all you guys and girls enjoy reliving past memories!!!
---
There is a debate amongst the devs if your "+healing" stat should effect the HoT portion of Regrowth. In pServers your "+healing" affected both the main heal, and the HoT that followed. 
---
 The reason this is a debate is because Regrowth isn't a spell we (droods) use often, so even myself as  resto raid healer in retail vanilla can't remember if it's one way or the other.
---
Yes it does
---
did you forget to use your brain about drop off?
---
Because he has upper arm and shoulder pain with computer usage. He's surely not the only person in the world with this problem who is/would be excited for this game if it weren't for health issues. I hope he finds a method of playing that works for him. We all just want to live our lives in Azeroth.
---
What in the Willy Wonka was that

And those guys will be doing guild raids i suspect, not open world pvp for the most part.

I mean the stress test was like 4 days long during weekdays &amp; weekend and setting up addons only takes a couple of hours. And now he wants to use that same time after the stress test is over. Sounds like he already had a sub so it doesn’t really make sense.
---
That's rude to say
---
No, but it’s certainly BIS for warrior tanks.
---
Same, I have learned my lesson from when I was a child.
---
Hey, when you get a throwing axe kill in PvP at max level it is a damn good feeling. One time I was lucky enough to get a mage on the run after he had blown all his cd’s. I was left in a frost nova and had no abilities up to get me out. Throwing axe to the back of that Gnome’s Head was a great moment.

I'm playing on a private server to re-familiarize myself with the game and I get spammed about every 5 min to buy gold for classic.

Actual claim in some thread here: "Naxx was only hard because players were bad", directly translates to "I'd be the absolute top player in Nihilum by a large margin". It's just an arrogant and asinine claim.

Why not Mograine?

100% recommend so so much. I leveled my void elf with it and it was so enjoyable watching my character actually talk to NPCs
---
I wanted one of the Alliance flags, the large ones. I thought 400 would be enough. It stayed under budget all week until thr last hour where all of them jumped up to 800+ dollars. Im upset I couldnt get my flag but..couldnt justify that much on it. It all looks great :D
---
Well, most serious guilds will require you to raid it every reset to farm enchants, wether it gives dkp or not doesn't alter the fact that it's one more obligation. Not to mention clearing zg twice takes almost as long total time as clearing mc + bwl in one go with all the additional travel, invites and what not.

---
Its the better render than the classic login screen, take it or leave it
---
classic graphics are defaulted when you're 3/10 on the scale in the video settings. If you can manage 10/10, it should look as good as Legion at its best.
---
I like what they did too.  I'm not a fan of changing all of the models though.  They have a certain style to them that got lost with the update.  
---
The new water looks kinda weird though.  The terrain in some lakes/pools is very angular/boxy so now having a nearly opaque shimmering layer really accentuates those corners and makes it look a bit unnatural.  That's not for all areas of the game though, just for those pools with hard corners.
---
Awesome,  saving this!
---
Upvote!!
---
I do think it was added in then. Prior to that people would bring their goods to that tunnel to sell. Those were bad times for poor old Sgt Slate.
---
omg frickin blueleaf tubers. Even when I remember to get all the crap sometimes I decide halfway through the run I want the bagspace more. I dont think the reward is anything worth it if I remember
---
This is just a thing that people hear people say and people like to repeat it.... Warrior is an excellent class in PvP, you'll just be sitting in roots a little bit more maybe :P
---
and regardless you should be running into healers constantly in battlegrounds/out in the world. Make more friends :)
---
This would work well in tandem with the Leveling Guide Navak and I just published: https://classicwow.live/leveling
---
How is your opinion a fact?
---
OH please.... there will be a huge rush, those that never endured classic will die because they actually suck so bad... and those that did endure it will walk through it like its cake since we won't have EONS of lag.  
---
soooo... yeah.  I can't wait.
---
Make SURE!! to voice your layering worries. Even if theyve said phase 2 and we might believe them.. make sure we're not gonna forget or have eased up on it and wont. 
---
Apart from that.. this is awesome! Prepare your questions :D
---
if you are going to take your time and read and enjoy the quests I recommend the addon Immersion
---
+5 weapon skill is OP, and Rep is great
---
- only need 3% hit from gear
---
- 25% more damage from glancing blows
---
Both most likely

Good idea. I'm kinda in the same boat as him. I will mostly just be limited in the hours a day i can play, but maybe having another method of input while doing the mindless part would be beneficial

Stalagg is a new option for East Coast now.

No, if you're doing this, you should prioritize your first 12 points in:

---
T2: Toughness 3/5, Imp Bloodrage 2/2

T3: Last Stand 1/1, Imp Shield Block 1/3

I support this statement.
---
I don’t know if your opinion is ‘unpopular’, but I really think it could go in a completely opposite direction. I think that the whole Twitch hype train could bring a lot of new people to the community if Classic becomes a top 3 streamed game like it was the case with Apex/Pubg/Fornite/Autochess. Because these mentioned newer titles are shallow and requires no real time investment, I think that a fraction of younger people coming to wow will find it interesting and different. If you first get immersed into the universe there are tons of hours in the game and subs could run for 6-12 month - even longer depending on the expansions.

Ret pal or cat druid. Moonkin is under-rated but is pretty rough in pve, ok in pvp though. Might add enhance too.
---
I thought that was already a modern WoW server.
---
They clearly did that on purpose - they don't want people just making characters on that server for name res unless they want to get away from the previous servers queue.
---
it is similar to jagermeister
---
Yes, Kungen was an absolute shit player. Sure. Easy claim to make when you were young child at the time, but if you were actually there to see the theorycrafting you couldn't make that claim. Tanks generated less threat in vanilla because private servers are incorrect and makes it too easy to generate threat.

If the game is more popular than they anticipate and people don't drop off as fast do you will want them to disable layering at the cost of long queues?

I played as NE back in the day for this reason. I was young at the time and my parents wouldn't take "I need to wait to get to somewhere safe first" as an answer when they wanted me to do something. Being able to pop shadow meld made it so much easier.

---
It isnt necessary as in its the only option. The other option is queues and offer other new realms to transfer to. This option is also a hassle, BUT it doesnt not STRONGLY interfere with the gameplay quality and go against the massive majority of the playerbase who dont want layering.
---
Idk I just cant understand how people could ever want layering over migrating server or sitting in a queue when content like dragons or stuff comes out. Classic gameplay would be directly fucking ruined by layering for dragons or AQ event or whatever. The Blizz leads have said so themselves publically.
---
So no.. it isnt necessary past a certain point. Thats where you introduce the other options even if theyre also a hassle, but to a degree where it doesnt fuck with the actual game and product we all asked for and have waited for.

Voting with a wallet would be absolutly mute here. If theyd keep layering for longer it would simply ruin the content patch and I wouldnt get to enjoy it. Saying "I dislike this so Im not gonna pay for it, hope you learn!" isnt gonna be effective since the mistake is done and I cant relive it unless they RE-RELEASE classic without layering?? Thats not gonna happen.
---
You dont need 40 people and 95% of your raid doesnt need special gear.
---
A month lol?  Overturned MCs are cleared in 9 to 10 days on pservers.

Thex didn't get Thex. Some guy named Thex got Thex on Herod and gave it to Thex because we all fucking LOVE [Thex](/u/literallyablackbear)
---
Diablo Immortal was even more disappointing.  It was a reminder that Blizzard's shot-callers are WAY out of touch with their core fanbase and they need to quit listening to their bean counters who love microtransactions so damn much.
---
Damn, Faerlina will be so aids, poor souls that roll there that don't know about all that stuff.
---
That's such a strange sentiment to have.  Does no one replay video games they enjoyed before?  Does no on reread books or rewatch movies or relisten to songs?  It's all the same.  It's an experience.  If you enjoyed the experience once you're probably going to enjoy it again and it's really strange to see people totally dismissing playing an older video game again.
---
dude yer gettin a Dell
---
Look man... We are talking WoW Classic.  The 2004 version of me, when it was okay to say that... just came out.  I'm not retarded.  Current version of me would never say retarded.
---
They’ve already shown they’ll make realms as needed to make sure Layering can be removed in Phase 2. If you refuse to take the transfer and avoid queues, then it’s not on Blizzard, it’s on you.
---
One thing that came crashing back to me during the stress test was how much I had always enjoyed reading the books you can find around the world, especially in SM library. I'm looking forward to reading them all as I pass, along with every quest.

Stop hyping me up man. YOU'RE KILLING ME!
---
there is no Orgrimmar layer. It goes by server only.
---
Where do you change these settings?
---
Ret wrecks in PvP but pve is different
---
Yeah, good fucking luck convincing a hunter to do this. It’s a game, not a job.
---
Holy shit, a fellow horde from Burning Legion!  I remember OG and The Princess Collection.  I always envied the people in high end guilds.  (I was also like 12 with a shit computer)
---
I’ve got a friend who’s an incredibly skilled Frost mage ever since original classic. He’s rolling Alliance side on a PVP server.
---
Basically I want to play something that will compliment his mage and perhaps my other friend who’s maybe going rogue if he ends up playing.
---
What’s got me nervous though is rolling a class that’s potentially “roguebait” out in the open world. Not really keen on being an instakill or camped for hours.
---
One route I thought about taking was Night Elf Hunter with Herbalism/Alchemy, so that I could abuse Feign Death, with Invisibility Potions and Shadowmeld. I’m not sure how viable that is though.
---
Another thought was playing a Restoration Druid as a healer that can also stealth, while also being as annoying as possible in PVP with bear stuns and Moonfire/Insect Swarm spam.
---
There is of course the “If you can’t beat them, join them” approach or rolling a rogue myself. 
---
Finally, I’ve also considered Warrior and Holy Pally just for their sheer tankiness in the hopes that would discourage Rogues from making me their primary target in the first place on the account of being hard to kill.
---
I also heard somewhere that Soul Link Warlocks are also super tanky and able to survive a Rogue opener.
---
Any feedback or suggestions one way or another are greatly appreciated.
---
Every class has consumes to farm for raids. Farming a few pummelers takes like an hour or two each week.
---
Do you have to buy a copy of the game, or will a subscription alone let me play Classic when it releases?
---
We can dream
---
Not one OP?????????????????
---
The broken tooth race will be real :(
---
Im on EU servers unfortunately I cant get tuesday off but I should have wednesday - friday so... late 20s perhaps 30?
---
This isn't retail, you gonna be whacking shit with your staff just to save that precious mana. My staff skill was always maxed out in vanilla.
---
Now swords and daggers, that is gonna be a pain to level. You gonna find one of those dope ass mage daggers or swords at like level 50 or something and more likely your skill is gonna be at 1 or some shit.
---
Dude do a simple search before posting
---
They already have given as much as they can. Theyve said theyre definitely open to TBC for example but it all depends on if the demand is there. So basically, classics success will determine it 100% since money is the motive. 
---
As for how good TBC was.. thats a subjective convo.
---
I'm rolling on Stalagg. Don't want any drama.
---
oké
---
Everyone is gonna pick the Mohawk :( its the best but the most common
---
Watch out buddy, I have your username, you don’t want me to hack you, do you ? Just be careful, friend.
---
Rogue stun warrior smash.
---
Small fraction of players carry enough to worry about that.
---
An accurate display would allow anyone to be swayed by a number that isn't persistent or permanent.
---
Going from duskwood to STV be like:  
---
instant/instant  
---
crippling/mind numbing
---
Yeah, but 4 days is nothing, especially if you're busy irl.
---
As an example, I work from 3pm to 230am every weekday, meaning I get home at 3 and sleep by 4. Wake up at noon, get ready, use the 2 hours left for housework and errands.
---
It's easy to be critical of someone else's perspective, but it isn't helpful. Everyone has different amounts of free time, from nearly 0 to having no obligations to speak of.
---
Tl;dr you may have "a few hours" to set up addons, but for a lot of us that's more time than we have to play regularly.
---
I think two months of phase one is very plausible.  I'm banking on 3-4 months of phase 2, putting BWL at 6 months after launch.
---
Hard numbers for current server pops would be really nice to hear.
---
Kids to bed at 7 and we're usually done general chores by 730ish. From there we spend at least an hour together from 730-830. She usually goes to bed at 9 as she wakes up earlier than me, and I'll stay up til 11 playing videogames or doing other "me" activities. Weekends are almost always fully dedicated to family time, and I stay up later on Friday/Saturday to get some more "me" time after the wife goes to bed. So all in all I can easily squeeze in 2 hours of videogames each weekday and 2-4 hours on the weekends if I dedicate all my free time to it.  
---
Balancing life post marriage and kids is hard at first, but you adjust
---
If you have a mage and a rogue, the obvious answer is to play a priest. Strong in their own right, and RMP is crazy good.
---
That's a whole conversation...
---
You don't need to be "crit immune" via 440 +defense skill, if that's what you mean. The more +defense you have the better, but 5 points for 10 defense is an extremely inefficient use of talents and not worth it unless you're the MT walking into MC for the first time, in blue gear. Also you will not have anywhere near 440 defense until you're walking around in full T2-3 gear so don't worry about this until then.
---
The more effective way to be "crit immune" early on is to use shield block as much as possible. Blocking attacks naturally prevents crits, and with Imp Shield Block 1/3 you get 2 block charges every time you hit block.
---
Not to mention, Imp Bloodrage and Last Stand are awesome talents for tanking. And Toughness is generally better than Anticipaion per point. 2% armor scales with gear, consumes, buffs, etc. which increases your armor based damage reduction percentage.
---

Considering they said they wanted to re-acquire them when they announced Classic there must've been something of value on them.

I have to move apartments in the next few days. That combined with setting everything up for Classic launch has more than covered the prelaunch obsession. I recommend.

There's a higher chance of getting Thunderfury for casual guilds than there is of becoming Scarab Lord.

Are you rolling solo if you dont end up playing with them? Friends are what make the game fun imo, wouldn't play this game without friends or a guild.

If you play alliance lock it will be even easier.

Happens all the time on RP servers. There is still a HUGE community in modern wow, just need to go to Rp realms.

each server already has its own sub reddit and discord, and that info is being shared in them, specific to each server.

If you are so worried just make character on Shazzrah.

I bought a 6 month sub on the 9th!
---
I can't decide between hunter, shaman, warrior, warlock, mage, rouge, paladin, or druid? They all look so good and I can't pick! Which one is overpopulated?
---
Those results are from way before the spanish guild council announced they would be rolling on Shazzrah.
---
It is now updated :)
---
Two moniters. Naga mouse.
---
Whenever Id like with my wife. Easy peasy.
---
You get that in addition to the Druid talent furor then time the shift right before the energy tick. It basically turns each shift into 80 energy (20 helm + 40 furor + 20 energy tick)which is the core of feral dps using  ‘power shifting’.  Using that mechanic feral dps becomes limited to mana instead of natural energy regeneration.
---
 Absolutely, I like the more simple look. At first glance you can fell who is how far in current content and which class he is playing. And they all fit to the world, more or less. 
---
Also in Vanilla you still felt like an experienced adventurer, in Modern everyone is this insane buff armored Superhero that rides insane warbeasts and can beat 6+enemies at the time, even while you are just leveling a twink.
---
Let's all pray that D4's reveal is something special and mindblowing.  There *should* be an announcement at Blizzcon in a few months.
---
After last year's Diablo Immortal fiasco, they need to show their fans something special to go crazy over.
---
If that is the case then OmniCC would be a nice addon to have, thanks for the tip
---
OK retard
---
They won't. They will have a policy of no answers about Classic+ or TBC for now beyond what they've already said. And you're just setting yourself up for disappointment if you expect anything but Classic:TBC, it's by far the most likely option. The next most likely is TBC and also some Classic+ development.
---
Honestly this is so true, I'm one of the few people here who still play retail, however I'm not even logging into BfA anymore that much these days. Seriously, I login, check world quests, then realize I have all of my reps on exalted, so I don't need to do world quests for little bit of that shitty azerite, then try to get into some M+ groups where even with my 1k score it takes so long to get into the one as DK, then raids where as PUG raider I can't get into one because I'm 6/8 HC and I don't have a curve yet. And then I logout instead of wasting my time there, realizing I can't wait for Classic.
---
What I found to help is just play a completely different genre, like for example I got back into Dead by Daylight after like two years of not playing it and I'm having fun, at least killing the time somehow until Classic.
---
Moonwarden.
---
I sense alterior motives
---
You just fap between leveling sessions. It’s no big deal.
---
I got to max lvl without any addons back in the day. But dmg meter addon/enemy castbar/enemy hp addon.
---
What is this Naga mouse stuff about?

You mean Thrall?
---
I have an exercise bike and my PC hooked up to my TV. Play with wireless keyboard and mouse.
---
I was laughing so hard at the dismount.

I have a windows pc so windows is always open while I play! Not sure how that helps my health though
---
What's so great about vanilla wow?
---
&gt; It's not hard to find a partner to grind with
---
In dessolace? It might be. That place is seriously unpopular for alliance.
---
Seems like every game has a toxic community, ever played Mordhau?
---
NOW THIS
---
Yeah atm questies tracker isn't in the classic version and you have to use the default tracker. I use monkey quest: https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24930-MonkeyQuestClassicDaMaGepyedition.html
---
which has a tracker that supports all quests and as many as you want.
---
I feel like this is exactly the opposite. Years of playing horde and horde is always full of heroes wanting to SMASH people in the middl, whereas alliance seems so organized
---
fur children, the best breed of children
---
Thanks for your response, i think questie has potential to be a great addon in Classic, like on pservers. I prefer this over any other leveling addon, looking forward to the next updates for sure!
---
The LOTR segment kindled the adventurous awe of a big, grand world in me. Missing the Zeppelin filled me with stress and frustration.
---
Why the heck would they need your username? They just need your toon name to give you the gold. Or you do it via auction house, you list a few overpriced greens and they buy them out for you.
---
You just dealt with scammy people. Don't give your username out.
---
Please read my comment more carefully. What I'm saying is essentially that I think Blizzard is wrong, and that I don't think people will be quitting as fast as they believe. I'm not agreeing with Blizzard at all
---
Loved the element of fear there. Also found what would be my future guild leader there and a long and fun time raiding with that guild. Stv is great. It’s one of the most alive zones you can find. Don’t hate it, relish it.
---
You've looked into Google Forms, right?
---
What region is this?
---
Correct, but the truth is it doesn’t realllllllyyyy matter.  Only bad PVE healers use regrowth. As the only time I use regrowth this is when I have unlimited mana from the 2nd boss in BWL. The rest of the time it’s all rejuv and HT.
---
Edit: It’s more of a PVP healer issue.
---
You can always find people who are up for dueling but obviously there won't be much if any organized arena fighting. 
---
There is of course the Gurabashi Arena but that's more like a last man standing free-for-all and you'd get tired of it eventually.
---
When you meet opposite faction out questing it will often be spontaneous 1v1s or 2v2s so maybe that would be your thing.
---
I think there are different reasons to be excited. I'm legit hyped as I ever was for new content just to be going back to the OG Azeroth... then again, I never really did the private server thing (outside insta-60 to get my BG on). Plus, I really didn't level alts that hardcore back in vanilla. So leveling is gonna be fresh as it can be, for me. I haven't really leveled in vanilla since 2005 or so.
---
I only roll in STV when I have backup and overwhelming numbers.
---
Super biased.  TBH I prefer the convenience of group finder for group quests.  What I don't want to do is wait 30 minutes to form a group to kill an elite while waiting for people to travel to me, etc.
---
Time sinks in games are actually really bad and this is just one example of a time sink that people ignorantly praise despite the fact that its actually just psuedo increasing your play time while you waste time waiting.
---
Think waiting in queue as a dps for 30 mins to run a dungeon is bad?  Wait until you have to spend an hour forming a group and then another 30 minutes traveling to the dungeon.  1.5 hours of your daily playtime just to GET to a dungeon.
---
Community is cool and all, but not at the cost of wasting a huge amount of play time.
---
also the ability to scale it would be nice
---
The ambulance is for me if I try to follow your suggested regimen. lol
---
4 or 5. It was patch 1.11
---
I've never been at a midnight release, but I feel really nostalgic thinking about those times I'd been saving for months to buy a game and was reading the game manual in the car on the way home.

See if you can give deposition remotely over the phone with a court reporter present.  That's what I do.

How do you do this?
---
just dont stream lol
---
Imo hit 5 get a wand, get IF as HS, then do the entire lowlvl Nelf place without training. You will still get rep as long as the quests aren't grey so just start with the lowlvl ones. Then when you are done HS back to train at lvl12, then fly and sail to darkshore. Here you should train again at lvl 16. At 16 you will have to mix in some other zones to get past exp req. then back to darkshore at around 18.

All this Euro talk of banding languages together into servers, makes me glad that I speak both of the prevailing languages in North America.
---
Don’t feel bad, many people will swap from Shazz  on the 27th after hours of queue to login. It will fill up very quickly. 
---
And it’s not like Shazz is currently a big pile of s**** seeing the community on discord gathering kids retails and trolls.
---
Awesome post
---
That's a really tricky question to answer because a lot of it boiled down to a couple of key issues. One being your group/raid composition. Some dungeons and raids did better if there were certain key classes present. They'd also go smoother with people who know their class inside/out and don't putz around. Generally ubrs and lbrs will take an hour to two hours depending on group comp/player skill and how many damn times people have to /afk real quick for bathroom breaks lol.
---
For raids at first you're looking at a lot of wiping, especially if part of the raid have gear, while others haven't worked on theirs enough. There will also likely be people who've never struggled with how the hell to deal with the adds in MC or whatever because they started playing later and just basically solo'd the zone at lvl 80 etc.
---
The alternative is merging hundreds of servers. This is reality. There is no perfect answer, and pointing that there is no perfect answer over and over (Again you are assuming a huge if and then just leaving it blank, what is your point? Please?)  
---
What do you want? Hundreds of servers to be constantly culled down? dozens of hours of Queue times? Or layering? Pick one. You have to pick one, and complaining changes. Absolutely. Nothing.
---
&gt; Does anyone else miss going and getting in line to get your game at midnight??

How long can you usually play while on the bike?

Any chance you can give an idea of what these do?  I'm assuming farclip is view distance but I thought that was already it's own option?
---
Weather density causes what differences?
---
Violence level causes what differences?
---
Edit: Just saw this was answered in another reply.
---
or at least the number of layers filled with people when it says "full", "high" etc
---
Global launch, 27th in some parts 26th in US
---
Unfortunately in classic PvP isn't fleshed out. If you want to stand a chance in PvP you have to gear up in PvE or you'll just get wasted by hardcore raiders who one shot crit you.
---
You may be able to keep up if you PvP early and keep your PvP rank but once later raids come out the difference in ilvl will just be too great and you'll be at a disadvantage.
---
That's why I love Blizzard.
---
There isn’t much incentive to reachinf 60 instantly unless you have a group doing it with you or you are PVP thirsty. They have progression so why rush when everything isn’t available?
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who instant thought Sylvester Stalagg
---
Yikes if this is what the community on herod is going to look like I'll stick with any of the others lmao.
---
Trackball and Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard. The only way.
---
If you like duels they were at their height in vanilla, the neutral cities and arenas put a huge dent in the front gate duel scene.
---
Moving from Shazz toxic kid community on discord
---
A true sign that it really is the best mouse of its time: I'll be using the MX518 that I first bought in 2006 and used it for hundreds of hours of WoW. I wonder if the mouse will have nostalgia too.
---
I don't think it's going anywhere either. My bet is on fundamental shifts in development philosophy. If that takes place I entirely see your point coming to fruition.
---
30 years old myself and am also incredibly boring.  Classic Wow has been the high note for me this entire summer.
---
Is there something wrong with us?
---
&gt; And get off your #nochanges bro  
---
Nah, fuck all that.  No fucking changes.  Changes made retail into retail.  That's where the changes can fucking go.  
---
&gt; or else laying wouldn't exist  
---
Yea that sucks too.  But the biggest change of all is including it in another subscription instead of making it its own, and stupid layering is some attempt to manage that.  It's well intentioned, and also crap.  Unlike models, which is maliciously intended to destroy vanilla.  
---
And yes, the old undead models are far superior.  You know that one with the bands crossing the eyes?  Well, on classic, they actually cross the eyes.  They fucked that up on live.  They fucked everything up on live.
---
There is an add on that does scrolling text as the default when interacting with NPCs. Tried it on the beta and holy crap, it was super easy to read all the quest text, so much cool stuff I never bothered to learn.
---
Wait for another 11 days and enjoy your 40000+ people queues.
---
I had unicum once on a holiday in Budapest, and I can say with 100% confidence it's the best thing that's come out of Hungary since goulash
---
Keep a retail toon for your arena fun and try out world pvp in classic when it comes out. If you pick up engineering with some decent gear you can pull off some nasty 1v2/1v3 scenarios that are equally rewarding in the open world :)
---
You get random gems as a reward, and the only consistently valuable possibilities are Iridescent Pearls, but you will probably only get Malachites...
---
Yeah I always love that tbh. Running into people and killing them haha. I was pretty new to wow I play mop and the bfa. So vanilla is totally new to me but I'm really keen on the grind and stuff too
---
Cool. Drive safe.
---
Agreed!
---
&gt; Especially people that play in poorly ventilated places like basements need to consider this. 
---
im laughing my ass off right now
---
They specifically had an "IT department". And they are probably not using toasters as switches.
---
I was hoping when he tried to train, he wouldn't have the 10 silver required and would have to vendor his armor or something lol
---
I haven’t played consistently since MoP and I plan to get back on Classic.  Where’s the most reliable safe place to get addons these days?
---
Hello from a fellow Hungarian living in the US! 
---
Élyen a Magyar!! 💪
---
&gt;switching specs
---
honestly I think switching specs is a nice QoL thing to have in game. Doesn't really take anything away from the social aspect of the game, being able to go tank a dungeon without visiting the trainer twice and paying what after a few times amounts to a king's ransom.
---
Nice, I'm gonna check this out.
---
juddyy (richturpin) is a better player than any of the streamers in this video and it's not even close, but nice try.
---
https:// discord. gg/ TGCdPJ
---
I just hope they'll do TBC by making another client, setting up more servers and letting us copy L58+ characters from Classic.
---
Mr T is a Night Elf Mohawk. Now all my Night Elves are Sasseh!
---
Should they troll by makin it a pve server? Nah, Rp-PVP.
---
Try to avoid picking Paladin and Warrior as solo leveling is considerably more difficult with them. Hunters, mages, warlocks, and Rogue are all good first timer choices. Good luck mate!
---
I’m a lefty. But since keyboard keybinds are designed for a mouse in the right hand, I’m thinking I’ll force myself to go righty. Idk....
---
I personally enjoyed it along with WotLK. I'm not sure I'd want to play again though. Classic is one thing but feels a little meh to relive expansions. Not to mention, then what? Classic is once again a thing of the past?
---
Probably because RP servers are notoriously behind in pushing content.
---
Vishas rp-pvp
---
I doubt u will have shoulders by the time i log in.
---
S dead, It’s time for the fat loot
---
That's what I meant. DPS is the same regardless of attack speed.
---
... You mean the api?
---
Ask them if they can raid as a ret paladin
---
I like the idea of a PvP realm.  But don't intend on raiding in Classic until PUG speed running meta forms, I enjoy retail raiding/M+ too much.
---
So by the time I hit 60 (8-12 months probably) and get my dungeon gear people will be running around in raid gear stomping the shit out of everyone else.
---
Still remember back before Burning Crusade, Naxx raiders would show up and start 1v3 fights and just ruin all the fun of BG's and open world PvP.  I don't want to experience that again.
---
Never played vanilla but..  over the past stress test levelling a rogue. Got a real nice sword from a chest I think. I go to train swords in Stormwind. Costs 10s so a fair bit of my money, I think I was around level 13 or so. Go to equip it but I cant. Check the item. It's a two handed sword.
---
I'm one of those people who never dealt with MC, started in early TBC. But i guess/hope there are enough guides to get a basic understanding for the raids so i don't drag my group down :D
---
!RemindMe 11 Days
---
11 days for NA
---
Gives me a reason to grind I guess. I still enjoy pve if it's hard y'know? Like most pve shit is boring as fuck now because none of it is too hard. Mythic + was always fun because it was challenging, as long as it's challenging content I'll enjoy
---
I cant wait any longer I'm freaking out
---
This is legitimately 100% accurate to how it happened.

Blizzard Entertainment still exists tho. Activision Blizzard is the name of the holding company in which Blizzard Entertainment and Activision Publishing are subsidiaries.

I'm a WoW noob myself too and honestly really excited to play Classic! I've thinking hard about which faction/race/class to pick and at the moment I'm pretty sure I'll go with a gnome warlock. (or maybe human...)

Sweet
---
I mean if you want to turn in a shit ton of runeoth sure wait til 60. You can greatly reduce the amount of turn ins required by questing for darnassus rep while leveling.
---
I can't believe how much different artwork is in this game.. and its all so beautiful.. my god
---
But I was told Activision wants Classic to fail? REEEE
---
YOU LIKE THAT YOU FUCKING RETARD!?
---
The whole point of theorycrafting (for me) is to discover new ways to optimize. If we told feral druids "just hit shit" we never would have discovered the MCP.
---
To make it less detailed: use a 2 hander until they have lower hp, then swap to a 1 hander.
---
New weapon type takes an hour of smacking gray npcs to level up.
---
I always read quest text anyway
---
Oh, very cool.  I'll have to find a tutorial.
---
Thanks! You as well.
---
How is your discussion a PSA then?
---
I think the race stuff is a little bit overblown. You’re going to be looking at your character the whole game; the hit box making a difference would probably be in a very small subset of your game time. Do what you like!
---
Making a Hunter first is also probably better because it levels faster/farms gold easier, so you can boost your shaman’s leveling experience
---
Ya regrowths coefficient is already bad considering its mana cost and the duration of the hot
---
Time to use those photoshop skills to fake a jury selection notice.
---
Yeah, that could've been worded better.
---
The charms might be a bit of a pain to get.
---
Lame well maybe fair but, still lame. Hopefully well be able to pick up 3 more warriors easy then lol. Drop WF totem and just wail BURN FOR YOUR SINS!!!
---
Show yourselves cowards. SHOW YOURSELVES!!!!
---
You known all the quest texts are online. You can read them whenever you want...
---
Yeah 15 years ago i was 15 and most games with quest had trackers so WoW was really something new for me. i barely completed quest because i didn't knew jacksh!t hehe.
---
Yep this is actually what I was referring to when I mention the math, but I don't think they try a weapon swap, right?
---
Leveling through dungeons is viable at later levels 30+  because elite exp in classic is 2.25% as opposed to the 2% in vanilla.  It's faster to quest to 30-35 then start dung farming.
---
I see these things more of circular -&gt; undead rogue kills alliance warlock -&gt; dwarf warrior owns undead rogue -&gt; elemental shaman owns dwarf warrior -&gt; paladin does well against shaman, etc.
---
And a damn good thing it is
---
I'm making a warrior as my alt so I can get this shit done at 30 and let the good times roll in wpvp.
---
I just thought it sounded cooler that way :D
---
WA is EXTREMELY useful for tracking crit procs and the like
---
Sure, except I was leveling with a casting weapon which have lower dps and praying for WF procs. This is the first month of release.
---
If i own regular current wow, do I get to play classic for free? Also is thotbot coming back?
---
The only questing add on that I personally care about is one that shows me where all the quests are because I'm a completionist
---
Invade French servers?
---
( I am very very sorry.)
---
You’re not guaranteed a crowd pummeler every time you run it. And you’re going to need quite a few each raid since it’s charge based.
---
While someone like me who plays a Rogue can just log at raid time without much preparation and still do comparable if not MORE dps.
---
You right tho
---
Unfortunately paladins are broken af. But I'm all for the horde. Loktar ogar
---
Definitely need more people. I'd say a group of 5 with two healers would be safe. And it will take you a while travelling everywhere to rush it. If your aim is to get 60 it will just slow you down.
---
1080ti, 8800k, 32gb, SSDs everywhere.
---
Don't know what the ceiling is since I limit my FPS with Riva to 141 to allow GSync to kick in. Never bothered to turn it off since going over refresh cap turns GSync off.
---
I thought we were all going to be “sick” on launch?
---
You heard incorrectly. In PvP, elemental Shaman can be incredibly bursty.
---
Lightning Bolt, followed up by an instant cast Chain Lightning and Shock could chunk people for huge amounts of health with the right gear.
---
They could also offheal in a support capacity and supply stuff like Windfury Totem.
---
Yes, not Public Service Announcement of My Opinion.

Well it’s one change that I don’t think is necessarily a bad thing. It’s basically impossible to stop illegal gold selling. If that’s the case you might as well “legalise” it by making it a part of the game, so that people can buy it safely. 
---
(Just to clarify, people first buy a token with money which they can then sell in-game for gold, so Blizzard don’t lose revenue because of this)
---
In saying that I wouldn’t particularly be happy about it being in Classic. But in retail I guess it’s a good way to allow new players to catch up and not be super behind everyone else. 
---
It’s the same as how it has worked in Eve Online for years and it worked very well in that game.
---
Still got to run to different major cities to collect them all though -- like if you spaced it or something, it's just annoying.  Just giving examples of things that as aesthetic of classic.
---
Yeah, I agree that those aspects were better too. However, the "feel" of the game was just completely different. It was also a complete bummer to have a character that you poured your heart+soul into just basically turned to crap with the expansion. I thought the flying mounts were ridiculous. I just thought the environment/feel of the game completely changed. The world got much larger but it actually felt much smaller to me.
---
They always have been.
---
Current WoW is basically a different game from the 2006 version. They removed alot of elements from the game that made it engaging and added new ones that alot of people didn't like.
---
!Remind me 12 days
---
I still have my original manual from 2005. I used to read it on the toilet back when I first played and I remember how cool it was to read that there were “more powerful weapons rumored to exist...” or something along that line. It was so mysterious and enticing. 
---
I also remember reading the class info for Rogues and thinking...this is the most useless class I think..? Turns out that Rogues were one of the most powerful classes in the game by a large margin haha
---
They forgot the part where the boar becomes stronger with every one attacking him

Good luck ^(trying to log) ^(in) to you.

Mage/Mage is what my brother and I are going for. Lots of control and damage.

Amazing.

You shouldn't have an issue. I believe most warlocks will roll horde due to orc and undead racial. You definitely won't have trouble especially if you plan on rolling alliance like me. Gnomes FTW!
---
Is Twitter mods going to have a section for classic?
---
if you and them are good enough
---
Kettlebell swings are the peak of general fitness exercise.
---
If you’re on such a tight budget, don’t buy new.
---
Very interesting point of view. Upvoted for the refreshing view on things :D
---
I played classic and I'm not looking for anything. I'm 38 now; I have no time for games. I came here from /r/all. I'm just saying that this new classic wow thing they have going on won't really be the same as 2004 wow. Even though they are reverting a ton of the handholding QoL changes they have made over the years, much of it will still exist because of advanced addons that didn't exist 15 years ago. You think threat meters existed? Nope. Quest helpers? Nope. And even the stuff that was there has gotten so much better.
---
I’ve been neck deep in Fire Emblem for a while now so thankfully I have that but yeah man. Nothing is scratching that itch.
---
Church
---
Im pretty sure servers have tried this and it just pisses people off. Late to the party and want to play WoW with your friends? Too bad.
---
Love a good Harry Potter meme.
---
Same here, and I've heard the same thing quite often. Classic/TBC/Wrath era especially (Wrath less so once dungeon finder came in but still to an extent) forced social interaction on kids who otherwise didn't get any in their lives. It helped a lot of people come out of their shells and form positive relations with people.
---
I think people who let the game be a destructive force in their lives were basically destined to find SOMETHING to be that destructive force. That's just kinda how it works for self destructive behavior.
---
I personally gained so many long term friends, although I've lost touch with a lot of them since I stopped playing WoW mostly mid cata, from WoW and can still just pop directly back into those friendships as you would with any irl good friend. The first friends I made in WoW were on the Menethil harbor boat while I was leveling. Snuffy and Cornelius saw me eat, wait, then drink, and clued me in you could do that at the same time, and played together for like a couple years constantly hanging out from there on lol. Community makes the game.
---
Damn this meme really hit you hard lol
---

---
Thats hard to do. I made a character on 3 different server but have no intention of playing on all 3 servers. And how many people didnt make a character because they dont care about a specific character name but still plan on playing day 1
---
&gt;Faerlina -&gt; Anal Fire
---
Yep this. I’d be totally cool with new models in Classic, but IF and only IF said new models carried over the look and feel of the originals (yes, even the wonky faces). The only remastered classic race models this is true for presently are dwarves and orcs.
---
Until then, yeah my human might not have individually articulated fingers, but at least his beard doesn’t have a weird pineapple-goku spiky thing going on.
---
I guess that's an option. Something I'd likely have done earlier, but not at my age. I'm an old dude and quasi responsible now.
---
Can Tauren use their racial stomp while shapeshifted?
---
See you on the battle field.
---
Hang out in Gadgetzan in the arena there and kill anyone who enters it.
---
If you’re rolling hunter I wish you the best of luck man. I can’t imagine that brokentooth camp lol
---
It’s the idea of escaping reality and living inside fantasy.
---
Hey man I’m not saying it’s dumb just very very very specific. You even summed it yourself in one question, that’s my point. You do you brother just drop WF for my warrior plox.
---
Keep in mind people will remember you in Classic - if you had a good group run your isn't uncommon to add everyone to the friends list and group up down the road.
---
It also means you'll be remembered if you suck, though.
---
My advice for a new warlock is not to throw DoTs on everything during a dungeon run. You can throw corruption and maybe immolate on adds but generally it isn't worth throwing a bunch of DoTs on the main target. Shadowbolt is your main damage spell, remember that. Lots of leveling locks do ass damage because they're throwing 3-4 DoTs on everything while the rest of the dps is actually dealing damage during that time.

I will ask where they see classic wow 6 years from now...
---
I already know that i will forget the ama, if somebody will ask this would be cool.
---
What changes with the introduction of DM? Honestly curious.
---
Yes, mages are glass cannons, so if you don't like that kind of control-oriented playstyle then you'll have more fun with something else.  
---
Warlocks are also pretty squishy without gear. SL locks are very tanky and solid in 1v1 but again very gear depedent.  
---
\*IMO\* SPriest is a great option for players who don't have a lot of time to play. They're easy to play in PvP and they start off quite strong, even without gear. They don't have high sustain, which means drinking a lot, but BGs aren't until phase 3 anyway so it will be less noticeable in World PvP. You can still heal dungeons as Shadow, and you will probably be asked to unless the group has a healer already. For raids you will probably have to respec.
---
STV is the 'nam of WoW
---
Classic Pala was an Epic Goodtime, GL to all y'alls gonna experience it new, and the returnees. Me, I'm startin' Dr00d this time.
---
Hacking? They sure have.
---
This is well known.  That's why they revamped alliance racials at some point.
---
Other than what you're saying above -- horde gets cooldowns to boost damage.  Alliance gets... improved death.  Yes, horde is way better than alliance for pvp.
---
All good. I never stated when I took the picture, just when I made the sword!
---
Nope, not at all. Go play a private server. Type "Lightmope private vanilla" in google. GL ;)
---
Yeah, you say that until you're on a 70:30 server and you cant farm anywhere because there are two of them for every one of you.
---
No one gives a flying fuck about APES except members of APES. Stop trying to drum up notoriety for your shitty private server guild by embroiling them in controversial posts about server choice.
---
And if on the tiny chance you aren’t a member of APES, well... if you’re looking to suck dick that badly, just download Grindr. I’m sure you’ll even find plenty of APES members listed there.
---
Sounds dope. What would be best healer for little skirmishes holy priest or disc or h pala, I like doing a bit of dps too that's why I enjoyed disc in retail
---
I'm going to read quests; I'm in no particular rush to 60 since I barely know what to do at 60 anyway lol
---
Is APES an acronym or are you talking about like actual apes (gorillas, orangutangs, horde players, chimpanzees)
---
Wish you the very best with your endeavor! :) And I hope you have lots of fun in Classic!
---
you apperently haven't
---
Priest.
---
Lmao :D insulting and lying meme. Never heard of those before. Damn son, you need some humour in your life
---
Sweet thank you
---
This was awesome!
---
I wouldn’t, it makes no sense story wise.
---
But you can potentially rank faster on the lower side
---
Are there any threat addons working in classic yet? I tried one but couldn't get it to run.
---
Name reservations for two dear friends who were not able to participate :)
---
I'll be taking my time regardless, it's not like we can compete with streamers.
---
fuck, remember getting unarmed skill or like staves for warriors ... that sucked!!!
---
Push ups don't really aggravate the shoulder unless you have really strange form or a pre-existing condition. Unlike other pushing motions the free movement of the scapula actually helps protect the shoulders if anything.
---
Really if anyone has shoulder problems the first thing i suggest is push ups to build serratus strength and scapular stability which is what a lot of people lack when they're slumped over.
---
What guild?!
---
Did someone say...
---
I didn't follow the second link and it shows a more detailed list instead of pie charts for the results.  I'm on Whitemane and it's looking ~55% horde, so not that terrible, even though it's leaning more towards horde.
---
BUT YOU ACTUALLY DID ALL ALONG
---
What would be the point in that? Who plays to have an easy guaranteed win?
---
Learn to click, man. Save yourself some trouble.
---
Same especially as Alliance on a pvp server. It's no doubt Horde ratio will be 3 to 1 in STV
---
Just go get some gallbladder failure like me.  They are gonna remove it, I'm gonna sit at home recovering to to classic WoW.  
---
Happy face, and sad face.  Mixed emotions.
---
Coins are minted, not simply smelted or crafted. Minting is necessary for consistency, and the utility of coins being identical gives them value beyond the metal content.
---
Considering the high-medieval fantasy setting and equality between horde and alliance currency, it's safe to assume there is a neutral and respected third-party which mints the currency used by players, presumably the steamwheedle cartel has a minting operation somewhere heavily guarded. Although it would be strange in the modern era, private banks historically often issued their own private currency. Given the apparent monopoly enjoyed by the cartel on international trade, they would have a strong position to establish a widely-used currency allowing for significant seignorage through debasement.
---
You're actually a windfury totem bot for the dps warriors, and maybe some fear cleansing(tremor totem, i think).
---
You're worrying too much. Most guilds will have the same problems they always did: not enough people showing up. All raids are undertuned, though, so you never need a full 40 and/or perfect composition (except Naxx, which is literally the end of the game).
---
You'll get in to raids as any spec. You'll pull your weight as a hybrid class if you know your abilities and use them effectively instead of tunnel visioning on outperforming a pure class. All specs have value, people just didn't know shit during Vanilla to make things work.
---
You might be asked to heal because not enough healers show up; not because your spec is "trash". Vanilla doesn't really have enrage timers or many raid-wipe mechanics or even DPS races (yeah, Vael and Patchwork, but whatever), so the main factor in successful raiding is: does the tank have enough HP, and do we have 8-10 healers.
---
The DPS race is just a race against healers going oom, which is fixed by potions, druid innervates, mana spring totems, and having enough healers so the ooms can regen while another takes over.
---
Okay, great thanks. If I go a priest, I'll definitely not go dwarf then. Now to just decide between priest or mage...
---
Good call, will revise!

Yeah i thought about this too.

What? Im going by what blizz themselves actually said. They said they expect the first weeks to be heavily trafficked and are not sure for how long so they put the deadline for phase 2. 
---
So I dont think its fearmongering and emotional to say its MOST LIKELY gonna be longer than a few weeks based on that? Literally nothing I said was emotionally charged or fearmongering lol.
---
Do you even know whats been said by blizz atm?
---
pls no
---
Where has it been said scandanavian/swedes will be going to Gehennas? Is that actually a thing?
---
you do realise majority of player see have not even installed the game? casuals coming back next few weeks when they heard the game is out etc. only the Reddit/private community is in at the moment.
---
Oh I was saying the opposite. I don’t think retail is a good MMORPG at all anymore. It’s missing so many elements and also added too many elements that take away from both the MMO and the RPG part of it. But yea I’m really excited for classic
---
Yes you are looking at a chance for both stuns to hit. So for the first one there is a 75% chance to stun. If it stuns, there is also a 75% chance on the next one. So 0.75 x 0.75. 
---
With your math, lets say the stun resist was not 25%, but 50%. 50+50= 100... But obviously you wouldn't have 100% resist to the stunlock.
---
Much obliged!
---
Better than the updated versions. Blizz should have kept these beauties so the horde woulnd't be corrupted.
---
Thank you for taking time to type a long response. :)
---
I was musing about using voice modulation. Crazy and would very likely get complications down the line with whichever guild I join.

I can't think of any other concrete questions right now, I guess I'll need to experience it myself first.

Rise of the living dead 3: the turning is one of my all time favorites!
---
I do this anyway :x I’ve read every quest description in Outland AMA
---
Why does it have to be, all or nothing with you people.
---
Like it isn't reasonable for me to ask for proper class/spec balancing? I know its possible to buff ele to make it raid viable without needing to destroy its other aspects that make it fun. You can make all the classes enjoyable to play from raiding to pvp without making everything generic.
---
Just because retail fucked up doesn't mean it needs to be repeated the same way.

I hope so. It's absolutely essential they don't fuck layering up, and far too much evidence has built up showing that they've done exactly that.

Nope. Not everyone has of the black harvest title. They removed it at the end of MoP. The legendary rings and cloaks are also no longer attainable.

I'm planning to go as hpala, but I'm still wondering how they do at lvl 60 when it comes to farming stuff. My plan is to have mining / engineering. Can they kill stuff at a viable rate? How long will mining stay relevant - is there better choices for me? I do have a couple of friends going mage, prot warr and hunter which probably could help me farm - so please if anyone knows a duo/trio way of farming thats nice :D ty.

Someone in this sub said recently that retail WoW feels like a hub world where you choose mini games to play. 
---
I think that’s very true and part of why it feels less like a world now.
---
Your damage will be fine in dungeons as a Hunter. If meters are the most important thing to you then Rogue is going to be higher damage on average. It all depends on what your priorities are.
---
Don't give them any ideas.... because I would too.
---
Or when you close your reddit tab, and then open another reddit tab.
---
Does the main cast get a better coefficient on live than private servers tho? Or is it just completely useless?

I think since the responses should almost all come from this sub you'll see Horde favored on PvP realms since they're racials are generally better for PvP and this sub trends toward the more competitive side.

You ought to check out the Twitch streamer Lezonta. He’s also trying to have a more healthy/balanced lifestyle during this launch than he did back in 2004, so in his countdown to WoW he streams exercise sessions every morning. And I think he’s going to continue to do so before each of his classic WoW streams.
---
Might help you with your motivation to see other people doing the same!
---
Okay my dude good talk lol
---
Exactly. 
---
Im not saying scream at them to remove layering completely for launch etc or for people to be obnoxious. I just want them to take this opportunity of direct communication with the devs, to say that we remember the phase 2 deadline and we REALLY dont want it past that. We will hold you to it.
---
I'd love for them to address what they think of molten core in classic with the itemization and talent changes of 1.2 and whether it's a cakewalk.  And if so, are they okay with it being released that way?
---
45
---
Nope, same coef on the main heal. They just added the coef to the HoT. That's the only diff.
---
And mage vs rogue is a very skill-based match up. Even then, I would give the upper hand to the mage, especially while leveling.
---
RPG Mechanics Kreygasm
---
It's great and they managed to butcher it with the model update.
---
You can still make it difficult and rewarding, its just different. Now instead of taking 2 mobs at a time being hard, you try to pull as many mobs as the quest asks for without dying.
---
I also quit during MoP and am just now starting up. Curseforge and WoWhead are both still good places.
---
I mean... I'm a resto druid who mouse over heals in Luna lol. Mouse spells ftw.
---
im not sure who buys heroic raid or 10+ keystones, but they must lead sad digital lives.
---
&gt;because the guide talks about channeling Drain Life and/or wanding, which means you aren't picking up other targets.
---
I noticed that, but there is no reason not to dot up other targets and fear them, then poke them with rank 1 drain soul as they expire. You can drain tank 1 target easily while something else is running around feared or running back to you.
---
Do what you enjoy, but personally rushing to 60 is how I avoid the frustration of being camped by 60's and feeling like I am wasting time on irrelevant low level content. My /played on my private server lock 1-60 was about 5.5 days. Not an insane speed run, but very good compared to the average, and I had almost 400 gold when I dinged 60, and nearly maxed tailoring.

The axe doesn't stop being great at level 31. As soon as you and your buddy can comfortably duo level 38 non elites, get it then. 
---
If you want the experience of doing it, I think you will likely find it a lot more satisfying if you actually "do it". As in, get to like level 35-36, when you can actually farm your charms, and then you still get an amazing axe for level 36. And you will be able to do meaningful damage to cyclonian, and won't just be a spectator while the hunter actually kills it for you.
---
Doesn't work at all sadly.  Did it on the stress test 4 days ago.  Had a streamer attempt it again in the beta 40-45.  If you find some way to get it working hit me back.

There will be very VERY little incentive to bring these players to the party because their utility isn't worth the loss of dps or hps.
---
Figured wrong

I will name myself Hall Monitor and make it my duty to report everyone

For the last fucking time;  layering won't be around in phase 2.  How many times must we say it before you people get it in to your heads?

You're making a fuss about something that hasn't happened and won't happen.

LF Step by Step quest guide Addon. I am really bad at reading, so i can't use joanas guide, my eyes just can't handle it.  Would appreciate anything.

I doubt you were taught wrong... You just didnt learn right lol

Double bonus if you're running a mage, you're also practicing your raid rotation!
---
Nope. Blizzard does not ban gold buyers, just the gold sellers. You do run the risk of your gold being confiscated by Blizzard but I’ve never had that happen to me in 15 years.
---
Just enjoy it 😊👍
---
Same. Getting my good headphones, graphics max and make time for the journey
---
It’s been a very long time since I’ve crunched numbers on this but I have always been under the impression that 2H fury is bad because of being rage starved and bloodthirst not being based on weapon damage. Is this not the case?
---
yes, they have to keep the totem rotation on, but you don't need a lot else as Enh.  Shaman for me is so useful that If I could have 8 in my raid for DPS/Heals I would.  Though heals are the highlight for that, I do accept enh shamans because they add damage to other players that is really hard to track.
---
It's not not better than whirlwind. Better damage, better dps, more strength.
---
"Some men just want to watch their karma burn."  
---
Also, druid/shamans/paladins are all good healers endgame.
---
The only differences are attack speed. And don't get hung up on Brokentooth. There are a lot of other pets with 1.2 or 1.3 sec attack speeds. You'll hardly notice the difference. 
---
Personally, my hunter is going for the 1.2s vulture in the Blasted Lands. Screech has a much higher damage per focus than Claw (1.7 vs 1.54), and it only costs 20 focus so it can be spammed longer. After Brokentooth is focused starved in 4 GCDs, my bird will be going strong.
---
How much stolen troll land is the Alliance built on?
---
How about we play through the 6 Phase system with the original specs and game as it was one time before we change anything. After that is over lets see what we wanna do.
---
Except that nobody says just "DM" when they want to recruit people for Dire Maul.
---
Yup thank you. It wasn't sarcasm btw.
---
It really is that simple rofl. Take the free transfer or sit in queues.

---
The UnitDetailedThreatSituation  function isn't part from the modern API. 
---
We can't be selective on what should be available and what shouldn't in the modern API just because it's "convenient". Else they'll have to allow Healbot etc...
---
I admire the confidence. I am concerned about the self awareness.
---
You're still worrying about something hypothetical.  Get a grip and stop being so depressingly pessimistic.
---
Alt + f4 on desktop gives the shutdown prompt for all versions of Windows
---
Sure they'll say DM then the cardinal direction, but the DM still means DIRE MAUL, not DEADMINES NORTH.
---
I had two 60 Warlocks which I raided on. My Gnome Warlock I raided as SM/Ruin. My Orc Warlock I raided as MD/Ruin, since there was no salvation. 
---
Tanks are much better at threat generation today than they were back then. They will even go as far as wearing dps gear to deal more threat. MD/Ruin will likely not be necessary, although it might be nice on a few threat sensitive fights like Broodlord.
---
Yeah, that's going to be a shit show. I'll have to exploit layering.
---
Huehuehue intensifies
---
&gt;  is bad
---
MC-&gt;AQ20 all specs are viable. Period. Its AQ40 and Naxx that you need to min/max.  
---
Trust me, it will be very easy and all specs are welcome.
---
I don't know if you are serious, but this sounds legitimately cool.
---
And during day in a month, EVERYONE should be PVP flagged. Gurubash style. Like in that Rick and Morty episode when people purge after sunset.
---
Was truly a great game. Really grind intensive but man was it fun running trade routes from town to town.
---
You might already have an idea, but to me the difference is the design philosophy. I enjoy having to fight for my rewards, plain and simple. I enjoy not having everything handed to me, I enjoy that I can put in the effort an be better off than the others in the game. I enjoy that the world is dangerous and matters.
---
You forgot the kurtocs kolacs

 UnitDetailedThreatSituation  not available on the modern API. We'll have to deal with it !

"he's not retarded, he's special." is a joke for a reason.

---
Okay
---
IIRC no, takes you out of form.
---
Every class has a spec thats viable in pvp or pve, and will be wanted for either, I want to play a arms warrior, but I know I'll have to respecc if I want to join a decent raid guild that values progress, the same can be said for a ret paladin, if he wants to pvp he's fine as ret, but arguably he can pvp as Holy, and ALSO be wanted for PVE.
---
I’m actually not sure if the pre-bis changes because I’m not sure how much hit it has... but with two handers you really don’t have to get much more hit than to cap out your abilities.
---
But youre talking about specs, not class. There isnt a 'worst' class. Nearly every class has a bad spec.
---
Oh that's crazy bad. They just made up a coefficient for the hot when there wasn't any at all? That's seems weird. Oh well, add it to the growing list of reasons why I'm not bothering with druid till BC.
---
GO PLAY BFA
---
As in, they earned their place as worst in slot? Yeah...maybe... I think they can all shine in pvp though.
---
Yeah private servers got their values strong
---
Actually, they specifically encouraged players from Herod/Whitemane to move to avoid severe queue times.
---
So... why does everyone get Whirlwind.
---
If stress test is anything to go by mage to warlock ratio will be close to 2:1
---
&gt;Because TBC is where WoW died for me after several months of playing it.
---
Well, that's just like... Your opinion, man.
---
For real though, you can find people who think every era of WoW was pinnacle WoW. Some people loved BC, and think WotLK was where WoW died. Some loved WotLK and think it died at Cata.
---
If you're going just by subscriber numbers, WotLK was peak WoW, and didn't start rapidly declining until Cata. It plateaued at a pretty steady place for 2008 - 2010 during WotLK, surged to it's highest for Cata's launch, then dropped quickly and never recovered.
---
I'll be curious to see what happens in 2 years. Do they continue on all the way through WotLK Classic, then go in a separate direction, because according to subscriber numbers Cata is when they went wrong? Do they develop a whole new xpac after vanilla classic, and essentially develope two MMOs at once? Or do they just say "We'll the classic servers up in maintenance mode, but there isn't enough volume to justify developing it further".
---
We'll see.
---
It was a lot of zones, but a decent chunk pretty much stayed the same. I'm pretty sure most starting zones stayed the same, with the exception being trolls l

---
&gt; Yes, druids are a little more narrower but any resto hybrid spec will be okay
---
These specs will see SOME play in pvp but raids? You need to assign heals to groups and if that heals can't actually do its job then what is it there for? Wasting mana on dps?
---
No problem, you can DPS in the alt ZG run as long as you bring 100 pummelers.
---
You are willing to bring 100 pummelers for ZG, right?
---
You’re a fucking Savage bud. Good work.
---
In 15 years they’ve never given away those kinds of metrics. Why would they suddenly do it now?
---
I set my keybinds 10 years ago and never changed them.
---
All specs? Because I’m pretty sure fire mage isn’t viable in MC or BWL.
---
Because every person a new player meets and wow is exactly the same. Every Guild a new player meets is exactly the same.
---
!remindme 20
---
So it's not necessarily bad, but it is certainly not as strong as Duel Wield. With Warriors and Rogues being large portion of a raiding group however, having a few people not rolling on the Duel Wield items is never a bad thing. 
---
I've watched a fair few videos and it seems that with the Sword from Rag, the damage is good and will be viable up to Naxx where I can get hold of Might of Menithil.
---
You played yourself.
---
Not to mention a ton of people payed half a month of subscription without a game to play. I don't always agree with the decisions Blizzard take, but I do respect their ability to make money.
---
Real spots I have terrible situational awareness so basically anytime. I’ll probably stand there being murdered for a couple seconds before I catch on 😂
---
Dwarf....
---
In vanilla **you play a class not just a spec**. Every class in the game has a viable spot in endgame raiding. Also, because vanilla is very front loaded,  there is a lot of content that isn't based around the endgame where a lot of the lesser performing raid builds often shine. To me this is a lot more interesting than what the modern game offers.
---
Nice strawman. I didn't generalize anything. I said "most people," and it's true. You said "everyone."
---
Either way, there's no better mage spec for competitive PvP than Frost. Every fire spec lacks the survivability and CC that makes Frost a top tier PvP spec.

I changed my comment to 'most'

Point is I raided 2004-2006 in the 2nd top guild on my server. I was fucking arms and we rolled Boomkin and Ferral and all sorts of goofy shit.
---
Nu-uh!
---
Heavily leaning towards playing a hunter for classic, I'm really stuck between whether I want to play an Orc or a Troll. Im primarily a pvp player so dueling/world pvp/bgs will be were im spending the majority of my time, that being said I still have a strong interest in running all the pve content. 
---
I think what it comes down to for me is just how good is the orc stun racial? Is it enough of an advantage in a pvp situation to justify going orc even if I greatly prefer the aesthetic/animations for troll?
---
Also how is the hunter experience in classic?
---
This links died before I could see it. All subdomain requests are now handled at the support channel, http://support.classicdiscord.net
---
&gt; Also, druid/shamans/paladins are all good healers endgame.
---
All outclassed entirely by priests.
---
As a former GameStop employee I did so many of those release. WoW always had a legit turn out.
---
damage dealer makes sense as a role, dps is a unit... healers and tanks has dps as well
---
Well when you can get 150k for $15 gold is just money
---
Thats World of Fashioncraft right there
---
Yeah whether it's retail or it's classic we have to choose to talk to each other
---
I meant the hour as another annoying thing people forgot about.
---
TBC and WOTLK both launched during winter so it was cold as fuck waiting outside for the store to open. It was in a mall and they were only allowed to let something like 10 people in at a time so even after midnight it could take forever to get inside. It felt like you were making friends through a shared love for wow and the current experience of misery as you froze your ass off.
---
dwarf get desperate prayer too
---
also dwarf SP will beat ud SP 100% of the time
---
What movie is this from
---
My last name is Juhasz, am I invited?
---
Oh yeah -- gotcha.
---
That’s fair. To answer your question then you could heavily slack on hit since you don’t need OH to be hitting. It’s the OH weapon that adds to the base hit penalty and hit the spec.
---
The British welcome you, Golemates :) :)
---
If so, then It really should be a RP-PvP server. That'd be really neat, because in the Blizzard forums, there are currently many germans complaining about how left out they feel because they were hoping to play on a RP server.
---
Looks pretty interesting! I can’t wait for the results, good luck with your project. May you be well and happy friend! I’ll see ya in Azeroth.
---
48 is the minimum lvl target to receive honor at 60.
---
Because their website is going to be so busy with the number of people logging in, reporting issues, trying to sub, looking for info, etc. that it’s going to be slow and transactions often get delayed. It happens every big release.
---
I landed in wow mid-to-late TBC, straight out of diablo 2.
---
My first experience in wow was not very good, I rolled a Druid. And in those early quests I would swing my staff and hit a boar once, and in that time the boar would have hit me three times. So I was like “wtf is this, this game is trash” (keep in mind, this is during my diablo 2 days, where you are used to ability spam)
---
So I stopped playing and uninstalled the game that same day. This was a 7 day trial of the game. On the 2nd to last day, I decided to give it one more shot. I deleted the Druid and made a Hunter, now I’ve always liked ranger/archer bow and arrow archetypes in games, so I have it another go. Things went better, I got a pet and things started moving along more smoothly.
---
Then I made it to the first major town, saw other hunters with sick looking armor, and crazy looking pets that looked like gods all by themselves. At this point I decided to buy the full game and sub.
---
That’s actually a good question - it should be the same but I haven’t tested it on Classic. I’ll report back.
---
Not only are they different. BUT some racial DEPEND ON CLASS TOO!  I.E Fearward with Dwarf Priest.
---
Four or five hours of walking everyday.
---
I'll respect you as a fellow druid brother, but I'll murder you as a shaman horde scum. If you're horde, perhaps we'll see eachother on the battlefield someday, enjoy your hunter though. :D

Picking at /r/Breath_of_the_Wild and watching Dragonball(it's way better than DBZ)
---
They were learned from quests, I believe. Never played a Priest past level 10 in vanilla. 
---
On a semi-related note; Was Star-Shards worth a damn for anything during vanilla? It wasn't made into a non-channeled DoT until much later, right?
---
I bought a desk cycle to help keep the blood circulating a bit. Not as good as a bike, but I also don't have to leave my desk :)
---
Would have been the perfect game to play before classic came out. I pre ordered when it was released and it looks like I'll basically never play it at all since it's coming out AFTER classic wow.
---
Breath of the wild
---
I know there is no dual spec but that's not exactly how it works. Every build in the classic wow incorporates talents from multiple specs. There are cookie cutter builds, yes, but none of them only use one specs talent tree.
---
Load up the latest version of Bnet, go to the WoW tab, open up your browser and go to the wow shop, login and start the process of subbing, when you get to the part where you need to input a payment method you’re Bnet app should update with the option to install classic.
---
Worked for me so hopefully should for you :)
---
Probably won't exist. Modern API doesn't easily allow threat calculation
---
Look like will have to deal with it :) !
---
I mean... We all go things for different reasons. If the guild is happy to facilitate that, then the guild is happy. If it wasn't then I'd not be asking the question.
---
I'm more than aware of the weapon progression for 2H fury. The question is Pre-Bis... Do I need less Hit.
---
it doesnt appease to normies, deal with it
---
1 more for EU and maybe US on release day I'd wager. That would actually be an interesting server with no pre-determined communities or guilds going there.
---
No, it's 2019 Blizzard managing and implementing 2005 or whatever Blizzard's vision. I don't want whatever 2019 Blizzard would do to Classic if we were like "yeah, just make some changes guysss"
---
Yeah same here. I reserved my names without setting up how the characters looked. Just wanted to claim the names asap. Deleted later to change features, stressed as hell doing it. Noticed afterwards I had put the wrong damn facial hair on two of them so had to delete again to redo. It's tough being alive in 2019! The challenges we face! :D
---
craaaaaawling in my skiiiiiin

I'm super stubborn and do everything by myself in BfA (aside from raids and 5mans) because I'm a paladin tank and I can't be killed.

I totally feel that I don’t wanna play any games but classic haha. Once I get home from work I’m checking this reddit and watching classic wow YouTube videos. It’s so close!!!

You can say whatever you like in response but the problem is regardless of what you're answers are someone is better than them at that as well by an insane margin.
---
It's almost like people who choose full/high pop realms are going to act all surprised when layering is done and the queue exists. "OMG, BLIZZ FAILED US" even though Blizzard made is 100% clear these realms will be FULL and QUEUES will exist

I liked playing it on PS, but ya I'm taking a break from healing. Been doing it for like 12 years now lol. Good luck to you!

Yes, but you’ll still want something to watch 😬

drive through? Bro... Door Dash and Uber Eats exist now. You can have a stranger bring "healthy" food straight to you.
---
I was only a couple years out of high school, trying to figure out how to be an adult, when WoW was released. I knew about it, but like you, the idea of paying monthly for a game just seemed crazy (plus I barely had enough to make ends meet anyways). I was finally stable-ish when Wrath was released, and had a friend talk me into playing. 
---
I always heard the "good ol days" stories about Vanilla and was sad that I missed it. I'm glad I have the chance to experience it now.
---
I expect 1-2 more per region before or very shortly after launch, then another 1-2 before phase 2.
---
A toggle would be nice. Doable since it's built off of a legion build and they used to have one
---
It ain't me
---
So it was you... -_-
---
Add-ons this in depth didn't exist when I was leveling in vanilla, but thottbot sure did.  You'd often ask where something was and people would answer thottbot.com
---
Others would help you out.
---
This will work the same way.  People that want to be social will be and those that don't will not.
---
You too man, if you're on whitemane holla - Dkota

Are you blind? He literally has things like Q, R and alt-1/2/3 bound. If he has to look at the bar to see where the ability is it's still faster to tap the keybind than drag your mouse.
---
See this is one of those things that I would only do with Achievements. Not that it's needed, but it looks nice
---
I'd much rather just level up an alt in Classic
---
Why are you even interested in classic if you apparently find it so abhorrent?
---
Leeway and batching were in vanilla and are being retained.
---
Layering is a necessity because vanilla didn't launch with a fraction of the initial player rush as classic will.
---
This is common sense and if you don't like these systems then try and think of sound solutions rather than throwing your toys out of the pram and coming across as a repugnant excuse of a human being.

---
This vid was amazing, ty for the laughs
---
I think that's why he mentioned a toggle.
---
Yeah but you're not getting exalted by lvl 40
---
I think his concern is the server going to “locked” on day 1 and not being able to make a character
---
Captain Grim  on YouTube. His videos are fucking hilarious.
---
Most people will quit at the 3 week mark, having to resub at the 2 week mark is smart too.
---
And yet you bring 6-8 Shaman and 1-3 Priests to Horde raids. Healing isnt purely about numbers, it's also about utility.
---
Lol klh threat meters and quest helper were in classic.  I also remember when klhtm was in development naysayers claiming a mod like that could never be made.   You are dead wrong on this.  
---
Ps I'm 39 and still have time for games.  You chose not to play anymore but try to condescend to people who do.  Glad we won't have to deal with bitter people like you in game.
---
I totally understand that, but You're not going to find a good hybrid spec that ignores 50% of 2 trees to split their points 50/50 just for the sake of flexability.
---
I've been having the same issue. Ever since I played the stress test I just want to play Classic. I never played on any unofficial realms and am not going to start now but man I wish it were here already. I am dabbling with the new No Man's Sky patch but everything I've tried I lose interest in pretty quickly, so we'll see if it sticks for the next couple weeks.
---
Very true, thanks!

Reeeee not good enough! Goes against circlejerk

You can start Westfall at 12, try getting the lion’s share of the Loch Modan quests done for quick xp first. If you’re a little higher in Westfall it helps you die less. The GY there is a real headache!

What is shaman best at?

What is druid best at?
---
&gt; This is so accurate it hurts, after 10 years of retail it took classic coming out for me to realize the social aspect the game was so important to me.
---
The problem with Classic, as you will see when the game is "old enough" and out long enough, is that the starter quests, the elite quests, heck even the low level dungeons, are ***not doable*** because you lack the players in the zone to actually help you do it. 
---
That is the chief reason why Blizzard moved away from elite quests and added things like group finder into the game.
---
not even scroll up/down for druid forms smh
---
Everybody fucking knows you can tell based on the level and where the person asking is located. But the fact is that DM = dire maul is more logical and I'll fucking fight anyone who says otherwise.
---
I wanna be 2hnd fury. Because it's good for the guild to not have everyone be dual wield... wink wink. No sir it's definately not because I want dibs on Akandi and frankly I'm insulted by the insinuation. (sweat drips down forehead.)

I had a razer Naga but It broke after a couple years so be careful of that. Now I just have a g402 (I think, I can't check rn) and it works great

Well, 30 days. 12 days till launch, I guess, 30 days before boredom.

Have you said a single positive thing in any of your posts lately, or are you generally the kind of person nobody in their right mind would want to be around?
---
I wonder what that big banner on worldofWarcraft.com was for then... it’s been there for ages. Also ya you are right it would make sense to essentially say, I like the current game but I have heard you all will like the current game in a year from now! Saying that about vanilla was definitely an insult and not an acknowledgement of its popularity and that retail is now a very different game.
---
You know what really grinds my gears? Idiotic ramblings of angry 12 year olds.
---
I think you’re vastly overestimating the skill of the average player.
---
Like someone lower down mentioned, you bring more rshamans than priests to raids (ideally). What is your problem?
---
Sometimes I picture a meeting with the execs and the board of directors. Board: "have you tried making WoW more like Fortnite?" Execs: "Yes!  We already tried that!"
---
Well this is something that should be optional. The new models look a lot cleaner.

Thanks for your patiance! :)  Didn't know about that command.

Maybe you should try playing vanilla before suggesting things.

The cost of the professions is 10c for primary and 1s for silver.

Yeah, it was definitely fun times.  My small guild merged int with them by the time they were about half way through MC.  So I got to be there the first time TPC took down rag and the first time we cleared BWL and ZG.  It was fun as hell because a lot of us were very pvp centric as well, so we'd go out and smash people with our new found gear since the only difference between pvp and pve gear back then was stamina and the high end gear made up for the lower stamina.  :)

Nah man.  I'm going to RP walk everywhere in first person with no interface for maximum immersion.

Its too late to delete it i've already downloaded it.

If that's all they need to have a role in raiding, why aren't they already used against bosses that don't have taunt?

Man, you're even more stupid than I originally thought.

not every spec is for raiding

---
Once you've changed one thing in classic, you've opened up the possibility of changing more things. While adding a taunt to paladin on its own would probably not matter much in terms of the classic experience, now people are saying "Add a guild bank, it's just a qol improvement, and won't impact the game", so now you've changed 2 things. Next we're gonna make moonkins viable, because they're arguably the worst spec in the game. 3 things changed. This will continue, and starting on that slippery slope is gonna destroy what Classic was, and the whole idea with Classic is recreating the experience.
---
My problem is that a class like paladin doesn't have 1 great strenght that another class doesn't.
---
Everyone here is campaigning for class diversity but in reality what does a paladin do that others cannot? Not taunt?
---
Here's a fairly concise explanation of what Retail WoW has become. http://www.darklegacycomics.com/689
---
Whereas in Classic, that purple pair of boots you got felt like the greatest, most irreplaceable thing in the world.
---
Damn was actually considering both of those two pretty much cause I wanted to tank or heal. It's hard but how much harder is it vs another class?
---
&gt; Make SURE!! to voice your layering worries.
---
This latest idiocy from the scaremongers really has to stop. Layering will be fine if population drops off the way every sane human being thinks it will.
---
***IF*** you are delusionally convinced that Classic will be such an overwhelming success that everyone who ever touches it will play it hardcore forever, then yes it does follow that layering or overcrowding will be a problem in three months time. But (a) that is delusional and (b) that's would be a fucking *great* problem to have. That's a really good outcome not the sky falling.
---
Get over it. Find something important to whine and fearmonger about if your life really is empty without whining and fearmongering.
---
Republic of Stormwind when?
---
It's already Medium pop now so I think that's a fair bet. At the very least high by launch which is just about perfect.
---
&gt; All outclassed entirely by priests.
---
By what metric?
---
star shards did a lot of dmg, it scaled with spell power
---
That means 8AM-ish release for Australia. Perfect!
---
They become immune to damage.
---
Does 1.12 have Drek'thar and Ivus?
---
Who said there was?
---
I think they will wait it out and see how many stop playing cause many are just going to be “tourist” there to see what the hype is about but find it too hard and not stick with it, if they add too many and half the player base leaves it will leave a lot of severs dead which is bad.
---
This is why I can't play retail. Great video, hilarious.
---
hopefully none more
---
It took me a year to get to level 60 leveling as a resto druid, not rushing it, and leveling a warrior alt to 35 over the summer.  I was in college at the time.  The average player may take 3 months, but for most adults with jobs and young kids to raise, there is no way 3 months is realistic, unless they are very focused on efficient leveling versus enjoying the game the way most non-hardcores did it in vanilla.  
---
I remember sneaking into Teldrassil as horde, leveling fishing, "walking" up walls, going to certain locations to screenshot the moon, socializing in org, helping guildies getting ganked, wearing funny clothes etc... none of that helped me level, but it made the experience awesome.  
---
If you can only play WoW 10 hours a week, you're looking at about 24 real life weeks to hit 60 if you don't mess around too much.
---
If they introduce the token to classic it will kill the game
---
This isn't doing Stalagg justice. Delete this
---
It’s about %150 harder as a solo warrior and about %120 harder as a pally. A pally is a bit faster because their weakness isn’t so much lack of heals like the warrior, it’s more they main source of dps is auto attack’s making them slower then a rogue or other melees.
---
basically modern pre-order trap they got us
---
You can start logging into the game at less than 10% download.
---
Lmao, is this really a reason to bring a pally over a priest though...
---
Because of the fact TBC content is essentially untouched on retail, unlike classic content, I see that as a valid reason NOT to rehash TBC or Wrath. Bring on fresh new classic content IMHO (in due time)
---
As dps your only fuck up is really getting hit by mechanics or... Not doing damage enough? I guess?
---
Bit more responsibility as the healer obviously. Paladin is a healing beast in vanilla though, they have no struggles getting plenty of groups or actions
---
He doesn’t have forms or his pot bound lol. It’s definitely not faster to try and remember the keybind he selected for that spell than to just click it, and even so, you don’t analyze which would be faster in the moment, you just react. If your reactions haven’t been attuned to your keybind layout, your first instinct will be to click. Can’t believe you honestly can’t even understand that. My 8 year old nephew gets that LMAO. New players have no clue how to even get to the keybind menu, and grandmas don’t give a fuck about speed (most of the time). Your worldview is myopic, immature, and pathetic. Lmao
---
What are you even talking about? Are you aware of a thing called blessings?
---
Wrong. It is based on coalitions of major guilds deciding where each nation will play.
---
Nice.
---
Thanks! (:
---
You do realise that beta *tests* and stress *tests* are for *testing* mechanics like layering, right? And that maybe there was a lot of layering going on because they were *testing* it?
---
The chances of you tanking raids as a new warrior are extremely low. Tanking is a specialist role and guilds will have a few people for that already basically all the time. Tanking dungeons? Yes you would, raids, not unless you really pushed for it.
---
Not me.  The journey is just entirely too long for me not to have a quest addon so that I can remember where to go.  It takes 10 days of /played time to get to 60.  
---
I still have tons of fun while using a quest addon.  It doesn't take anything at all out of the game for me.
---
I don't think it'll be dead unplayable or an unhealthy population. I still don't think it will be full however.
---
Repost city these days.
---
Vanilla WoW hooked a lot of ‘nooby’ players. I don’t think that’s the reason players will be culled.
---
I suspect the lack of instant-gratification is what will kill it for newcomers. Getting to level 20 will be a journey for them, pushing to 40 will be a task and 60 will seem un-doable.
---
I’m going to be watching the forums for people asking about paid 2X exp and stuff haha
---
WHOA WHOA there, you are aware that many many classic wow private server players absolutely hate modern wow models. 
---
I for one would love to see classic wow revamped graphically, and maybe even then some. But the sad fact is that nostalgia bots only want classic exactly the way it was and no improvements are allowed.
---
Lmao OK champ👍
---
I honestly wish it’d be a nice change if they gave us the option for both AV. I’d mostly do 1.12 AV but occasionally do long ass AV. I feel like even the no changes crowd wouldn’t mind that.
---
zygor guides is coming out for classic launch and it is a lot more step by step than AAP or questie.
---
I understand the slippery slope concept but, making moonkins somehow leads to destroying classic? What is this revenge of the chickens?
---
You talking about the white sets? Are those actually that good? I'm so used to them being trash from retail that I never even considered their usefulness in classic
---
I was waiting to see a teabagging or a skullfucking.  Or at least a little bit of crying before moving on.  Oh well.  I enjoyed it.
---
That's what stables should have been man, no silly carrying in your backpack or magical void where they live, stables should be a "bank" for mounts.
---
Oh you want paladin over a priest? well in that case, one gives me blessing of kings, and another priest can't give me another fortitude buff.
---
No thank you.

You don't need to rely on bubbles if you have priests.

I feel like you're using the wrong jaina template.  That is not classic jaina!

Badas! I love it!

I think the percentage of people that reserved their names will be like 10% of the population on launch day.  Stalagg will be full on launch day also.
---
I know the ranges are vast. I'm basically trying to figure out which recipes are skippable or which I can afford through crafting by tips for desirable items or guild support (Asking guild which they'll actually make use of while leveling) so I dont end up bankrupt while helping everyone else race further ahead of me.

to avoid people like you lmao

I got it by pre-ordering wc3:r... I'm not sure if you can buy it as a standalone game through blizzard's website or not however.

Yeah just hop over the continent

Wrong, it was unfortunately changed when the spaniards (who usually refuse to speak english) decided to go to Shazzrah instead of Golemagg. So Sweden moved to Gehennas (the new server).

I don't know if there is one but it would be an account cap not a character one. As in if you already have a character on the realm you can make a new one but if you don't you cannot. The character limit is then ten per account per realm.
---
As many of us saw servers that said 'locked' when we tried to reserve and got a message along the lines of 'only players with an existing character on this realm can create a new character' it would appear that the game has something in place to put an account cap in place but whether or not they will actually use it I don't know. It could discourage a lot of players who join late if they are trying to join a friend but cannot create a character on that realm.
---
&gt;WHOA WHOA there, you are aware that many many classic wow private server players absolutely hate modern wow models.

So why not give people the option of which they want to see like they do with everything else?

if u wanna buy warcraft 3 now u gotta buy reforged now, it comes with it and u can dl and play instantly.
---
on private servers, i seen duels where skilled rogues would beat warriors. Level 60, full T2-T3 gear. Basically stun locking and bleeds. But you gotta be pro.
---
Any noob vs noob, warrior wins. And mages are good against both if youre frost.
---
take my upvote. i laughed
---
The cost is super variable as professions like Engineering or Blacksmiths has considerably more recipes to buy.  I would place those two as the most expensive if i had to guess without running the numbers.
---
Not only for a game but for a nostalgic game too. I've played different games on emulators and I can never do more than an hour. I rather leave those games as fond memories.

**Main:** Human / Warrior / Fury (Open to gearing up in order to function as an OT)

Will have rogue and mage alts for money making.
---
Planning on no-lifeing for the first 1.5-2 weeks with family members who are also playing. The plan is to be 60, attuned, and farming BIS in that first 2 weeks.
---
Will probably play 20-30hours/week easy.
---
I want to focus on clearing content. No aspirations for world first or anything like that, just want consistent focus on progression and having fun with like minded people.
---
My current work schedule(2nd shift with possible extra time added to the end of shift) requires me to raid mornings or very late evenings in order to guarantee raid attendance. Anything from 4am-11am PST  and 11pm-3am PST should work fine for me.
---
**Background**
---
Played Vanilla in 2005 as a rogue. Raided in TBC on the same rogue and a druid (heals then tank). Nothing special, but I am familiar with the game and with a few of the classes. I will be progressing much more quickly this time around. I played up until Wrath and was done when the game began going in a direction I did not care for. Looking forward to going back to Classic times. I am also looking forward to trying something new class-wise (Warrior).
---
The only thing your right about is that 21 jump street is a good movie
---
Aye!
---
As opposed to nearly dead unplayable or dead nearly unplayable
---
How is it not related? Every single decision they make boils down to making more money. Layering is in place to make the gaming experience more enjoyable and so the zones aren’t over crowded. What does this accomplish? Happier casuals. More subs. More money.
---
Yes, there are prey and there are the hunters. We need prey. I am the hunter.
---
Cool dude

Despite the fact that you’re an alliance piece of garbage... I loved the shit out of this post. Inject it right into my veins.

---
There were definitely days when I would have to take a break because someone (or a group) decided to camp me, or were questing in the same area as me and would kill me on sight.
---
Back then, a break was "whatever". Now, my time is a little more constrained and I don't really want to log on only to be camped during the short time I have to play that day.
---
had me lol at "chadkin"

Can we layer people based on their /played time? Then all the people that are just checking it out and will probably leave will be in the same layer.

What is the point of playing a Subtlety Rogue in a raid?

What is the point of playing an Arcane Mage in a raid?
---
What is the point of playing a Beast Mastery Hunter in a raid?
---
Frost and shadow
---
It gives people a place to share their fears about future potential outcomes and either be supported or be derided, which will that affect their actual experience. I mean social media is an awesome thing to have for classic now
---
Well finding groups will be way easier, with the various realm specific discord etc.
---
!RemindMe 10 days
---
I can see the Lock having a summonable mount, as it fits the class theme of summoned demons.
---
I have no idea how much you would need to grind in retail to get 500k. Is it anyhow comparable to amount of gold people would have in vanilla in any point?

Rend Blackhand is Blackhand's son. Not the same person lol

prot pally is a special case, why do you have to talk about this one ? all other are fine they just do  less dps
---
having a tank that can't tank and a dps that does less dps are two different things
---
every iteration of AV has Drek'thar
---
Another psychic who knows how long layering will be in the game for.
---
So you think BFA players are not aware of classic because the webpage does not show a giant image of it.
---
Sure...
---
The rest of the mortals aren’t even aware wow is still a thing today, and if they do BFA is probably a better game for them.
---
Also, you know nothing about how engineering, programing and managing a cluster server infrastructure works, apparently. I’m sure that merging the 1.12 codebase and data with BFA engine is probably as big of a deal as making a new expansion from scratch, if not even more.
---
You are dumb. Just enjoy the game.

Yeah I have heard a few people say they won't even try classic because they prefer skill to make a difference over gear

It's really not hard to direct someone North East, and honestly... It made me feel super nice to help.
---
Mages are an S tier pvp class and gods in open world. Rogues aren’t gear dependent. Mage is by far the better solo class for every aspect of the game.
---
Man you would be fun at parties
---
Amen, and 95% humidity.
---
Yep, running through Elwynn Forest and I would have believed you if you said it was the post-Cataclysm map, especially with the advanced water.
---
Killed 10 horde in beta today in STV ready for this to go down for real
---
Yes lmao.
---
Do you realize how low mana costs would be to allow a balance Druid and elemental shaman to chain cast an entire fight with only mana pots to sustain them? Mages and warlocks can only do that with mana pots, mana gems, evocate, and lifetap. Druid and shaman have no such ability, so all they have are potions. 
---
They would essentially have unlimited mana, which is extremely OP in pvp.
---
And that’s just one example of those you suggested.
---
im leading the charge for all my friends to play on fairbanks and we are east coast...im trying to avoid the zoo that is the east coast servers rn...they wanted to play herod
---
I like that things MATTER. Almost everything does. Bag space, professions, gold, leveling skills. Critical decisions you have to make that matter. Also, it’s nice not feeling like an overpowered god anymore like in retail. Being a “nobody” adventurer again felt so good. Like it’s time to build our story. Thrall may as well have spat on my face the first time I spoke to him because he couldn’t be bothered with my presence, but in retail, we are his equal or higher and as someone who came from Warcraft rts games, loving the campaigns and lore, being on equal footing with Thrall is garbage to me.
---
I just hope that the Alliance in Shazzrah (EU) will be ready for some orcish love :)
---
&gt;I feel like in my previous WoW experiences, I was always on low pop servers... and always wondered if life was better on high pop.
---
I'm on one of the highest pop servers in EU for Horde (yes, servers segregate by faction now for whatever reason) and it's actually more annoying than anything. Trade chat is full of boost spam 24/7, all your auctions get undercut within 5 seconds and there really is no upside because the only people I interact with are in my guild anyway.
---
I guess Classic servers could be different. No sharding, no boosting, and if you want world PvP the more people the better I guess. But I would still rather roll on a "medium" server. I have high pop server PTSD.
---
Definitely. Also some jobs basically force you to make 1 big pause and not allow multiple small ones lead to headaches. Worked in a Callcenter. I usually don't get a headache, I get migraine instead.
---
In my experience a certain percentage of how toxic or awesome a community is is how I interpret it.
---
Windfury the shit out everything. Have the warrior pull like 8 mobs, pop down windfury totem and start healing. AOE farming made easy.
---
Don't wanna heal? Well, playing any hybrid non pure dps class means you heal In raids, and all raid gear is itemized for healing. 
---
So, choices are then warrior, rogue, mage, hunter, or warlock. 
---
I would say mage tbh. Feed your warrior buddy, provide CC and great damage in dungeons. Can kinda AOE farm, and teleport you both around. 
---
You'll also have the same movent speed, both have to pay for mounts, and use completely different gear.
---
Everywhere I read you can make characters on a full server as long as it’s not “locked”

Back in the day Alliance and Horde felt pretty disconnected from each other, and most people didn't use stuff like mIRC to connect with the opposing faction.  
---
These days a large majority will probably be on the server discord with easy access to that asshole who just killed you / is camping you.  
---
You can of course choose to opt out of this, but will likely miss events, raids and drama if you do.

I'd prefer it the way it was back in the day, but I'm not gonna gimp myself by being one of the few not keeping up with server news/events.

no u are not. a mage won't one shot a 5k+ hp druid. who can also go bear. who has NS.
---
Well, I don't know if that would work. But I think it won't, as the communication uses a hidden channel and whispering to send the data. Although even if it would work and u'd see the other factions items for sale, you wouldn't be able to trade with them directly.
---
Does click work for mouse over +hotkeys also? Or just right/lift click and modifiers?
---
Same account log in. Two different game installs, though. One subscription paid for both.
---
Nope.  Just play.
---
That was better than I expected it to be.
---
Fn Epic.  Nice job.
---
Classic is included with an active wow subscription
---
I have no idea either (this was the first time I logged into retail in years), I would guess not. 
---
I imagine it’s hard to grind 140k, which is what a game token (worth one month game time) costs.
---
I'm talking about all these specs because there isn't a "they're best for X activity".
---
Balance druids are the worst thing in every scenario, this isn't limited to prot pallys who are unable to do the job they're designed to do...tank.
---
They'll add more as they need, they may even add some after launch and offer free-transfers if the servers keep filling up.
---
Just install and play classic

I think stock setting is like 2100? I honestly dont know.
---
Dude holy shit this. Being snowed in in a warm house with classic wow....hnnnnnnng I feel this on a spiritual level.
---
Have you tried warrior pally? Pretty sick. Endgame you use cloth and other healing gear so it wont matter as much if you're worried about that if you're gonna pve. As for PVP you buy the gear from vendors anyway.
---
I know it exist on paper, but all of the original management and higher positions have been given to Activision employees.  Blizzard is just a name that Activision is using, nothing more.
---
I was on the server with "The Flying Hellfish"  They were the third horde guild in the world to complete Naxx, and I believe had other Horde world firsts.  They wrote their own addons realtime (and obviously after the raid).
---
Honestly, after watching some of today's streamers try classic, that were supposed to be these great Pros, I thought they were terrible, impatient, and stupid.  Had a difficult time getting into WC at level 15....really.....made multiple CRs...OK.....
---
I realize they were just trying to kind of zerg it for their audience, but needless to say, I thought they were terrible.
---
WoW is the only game that made me cry iRL.
---
I picked a PvP server as my first server and I leveled a nelf hunter. When I hit 30 I went to STV and got merceilessly ganked by an UD rogue. I legit cried because he would not leave me alone and I just wanted to do the quest there. I even opened a ticket with a GM saying that he was bullying me (lol).
---
In the end, my Mom saw me crying and gave me a hug. She made some chicken tenders and I went to bed crying but full of tendies. Good times.
---
I see a [Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge](https://www.wowhead.com/item=12940/dalrends-sacred-charge) on the two auto attack buttons 9,

---
also why is [Un'Gror Soil](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11018) on that action bar  
---
distract on key 8 is only usable while in stealth, but using any other attack on the action bar would break stealth and swap the bar.  
---
hmmm
---
All it takes for it to be a race is for &lt;your faction&gt; to do nothing to stop it.

If only they would do this with Toontown Online...
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
Im on there.  Haha big help to you.  But when I heard it might be brazillian i looked at it as an opportunity to learn a little bit of a new language.
---
The elite quests were supposed to be hard. You had to do social interaction to do some of the quests as well as dungeons. As long as the servers were not dead i never had any issue in vanilla finding people for lower level dungeons
---
ralph pls go
---
while thats probably true, its nice to hear some positive stuff too.
---
&gt; BEYOND ironic comment.

&gt; If you can tell me 1 good reason to not add a taunt to prot pallies I will delete this thread and apologies for ruining your reddit browsing experience.
---
You can't show favoritism for any class, if you try to fix the protection paladin then you'll have to make also every other mixed class tree viable. That much heavy handed balancing right from the bat would deviate too much from the Classic WoW experience.
---
Balancing isn't just tweaking a few numbers or adding an ability here and there, you need a long term plan on what you're doing. And right now the game is at the point zero so it's way too early for talks of balance even with historical knowledge. When the last phase rolls out (A'hn Qiraj) and players decide they're bored and want something different then maybe.
---
For now just enjoy the game as it was with all its flaws..
---
I appreciate even the smallest gesture of help. Even something vague like that is helpful. I've play WoW for 10+ years but still get brain farts when it comes to old quests. I'd rather ask the chat than look it up on Wowhead. I enjoy the social interactions more anyway.
---
Like the other lad, I agree it’s more difficult at the start, particularly when kids are involved. Although if it is just your wife and no kids, that is a lot more manageable.
---
I have the fortune of being a shift worker so in order to prepare for my night shifts, I stay up the night before. Generally play from about 2000hrs to 0700hrs. I will also play from 2000hrs to around 0300hrs before an afternoon shift, so that’s how I squeeze it in. I can also play while at work if I am not being called out for a job, which I will be doing my professions/leveling alts/fishing/farming/gold making etc.
---
I’ve been practicing all the above on private servers for a while to see how it all works out, and I can easily knock out 20-30 hours a week depending on how busy I am at work.
---
Everyone starts at 0 and learns, don’t worry about it. Tank dungeons while leveling and you should have enough of a grasp by 60 to be totally fine. It’s not rocket science, or that much harder than any other class
---
If you actually played the stress test, the starter zones were filled and yet it was far from "unplayable". This concern is so silly ever since they confirmed dynamic respawns.

Playing wc3 again makes me more excited for classic. I played wc3 casually and skipped wow until cata, so seeing all the references and items etc. has been fun, and makes me appreciate even more what the idea and spirit of vanilla/classic was, (basically to create and play as your own hero unit, lot of familiarity for wc players)
---
I've heard that water is see through with the non-vanilla graphics. Won't this have an effect on the game when you can see monsters and players underneath the water without having to dive yourself?

note it doesn't include keyboard, mouse, monitor, or windows OS.

plenty of other options too.
---
Aside from modifications to the battleground itself, cross-realm also changed it a lot. Happy?
---
Paladin counters melee but weak against spellcasters, very boring healing PVE, fun PVP.
---
Priest has fun heals, best situational healer, weak against physical, good against casters. Later gear levels melee will destroy you, with no peels.
---
Priest for more complicated healing gameplay, paladin for effective and easier gameplay. PVE I'd say priest, PVP I'd say paladin.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
lol why ARE they downvoting me? if youre from shadow moon you know what it is. if not, bugger off.
---
Oh shit, i might have to give wow another go, thanks for the info!
---
I think if you have sex with a body after the kill it’s necrophilia and not rape. Therefore should be good. Rapekill on the other hand. Watch out permanent ban
---
The latter is a lot more involved, and there's an incentive for everyone to try and get along and even get to know one another since it'll be easier to get good groups in the future if you make friends. Or if you behave badly, the people in that group will know not to group with you in the future making it harder for you to find groups.
---
The former everyone treats each other like an NPC because it literally doesn't matter what you do or say to each other, it has no impact on your ability to get groups in the future
---
I played like a filthy casual in BC and still knew &amp; knew of a decent amount of people on my server. Coming back in WoD and playing the same way for roughly the same amount of time I had no idea who anybody was / didn't form connections with anyone in the game and it didn't matter at all in terms of my ability to experience content in the game.
---
That's not to say that dungeon and raid finder are inherently bad, it just appeals to different audiences. Automated queue systems are perfect for people who don't care about community/social aspects of MMOs because for them there's no downside
---
I had no issues running it during the stress test. I have also had someone else run a slightly modified version of Memoria on the beta and haven't heard about any errors. Do you remember what error it was you got?
---
You could always join a private server and mess around with classes/races.
---
Even better, I've already installed an addon that will prevent such text from appearing on my screen for even a single frame.
---
We're closer to High/Mega/Ultra pop rather than Low/Medium/High though.  
---
You'll get a better and more authentic experience on the lower populated servers.
---
Seriously nobody can grasp this. I give up saying it.
---
 "I'm going to stalagg because the population is lower and I won't have a queue!" --- yeahhhh... Good luck with that.....
---
Would I be able to gear without raiding, just from PvP?
---
Really?
---
what if the scenario is that your healers extra mana with innervate or your raid need a battle res ?
---
With flasks and consumables their dps is not **that** bad, I mean even on BFA some classes are still much worse than others but people still invite them, even if it's a lesser difference  why wouldn't you on classic where the content is 10x easier
---
Ask about possibility of classic+

just need a 15$ subscription for it, no box cost!

Some people don't understand that things like threat and mana management played a significant role in the game that added to the difficulty. I see so many people implying that quick reflexes and extremely complicated rotations are the only way to scale difficulty when a conservative play style can be equally as engaging while being less stressful.
---
I was 16 when i was jerking off to this, checkmate

"I guess I could log into retail..."

Is classic wow worth playing if I’m gonna play solo?

THEN it would be flooded.

Totally with you. Just enjoy the ride and have fun! I'm not rushing my classic experience lol.

That’s monthly right?

Wasn't DNS supposed to resolve the problem?

List your streams please. I watch streams of PvP servers 2 days after launch so I can see STV madness while I level on PvE.
---
I currently only have 2 Streamers saved urls though. Any other smaller streamers plan on streaming STV? Please put your url for me.
---
except every other druid in the game will have it as well now.
---
Hurray for welfare epics.
---
Just wanted to comment that Diablo 2 is also my favorite game of all time. Absolutely love that game, although I haven't played it since I was a kid.
---
Low probably means 2 or 3x a vanilla server high likely means 5x+
---
If you’re a retail baby sure. I guess there are more of you than me.

With my paladin, Stand In ironforge in full t2 and Sulfuras.  Only had 5/8 and eye of Sulfuron in vanilla.
---
Made me pause to catch a breath from laughing. Excellent work
---
Not one great strength? You mean like divine intervention to avoid hard wiping, or the countless utility they bring to raids in the form of many different buffs? The fact they MT heal better than any other class? I guess you're right.
---
Oh, then yeah, druid war should be excellent. I'm in the same boat so did a ton of research. My friend is rolling a warrior and I going shaman. Somewhat mismatched movement but after 30 its gonna be a dungeon melee cleavefest.
---
\#cheer
---
Don't worry too much about it. If you plan on making friends, playing in a group through your levels will make it not really matter. If you tell people you are learning, they will likely help you out, and leveling as the role you want to play is a great way to get to know all your abilities.
---
I can tell you listen to My Chemical Romance while carving the name of a girl that will never look at you on your arm and blame your dad for all your problems.

You can train everything (within class restrictions) but polearms at level 1 in classic. The level 10 requirement was a private server thing.

Will try and give you the information you need. 
---
first your hit cap dose not change from 2H to DW on yellow hits it is eather 9% with 300 wepondskill (WS) or 6% with 305 WS vs. a 63 boss at 60.  Tho as DW you want as much hit as you can get since it helps on white dps since your miss change is around 24% (give take a bit on whant your WS is)
---
your pre raid will not change much, you will not want to go over your hit cap as staided above. 
---
I my self will start as 2H furry since its easyer to gear for pre raid bis, and there is not a lot of compation on 2H weps.  When i make the change to DW depends on drops and how they are given in raids.  persanaly im not going human/orc, so im not forced to use special weps, and this keeps my options open. 
---
here is a link to a informative video.

Oh wow, thank you so much!  I definitely need to sit down and do some research.  My 12 year old Alienware could run everything before Legion no problem on 4GB of RAM.  After Legion, not so much 😅

If their laptops are anything like their PCs I'd stay very far away from them.

It's definitely going to be a grind, but I like the challenge.

This is incredible. Amazing work!

&gt;If you can tell me 1 good reason to not add a taunt to prot pallies I will delete this thread and apologies for ruining your reddit browsing experience.
---
Pallies didn't have taunt in Vanilla.
---
Ain't no way I'm wasting 30 minutes on a total stranger for no compensation, and I suspect anyone who's seen as the "best" on their server would be the same.
---
Do not expect this in 2019.
---
You know those times when you read a messed up story and can't wait for the epic punchline? Yea, this ain't it, chief.
---
Nothing wrong with giving paladins taunt in my opinion, just not in this version of classic. If theres ever a classic + then sure go in the direction of TBC talents, they buffed all the hybrid specs and raiding was great imo.
---
&gt; until PUG speed running meta forms
---
Hate to break it to you but it already has. Private servers has been a thing for a long time. The raids are already figured out.
---
Well played reference
---
you realize several bosses are taunt immune right?

Good cops are cool, bad cops aren't cool..?

Priest has stun resist in talents, inner fire for a lot more armor and warriors don’t get rage when they hit power word: shield. Rogues can be tough, but you really shouldn’t get soloed by them. Ele shamans are what you need to be worrying about. 
---
Divine shield is the only edge paladins really have on priests for survivability, and it’s very long cd so not that reliable. You will get 1 shot bursted and trained the same as priests for the most part.
---
My college grades tanked when WoW first came out. I made it through that. I’m sure I can survive through my marriage and career tanking this go around.

I DEFINITELY am a HUGE advocate for the old models. If we had the new models, I would be severely disappointed. It's a massive part of the immersion classic brings to me.
---
are you a troll
---
Ahhhh still undecided on Warrior Race.
---
I lean towards Dwarf more... but human has nice proportions, good racials for PvE &amp; their 1h animation isnt really bad like Dwarf.
---
But then I also kinda wanna go Horde because they get windfury, no orcs in PvP, no UD in PvP, no ret memers stealing your plate gear or big swords... but do I go Tauren? Or Orc? Tauren seems good but armour fits them quite poorly... and orcs shoulderpads are waaay too big.
---
listen: shaman is the most fun healer. Unlike paladins, priests and shamans are not just pressing one button and playing a game of wack-a-mole with damage. I have had many shamans as the main healer of my group and they are more than capable of putting out tons of healing. as are priests. shamans have huge bursty heals with NS, plus their positional requirements for totems and, of course, CHAIN HEAL. I've played a priest, they are also fun. strong single target heals, a HOT (which is very important to me) and of course Prayer of healing for those mana expensive but good group heals (not as good raid heals as shaman). What i want to get across is: if you choose shaman: you can be very successful at the highest levels of the game in terms of healing. priests are absolutely not the only viable healer in the game.
---
get my first green drop!
---
Yea but then you'd have to play a druid. Hope you like healing at 60!
---
What did you use to form it?? I want to get into cosplay and making weaponry but don't know where to start.
---
Sorry I misread your first comment. My reply didn't really makes sense
---
Fortunately, I managed to burn myself out on a private server. I'm glad I did because I learned a lot of things
---
To be honest, you'll probably catch up quickly. You might miss some of the initial chaos which I'm kind of looking forward too but it'll also slow everyone down I'm guessing.
---
Yeah I think deungeon/pvp gear should be sufficient
---
IV still got a bank alt called slutdrop and no ones got me for that yet haha you might be good.

Get some chicken wings and put a tea spoon of baking soda per 500g with some salt, leaving in the fridge overnight. Pat the dry with some kitchen paper and season with lemon pepper. Bake them at 200c for 45 minutes. Once they are out drizzle them with a buffalo/ hot sauce.

Enjoy the best wings ever.

Thanks for the tip!

For one, the very last stress test was available to anyone with a subscription, so not invite-only, and obviously far less people showed up than what launch will have. Yet if you think [this](https://i.imgur.com/XjypRTe.jpg?1) doesn't count as high pop or [this](https://i.imgur.com/d21Qf2F.jpg), then I don't know what to tell you. And yet, even in these conditions, the spawns were smooth and plentiful. I will gladly pick the "1000 people in the same zone" poison 100 times over.

Just because he doesn't have everything bound doesn't mean he doesn't have bindings at all...........

If you look at a spell and you see there is a Q keybind next to it then it's faster to press Q than to drag your mouse to it unless your brain is slower than an 80 year old's. The fact that your dumb ass can't understand that means your 8 year old nephew is a genius for you. 
---
My point is he's NOT a new player or a grandma, he's a damn DEV of this game, and I said the ONLY excuse is for new players and old people. Holy shit you're dyslexic and this is a waste of my time, goodbye.

I'll never forget getting this on my female Undead Rogue in the mid 50s. I ran out of quests around lvl 51, and spent countless hours grinding the ghosts at the lake in Winterspring. Found countless Icy Enchant recipes 51-60, and eventually Krol dropped. My first epic!
---
I went to stalag because it was free name res

I don't see what you're talking about.

Farm MC for 5+ months, again.... for what feels like the millionth time.
---
Rankil from &lt;Ænigma&gt; says hi!
---
Yeah why the fucknwould you want to do that?
---
Blizzards response to the issues which could make or break Classic are the most interesting questions.
---
haha we are in Australia unfortunately, but whitemane would have been the realm I chose, maybe if the battlegroups line up we might cross paths in BG's at some point!!
---
So a better approach would be to remove taunts from all tanks.
---
In PVP you mostly use different spells such as moonfire or chain lightning so...And boomkins are not great in pvp, buffing starfire mana cost would never make them op lmao
---
They would need like 50% reduced mana cost to be more in line with other casters but I haven't done the maths
---
Also just adding nature to curse of elements from the warlock would buff elementals shamans a lot, only in PVE
---
I don't see why people are against this. If it's OPTIONAL, how does just not using the updated models harm you?
---
The bulk of it is made of a thermoplastic called Wonderflex.  It comes in posterboard sized sheets that I cut with heavy duty scissors and heat with a hair dryer.  Once heated, the stuff can be molded, shaped, and sticks to itself extremely well.  When its heated up, its pretty floppy and hard to shape on its own, so I wrap it around pieces of cardboard to make each piece part.  Once all the piece parts are completed, I can then reheat the edges and "weld" them together.  
---
Hope it helps!
---
Where? Cant  be me because Im not predicting anything specific. IM just going by what blizz has said &amp; implied :) Stay up to date.
---
99/100 times you get ganked they’ll keep it moving and you won’t see them again. You typically don’t get camped unless you did something to piss someone off lol
---
Bet hes kicking himself for saying that lol
---
Need to start using the original Jaina format, just blonde
---
A lot of us have been waiting years man. This is the golden age. These are beautiful times
---
As long as you stay a little ahead of the bell curve it's not bad at all. 
---
There is also going to be layering so it wont be vanilla or how it was on emulated servers. 
---
Most the people ahead of the curve are going to be focusing on leveling as fast as possible and will try to avoid engagements and gank wars as it is detrimental to leveling speed. You want to get in and out of STV as quickly as possible. Exchanging ganks while you're both farming tigers is pointless. 
---
However, be behind the curve or right in the middle. Going to be bad.
---
Out of loop, could u clarify mon
---
Can we get a list of things we already know so that they don't answer questions that waste time. WE NEED TO KNOW : Server caps and layer caps.
---
Which is the only reason people should have. Going to stalagg for a lower population is just silly
---
Unfortunately Ask Me Anything doesn't imply they'll answer anything :(
---
How many of you modeled your character after your first ever toon?  I cant be the only one.
---
it's really not bad to skill while leveling if you are going mining anyway. You can even make some money doing it since there's an engi quest on both ally and horde.
---
They don't need new physical servers, this isn't 2004. The same processing power they were using for 10 layers on that 30k realm can be used to create 10 3k servers. There's no additional cost for that.
---
Awesome! Thank you so much!! ☺️
---
Ah, then it's the same one. Brilliant macro.
---
There are some spots that you can't dungeon through. But ya, most of the way to 60 can just be dungeons.
---
You could probably just as easily just lie about it... not like anybody looking in the toilet lol
---
An alliance player would have rammed into him with their car
---
I mean, there’s a zeplin between the zones, faster to get from SM to STV than like SM to Arathi
---
And this is exactly what they will say haha
---
If they had enough time.... they wouldnt be casuals now would they.
---
ok, well.. now i'm going back to herod..
---
lmao jk
---
Play what you want to play cause you will be doing it and looking at it for, as they said, at least 200 hours.  Maybe just pay attention to what is the reality of certain meme specs end game so as to not be diasappointed.  I am led to believe that certain meme specs are difficult for the normal player to do well with end game.  Im talking moonkin ans feral druid.  You might love feral but if what have seen is true the reality of it will force you to respec into healing endgame.  Unless you are a certain type of player and have the agreement of your crew.
---
An open beta won't help you decide what you want to play
---
As long as it's not 90% of the gear for every spec then it's not an issue. The video I saw made it sound much more game breaking than you guys do!
---
Most of our lives will end.
---
Oh another "you're all gonna get bored without changes" thread. Joy.

You're a wizard, u/tubbis9001
---
Well I havent played since just after BFA launched and this was before... So nah.
---
Sorry friend, you’ve very clearly proven you have no idea what you’re talking about. There’s a reason these classes didn’t get fixed in vanilla with a simple number change and instead underwent major overhauls in TBC. And not even just the struggling specs, but all of them.
---
In my opinion the purpose of an AMA is to get a feel for the issues that are on most the community's mind, so I feel it makes sense that people will ask about layering. I personally want to know what the layering backup plan is now that Herod will most likely be overfilled for much longer than anticipated.
---
Yes but you don't seem them often.
---
Curious at how they determined these without being able to login to the world.
---
Social!  Basically, in vanilla it takes a long tind to get things done, and some things are really difficult to accomplish solo.  Without guildmates or friends, it can be veru frustrating.
---
In vanilla you just make friends naturally.  You're trying to kill this 1 mob for a quest but everyone else tags it before you... so you just make a group amd invite everyone nearby doing the same quest, and you all get it done much faster than waiting for it to respawn 5 times.  
---
Dungeons have great gear, but can be difficult/impossible with a bad group.  So when you find good tanks/dps/heals you add them to your friend list, or join their guild etc...  so you can group up with them again.
---
There are many examples of this... so what makes vanilla so great for me is the solid friendships I made in game, and the fun we had together. 
---
I'm so stoked! :-)
---
Get off that fucking game and come play with your fucking kids!!!
---
Its more like, most graveyards are located in or next to the major quest hubs. So say you're in Westfall and you just completed the Defias kill quest inside the far north mine. Instead of having to fight your way out of the mine and run all the way back to Sentinel Hill, you can instead just die and spirit rez to get there instantly and turn in your quest. You're probably only lvl 13/14 by this point anyways, so you only get 3-4 minutes res sickness. By the time you turn in your quests, pick up new ones, and hike over to a new area, you res sickness is gone and you're good to go again.
---
My pc is older than wrath and can't run classic full graphics smoothly
---
When I first played the game I remember traveling to Mulgore and and Tirisfel glades as an Orc, because I wasn't grinding. It took longer but it was actually really fun to go "adventuring" that early
---
Nor that they won't ban you if you ask them something they don't like on their forums.
---
True, new players or returning players or players looking for that fresh fresh fresh whatever
---
I am an Spriest, been an spriest since vanilla.  Holy for MC - BWL in vanilla, but Spriest from there on (we were all dumber back then) and spriest for pvp. Spriest for all of BC/Wotlk/Cata/etc. Small forays into DISC for arenas.
---
I love Spriest. But it's a sad PvE class in classic. I plan to ding 60 within 10 days of go-live and want to get front-running good gear for blowing up PvP/etc but afraid I can't get good Spriest gear in raid. 
---
SO! That being said... probably speed running another class to 60 that is both a PvP and PvE beast and actually gets gear from raids. Thoughts: Warrior/Mage/Rogue...
---
Pros for Mage: similar play style (range caster dps) to Spriest which I'm used too. Easy to level, easy to gear.  
---
Cons for Mage: Not learning to play something other than caster dps.  
---
Pros for Warrior: I can learn to tank, I can learn to play melee dps. Awesome pvp class with gear  
---
Cons for rogue: Harder to level, weapon dependent for leveling. Probably lots of warriors to compete with.
---
Pros for Rogue: Similar to warrior but more fun play style (probably).  
---
Cons for rogue: Harder to level, weapon dependent for leveling.
---
That was pretty much the last stress test. You missed out man.
---
1-10 is pretty slow as not having a pet and having to melee when mobs get to close to you, but overall hunters are pretty solid, and don't forget to keep your pet feed :)
---
But noone would have found it.
---
See ya there, brother! I decided against warlock though, since one of the people in my group of mates planning on getting in to classic together has his heart set on warlock, so I settled on mage. If you see a troll mage called Zig, say hello!
---
&gt; take a break.
---
Sorry, a what?
---
And a sober guy sad.
---
Sure, we should voice our concerns but I think the main problem here is that we don't know enough about the way layering is intended to work because blizz is not telling us. That's creating alot of unnecessary anger and concern.
---
I think we should all make it clear that we want them to explain it and hopefully understand a bit more what their reasoning is before we all jump on the big old rage train.
---
Alot of the hate so far blizz brought on themselves anyway for not communicating better so hopefully the ama can alleviate that.
---
&gt; Back in the day Alliance and Horde felt pretty disconnected from each other
---
I used to frequent the server forums, they were very much connected lol. Although... it wasn't always uh... civil.
---
I think you underestimate neckbeards and there will to win at anything. Pservers have been up for years and they have had all the practice in the world. Rag was killed within the second week on one of the more recent servers.
---
guilty
---
Exactly. People have been wanting classic for a long time because it's not retail. And now that it's here they want to change it to be more like retail??? It's a big circle. I don't understand how some people don't see this lunacy.
---
Feel free to save my username and ask questions later on if you need some advice! I seem to have a gift when it comes to weapons, but I can't make armor for the life of me..
---
Undead for 1 very simple reason. Nonthing in pvp says "fuck you!" Like killing someone, then eating their corpse
---
Pick the class you want to play most. Don’t take other peoples preferences. It’s *your* character.
---
I just see it as phasing being rather trivial whereas being 4 to 6 months behind the majority is a significant disadvantage.  
---
Chat isn't affected by phasing so it's really not that impactful, but it will be harder to find groups when the masses have already gotten what they need from dungeons which will compound the problem of being behind even further.
---
If you're going to be playing casually then nbd, but if you're like me and concerned with progression at all then it's not even a choice.
---
It's either Thex or XxLegolasxX
---
If I'll ever hate myself enough to make a priest it will be a Dwarf female with the 2 long ass ponytails. They do a hippo helicopter shit when you cast.
---
What happened to Teldrassil???
---
They just updated the twitch app around an hour ago, seems they improved classic support now :)
---
Here's Kevin Jordan, class designer for Vanilla, on why Paladins were not given taunt:
---
&gt; So, Prot Paladin is supposed to be damage from being hit, right? Retribution Aura, Holy Shield, You know? I would generate threat this way, I would punish evil for daring to attack me. And then on top of that we wanted his taunt to be more of a rescue operation than a direct insult, right? Like a Warrior is just like: Hey you, you’re a jerk, come attack me. Very direct. I’m intimidating. Whereas for a Paladin the idea was Oh one of my frieds is in trouble, I’ll cast a spell on my friend and it will transfer the threat to me and get that monster to come over and, right? So that’s more in mind with the thematic of he’s a protector and a saver rather than, you know, like a direct yelling and screaming.
---
&gt; So that’s was the thematic approach. The mechanics were difficult because it was much harder to switch targets and use an ability on a friend without the smart targeting stuff that eventually went in. It wasn’t just, you know, hit taunt on the thing that you were already targeting so we had some mechanical difficulties. He was fine generating threat as long as the thing was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, where as the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.

&gt; It’s one of those things where we didn’t have the idea worked out yet and we didn’t want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can’t take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It’s very difficult to take mechanics away. We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt so we were still experimenting and learning as we went but our goal and **our philosophy was always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the paladin tank a certain way make the warrior tank a certain way and to a lesser extent make the void walker tank a certain way**, just have him feel differently, have the function differently so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.

Raiding isn't even the main focus of Vanilla, and it isn't what makes the game great or fun. That's a retail mentality, not a Vanilla mentality. Leveling, PvP, professions, dungeons, community involvement, and more are what come together to make the game great as a whole, and retail has lost pretty much all of those, leading people to hyperfocus on raid and "class balance" when its actually just them looking at the meters in raiding and not understanding that classes provide more than what you see on the meters.

all server will be full at launch

I've leveled with guides before and plan to again. In 40-50 hours (no work that week, so easy to achieve) I'll be 40. After I hit 40 I start the real game... AH profiteeting

It’s usefulness comes from PVP where spell schools being locked is a very real threat to your existence.

On pserver i have seen it at around 8h, so pretty cheap
---
FF14 is amazing if you love story, dungeons, and raiding. The new expansion is leaps and bounds better than any previous content.
---
Now, if you like to PvP, FF14 will not scratch that itch. It exists, hardly anyone actually plays it, and it is all around meh.
---
Bah. Mods removed the post. I finally had a witty comment.
---
I hope this team is more upfront and transparent than the BfA devs. When they do Q&amp;As they only answer silly meme questions and anytime a serious question gets through they skirt around the issue and end up answering nothing. It's great of them to have some fun with the Q&amp;A but they only present half-answers. The Classic community (rightfully) takes Layering very seriously, and as such I think the developers should address it with the respect it deserves.
---
You can also keep in mind that each different race in classic offers a slightly different play style in leveling, Pve, and PvP due to both faction differences as well as race specific abilities.
---
There’s no danger of publishing the IPs as they do not accept traffic from anything but the game client. Blizzard publishes themselves in their Looking Glass web app, it just hasn’t been updated for Classic yet.
---
The IPs for each realm aren’t static, they’re only useful for determining what data center each realm is hosted in. Trying to determine which realm in the same data center you should play on based on latency is foolish. That latency (and the associated IPs) can and will change by the minute, hour, or day.
---
😂😂
---
Lose-lose situation for blizzard in this regard. Either they underestimate it and everyone takes to the servers to condemn them for not forseeing it; or they overestimate it and everyone condemns them for the dead servers they created.
---
Lol who groups for elites you can easily solo it without thinking XD
---
Is that a blue moon? Also, nice
---
If you're not trolling, then that just means you're a rude, unreasonable and unfun person. There's nothing to argue here, you're wrong and you're too egotistical and stubborn to just accept that someone can have fun playing a video game in a way that you don't consider fun, and that their idea of fun is completely fine, not harrasment and by no means warrants calling them pathetic or belittling them in any way.

Running around in Ironforge only seeing a couple of people. Getting sharded out of the groups layer while playing with friends. Yeah to a big degree layering is cluncky and unnecessary. Vanilla servers can easily have 10 000 + pop and still be fun.

Basically, Woody Harrelson's PR team faked a Reddit AMA. It wasn't really him, he didn't answer any questions, and he constantly tried to steer the conversation toward advertising his new movie. It was a disaster. This AMA was so disastrous that they changed the rules and started to require proof that the actual person was the one answering the questions. Even to the point were a Reddit Admin would be the one transcribing their answers. That's how powerful the blowback was.
---
You don't understand why people would want to be competitive in a video game? Or why people would want to be efficient in a game which could swallow thousands of hours of your life?
---
Nah man you're right, hitting lvl 60 at 20 days played 6 months in is what a true gamer would do.
---
LunaUnitFrames in 1.12 was able to emulate a focus frame.  Is that method not working in 1.13, as you were saying?

False on the bonus stats and BT does have the fastest attack speed, but his damage is normalized regardless.

(On the right side, Recent Files -&gt; WoW Classic, currently r905-beta-classic)

Yeah it's all in jest ;) I think it's an awesome build.

Eh too much leds

Did you miss the 3/4 stress tests?

Because I’ve done 1-60 3 times now. I’ve already seen all there is to offer
---
The realms can easily have 10k+ pop all at the same time. With modern hardware L hope did this easily.
---
Takes some pretty big balls to put yourself out there like that. Explains the pant size.
---
This is all speculation, so don't take this as fact.
---
I would guess the fastest anyone is going to get 60 in classic is 4-5d played(in optimal condition) and it's not going to be even close to that on release, since there is going to be lot of competition over mobs and wpvp since herod is pvp server. I would guess the first 60 is going to be like 7-8d played, so getting 60 on the first week is not gonna happen.
---
Love the LEDs in the case!!!
---
I’m sure Ironforge probably is empty, the game doesn’t come out until the 26th. You’re playing an unreleased game apparently
---
Looking foward to see Ashenvale and Auberdine in their „not destroyed“ state. Heck I’ll gladly visit my old ~~nightmare~~ best friend: sleepy bear druid.
---
You're totally right, Blizz has assured us that layering won't be here to stay. But what worries me is that they constantly change the time-frame. "Opening weeks" went to "a couple of months" and most recently "removed by phase 2" - which is it?
---
Surprise surprise, a starter zone shared by two races is going to have twice as many players.
---
Also that's still nowhere near 1000 people, lol
---
Nice moves matey
---
Can i ask is retail and classic on the same client version now?
---
I basically want to install classic addons and set them up on retail because im not subbing until closer to classic release. 
---
so install classic addons on retail , use the 1-20 free character to configure everything and make sure im happy with the addons 
---
there is likely some way i could copy the interface to classic but im not too fussed about that 
---
also i assume all macros i setup on retail will be functional once i manually copy them over to classic or are some macro functions disabled 
---
bit of a strange question but i dont really feel like wasting 10+ days of a sub, and when i sub the beta will be done with

Vanilla hype is sky high literally 1 new server is added and the sub thinks its gonna be "dead" lmao.

---
Lol How did they break? He didn't specify numbers at all.  You're just completely blowing it out of proportion.   So a mana buff for ele and boomkin to allow 2 more casts before oom is OP?
---
Wrong Jaina skin.
---
Followed by *Sympathy For The Devil*
---
I made it to 1 and the lvl cap was 15 and was working 7 days a week so I couldn’t do much. It is what it is they hype for launch is driving me insane.
---
Honestly, I think the best pieces of advice I can give you are:
---
- Don't learn to much about the game ahead of time, half the fun is exploring the unknown and finding things out for yourself. 
---
- Don't listen to people telling you not to play certain classes. Play whatever class you want, and if you don't like it just play something else! 
---
- Try everything! Do some PvP as soon as you can, run a dungeon, visit a city that you like the looks of, try out professions etc etc.
---
small brain
---
Respect
---
Once I get pounce I agree. Pounce - Rake - Moon - IS - shift to Cat - melee down
---
This build is more about killing and surviving in PvP. So it won't be that efficient while leveling but I think the damage is going to be good enough
---
Something something corrupt administrators
---
Most the servers are already full a week before launch looks far from ruined.
---
I only ever really use Org on my rogue since they have the trainer and poison vendor there and I hate UC. Otherwise I'm all about TB.

That’s hilarious, well done on making me properly laugh

Isn’t it lucky we have all time travellers coming back from the future to tell us about what killed classic.
---
If anyone has the name “Hey” I’d be willing to purchase it....
---
As if Ashenvale and Auberdine didn’t got hit hard they destroyed them even more in BFA (Rip Teldrassil)
---
If you are a hunter you NEED to buy a bow/gun, its a huge boost. I did it in the open beta and I got a nice dmg boost, really needed for those levels without pet
---
It wouldn't help you at all.
---
You have to decide at launch.
---
It was a great experience playing on that server.
---
Haha good eye
---
ur right layering has ruined classic. its gonna suck. you probably shouldn't even bother playing tbh
---
Whatever you say pal!
---
Right. It's going to explode on Launch.
---
Kirkland indeed
---
I don't know what y'all are talking about. There are so many textures that could've easily been touched up to look significantly better. I am returning to classic for the game that wow was, not how it looked; I still cant help but feel that they could've really made it shine yet they didn't. Granted I didn't get to see all that much during the stress tests but I'm looking at my lvl 1 character i made and most of the textures are gross.
---
This is the nerdiest fucking thing I have ever seen in my whole god damn life.

I love it.

Tauren cat + Barrens = Everything I need

Be first into the nelf starting zone and /yell "first", and spend the next 5-10 minutes running naked around all the people who weren't first.

I deleted my 3 characters off of Faerlina and made 3 more on Stalagg with no issues.
---
leddit
---
Amen brother.
---
Can we get a drake meme with this meme in it?
---
Honestly, i quite enjoyed leveling as paladin when i tried it in private servers - did it WOTLK, mind, so i knew the class a bit.  
---
It's one of the few classes who can pull more than one mob without being in trouble, and you can heal low lvl dungeons while being in ret spec.  
---
Also a good healer both pve and pvp in endgame.  
---
Expect that you "have to" heal, though, even though ret can be decent in pvp.
---
Thank you, I’m sorry they affect you though.
---
That wasn't my point. I meant that on a long enough time scale even a casual player will be able to aquire pre-raid BiS loot and get into a pug MC group. It just might take you a few months longer than the hardcore people.
---
Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you
---
Yeah I wont. If I play some games right now its gonna be Pavlov VR or Mordhau.
---
Back in the day me and the boys considered STV to be a right of passage.
---
I think people are going to be really surprised by the popularity of Grobbulus. Already has the most active server subreddit, booming discord, and strong sense of identity. Grob Mob for life!
---
This is just plain not true.
---
Guess that’s good cause it would probably violate T&amp;Cs?
---
I prefer the look of gnomes.  
---
Not sure why they get so much hate... Am i weird?
---
Yeah. And they dont have to layer. Dynamic respawns fixes the population issue easily.
---
Vanilla at my parent’s house likely had those stats... this time around, not so much lol
---
Well, I explained below, but you’re clearly struggling so I’ll help you by repeating here.
---
He’s saying reduce mana cost for boomkin and ele to compete with mages and warlocks. The only thing that allows mages and warlocks to sustain mana, say for a 5 minute encounter for example, is potions, gems, evocation, lifetap. Shaman and Druid’s have no such abilities. So the cost would have to be so low they can chain cast an entire fight and never go oom.
---
Infinite mana isn’t broken? Interesting

Yeah but I think this video relies on the demented face of bilbo as he snatches for it, comparing that to the hunter who convinced himself he was fine to roll because he deserves the weapon

I raided most of Vanilla up til Naxx as 20/31/0. I was the designated MT warlock with imp imp and I definitely could push a lot harder than the other warlocks who were having major threat issues.
---
... but even then I had to hold back a lot. Most of the time I did more dps than our SM/Ruin and DS/Ruin locks or even the rest of the raid.
---
At the start of Naxx I was still running 20/31/0 but I noticed I was nowhere near the MT. I was quite undergeared compared to the rest so I tried both DS/Ruin and SM/Ruin, I believe I still had no threat problems after that.

Notice the lack of potions and worldbuffs. On private servers the MT is buffed to the gills which would give warlocks a lot more space to push their limits. 
---
There were not many differences between Vanilla and privateservers but they did change the game. Classic will just be as different, most things will carry over but there will be nuances.
---
he said + not 30 exact. yes that makes him almost mid thirties
---
That name is unavailable, as it was lost at sea in the form of a tennis ball with a smile face  by a stranded man who vaguely resembles Tom Hanks. I could however recommend you roll a gnome football with the name Nilson.
---
I just might!!
---
You will not change the Blizzard can do no wrong groups mind, so this entire discussion has no value sadly. Layering will be in the game, the effect layering has on socialization, early pvp and most specifically the economy will be huge and Blizzard has decided they want it anyway.
---
They put more value on people having an overall enjoyable experience.... than actually playing a multiplayer game in a packed world with other humans.
---
That wouldn't really work. The new character models have a different number of settings than the old ones, so they can't be equalized. They'd have to update all the old models, which doesn't seem worthwhile.
---
Love Ironfoe!

I'm so hyped I'll start wPvPing irl soon

Would up vote multiple times if I could.
---
It's not bad, pisses you off sometimes but if you're a Rogue you'll be at a huge advantage with stealth and can avoid lots of deaths (or cause them).
---
That's fine they speak pretty good English for the most part, and everyone needs more Canadians in their life.
---
So the mana is stored in the balls? Drinking water makes so much sense to recover mana...
---
toxic
---
I think they extended the deadline because they realized they cant make a shorter/exact promise before they have a launch with actual population metrics. So they should have just said by phase 2 from the get go. I agree with you that its been stupidly communicated, 100%!
