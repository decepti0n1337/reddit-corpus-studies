 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---

---
Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.  
---
Raid Schedule: Tuesday / Wednesday / Thursday 6 - 9 PST, 7 - 10 MST, 8 - 11 CST, 9 - 12 EST.

Ahh yes, he’s working on it with Ayle.
---
Yeah, it's big brain time.
---
Prot Paladin is fantastic in dungeon content, but lacks a taunt so will never raid.
---
Well reading all the information on the sub you're posting on is a start...
---
Good point he plays a ton of overwatch and roblox I think is the name. So I never know what’s going to interest him. He’s played everything from ocarina of time to spider man 4
---
Mage Bois are in the BG tonight
---
Gonna Pom Pyro those Hordies all night
---
Honest question ! Do you not care about building a strong character at max ?
---
19 at launch. RIP Winter 2005 semester.
---
Just play on private servers, they'll definitely still exist even with classics launch because they make that $$
---
They wanted to hook you good lol.
---
Why don't you just pause the game?
---
This is exactly the type of content I'm talking about. Long rewarding quests (and some short less rewarding ones). And each quest doesn't need to have BIS gear. Just a few items for each class, like 3 (for example). Throw in a few 3rd or 4th best items which are only a minor 5-10% reduction under BIS. Others could be rewards like collectables (like titles). Furthermore, others could just be fun quests with some gold reward. Not everything needs to be in pursuit of BIS but having a few bis items linked to actions you can do outside of raid is very vanilla like.
---
Also, not dailies or weeklies to get the gear. Just no.
---
Trueshot aura is better before AQ 40, imp wing clip is enough until that, just a tip,  put 1 point into trap mastery as a resisted trap alot of the time means death.
---
Hahah I can’t wait to be part of that rogue group finally. AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. I ANSWER TO MY TRUE CALLING. PREPARE YOURSELFS ALLIANCE
---
&gt; Shadow resist gear to easy mode gank warlocks
---
If you have enough shadow resist to actually make a difference on incoming damage from a warlock then you have sacraficed every other stat to get there and you won't be ganking *anyone*
---
It aint that serious. I've got 7 days booked off work, will be online for the first 24 hours and then will sleep. After 24 hours I expect to be mid 20's unless there are server issues. The key is getting ahead of the pack and staying there.
---
Thanks for the info, guess its just more of a hidden recipe instead.

# &lt;Forty Decent People&gt; 18+ NA Horde PvE Competent Raiding
---
We are an 18+ PvE Horde guild of goal oriented individuals who aim to clear all the PvE content that Classic WoW has to offer, and to have a good time doing it. With the ultimate goal of defeating Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
Leadership is experienced in raiding and we are currently in the process of recruiting more Officers, Raiders, deciding which PvE server to play on, and the guild tabard design.
---
All raid times are EST. We plan to raid 2 nights a week so people do not get burned out. If there is high demand for raids outside of these times, those discussions will be had once phase 4 is on the horizon because clearing MC, Ony, and BWL in two nights is quite doable. Tuesday 7-12PM Thursday 7-12PM
---
Loot will be given out by loot council. Primary decision makers are the Class Officers, with other officers and Master Looter serving as oversight to (hopefully) prevent most loot drama.
---
No single person has ever carried a 40 man raid to victory. You do not need to be an all star to join us. However, you do need to be able to pull your own weight in the raid. If we can assemble 40+ people who all pull their own weight, not a single raid boss will stand in our way.
---
If you aren't looking to raid, but want to be a part of the guild to run dungeons with or just hang out, there is room for you in our ranks as well. **You only need to post an application if you want to raid.**
---
Please, do not apply if:
---
\- You cannot respect your fellow raiders, even if they have made a mistake that caused a wipe.
---
\- Multiple raid wipes make you emotionally unstable or hopeless.
---
\- You cannot speak on voice coms.
---
\- You feel like playing for 5 hours 2 times a week is too much of a commitment for you.
---
Do apply if:
---
\- You are a relaxed person who's fun to play with.
---
\- You are willing to make a long-term commitment to take down Kel'Thuzad and C'Thun.
---
\- You are dedicated to improve and build the raid team with us.
---
If you read this far, you may be the kind of player we are looking for, if you have questions you can ask them in our Discord, or PM me on discord. The "get-applications-here" channel has instructions on how to apply. Everyone who raids with us applies. Even Shizune the guild leader.

I believe Monkeynews does it in 5+ while grinding honor, but week 1 rah kill is going to be a race that’s down to the wire.
---
Yeah that's how it's done on private servers at least. Someone said that spot shouldn't work and that the range of the knockback is wrong, so I thought maybe that's why melee wore FR gear back then but not on private servers.
---
Thank you for calling out hypocrisy, you rock!
---
I don't understand how so many people lack basic reasoning skills.
---
These things are true at the same time.
---
You should play what you find fun, and also if you find raiding fun, then what you find fun will be something good at raiding.
---
It's not fucking rocket surgery.
---
Id say when you spend as much time in game ad you would a full time job then you are probably a hardcore player.
---
Im gonna guesstimate ill spend on avg 20 hours or so a week playing sometimrd a bit more. Especially on launch
---
CB + Preparation build sounds intriguing
---
Stray pets were so annoying, nothing was worse than when somehow two random hunter pets are on you as a caster. Especially if the nobody else attacked you, just the pets being ignored that wipes you out.
---
Started in BC, aged 42.  Old fart.
---
Of course there will be a bajillion nodes and if your layer doesn’t have them just hop to one that does... duh
---
I liked it when sor became a standard in the priest package. You were in a full raid. Suddenly, fail angel. "did you stand in shit again" "yes"
---
The core game is the same but the endgame is MUCH different. The outer world is dead in TBC and people only really play for instanced content.
---
Never bought my epic flyer in actual TBC because there was no need for it. I never spent time in the open world.
---
Here's something i plan to do
---
So you know how dying in Felwood is a pain in the ass right?
---
Well at the Horde Flight path, if you jump off the cliff you will fall down about 1/3 of the way, die, and ghost in Darkshore.
---
So this means you'll have to run all the way through Darkshore &gt; Ashenvale &gt; 1/2 of Felwood. THEN you'll have to jump off the cliff as a ghost and rez at your body. The only problem is that there's no safe way down, so if you dont have Hearth up you will fall down another third of the way, die, make the run AGAIN, rez, then jump down again, die, run, rez, and then you'll be able to rez at a safe place.
---
So essentially dying at that cliff in felwood is guaranteed to make you rez sick, hearth, or die 3 times.
---
As a Nelf Spriest, you can wait by the FP in shadowmeld, and when an unsuspecting horde lands you MC them, and make them run off the cliff. If you do it right they take durability damage too. You can do this as much as you want.
---
I was 13 in 2004 c: 1991 coming in hot
---
just suck his balls
---
[This is your standard build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/205300105041-3023-05025302030011).
---
Tbf, first hitting 60 is more relevant than in Naxx gear. If it's significant enough as a fresh 60, it could mean the difference between a raid spot as a feral which could affect whether or not you even make it to Naxx with a guild.
---
I don't think 112 AP is enough to make that difference, especially as you mentioned MCPs exist, but let's not dismiss the difference as just a 4% difference in a situation only a small fraction of players will experience, and it'll probably be 1.5-2 years into the game
---
I am curious though, is there a source on the 112 AP number? How was it determined if Beta didn't have 60s? Was it just extrapolated from level 10-40 and 58 data and it's offset by a confirmed formula?
---
You hit it on the head with pre BWL. When I'm talking about Classic+ I'm talking about new zones opening. This new zone needs to be consistent with the idea that the new raid doesn't dictate the fun. This means a few new hubs in one location, a few new dungeons, maybe a new raid. But it doesn't need to be limited to one location. Those quests could open new quest-lines in other parts of the world so it doesn't feel like the rest of the world is abandoned like current expansions do. The gear can come from all of these sources and doesn't need to replace all current gear.
---
just fuck his cock
---
Coin flip is how I base all my life decisions.
---
Is there an actual source? Interested in the testing procedures, the math, and the details
---
&gt;Someone said that spot shouldn't work and that the range of the knockback is wrong
---
It did work back in vanilla, so I have no idea what they are talking about.
---
Entrapment is better than Improved Wing Clip. Counterattack is a waste of a talent point 99% of the time.
---
I'm not playing Hunter but this is awesome and I hope it catches on for other classes. Thanks
---
Just autohotkey keybind that constant switches between the two. 100% bannable as fuck but worth a shot
---
15 TBC
---
Don't forget about the lollerskates macro
---
&gt;Druids, Paladins, and Shamans are terrible healers compared to priest. If you choose to roll a Druid, Paladin, or Shaman you can ONLY play heal spec 
---
These are not mutually exclusive statements. It is quite possible that people might consider the non-healer specs of those classes to be absolute rubbish so if you are going to play as any of those three classes you should play as a healer despite the opinion that Priest is a superior healer.
---
i.e. If you are going to pick a shitty class you may as well not be completely worthless.
---
Dont worry the Light says it's fine.
---
Always fight at the flags in battlegrounds and not the roads!
---
I liked pservers, i played on 3 different one that did spell batching (one worked blizzlike) and most all pserver players said no thank you to that shit. It was always quickly removed.
---
Why? It just feels bad. It feels bad in raid, leveling, farming, and pvp.
---
34
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I'm not sure about the auto down ranking (never tested it), but  /cast SpellName definitely did cast you highest level version of the spell, while dragging a spell from you spellbook without a macro would cast only that specific rank.

**&lt;Plasma&gt; [H] [NA] [PvP]**
---
Are you interested in Classic WoW and want to be in a successful and positive guild, led by Leaders who raid at the top level.? 
---
Plasma is one of **The Largest and most active Horde Classic Guilds** focused solely on Classic, looking to have 3 teams going into Launch. Currently 400+ Members. We will put initial focus on raiding once Classic releases, and will then begin to start focusing on PvP as well once Blizz releases honor system in Phase 2. A large majority of us currently play on Private Servers, so we have all the resources and information anyone would need to be ready for Launch and the raids. **Also had multiple of us on Beta as well and we are currently raiding on our own Pserver with 60 Boosts.**
---
**Guild and Raids will be Lead by all current CE level Raiders on Live for the past few tiers as well as successful raiders from Vanilla menza and said Private Servers.**
---
**Please keep in mind that while we have a lot of members, we also have a lot of casual players who just want a safe and friendly place to level with friends and enjoy the game. However, we take our raid teams very serious. With that being said, it is not mandatory to raid. You are more than welcome to join if you just want a place to call home while you enjoy the game that started it all.**
---
**For more information or if you’d like to join, just shoot me a message or comment on here.

How do u play without your hands?

Its the 7.x server or client. Remember nochanges was never a thing off the bat.
---
Classic+ w/ &lt;Mythic+ server side only. Hear me out... 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There's a lot of chatter here already about making new 5-man dungeons that scale up to Naxx level gear. The problem with this is that if you start scaling dungeon gear to the same level as raid gear, then you're limiting the reason to do raids in the first place. Raids are hard(er) than 5-mans generally, and one big reason they are more difficult is because of the scale of coordination both in-game and in-discord (previously ventrilo). 
---
What could be the proposed solution to not disenfranchise those people who spend days upon days getting attuned and raid ready when there's simply an "easier" way to get the same gear from a 5-man that is objectively "easier" due to the lack of need for large scale coordination? 
---
Like it or not, part of what made Vanilla so attractive to people was gaining an individual or group reputation for being the best, fastest, and strongest. With that, I'll toss it back to anyone who can solve for this. 
---
I'll propose one solution in the form of Mythic dungeons, but the gear rewards do not scale with the keystone, rather, you're offered a chance at cosmetic upgrades and titles that coincide with your level of group skill. Pretend for a moment that you're now able to gain a server reputation for being the best tank in mythic+ and you've got the only title for rank 15 mythic+ on the server much like it was an achievement to gain the rank 14 title in PvP or become a Scarab Lord. Could be cool as hell. That to me, would maintain the integrity of the original game, allow for more competitive style PvE, allow more personal recognition in the form of social clout and cosmetic grandeur, and give us that sweet sweet content that we're all going to be crying out for in 2 years. 
---
To add to this, I don't want to play TBC or Wrath again. Those expansions broke a lot of what Vanilla built and though I loved both of them, I don't believe releasing multiple multiple multiple versions of the game is good for the community aspect, which is another HUGE part of why people are so excited for Classic.
---
Druid ? What
---
Played Horde in Vanilla and the first half of TBC
---
The game was heavily populated by Alliance until Horde got Blood Elves.
---
Played Alliance on private vanilla servers and we mostly out popped the horde, still except for "Kr oh noes" 1 and 2. "Borth Hale" private was again mostly alliance but that was due to the no lifers all rolling alliance on purpose.
---
UD animations are way cooler than troll animations and you'll definitely score more chicks playing UD
---
Tuesday nights.... wait...
---
Your build is the best you can make for raid tanking. But you're missing a lot of key talents for filling other roles. If you're not the main tank of your guild, then you would benefit more from a hybrid spec that picks up either more cat form talents or healing talents.
---
For leveling: I recommend picking cat form talents instead of bear form talents. You are more than capable of tanking every single dungeon with a cat build. Respec @ 60 when you get there. Here's what I plan to level with: [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=01400530100000005050021323202151050000000000000](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=01400530100000005050021323202151050000000000000)
---
31 points in Feral first. Then Furor. Then put that last point into Imp Shred. And finally, max out the Balance tree.
---
I think you are completly right!
---
I think it is possible to create more five man progression. The difficulty of these dungeons should be set at tbc heroics (as they were in blues= mechanichally harder than most raids) when at tier 0,5 level and you might need to do the full d2 chain as an attunement? (Or a likewise grueling attunement) This way it would never turn into a catch up mechanism as that is some major work that very few did back in the days so it would never become the easiest way to gear up for raiders.
---
The important thing with this kind of addition is that you always have something to strive for.
---
These dungeons (and ten man Raid?) could then drop a d3 set that could be upgraded to d4. The associated quests could also send people all over the world.

I envy those who can game more than 12 straight hours. I could do it even 48h straight back in vanilla when i was a teenager, now in my 30s i cant even fucking game over 3h  when i have free time, my lower back hurts, my ass hurts after some time, i get sleepy etc. Fuck me.
---
Thanks, for a bit i almost forgot which part of reddit i was on!
---
???
---
What addon
---
15, quit halfway in TBC and my life improved drastically.
---
Can't wait to throw away endless hours again at videya.
---
&gt; i disagree. im pretty sure a vast majority of people who are oldschool wow fans know about spell batching. its base knowledge for everyone who has so much as dabbled in pvp
---
I didn't really know about batching until I started raiding in TBC and reading about the mechanics in detail. In vanilla I just thought it was lag and bugginess that sometimes I threw out a last-minute heal and people died anyway.
---
Just need to play any class with a heal then
---
That sounds Ballad of the Noob, but it wasnt a twink and it didn't have Hey Ya playing lol
---
...You're a female? Huzzah! I never thought I'd see the day; it's a shame you're taken.
---
Just do like me. Go level up to 55 and above without doing the totem quests :)
---
Hunter: Feign Death into Shadowmeld
---
The Xp was changed then but the TBC talents and all the extra lower quests that were added at lunch did help in making leveling easier.
---
x x x x x x x x x x x x
---
That's a fair point, my counter argument would be that unless you have a second character it's extremely inefficient to farm 20 mins at gnomer, then go do something else non instanced based for 40 minutes (So no helping guildies through dungeons, farming dungeons for pre BiS or gold.) and then riding all the way back to gnomer. 
---
At best you could herb or mine for 40 minutes in between? (Also does instance lock count for BGs when those come out?)
---
Omg I just understood it 😂
---
If they were properly gated behind LONG questlines taking place in endgame(naxx+) raids, I'd agree with this.
---
Think scepter questline to create a raid ready elemental shaman, oomkin or ret paladin.
---
If they were extreme luxury speccs confined to those who really put their time in, It'd actually work without disrupting the game too much.

Because it's not your best attack, it's not even an attack at all.

Max rank Shadowguard costs 294% more mana and with 400 +damage (which is totally possible with pre-raid gear), it only does 18% more damage.

* Save your money otherwise, loot as much as you can
---
* If you are a pet class keep it on passive when in groups and be mindful of it, your pet can get everyone killed
---
* I wouldn't recommend a warrior, paladin, shaman, or druid to start.
---
* I wouldn't recommend taking enchanting.
---
* If you don't feel the need/desire to do tradeskills I would get skinning and keep it up, the leather will help you with cash
---
* If things are a close level to you try and kill them if you can, the exp and money is worth it, even if it's not for a quest
---
These would be the beginner tips I can think of.
---
Hurry gurdy gurdy, in the windae boxes.

Please don't spec 0/30/21 if you're planning on raiding as cat dps. Even with ideal talents that are missing here (Natural Shapeshifter, LOTP, OoC, Natural Weapons), tryhard raid consumables (MCP, mana pots / dark runes, dps elixirs), and an experienced pilot (minimum time lost executing the rotation which is probably top 2 hardest to get right), cat dps is tough to compete with. Having none of those is no doubt going to put you at the bottom of the totem pole in dps.
---
If you want to be a flexible player that can tank one boss, heal another, and dps another; or raid as bear/healer and not respec for PvP or farming as cat, etc.... HOTW is phenomenal. But if you're trying to tell your raid that your main spec is cat and are spending dkp on cat gear over bear/healer gear, don't go 0/30/21
---
Also as others mentioned, the single point in Nature's Grasp is recommended for PvP over the final point in HOTW
---
Right out of the womb.
---
Yep. Whatever gear they ask for is gonna generate hate; dps rings, necklaces etc. piss off melee dps, if they ask for pally gear the pally healers will scream (even if they don't use it, they'll say they are doing what a pally is supposed to do so they should get dibbs), they'll be at least a couple of warriors who get pissed if they want a two hander (I know the meta is duel fury, but like a warrior off tank may want the two hander for fights they aren't needed to tank in), and their dps will be shit.
---
And I played a pally from closed beta to wrath. Why anyone picks this class and thinks dps is beyond me. We can pull off some miraculous crap and are awesome healers; go warrior or rogue if you want to melee dps.
---
When I was in the more recent classic beta, granted level 40 cap so not raiding, but we already had pallies arguing they should change pallies to let them tank and dps AT ENDGAME raiding. Sigh.
---
This post inspired me to make this
---
emotes during the fight always would be something that stayed in my head after i had just gotten owned, so i started doing it too
---
The discussion includes leveling. You need to spend less time constructing strawmans to argue with and more time figuring out what everyone else is talking about
---
Looks good.
---
I played a shaman back then (enh / ele hybrid) and would like to play a shaman again, but nowadays, people actually know how to play, what to bring, how to optimize a raid / PUG. I fear not getting a spot unless I spec heal.   
---
Then I think about going melee on horde side, for juicy WF totem shennanigans, most likely rogue as it is more suited to solo pvp than warrior...but guarding flag / farm.  
---
I'll just roll with shaman for nostalgia and probably never play serious anyway.
---
Blizzard is pretty known for being Mac compatible. It will work for you too!
---
20% healing is very weak. Honestly no healer is going to care that much about 20% reduction, either in throughput or efficiency. It's rarely worth spending the global to cast.
---
&gt; just trying to get the minmax input for all types of PvP specifically
---
While he does mention leveling, it is not the primary discussion topic.
---
This is true but poisons are a debuff category and not a CC category. Debuff categories are Poison, Disease, Magic, Curse, Bleed (don't know if I'm missing one) which can be removed by dispels, abolishes, cures, Luffa, Anti-Venom, etc. Think of the CC categories as the ones removable by the Insignia PvP trinkets. So something can have both a debuff and CC category (polymorph=magic+polymorph).
---
For a name you can always google “female orc name generator” or whatever race you want to play. That’s a fun way to get ideas for names. You can mix and match some of the names you find or maybe it will give you an idea of what you want to be called. 
---
Just remember people will call you by that name and especially if they are on some form of voice communication with you they will call you by the first syllables of your name. So if your name is Misscooldude most people will probably just call you Miss so it’s something to keep in mind!
---
What a quality post....Tywin would be proud
---
If you’ve rolled Dwarf Priest it’d be crazy not to use the racial so yes I’d say mandatory.
---
Yep, has been happening to me for months. I just disabled the style a while ago.
---
My two cents are that this guide will be followed by less people.  For that reason, you’ll probably  run into less bottlenecks and save some time that way. However, because of the profession leveling, you will likely have a slower time but a better foothold to start grinding prebis and making money at 60. Either way you’re good :)
---
Don't forget the 150g fee to switch specs.
---
You should add another section pertaining to all classes that includes items.
---
Grenades are stuns that break on damage, Gnomish Mind Control Cap is a charm, Magic Dust is a sleep, Tidal Charm is a stun, etc.

Yep, just not all the pservers :P

Did the Priest immortality (Spirit of Redemption-related?) bug get fixed? Saw some Priests flag-running in WSG while being immortal.

I read that as 8 year old and wondered why you weren't just putting him to work farming on an alt.

I have a 4 week old, so forgive my lack of sleep and not comprehending your post.  I also have an 8 year old and a 2.5 year old, so I have no sanity left and one is definitely going to be farming for me.

Damn, I wish more women talk back like that. You better not be some dude fkn with our horny minds.
---
Too many people are spread-sheeting everything since we are all (mostly, lucky beta users) waiting for Launch. Its fun to theory craft and speculate. Sure hunters do have less potential dps than most DPS classes. But potential is not a given, maybe only 10% of all toons out there will hit near their classes max dps. 
---
People mess up in Raids, misjudge a mechanic, time rotations badly, tanks loss aggro and mobs get pulled. In PVP you get stun locked, how about them DPS numbers now? And world PVP... having the advantage can change very quickly when his guild mates arrive.
---
What really matters is how well someone knows their class and is able to handle that in a group situation, PVE or PVP. That's why i love vanilla. Its not about 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 performance (slight jab at arena based balancing). Its all a team effort and hunters along with many other classes have great team based tools.
---
I played a hunter in vanilla, TBC, and WOLK. Will be rolling one for classic too. Short, stout dwarf huntard with a boom stick!
---
Suffer through the 60 levels and let it harden your resolve until you're a heartless sonuva and then, when you get your gear and you become an unstoppable wrecking ball, you'll have the requisite lack of mercy to tear through the hordes of scrubs.

fear is an afterthought for geared warlocks, it's not as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be &amp; on the plus side you don't have to deal with it in duels.

---
Hunters only scale badly after MC, and if you're playing alone you might not progress much further than that.  And they are always awesome in PvP.  
---
So Hunter it is then!
---
Our guild's number one DPS was a hunter all the way through vanilla. No one used consumables. No one farmed world buffs, no one knew how to optimize gear, knew proper DPS rotations or knew top specs. We cleared all the way up most of the way through AQ40 and were one of the top 10 guilds on our sever. 
---
You are an absolute fucking mindless moron if you seriously believe that ANY specs in nearly ANY raid composition with the knowledge we have today won't  be able to clear up through Kel'Thuzad. A fully optimized, min-maxed Ret Paladin today will do higher dps than 90% of any players of any class ever did in retail vanilla WoW. 
---
Not only will people raid without farming consumables or concentrating, but they will clear all the way through Naxx if/when they get in with the right people. 
---
And Hunter DPS won't be the bottom of shit in Vanilla. There will still be casual guilds with Hunters leading the pack all the way. Stop this nonsense about 'losing raid spots' and 'won't be raiding.' With 40 man raids, most guilds will need to pick up 'warm bodies' to fill out their rosters and they will still succeed without a hitch. Even if some of the DPS are doing less damage than the tanks.
---
Natural selection. That's what that was. Shame they can ress.

Omg I love it!!!

The word twink has always been ruined because I knew what a twink was in the gay sense before I knew about it in WoW. Honestly I thought the person was fucking with me when I first heard the word twink in WoW.
---
The gay slang perfectly fits the gay usage of twink too, you know some young pretty thing being decked out by his sugar daddy. It is like the term "heal slut" becoming widespread among everyone. It is just so weird and a bit gross.

---
Rank 1 totems are very useful in PvP. If people start killing your totems, then you start dropping rank 1 totems instead. Switch back to max rank when they realize what you're doing.

Casters will do this with their buffs to bait you into Purging them.

It might be more a pain in the ass, but if you use smaller icons you may end up with a crisper image!
---
Do the class icons instead of an actual mage. Greyscale all of it if there aren't enough of each color.
---
cant mages block in kidney/cheap shot/sap? sry if noob question
---
They horde or alliance ?
---
Dude, that's retarded. Frostbolt casts faster, you do 0 damage on a target that isn't there, and frost nova does like 2 dmg anyways.
---
Do you can stack more shadowguards on yourself if you use rank 1 lol? Or do you want to use rank 1 shadowguard so it gets wasted on a bubbled paladin and tricks him into thinking you're a dumb dumb?
---
Hey there! I'm also a first-time player and I'm playing because my husband wanted me to join him when classic comes out.   
---
I think the best thing to do would be to start playing now on a private server, along with him if he's interested. I started playing on a private server a few weeks ago and I'm so happy that I did because I got a lot of the slow, annoying "learning moments" over with and I have a clear idea of what kind of character I want to play when classic comes out! It helped that my husband played with me in these moments, especially my first dungeon, but I've been playing alone now for my second character and I'm able to manage just fine. Just make sure you're enjoying the game!   
---
If you have any questions that you wouldn't wanna ask him that I might be able to help with, such as choosing your first class/race, you can ask me because we're in similar positions :) Most importantly, have fun!
---
Again, if you're Disc, you only use Rank 1. If you're Shadow, you use Rank 2.
---
18 years old. I was a bum kid straight out of highschool with all the time in the world.

---
Oh, my bad.  I should have said your autos/spells or your pets auto/spells or other damaging effects that are at your character's disposal.
---
That's still requiring pet travel time and attention.  That's not auto-anything.  You have to divide some of your resources to suppress a shaman, as it's always been.
---
I didn't think we were here to balance Classic WoW.  I was under the impression that we were here to emulate it as accurately as possible.
---
I can see that significant changes (such as suggested here) could have a place in the game if it went the way of OSRS, but until new content is being added to an old philosophy, keep Classic as it was, and give it to us as unaltered as possible.
---
It would be awesome if there is some post naxx content. Above all else, no matter what it is, this potential content should be optional for your character, and be able to remain at 60.
---
Fear, Shadow Bolt, Corruption
---
only issue with smaller icons is you would need a 16k resolution display to appreciate it xD
---

* I see your point about first hitting level 60 being more important, but I disagree. MC is not exactly tightly tuned and I believe ferals will still have a pretty sizable threat advantage over warriors early on. Especially with MCP. This advantage will continue throughout vanilla even with DW fury prot warriors viability. 
---
* 112 AP comes from my subjectively eyeballing of the graphs collected on the classic druid discord showing ~ 8 dps difference in cat form. This translates to a 20 dps difference in bear form. Either way 8x14 = 112 AP
---
* I should clarify the 4% difference actually is assuming that the discrepancy is much worse at 27 dps in bear for or 10.8 dps in cat or 150 AP. Please don't take my numbers for gospel.
---
In a few years everyone will have multiple gear sets and all sorts of weird combinations looking for new challenges.
---
Remember, this is AFTER the initial rediscovery is depleted.

Honestly, if you want to impress your boyfriend, have fun. Like every boyfriend that wants their gf to play wow with them is just hoping they will enjoy it as much as them. Brownie points if you set him up with a doritos &amp; gamer fuel care-package.

As a paladin you should be able to tank all the dungeons. Rushing consecration is not a bad idea. Seal of Command in ret is good for not tanking content just dpsing stuff. 
---
Paladins leveling up are not heavily reliant on their talents. Use ret aura, seal of righteousness with righteous fury and you should be able to hold agro in dungeons.
---
People will say you will have mana problems, this is only true in two main cases, you are unskilled at managing your mana in a regular group or your group is balls to the wall in clear time. But if it is the latter than mobs should be dying faster than they are threatening.
---
Time to start working a physical job so you can cut out the gym time!
---
I've got 3 kids, one of them plays games with me, one sits on my lap and watches, the other sits on moms boob watching.  Its a family activity at this point.  Honestly, I just sacrifice sleep.
---
I work at least 40 hours a week, generally ~45 minutes each way to whatever jobsite I'm at, but a lot of times I can get away with working 4 10's, which frees up a day, which is nice.  Don't go to the gym since I work construction and all I really need outside of work is ~30 minutes of cardio which I can do at home (no wasted transit time), between work, cardio, showering, eating, spending real time with my family, I'm lucky to get an hour of "me time" to game after the kids go to bed.
---
Generally I'll log in and dink around ~1 hour before they go to bed, do some mindless shit that I don't mind walking away from randomly (so definitely not grouping up), and rather than play for an hour after the kids bedtime and going to bed at a reasonable time, I just stay up, do what I want, and sleep 5-6 hours.  So thanks to that, I get ~3 extra hours of time to handle life/family/game shit that most people sleeping a solid 8 just can't cram in.
---
Then of course the overtime rolls in and all of a sudden all my "spare" game time gets pushed on the back burner for "real life" time with the family and doing normal human shit like eating and personal hygiene.  Taking the week off for Classic release, then probably going to have no time when the next project picks up and I'm working 70+ hours a week, RIP raiding.
---
10pm . 6 hours is plenty of sleep
---
I did google it... and put them all in one list.
---
The biggest thing is I hate managing different action bars. Itsy biggest complaint with warriors and stance dancing. Otherwise, all your points are good. And I like the point about getting showered in gear. However, I'm sure there won't be many other locks so I'll have a good shot at that gear too.
---
Gank him while he quests
---
If you don't need the drops, then you out-gear the content and it's not going to be challenging even with 40 Shaman. Still doesn't really work.
---
You forgot about dwarf.
---
Because those 5 points have nothing else worth getting up to Feline Swiftness
---
I'm not sure what you mean by 1 shotting casters and as someone playing neither hunter nor mage I don't have an issue with this because it was the same way back in the day during Vanilla. They're not the only ones who can do it either. I've seen elem shamans do it. And disc/holy priests can farm lashers in DME. Rogues can farm gold by just pickpocketing BRD. There are plenty of easy dungeon gold farms for more than Hunter/Mage doing Tribute runs. Heck any healer with a tank can pretty easily farm DME jump runs for the ore and shards. To "save" the economy (as you are essentially suggesting) you would need to remove the ability for any group smaller than 3 to zone into a dungeon. And even if you hypothetically did that all it would take is grouping with friends who sit and org or SW and you just do the same thing while they sit in the cities or farm elsewhere. There's a lot more to Classic than making the same gold per hour as another class. It's Classic, virtually every class is going to be better than you at something.

I still try to figure out what to do when the enemy pulls trash in fear. Currently i use /laugh but mabye theres something better (open for ideas)
---
Yes. This is what often separates hunters and huntards.
---
Q fucking Q
---
I'd put shaman up against that claim. Of course, shaman have a lot of other shortcomings as tanks, but purely threat/second in a 5-man environment I'd find it hard for anyone to top. They don't need to wait for rage and are great for dungeons where dps are salivating to attack as fast as possible. Of course, waiting to drink for mana kind of goes against the time saved frontloading threat in combat.
---
If the beta is any indication of the damage mobs do in 5-mans, I was tanking equal-level elites with a 2h and maintaining threat on 2-3 mobs at a time without dying, and on single targets I didn't even need to use Earth Shock on cooldown, or at max rank, and was keeping aggro from warriors with whirlwind axe.
---
I was 15 day 1 of wow vanilla launch. I went to Best buy right after school to buy it, they were already sold out of the regular, but they had one collectors edition left so I got it.

So glad my mini diablo, panda, and zergling will be joining me again :)
---
I mean, there are people who drink daily and don't feel like they can go an evening without drinking but aren't getting shitfaced before noon and staying shitfaced all day.  I'd call that casual alcoholism as opposed to the shitfaced by noon hardcore alcoholic.
---
Then that doesn't even touch the difference between a functional alcoholic and a Frank Gallagher dysfunctional alcoholic.
---
Tons of people are going to play hunter, I think there is a conspiracy to make the general player base think they are trash to reduce the numbers.
---
CAOS BOLTTTTTT
---
I've done it the hard way and I prefer the easy way.
---
First off get used to fighting green mobs. Basically you want to out level the current content. This will require moving zones often. 
---
Fighting green mobs is pretty safe if you keep your 2hander as current as possible. You can even handle the occasional muti mob pack.
---
Staying with current level content and fighting yellow or above mobs is sort of a death wish. Your going to die to multipacls hell in some cases at lower levels you will lose 1on1.
---
.
---
By just staying with under level content and just being a bit more conservative you will have a easier time and less running back for your corpse.
---
I have zero plans to play a warrior in classic so I wish all of you well in your grind to 60.
---
And you either play WoW or you don't, that's the (semi) joke.
---
Ffxi flashbacks... shutter
---
Out of interest why don’t you want to join a guild? Guilds were never stronger/ more important to the experience then they were in vanilla..
---
I am very much looking forward to using reagents again. Made those utility spells feel so much more meaningful. I also remember thinking "Do I really wanna waste my arcane powder on these plebs?"
---
tank dungeons, ask party where to go, explain it's my first time tanking, apologize profusely
---
Good call my dude
---
How about you stick to fixing things you understand, thanks.
---
Yeah, if you're on the inside it looks like there's so much difference, doesn't it? :)
---
Lol you're a whackadoodle. If rank 1 does 1 damage and rank 30 does 10, it's a 900% increase but it still does 10 damage.
---
Why would you want to do less damage in PvP for no reason? Why would you not prebuff at rank 6? Why would you worry about 200 mana if you're getting smacked for 10 seconds so that your entire shadowguard fell off? There is no logical answer to this question. You go use whatever rank of shadowguard you want you jigglybrained weirdo. The rest of us will cast the ranks that make sense.
---
Not to mention you get to keep a full energy bar, and it also helps chase down runners, stealth faster, etc
---
Forty five, started about a year into TBC.
---
If you’re worried about how “good” you are, you could always learn the game on a private server and then you’ll have a solid base of knowledge when the real game comes out. Otherwise, just have fun!

But who cares, you will still get raid invites and hunters are beasts at pvp
---
I never did it, but I saw someone claiming that if you MCd someone and toggled them to walk instead of run, that would persist after it wore off. Which could be amusing if the victim doesn't know what their walk toggle keybind is.

I think you could leave aq40 and naxx in, but just tone down the gear a little so that it doesn't totally break the game.
---
Keep in mind with/cast or CastSpellByName you can specify the rank of spell by typing (Rank 3) for example at the end of the spell name.
---
Farming inside an instance, completely shielded from world PVP, and earning 150g per hour with barely any effort sounds carebear to me.
---
The easiest solution would be to just add a simple mechanic to the especially lucrative bosses for gold that makes them unsoloable. They could just increase boss movement speed  if only 1 player has engaged the boss after 10 seconds so it doesn’t impact regular players

Except frost nova's damage is negligible regardless of what rank you use? This some sort of 4d chess, you wanna be president of America?
---
If you skip Imp Shred, then you still need to respec when you get to max level. You really want Blood Frenzy while leveling, but it's a useless talent @ 60 unless you also have Imp Shred.
---
Also, your first respec is 1 gold, not 50.
---
Prot paladin is a very gear dependant leveler and unless you have BS yourself theres no guarentee you'll get spikes applied to your sheilds consistently... it's hard to run BS because engi is way more useful as it offers on demand aoe and a way to ranged pull for the price of a few stone and cloth. It's also a slog in pvp until 46+ with reckoning and half decent weps, which yet again engi helps, but if you are diligent about finding eagle mail/plate gear then you can sustain healing enough to be useful in a fight and maybe even get a few cheeky hits in... If you are running around in warrior gear, which most quest rewards are, then you'll have the mana pool of a 2 pump chump while specced into a mana hungry consecrate spell. AoE potential is also much much better with a mage since they can hold their own if they pull aggro and give the pally slows/nova to kite and heal safer. Lock is basically a higher risk version but the health stone will help compensate a bit.
---
Druids pretty much just work out of the box and they have a more aggressive toolkit for pvp with stealth open possibility, charge, root and range damage. Less oh shit buttons of course.
---
I'll be leveling prot pally but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a first toon to anyone who isn't 100% on board the slow n steady train. Super duper fun alt to dump gold into tho. Ret till 41 then respec 11/21/0 after is generally an easier route for most.
---
I was in a guild where the guild leader was trying to pve as a soul link warlock. 
---
I left that guild.
---
That's not how it works.
---
"Easiest" perhaps, most accurate perhaps not. Changing the mechanics of a boss doesn't address the root cause and potentially impacts non-solo players. Not to mention just because you *think* X change in boss mechanic would solve the issue doesn't mean that a clever player won't just come up with a new method to cheese it.
---
If you want to solve the issue of inflation resulting from instanced farming with any degree of accuracy you have to address the root cause of the inflation in the first place. Which is vendored items that were not designed to all go to one player. That means unless you made a modifier which increased vendor price from 0,by 20% additively per participant in the kill then there would be no way to ensure you fully sealed the issue without impacting other players.
---
I'm not sure I would support such a modifier either, even though it is an accurate solution it's also a convoluted one and would be difficult to explain to any new player.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/New_Player_Guide
---
I dont know how new you are to rpgs in general. I tried to find some of the most basic guides which are the most useful for understanding the game. If you read this guide you should be ready to start and learn on the go.
---
My advice that probably isnt in this guide is to use google for things like zone lvls or the quests you can get for dungeons.
---
Because you cant keep all that in your mind even if youve spent hundreds of hours.
---
One blue post, said that spells that affect other players get batched.  Spells that are cast on yourself aren't.  So if you heal yourself, that's pretty much instant, vs healing other players which would get batched.
---
  
---
So if you vanish, that would happen basically instantly, and the sheep would be batched.
---
I am fairly confident Ony was done with less than 11 in retail vanilla. I don't have a source though, just memory. So I might be wrong.
---
more like "sry need dps"
---
Yes any elite location, really. Because any non-elite location you'll be clearing too fast and probably wait for respawns while increasing kill time on elites doesn't really have consequences
---
I have a wow buddy named Nupraptor... coincidence?

Moves and abilities were designed with spell batching in mind.  not having it would throw off the balance.  Did you consider that at all?
---
Wow first played me when I was 14
---
How would that work? Wouldn't you need to disable mc to complete the trade on your characters end?
---
Gnomesaaaaaaaang?!
---
ubrs is a raid
---
No when it was released. I saw it in a youtube video when spells were originally released, ill try and find it and paste it here.
---
Well :(
---
I spent 8 hours trying to convince horde with / commands to resummon echekey in the barrens on my NE happy hunter
---
All that and you still don't understand what the word viable means. Shut the fuck up for 5 seconds and use a dictionary.
---
One of my only memories of classic other than getting rokh dear bow
---
\&gt;Instead who ever really was the first to finish the cast gets the advantage instead of it being a wash.
---
That's not true, because latency.  Which isn't 0 for everyone despite what people seem to think.
---
not weird or gross. kinda hot actually
---
Can those unawares handle the grind?
---
"Hunters are already a powerhouse of vanilla endgame".
---
Sounds like you don't know what you're talking about there, bud.
---
Well the obvious solution is make the last boss be able to walk down the fucking ledge.
---
But hey that is neither here nor there.
---
I guess 20% was just so much more significant over the last few expacs than in vanilla.
---
Male trolls or ghost wolf/cat/bear form tea bagging.
---
the draw from streaming at launch will be big. lots of top streamers say they're going to play. that'll inevitably attract new people. question is if many will stay or if the game is just too old for a new crowd
---
The answer is yes because there are already people in this sub that fit that category.
---
My friends at uni were talking about giving it a shot having never actually played anything past Cara themselves, I believe it will, however anecdotal this is. The stories alone of what it was like during the vanilla release in 2004 is enough to draw most people in.
---
Wasn't expecting to see Still Game here of all places. But aye, they're pricks.
---
make friends, contribute, be nice
---
How ever old i was the month after vanilla came out. I remember asking for it for my birthday but they got me EQ instead, so I had to fix that then I started playing.
---
https://youtu.be/zgepfH0Pg34?t=148 
---
DR Scatter/Trap was never in the game.  
---
Blizzard giving hunters the short end of the stick, like old times
---
You would be giving up trap+aimed combo if you used a scatter shot. What?  Since when?
---
5 seconds to run from deadzone and cast aimed shot.  Oh okay
---
Why on earth?
---
Used a translator and spent 1h figuring out how to make it work with a friend.
---
So yeah it works. It was a pain in the ass to make it work but it works
---
How to get your guild to take you seriously: don't try to raid as ret
---
This is most likely true rbh
---
Ima let everyone here in on a secret weapon (literally) for paladins
---
Blackblade of Shahram
---
Yeah but he's a mage you can always blink or iceblock
---
I said engaged the boss meaning if someone else has tagged it then some funky anti solo mechanic wouldn’t kick in. Unless a group of players for whatever reason let’s someone solo a boss for x amount of time then it would never affect normal players. That idea was just off the top of my head, they could also just give ends game dungeon bosses that are being solo’d the same teleport mechanic that raid bosses have. If someone is so powerful that they can solo end game bosses by actually taking the hits then it’s basically impossible to stop them from doing shit like this lol. 
---
I just think a change like this would solve the problem with much less work on blizz’s part for the same result.
---
Cone is a big chunk of damage.  I wouldn't say you NEED it but I think it's better than alternatives.
---
Any soundtracks from action movies from the 80s/90s
---
You would be giving up trap+aimed combo if you used a scatter shot. What.. Since when?
---
Really confusing layout. Could only understand a few by context.
---
Double backing for 1 - if you aren't going with any gathering, what's your plan to level professions post 40 on a fresh start?
---
Ignore your opponents like nobody when you are done with them is the most disrespect.
---
And the most fun of pvp is killing people. Why do I bother to waste my time after killing them?
---
You would be giving up trap+aimed combo if you used a scatter shot. What.. Since when? 5 seconds to run from deadzone and cast aimed shot.  Oh okay
---
In PvP it is extremely important and you will use it all the time because of the snare, whether talented or not. I think it depends on what you like to prioritize and how you like to play that depends on whether you want to talent into more than anything. But the spell is essential part of vanilla mage PvP toolkit for sure.
---
Paladin - Bubble, Hearth

Cool
---
ZG "Edge of Madness" is actually 4 different encounters: Gri'lek, Renataki, Hazza'rah, and Wushoolay
---
Little imput, i played a hybrid 29 lvl shaman twink with flurry. He was just plain devastating with the amount of hp i could get thru some quest items for lvl 40s i was able to obtain almost no one could kill me. Had a rogue friend completely twinked who could occasionally kill me but it was like a 30 min fight cause he would hide behind buildings and bandage. RIP Hexx, had a key logger sell everything he owned:(
---
What do you mean by this?
---
&gt;what's your plan to level professions post 40 on a fresh start?
---
We can just run back to the early zones to level up from 0 - 300 at a faster pace right?
---
I guess it's more of, would it save more time to level a profession 0 - 300 picking it up at Level 1 or picking it up after Level 40 - 60?
---
Of course it will - it's going to be number 1 on twitch for at least 1 day, anyone interested in an mmorpg will play classic - not other popular mmorpgs out there that will have a playerbase like classic, and it's super easy to jump into.
---
Druids are just not great at anything in wow but Flag Running and having fun leveling. 
---
They do play a good roll at having a single spec that can heal, dps, and tank. All poorly but its nice for a swing positions between different bosses (need more, healing, need more tanks, or if you don't just dps.)
---
Farming those items is a JOKE, and is only done for showing off a fake representation of druid dps. You may do it for progression if you are really close on a boss, but even 20% more damage (maybe its 30% idk will not change much) from 1 out of 25+ people is at max 0.008% more raid dps. 
---
So yeah.
---
&gt; Level 60 Mage Alt. (For food/water (you will need a lot for daily stuff; while not 100% necessary, highly useful for gathering professions).
---
Explain this one since you can't mail conjured items. I wouldn't call a separate account an Alt.
---
Player of mending is my favorite priest spell. I'm a bit bummed it won't be in classic.
---
You're trying to argue that NO damage in negligible.
---
The hours I try to put into this game to stay competitive is insane. I think both me and my wife enjoy our time apart though and still plan time to spend together. We also have plenty of time spent still talking while we are doing diff shit 10 ft apart.
---
&gt; In cases where blizz was clearly aware of things that could be abused and decided to leave them untouched for the entirety of vanilla should be off the tables then yes of course that is off the tables for changes
---
So you mean like dungeon farms? K cool.
---
Yes, but you only do one of them per week, so it's not really important to list all 4 separately.
---
sure it is, you just don't know it
---
This is the correct solution.
---
15 or 16
---
2005 or 2006
---
Yes, but you're just trolling the actual topic.
---
I don't know. I want to say yes, but modern games (even retail) are so bloated and have so many Things, along with quick gratification. I don't really know if a younger generation will appreciate classic, but I hope so.
---
Noon gmt +1
---
I won't be switching to Goblin Engineering and I don't know what guides you're reading that say you should.
---
The Gadgetstan teleport from Gnomish is far more valuable than the Everlook one for Goblin.
---
The only items you get from Goblin Engineering are the mining helm, the construction helm, the dragon gun, the bomb dispenser, and being able to reload the mortar instead of crafting a new one, all of which are fairly useless.
---
The only *real* reason to go Goblin is to make your own sappers and a level 35 alt or a friend can do that for you.
---
Cannibalize doesn't restore mana. And it's only 35% health regen over 10 seconds.
---
Ah yes, he wargs into a bird and then accomplishes nothing. Sounds like Bran.
---
That is incorrect.

---
You should rethink your positionnon this. Hex is crazy good.
---
It works on rogues who time their blinds as your SW:P falls off so they can bandage. It works on mages who sheep you so they can eat up to full to reset fights.
---
Fighting a hybrid healing class? If they get off a heal you should be sweating because you could be in a mana race against going oom. But with hex, they're 20% less less annoying.
---
And rank 1 costs a mere 35 mana (less if you talent Mental Agility). It's spammable. If you take a few globals to dot up a team you reduce their healer's effective healing by 20%. If they decurse even better: you soaking them for more mana and their group's dps is lower.
---
Hex is pretty much the *only* spammable healing reduction ability in PvP. It's almost always worth a gcd to cast.
---
Ah, nice. Thanks.
---
Kodo round up in Desolace.
---
I've thought about this a lot and I think what I am decided on is that I would like WoW to progress along after 1.12 if only to help prevent stagnation and economic ruin.   
---
Look at a lot of old MMOs that still are up and running and their economy is absolutely atrocious to get started in and puts a huge barrier to new players. Since there is that barrier, it means the community gets a bit stale as well. You absolutely NEED a constant influx of new members, even if it is at a snails pace.   
---
So how do I see that happening?  
---
Well, there are a ton of places that the developers can go and keep the original fee. Just all the zones on Azeroth we have seen in retail that have been added are excellent places to look to. They need to be additional end game AND leveling content though, so you keep the feeling of the world being alive and used.   
---
Something else is that there shouldn't really be gear invalidation. I think T3 is the highest power level we should see gear wise, so instead I think we should have a lot of specialty gear that opens up new build options. I also think it would be nice to see extremely challenging dungeons that offer alternative rewards but require specific gear to do. Think frost resist for Nax or Nature resist for AQ.  Maybe add some legendaries for other classes. Also think like Diablo 3 and have some neat sets that offer an entirely different way to play your class (Warlocks becoming demon hunters as an example!)  
---
Something I praise retail wow for is how engaging the mechanics of fights are now, even in 5 mans. I'd like to see some modern dungeon/raid elements but in the classic environment.   
---
PVP I think we could see some neat emphasis on world PVP like the towers in EPL or Silithus but give players a better incentive to participate. I may entertain the idea of Arena as well, though I am not sure. New Battlegrounds would be really fun!  
---
I firmly believe in patching bugs even if they are 1.12 client confirmed mechanics. Leave it as is for now, but once we begin to move forward, begin patching.   
---
If I'm also discussing this, I'd really like to see a different story than what played out in Retail. If we are going forward, let there be stories that follow the threads from the quest lines we already have in Classic, like The Missing Diplomat, or the Scythe of Elune for example.   
---
I think its imperative that the following things stay as is though:  
---
No Dungeon Finder/Raid Finder 
---
No Flying
---
No Catchup Zones/Mechanics
---
No "Wellfare Epics"
---
No changes to economy (I.E don't add in recipes or items that would change the top end of crafting, keep new recipies using a similar amount of materials, only new materials be BoP, etc)
---
Maintain the "journey is the destination" mindset
---
No Retail expansions (meaning no TBC, Wrath, etc)
---
Maintain community and social focus, relationships matter!
---
Maintain class identity and uniquness
---
Other than **Gnomish Battle Chicken** &amp; **Gnomish Death Ray** what other necessary BoP Items are worth crafting before switching to Goblin?
---
&gt;[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/engineering-profession-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/engineering-profession-classic-wow)
---
Yeah, for pre-raid BIS, I can see Blackblade of Shahram being a good alternative to Arcanite Reaper, yeah. But I feel it's unrealistic to expect you'll get it before Nightfall is available..
---
My wife recently decided to try wow with me. If he’s playing with a group of friends, get some headphones and a mic. You’ll see why it’s so much fun.
---
Read up and know your class a little bit, once my wife got into the game and started to really know how to do things herself made it infinitely more fun
---
It was just an idea you don't need to be condescending.
---
Oil cooled cpu. Sounds legit.
---
Yeah, I watched ahmpy do some ne speeds and saw his most recent try 5/5 hawk and kept owl for a while. His 35 hour 1-40 he didn’t do any hawk and did owl til hillsbrad then a lion.
---
Okay this is important so listen closely. If you've never played WoW before, you're going to be in a world of hurt. You NEED to play with one hand on the keyboard and one hand on the mouse. Rebind your movement keys to only strafe and forward, then use your mouse to look around and turn your character. You only need strafe and forward movement so that you have extra keys for spells. Holding left-click looks around, holding right-click turns your character. You should be also incorporating strafe into your mouse movement. It might take a week to get use to just moving.
---
Now EVERY SINGLE spell needs to be bound to a keyboard button. You can also bind to what's called a "modifier." So you can bind a spell or ability or item to the A-key, for example, but then bind another spell/ability/item to shift-A and CTRL-A. Sounds like overkill? Well it's not. Classic WoW has WAY more abilities and on-use items and potions etc. than modern WoW. You CANNOT click on abilities on your action bar and still be effective. You will struggle to keep up. Obviously if you're leveling with your boyfriend he will be able to take care of you, but you want to start being as effective as possible as soon as you can. It may seem difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, it will be second nature and the muscle memory will take care of everything. Then it's going to be very fun. You can and should also bind spells to your mousewheel up/down and shift-mousewheel up/down. That's where I put important abilities like interrupts or crowd control.
---
Good luck.
---
This reads like a short mans guide to not being seen as short. 
---
Step 1) Platform shoes
---
Ret is a joke spec. Best to embrace it instead of striving to be taken seriously.
---
What about the faction bosses? Sylvanas &amp; co
---
you want to play retail and it's already out, how is that condescending?
---
I think those who care enough to get that key early are perfectly within their rights to reserve the key piece, so long as they advertise as such in LFG. Then they know what they're getting into.
---
I am only used to guildie heavy runs doing this however.
---
&gt;Best is to go gnomish, craft battle chicken and **other trinkets**, swap to goblin and craft sappers.
---
Could you name these trinkets?
---
I couldn't find them anywhere.
---
"any serious raider should probably have a 60 mage alt" ... you can't mean that literally.  What is the point of being so invested in raid prep that you fall way behind all the hardcore synergistic guilds and yet spend way more time grinding than them?  I doubt that is 'goals'
---
&gt; Without nightfall the ret is useless
---
nightfall would prolly go best to the offtank or any of the warriors with an instant strike attack that they can spam, same for annihilator.
---
I plan on MT'ing and i will have both (and blackblade if i can)
---
You can lead men to water, but you can't make 'em drink.
---
I also favor regrowth over HT druid. The role of a druid healer can be tank healing, but better at a dot healer which is also on tanks, but its more of a cusion, where HT healing are slow but big (Priest, pallies, and shamans can all MT heal as well, but you can provide two more hots.)
---
Typically as west coast I get about 26 ping, East coast I get about 56 ping doesn’t make a huge diff tho
---
There’s no good hybrid spec for Mages that works in both pvp and pve. You’ll always be way below the arcane/frost mages. Your best bet is to go winter’s chill spec and pick up some pvp talents. That why you’re still very useful for raiding and decent in pvp.
---
True true. Brainfarted there.
---
Well, Blizzard won't be tweakign spell batch to work only on some itneractions (because it'll be hard as hell to do, not to mention it wouldn't be vanilla-like).
---
We'll either get spell batching, or not. There's not middle ground here.
---
I am almost 100% T6 was released a month before the season ended. Virtually nobody could raid it because they were not attuned.
---
I knew bobby b was alliance
---
TAKE SHIP FOR THE FREE CITIES WITH MY HORSE AND MY HAMMER, SPEND MY TIME WARRING AND WHORING, THAT’S WHAT I WAS MADE FOR!

FROST SHOCK
---
Seriously though guys, Hunter or feral druid? I've spent literally hundreds of hours debating the two. I ask my wife randomly throughout the day which one I should pick and she doesn't even know what the fuck I'm talking about. 
---
Fuck.
---
Take tailoring on lock and you will make bags no problem.
---
Roll Dwarf Priest for fear ward
---
1. You have an hour commute, which is above average. A 20 minute commute would add 80 minutes to your day.
---
2. 2 hours to work out or clean sounds high as well.
---
14
---
I don't think there'll be enough rets raiding for accurate statistics to be listed.
---
I change my mind about it pretty much on a daily basis.
---
Good luck deciding on professions :D
---
Yeah, I think 2.0 didn't change much for levelling. It was later patches that they reduced xp requirements, and also the change that removed most of the elite mobs/group quests from Azeroth.
---
Its an instance limit guys. 5 per hour.
---
Eyy, neither have I. Good thing about older WoW expansions is the fact that you can instantly tell when something is an upgrade. I think the only add-ons I'm planning on using are bagnon and bartender if they have some compatible versions for classic.
---
It does bit goes down to grey (0xp) very fast iirc.
---
Really wish the sub numbers were public so we could see how many people drop out after the first month.  I hope classic can survive until at least a TBC release.
---
You’re telling me I cleaved off both it’s butts?
---
None of those spec suggested even provide the 3% crit.. Kinda sad.
---
0/31/20 if you want to play the jack of all trades or 27/0/24 for the much better healing and i guess you could cast dps if needed (bad).
---
I think there will be every spec in the world raiding in fairly large numbers because in the end, when everyone starts to leave, you'll take a body over an open slot. The exact same way raids have worked since the dawn of time.
---
There's literal potatoes getting cutting edge every tier, I imagine vanilla will see some meme specs being played in raids.
---
Dope picture.. really like it. 
---
Do a weapon or Arthas next!
---
Where do you live?  You should choose the region closest to you...
---
Yeah and Hyjal and BT were released in the same patch.
---
You can play another stress test Thursday July 25 until Friday, the 26.

---
I like to purposelly backpedal and keyboard turn when I know I'll beat someone, just so they think they lost to a bad player.
---
I meant T6 release, but it’s been a decade almost so I don’t feel bad about being a little wrong.
---
Roll the class that works the least with their class choices just to spite them for not rolling the almighty Horde
---
Your not wrong
---
Yes, but 1 drop = 3 charges. You will only use 1 charge in a handful of situations as a tank. 5 instances will take you 10-15 minutes and net you 2-3 drops (6-9 charges). That will last you weeks if you're a tank.
---
Maintaining 100% uptime on the buff (which is what full-time cats should be aiming for) is a completely different story.
---
I'll have you know cheetahing away and coming back with buddies is a pretty solid counter to warlock
---
&gt; If you are playing with him you can play a support class
---
Actually if OP's bf is a WoW veteran, then it makes more sense for him to play the support class while they're levelling together so she gets to pick whatever class she wants.
---
Death ray, net o matic, world enlarger.  These are more novelty and pvp oriented, but not necessary.
---
After watching one of Madseasonshows recent videos I am so amped for those orc quests in Redridge mountains. Also I never kept up with vanilla on pservers and what not so I can't wait to slowly remember tons of different quest lines.
---
Tywin took this slow, massive damage 2hander and turned it into two 1 handers. I guess you could say he was a rogue this whole time.
---
It would get removed for low effort. 90% of memes posted like this get removed for low effort. The mods here are incredibly inconsistent when it comes to memes.
---
Jinthalor!!! Yess that was epic
---
Rogue cheap shot, gouge, kidney shot.
---
Priest. No class items, no alternate item sets and doesn't even necessarily need either water or bandages.
---
the picture is the hunter calling the mage a prick
---
Lol!
---
So u should play a Mage?
---
Doesn't matter.  You could have 2 offtanks using nightfall, and it would still be the best wpn for you as ret, because your personal dps is a joke.
---
No worries, I appreciate the suggestion. I actually played BfA for a few weeks back in October with my ex, got a dwarven hunter up to level 20 before that relationship went south and... welp.
---
Brief as the experience was, it was enough to conclude I genuinely have zero interest in the game as it exists today. Assuming Blizzard doesn't screw it all up with phasing, they'll get my time (and my money) when Classic launches next month.
---
honestly though most end game shamans are resto and the mail is trash other than our tier it is well known we steal gear from druids and priests.
---
&gt; help enemy players kill spiders
---
I think you mean help the spiders kill enemy players, spiders gotta eat to
---
Do some bosses
---
I bound it to jump 😂 makes life a lot easier,
---
Lol. 13 mins... we still sheep each other lol
---
Mage, but not for the reason you think. The biggest thing is that they can conjure water whenever. So they only really need one free slot for water that you can destroy at any time.. You only need one stack of portal reagents. The cost difference between that and tele is basically negligible. The reagent for brilliance also takes up a slot. So you're realistically looking at 3-4 slots max taken up by class junk.
---
I don't ever remember getting feathers for slowfall (blink at the last second= no fall damage). 
---
Every other class will have multiple gear sets/reagent/are hunters, and all casters will probably want more than one stack of water.
---
Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros by a large margin. Even the meme specs rocked a Rag-Hammer!
---
Warrior kiting wont work in classic btw
---
&gt; Everything you are describing comes from the fact that we know more about the game than we did when we first played it. 
---
So if we know how to exploit ping heartbeat to do dramatic things in the game (as an analogy) you would be in favor? If people develop mods that allow you to time jumping through traps, or to for another dramatic example spam a macro that doesn't function until the enemy play meets some criteria like switching into a druid form, or immediately blinding a hunter as his scatter is cast at you?
---
Also strawman, it isn't because we know more about the game, when we knew more about the game but had 300 base ping it was impossible, what has changed is our hardware, you are trying to wiggle out of that situation.
---
I'll be happy with it either way I'm rolling a mage, 15 yard range on frostnova is fine with me, it just doesn't LOOK like the game used to, it won't FEEL the same for basically everyone save a few who were lucky to have low ping I suppose. I guess if you are infatuated with a statistical number that in today's world will output a different result than it previously did because "duh number be vanilla" I can respect that as consistent but it isn't rational to me. We could think of a million ways the game needs to be changed in order to fit newer hardware and how things like spell batching aren't in the code and need to be artificially remade, but artificially reinstating the feel that swords didn't have scopes on them is being pro-change it seems like.
---
Is this a new copypasta?

Yes, then teabag and eat the enemies corpse.

I don’t know that I’d call nathanos a raid boss based on his definition of “requires 11+ people.”
---
To add on to my first comment, how viable was it through classic? Was it still BIS come naxx?
---
Vrykul, bro
---
Comb the desert!
---
It will, leeway works both ways so youll have to adjust, but it will still be doable

Thank you so much!

&gt; No one will be using a sulfaras in raid (they won't want the debuff).

Weapon proc debuffs will be on the same priority as deep wounds in 1.12, meaning they're knocked off like fireball dots and won't be able to knock off anything important.
---
Something about this gets me so excited for classic
---
I've never played retail either, so I'm not hugely familiar with any minor differences. The main reason I looked into classic at the beginning was that I wanted to get into Wow but there was so much in retail I didn't understand, I didn't know where to start. I figured there was less to learn in classic compared to retail, so I looked into it and found out about all the awesome features such as:
---
No cross-realm zoning, 
---
Awesome full scale world pvp battles
---
Actually having to travel between areas
---
Real class identity
---
Faction pride
---
Leveling actually being part of the game instead of some obstacle I have to complete before getting to the real game.
---
No mob scaling so the feeling of growing stronger is there
---
Attachment to your class/spec
---
Player reputations on servers. 
---
and lots more, those things are just off the top of my head.

I used to farm felcloth with a shadow res set on my rogue.  When a priest/lock were around I swapped the gear out with outfitter in stealth and continued on with my business.  Its not always to gank them, but I never died if they turned on me.  
---
Now I just outgear them
---
Time to restart!
---
Damn that's cool
---
Do you have a link to the specc/build?
---
I was 27 at the time, and I'm still amazed that I have managed to finish my dissertation while playing WoW 4 to 6 hours a day.
---
9 with my brother helping me get a defias rogue mask on my NE.
---
Use Lutris to install WoW, it will configure Wine and DXVK for you.
---
When he gets a debuff that you can dispell try to do it before he asks for it.
---
Thanks for the response :D
---
Yeah, where the warlocks are.
---
Yea now that u mention it I do remember seeing tanks with tbunderfury in tbc
---
Thunderfury was BiS for prot and fury all the way to end of xpac. It is my 1 worry about playing classic is that I will never get a 2nd binding again lol
---
Really neat!
---
25, back in 2006. My friends dragged me kicking and screaming into WoW a few months before TBC launched. At the time, I was still heavily enmeshed in Achaea, a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon -- think text-based multiplayer game that's the father/grandfather of all graphical MMORPGs).
---
BRD
---
Ironfoe drops and a priest rolled need against me (prot warr) and won.....
---
With DHKs being implemented with the Honor System, hardly anyone is going to do city raids. They also serve no purpose and give very little reward (about 500 CP or ~2 Battlegrounds).
---
if your goal is to be a prot war then i would suggest asking yourself how much use you expect out of Mark of Fordring because before long you will get the neck reward from the Onyxia head.
---
Some people might think picking up the trinket over the neck is a good idea but you will never replace the neck and there are easy alternatives for 15 FR trinkets (like blazing medallion or fire reflector, both are BoE).
---
xd
---
How rare is getting thunderfury? If a guild has MC on farm for 6 months will they probably have it by then?
---
The epic shield is why you go Goblin, no other reason really
---
Hunters need pet food, food, bandages, and take up a bag slot for ammo. Druid has reagents for bres and mark and water. Mage has reagents for portals, teleports, and slow fall. Warrior needs food, bandages, and various armor and weapons (if you choose). Warlock has water, food, bandages, and soul shards. Rogue has reagents for making poisons, the poisons themselves, lockpicking tools, food, bandages, and reagents for vanish and blind. Shamans have reagents for res, water walking, water breathing, water, and individual element totems until you get all of them in one. Paladins have reagents for greater blessings and DI and need water. Priests might need something for slow fall and water. Sorry if I missed anything. This is from memory.
---
You can buff yourself though, right?
---
The huge dad thread in the top is so wholesome.
---
Yikes. A lot of very abrasive and vulgar comments for such an innocent post. 
---
Thats cool that you're doing this, OP. Just follow his lead. He might be inclined to rush through content and get to max level as quickly as possible. If so, just roll with it and work with his style of play. You can always go back and start another side character later (or even right away) that you dabble around with on your own so you learn the world. 
---
On the contrary he might totally be down to take things slow. Whichever happens, you'll pick it all up pretty quickly if you just listen to the essentials which im sure he'll guide you through (getting professions, training at class trainers, etc) 👌👌

---
Dont sleep with your/his guild members.
---
That sounds like a joke, it isn't
---
Force Reactive Disk does not require Goblin Engineering to learn, craft, nor equip.
---
Those were the days hahaha
---
Nah they have like three different sets of gear
---
Blizzard is doing this with as little upfront investment as possible, that way if it’s a failure, little is lost.
---
If the launch and subsequent months after prove popular, then I can see Blizzard doing something to push it more.
---
Alliance or horde? :3
---
Bear tanks require WAY less farming. Like maybe 5 mcps per raid, if that. Cat druid is the one that needs to farm a fuck ton.
---
Me three.......
---
Yes you'll just do it farther away from mobs
---
Pot meet kettle.
---
Needs more aimed shot
---
Something that would be a solid addition is the vendor costs of the bows/quiver/ammo
---
I think it looks cooler that way. Fits in with the troll aesthetic
---
Vanilla was never fair and am pretty sure each class has its advantages
---
Till this day, I remember when I started playing and this guy called me a noob for being a 12 year old playing a Night Elf Hunter. 
---
I was actually 11 when I started, so I sure showed him.
---
Nah just need to not leave it to the very last second. Still a fool proof way of avoiding falling damage.
---
250? Way more I would suspect, but that's my opinion.
---
thunderfury makes for a decent offhand for fury but you will never use it because fury has no way to dump threat and this weapon generates tons of it even outside of D stance.
---
Against the subreddit rules, delete this.
---
Shaman theme! :heart:
---
Not sure how this relates but 0/31/20 is pretty weak. Those 20 points in Resto are only useful if you're actually healing on certain fights, but Leader of the Pack isn't active while you're healing. Swap that to 0/30/21 if you're actually spending time healing and you will be more useful overall.
---
Leader of the Pack is for full-time cats &amp; bears.
---
Carrying multiple sets of gear pretty much takes shaman/priest/pally off the list. Unless you're happy with strictly only playing one spec in PvE for example.
---
A 30 second prime time TV spot costs anywhere from $200,000 to $600,000 depending on the channel and show (sports are always the most expensive).
---
That means each time the commercial airs, it needs to attract ~26,000 new players just to break even on the air time.
---
In comparison, a commercial for Battle for Azeroth only needed to attract ~5,000 new players to break even.
---
And we're not counting production costs here, which is easily another $50,000 to $100,000.
---
And since there's no trial or starter account mode for Classic, the chances of convincing and hooking new players is even smaller. Only 3 in 10 players keep going with the game past level 10.
---
Lights hope, silver hand. Great server.
---
That's a good point. Unfortunately I'm not sure whether I'll be maining Prot or Fury yet, and I'm also not sure when I'll be able to take down Onyxia.
---
The more the better, I mean unless the next retail expansion is the final expansion of the game I would like to think that if classic launches anywhere near half a million players in its relaunch that the burning Crusade launch 18 months later could outpace the current retail expansion. That would be Berserker.
---
Yeah, I think the winners are definitely Rogue or Mage. Whilst Rogues have to carry 5 poisons, Mages have to carry water, mana gems, and mana potions.
---
I don't think this is a problem. Those macros worked in Vanilla. They were only changed because of arenas - and arenas don't exist in Classic.
---
If someone is killing your totems, then they are not attacking you. Just drop them again.
---
How to be taken seriously as Ret: Create a warrior &amp; name it Ret
---
It's honestly way more of a pain to break up leveling at 40 to go catch up on shit, than it is to grind mobs for the hour or so you need to catch up in the zone you're in. From my experience. Rarely have to actively spend any significant time leveling these skills on pservers.
---
Should definitely not be using the term “meme spec” if you are over the age of 12.
---
Why bother?  Anyone who would care knows.  I think this is way more about getting old players back than bringing new ones into the fold.
---
They don't have to use tv as the source. They have their own platforms they can use to share it via social media.
---
Imp blizzard is pretty ridiculous in lots of 5man and raid situations where you need aoe, as well as in AV. It's a really nice perk if you're going deep frost. And it lets you aoe farm really well.
---
I agree there!
---
i believe the drop rate is around 4% per binding, 6 months is about 25 clears, or 50 if you did split runs, so there is a decent chance
---
I doubt there's anyone connected to Blizzard through social media that hasn't already heard of Classic's announcement and planned release.
---
No lifers will reign king once more. No more shortcuts people with jobs shouldn't role pvp servers
---
Last time I ran WoW on Linux it used OpenGL instead of DirectX, and it worked perfectly, bit that was MANY moons ago.
---
I dunno. Esfand uses BoP long before he hits the ground [here](https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulExpensiveSharkHoneyBadger) and he still ate it.
---
Anything Yoko Kanno had done around the turn of the century, so a lot of Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex OSTs.
---
Mate I'm in the same boat my son will be playing his 10 no better way to hang out, he will  be playing with me and his 2 uncles, August 27 can't come quick enough
---
Yea and add Dungeon Finder too!
---
Psa: ping lowering services like battleping are amazing.  Evem from east us to socal you can shave off ping.  I'd often get sub 100 ping from China to Usw servers.
---
If you look at Shedo's dps, sometimes being No. 1 on the meters, one might get inspired to roll feral as well, including me. But that guy is a classic feral god. He's got immense training in power shifting and thus energy regen timing. That's part one. 
---
Part two are consumeables. You will need pots and that 2000 mana flask, which is expensive (or time consuming). Farming the pummeler, where others here estimated getting 2-3 per hour (20 mins for five runs in one hour lockout), are the easy part imho, but time sums up. You will be farming something regardless, because you'll also need the mana runes.
---
I'm always for playing what you want. The more effort you put into your spec, the more it shows your guild that you're serious. You might even pull some respectable dps. But you will be farming your ass off with this spec just to be able to (having a chance to) keep up with rogues and warriors. 
---
I read many posts about feral and some even said, that they burned out because of all the farming. So I would only recommend going feral if you don't have a job, hyperbolically speaking.
---
When MCP is really the only major concern, then not using it will put you from potentially top dps in the middle/lower dps bracket, it's just that good. And people now know about it, so they might ask you why you don't use it. That's my major concern. I saw videos where ferals didn't use MCP,  one said "He couldn't be bothered to farm it" and raided Naxx, but that was when people didn't really know MCP was such a huge dps boost. I highly believe not farming MCP will be considered slacking. Depends on your guild I guess.
---
Tl'dr MCP is king, farming other necessary stuff is time consuming as hell to be somewhat viable. Beware of burn out.
---
The way you impress him is to allow him to teach you and be interested and willing to learn. I'm not saying to go in blind, but it will make him feel empowered that he is making someone so close to him a better player.
---
Prep rogues with cool downs are unpleasant.
---
Me 26
---
Yeah I was able to do it in the beta. Just wont be able to cross the mobs path anymore unless they fix leeway 😀
---
I'm almost tempted to name my Hunter Legolas, but spelled wrong and with extra characters to make my enemies underestimate me.
---
This is pretty much the issue; like ... you gotta play like a world class player as Ret... to out-DPS casuals. That's really all you can do.
---
I don't recommend ret, but people who are dedicated TO doing it for the meme? They pretty much have to play with people who suck, and NEED their dedication, to help a less dedicated guild advance.
---
A dedicated player brings a lot to the table ... but if this same player was playing a fury warrior and doing the farming the same way? He'd be in the best guild on his server effortlessly.
---
This is assuming most guilds are running only 1 MC a week, I imagine by BWL a fair few guilds will run 2 with 1 main tank in each etc
---
This is pretty much the truth.
---
I agree with most of the things others here have said. Just playing with him will be enough to impress. If you actually enjoy it and get invested the rest will come naturally.
---
If you want a fast-track to success then take some time to familiarise yourself with the UI of the game, change your keybinds and set it up in a way that works well for you.
---
Some other people have already said this but the first place to start would be to change your movement keys before you even get into the game properly. By default w is forward, a is turn left, s is backward, d is turn right. You won't ever need to use the turning keys as you'll use the mouse to turn. Best thing to do is unbind w and d, then assign the commands for strafe left and strafe right to those keys. Unbinding the s key will also help you develop good movement habits but it's not as essential as changing your left and right keys from turning to strafing.
---
Beta was a commercial success, there's no need to spend a crap ton of money on other types of advertising.
---
I personally would love to see a n ight elf or druidic one.
---
And you join the guild as holy, once you have made the friends you tell them it's your life long dream to play as ret. Then you become the guild mascot, the guy they bring to raids because they like him even though you a last on the dps meter every raid.
---
LOLRET. &lt;3
---
I hate layering
---
My favorite zone is Wetlands and the Whelgar's Excavation Site quests there are the most memorable for me.
---
My most memorable non-dungeon encounter is Araj the Summoner in Andorhal.  I had three? quests to kill him and after trying a few times realized that it wasn't going to happen solo.  I had just joined my first guild and asked in gchat whether someone could help with taking him down.  Like 8 level 60s showed up and promptly wiped their butts with Araj.
---
To me, that encounter cemented the importance of a guild.
---
I did something similar, looked at stuff I can pick up in my 50s... Like a pre Bis Bis.
---
I like that phrasing, made the friends, like it's some Arcane, foreign concept. Made the Friends, baked the cookies, inputted the data.
---
...and then he got backstabbed!
---
Like bladeflurry did?
---
[They are straight](https://imgur.com/TdZPius). Trolls just move their head and shoulders a lot in the game.
---
Tell me kid, knowing that classic is based off of the legion client and knowing that the legion client is heavily modified from the original vanilla one, how can you even ask this question? 
---
It's all an emulation. It doesn't even feel like vanilla. Instead of asking these stupid questions, maybe hop on a private server and see the differences for yourself. The only thing you can trust that they got right were stats(hp, armor, resistance values), and spawn times.
---
This is truth.
---
Yeah when you're questing or leveling solo in general you'll spent most of your time in cheetah if you really wanna be efficient. Since I plan to do the occasional dungeon, I decided to at least put one point into it. 5/5 would just be overkill in my opinion.
---
On Pservers there’s a lot of thunderfury’s
---
Technically I would of been around 4-5 my dad played from launch, me and older sibling would take turns making characters &amp; getting them to 6. I remember when I was 8ish getting a tauren to level 20 &amp; running battlegrounds
---
Because of its proximity to AQ. The time to reach Winterspring for either faction is much shorter than the time to reach Gadgetzan for either faction.
---
Fuck. That's more than impressive.
---
That's why I like winterspeing. Teleport there and fly to orgrimmar. Plus there is a bank and raid farming consumes. To decide on gadget for 1 phase is meh.
---
1. New content should bring more variety, not replace old one
---
2. Only long overdue changes
---
3. No flying mounts, or implement them in a different way
---
4. No main storyline, only small stories 
---
5. Modding support
---
They don't even do commercials for BfA, I highly doubt they would do it for Classic.
---
Because there are only so many icons in the game........
---
Looks very nice! I was planning to go Alliance but this post makes me my priest/rogue want to consider Horde :)
---
Regarding not being a dick, will there be an age requirement to join?
---
Do you have macro lists for other classes?
---
Colour palette and limited amount of actual thumbnails available I'd say.
---
This is why horde are kill on sight for me.
---
Well, it's also the fastest way to Onyxia's Lair.
---
So, how's therapy going?
---
Imp CoC &gt; Blizz for pvp
---
A lot of those actually exist. &lt;3
---
Side (circle) strafing, where you are ‘running’ in the intended direction while having you back to one side most certainly does.
---
Good God :o that's pretty neato
---
You have to go back to town and fork out 50g to respec anyway so you might as well grab your dps set from the bank while you're at it.
---
I disagree. If you're in any WSG premade, you need Imp. Blizzard.
---
They did a shit load in asia, look them up they are cool
---
Not in classic
---
I get what you're hammering home here but that answers none of what I asked lol. Ret pallys wont be trying to provide nightfall debuff by themselves so what weapons do they aim for, for their own solo power? And since they want 2 handers are there things that other classes find lackluster that rets actually have a chance to recieve?
---
Hunter is really not the best in duels because there's a circle limit for kiting, they do better in open world pvp or bg because they can kite indefinitely.
---
going for a no dungeons playthrough
---
Ok but in looking for Teleports on a daily basis to get me around the continents for the entire game. And have it be efficient. Doing it once a week for onyxia why u can just fly from org in a few mins is not a good reason.
---
Everlook has ekos for juju buffs. Also after finishing buffs in DMN you can teleport to winterspring and fly to felwood for songflower for world buffs. Then hearth to your raid location.
---
I was 12, so glad it's coming back.
---
A good one will still win almost anything, regardless of the small dueling circle. But yeah a lot worse than usual.
---
Noted. Since you buy many of the progression items from vendors, I agree that this would be a good addition.
---
So you can teabag them?
---
Just play the game and have fun with it. Don't rush it and don't try to be an expert for the sake of. Take a real interest in the game and he will appreciate it.
---
MOST BORING PART OF WOW. i will never fish.
---
Shaman id say, with far sight and else
---
Level an alt to 60 on the down-low.  Bonus if it's a healer or tank.
---
Site or excel spreadsheet?
---
Lol this is great
---
You're adorable. Not useful. But adorable.
---
Happy cake day! :&gt;
---
I feel ya bro
---
you are talking out your ass
---
If you're no trying to beat the world record in leveling you should do professions from the beginning
---
After having played rogue a lot
---
Gnome or Orc if you wanna minmax. UD can be useful vs war + priest and arguably vs lock too. I beat locks even with succubus as orc as long as I have PvP trinket. Non-SL is easy and non orc SL locks usually die as well.
---
Thanks. Did not know that.
---
Imo there is no commercials needed. Word of mouth is incredible powerful. Look at Tesla, they don't do advertisment yet they sell more cars than they can produce because the users are very happy with the product and are spreading the word.
---
Lightning reflex build will only get better at the very end of content. Pretty much when u are allready nax geared. Also you really want the multishot talent for pvp.
---
Go marksman it’s just better
---
I agree, but would like a combo of both. Where the fuck is Mr. T when you need him  :P
---
42yo here. Was around when vanilla happen. Coming to WoW from hardcore EVE. My friends were like “level a warrior, it’s great”. Took me fookin ages. But it was fun. I’ll take this vanilla slowly, like an old man enjoying a young woman for the last time

Sad huh
---
I played ret myself, and at some point I specc  holy and life was surprisingly easier... Even farming, pvp, everything.
---
Holy pally with the right setup, is awesome for AoE grind
---
They definitely do commercials for BFA lol
---
I’d love the ones with mr T, chuck Norris or ozzy Osbourne. They were not exclusively for vanilla but so awesome
---
Specifically druids which can reasonably raid with 3 completely different gear sets on 1 spec.  It's takes a ton of bag space to feral tank.
---
be a streamer, play a meme spec "ironically"
---
The original undead male rogue stealth animation. I didn't play until partway into vanilla, and I rolled an undead rogue because of those early rogue videos where they ganked people while looking completely badass. One where he went into stormwind bank, completely iconic for me. Shit #2 should be will of the forsaken, even though it's not rogue exclusive lol. I guess 2 is kidney or vanish.
---
mage - lots of mage ones mentioned, for me it's probably frost nova by far, then maybe blink or ice block.
---
druid - tranquility is pretty badass and memorable. maybe roots or one of their forms too.
---
shaman is tough, I think windfury procs. Chain heal I guess. I have more "iconic" memories of TBC shaman abilities tbh.. earth shield and lust.
---
hunter - call pet is what immediately comes to mind. maybe freezing trap also.
---
paladin - hoj, bubble
---
priest - psychic scream, mind control
---
warlock - their mount, death coil, maybe vw sac
---
warrior - charge/intercept, ww, t-clap
---
I have a ne priest alt named LOLREPAIRBILL ready to go.
---
Oh, that? Order of Priority for solo-farming... luxury PvP items for ballers:
---
For PvP, I'd probably put a weapon chain on most of these weapons unfortunately.
---
 - Corrupted Ashbringer (Recommended over MOM; because proc scales with spellpower. Also the scarlet monestary memes are cool; but not considered for why this is top, IMO.)
---
 - Might of Menethil (Harder physical damage, good speed.)
---
 - Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnoros (Close second to Bonereavers, but retardedly expensive to craft -- Fireball scales with spellpower. Requires 50 Arcanite bars, and Sulfurion ingots that can sell on the AH for 1200 gold. Not worth it in my mind.)
---
 - Bonereavers: Warriors however will lose their shit if the raid leader gives you Bonereavers, but it is basically BIS. If you're on a PvE server, I don't see you having a huge issue getting this, but on servers and guilds that prioritize PvP, good-luck. I'd recommend avoiding it just for guild synergy and because warriors in PvP get more out of it ... but it basically turns your physical damage into holy damage if you could ever use this to DPS on a boss. If you get one, your guild leader might be fine with you DPSing with it early in MC to experiment; but this may worry some warriors.
---
 - Grand Marshal's Claymore. For the hardest man alive only. If you could do this, you could probably aford the Sulfuras though -- but this will also come with a lot of other good stuff that you really could use, including a healing hammer, and other GM weapons/items. You really need to rank to rank 11 anyways on almost any DPS main for a baseline of gear and an epic mount that doesn't cost mana on a paladin (screws with ret's regen while farming; also your horse is subject to counterspell!!! x . X;; HORRIBLE when that happens; you're basically dead before the fight even starts). A fully raid-geared ret paladin though can do some brutal stuff in a premade though; you aren't a warrior, but you're support and extra cleanses, freedoms, BOPs and good stuff that an Enhancement Shaman doesn't provide to the horde.
---
 - Ashkandi. Good weapon. Easier to get than Bonereavers. You'll wreck with this, and some people in Imfamous used this religiously. (Not everyone in Imfamous was a Grand Marshal; some of them were Field Marshals - including Swifty and Chipman the paladin, I believe - maybe he went all the way, I don't remember.)
---
 - Spinal Reaper. It's pretty good. I considered putting it UNDER Untammed Blade though which I've experimented with a lot.
---
 - The Untammed Blade. This thing is HUGELY underestimated by most people. Seriously. It looks weak, it's not. If used for reckoning, if it procs at any point in your reckoning bomb, it counts buffs you and toward all additional hits of the bomb. Also procs off judgement, including while your back is turned for unknown reason.
---
 - Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds. Easy to get, low drama especially if you're there for every one of your guild's ZG runs 'cause you're a bro, and ZG actually let's a ret do good DPS. Not that strong.
---
 - The Unstoppable Force. 
---
 - Nightfall. 15% spellpower is nothing to laugh at when you're doing a reckoning-bomb combo and judging at the end and using a spellpower trinket out of ZHC and ending with a hammer of wrath dude.
---
 - Arcanite Reaper.
---
 - Ice Barbed Spear.
---
If you're going lower than this, you aren't even trying. I do have a video of my killing a rank 12 Troll Hunter, when I was level 55, using a Twig of the World Tree, when he tried to gank me 1 v 1 in a Yeti Cave.
---
Spoiler: Yeti's killed him.
---
1.8 year old? So you're saying your kid is 1 year and 9 months and 18 days? That's rather specific.
---
It's nightfall all the way down.
---
100% less male gnomes
---
she's already lined up that side piece :P
---
I vouch for a Classic+ post-naxx with new raids, zones and gear while still keeping the core gameplay of classic.
---
New raids = an oppurtunity to tweak class balance without ruining the progress through said new raids.
---
18. horrible time to start lol
---
I think it makes more sense to give a key to a DPS that plays all the time. As a tank you will already be in demand and able to find pug groups. It’s very difficult for dps to differentiate themselves, so a key could get some extra runs for some the key holder.
---
Hamstring kiting is so unfun
---
The meme that warriors level slow that gets spouted constantly needs to stop.
---
xddd
---
&gt; Cause y'know, apparently looting is a spell, vendoring is a spell, speaking to an NPC is a spell.
---
Uh, none of these matter either for PvE or PvP, or even leveling.
---
You might be right but your examples are shit.

You dont play world of warcraft, world of warcraft plays you.

There's this one http://www.wowclassicbis.com/ but it's just a list of items by phase. There is one that's pretty much identical to the wowhead one but I don't think it has phases - just a big dropdown of all gear.
---
Wzit did they say no realm forums? I can't imagine that happening
---
Very cool, maybe next you could do a raid boss made out of the items that can drop in the instead. Like C'thun or or Yogg'Saron since they are both a part of huge raid instances.

“You need to have good social skills and not be an autist”

Most folks with autism are actually quite nice, intelligent, and have social skills. Not sure why you’d include something as ignorant as this in your guide.

I see a rogue in a freeze trap for 9 or 10 seconds. I dont understand what this proves except for that blizzard is correct.

Eeeuhm, every pservers I've played was alliance including the last big three.

Leveling a druid is a lot of pain and suffering just to be a healer at 60.

nah, let´s not make that mistake again with that equality of outcome mindset.
---
Yeah thinking gnome and going daggers
---
Looks like he’s flipping everyone off. Cool design though ^^
---
If you're going 31 feral, there's no reason to go that deep into resto. You're better off picking up omen of clarity.
---
Also, I believe it was confirmed that buffs like lotp do not provide their full benefit vs bosses.
---
Most druids are going to be better served by going 1/29/21 if they want to do it all.
---
It doesn't matter if it's straight after a hunch or during an animation, that isn't the hair's fault.
---
Whoa, I've never heard of this tip before!  That's an amazing ROI at launch and could definitely lead to easy bags!  
---
Do you know of any other vendor trash recipes like that at higher levels for engineering?
---
Thanks again,

What is tellah doing here? /s
---
**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
​
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.
---
* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.
---
* Members willing to put real effort into their class/role and work to be the best they can be.
---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:
---
* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---
The Important Info:
---
* Raid Nights: Tuesdays and Wednesdays (With a possible Optional 3rd night being added once AQ drops, to be discussed with guild when the time comes.)
---
* Times: 8pm to 11pm Pacific time
---
* Faction: Alliance
---
* Server: PvP
---
* Voice: Discord
---
* Loot: Loot Council, decisions made public in a member read only discord page, to help transparency. Or publicly in the main discord voice channel. Exactly details on the transparency to be fine tuned over time. 
---
Contact/Join us:

I came to this thread for the quotes
---
Thoughts? How about good fucking job, damn
---
Warriors carry the most shit out of any class in the game.
---
I'd reckon if you can get past the launcher boss. Not sure how that'd even work. Good luck!
---
No, sorry. that's the only one I have done the math for. 
---
To be honest, I really don't look for ways to destroy trade goods after about level 10-20, because by that point, I figure mail fees are basically free. But it's quite tough to actually mail stuff around pre level 10, and it's not worth running to a bank to deposit 40 rough stone, but it's also not practical to CARRY 40 rough stone at level 8 with no bags.  
---
It's kind of a perfect storm of a way to make 1.4 gold an hour at level 6ish right when you would really want to make 1.4 gold an hour for about 3 minutes.
---
Ah here we go. Clever traps. Increase duration of trap by 30% with 2 talent points.
---
So how long does freeze trap last there dude?
---
Sometimes you will see what you want to see because you want to be right. You have to look at it with a new perspective man. That hunters are crying everywhere and they are the saltiest tears known to man. Lolol.
---
Once this and melee leeway are implemented make sure you vent your frustration to an actual GM using the help tab. 
---
Overload blizzard and theyll make the game how we wan't, Only if we make enough noise.
---
I am 38. I am not a boomer, but I am not young my any means :P Chain emails, memories!
---
every website that does this always forgets to implement "random enchantment" items properly as well.
---
i.e Gyth Skull is available but you cannot select "of Fire Resistance"
---
No joke, I zoomed in above the guy on the left and found freakin Gaben.
---
But will the right click report it?
---
even back then we didnt trusted blizzard enough and made our irc channels
---
now its going to be discord
---
Fury and Feral Offtanks don't respec, they need the gear with them.
---
All healers don't respec to farm, they need the gear with them.
---
Awesome guide, I'm very intrigued to try this! How do you think it compares to the usual Voidwalker "meta" that's come from private servers, in terms of speed? Seems like it'd be alright in a PVP situation too with the Succubus.
---
Yeti cave in Hillsbrad.
---
In a PURE PvE with World ... Ashkandi goes to the undergeared Hunter your guild just recruited... but double Dawn's Edge with +Agil enchants is far superior.
---
Ashkandi is the definition of a luxury item.
---
Will be looking forward to your Naxxramas progress screenshots.
---
My only experience with WoW was shortly after Cata launched I was invited by some friends to join them. They'd picked the game up late BC/early Wrath and so were doing a lot of end game stuff by the time I got on. 
---
My best friend levelled with me for the first hour or so, then said "well, see you when you get to max!". I went through to 60 solo and eventually dropped the game. 
---
I'm excited to come in to a fresh server with a tonne of other people around my level. This time I'll be leveling a human priest and planning on sucking up as much of the content as possible; rep grinds, hitting every dungeon, and I'll probably dabble in a little PvP. 
---
My main goal is to be part of a raid - I might be too &gt;!casual!&lt; to actually beat one, but I want to gauge for myself what all the hype is about!
---
Besides what you listed: play a different class, or faction.
---
Or really just quit. If a game is not doing it for you anymore I feel this option is very natural. I think we’ve become too accustomed to getting more, and more, and MORE ad nauseum.
---
I would honestly play one class and faction until I had it, then switch faction and roll a different class or playstyle, and  after some years of this just move on and do something else with my life. There’s enough content in Classic to keep one busy for quite a few years.
---
After this there’s no stopping others from jumping in fresh. The game will still be there, the stories, theorycrafting websites, old guilds, content, all untouched. I honestly don’t see a ceiling that would cause Classic to shut down. There’s just so much there already.
---
The more I read this the more blatantly wrong it is. Lots of people go 21/23/7 or some variation thereof for more control i PvP fights. It's a very popular build, especially on the duel servers.
---
And yeah, if the rogue jumps the hunter when they're at 10% then they win. Are you really dense enough that that's an argument? That's also the case for magi, ele shaman and Shadow Priests, the other 3 rogue hardcounters.
---
As for cooldowns; tell me exactly which cooldowns a hunter has that you'd feasibly use while "out and about"? You don't Scatter, FD or trap when you're just grinding, come on dude. 
---
If a rogue opens on you disfavourably you Scatter, Trap, Cheetah and dip outta there. You don't even have to take the fight if it's somehow disfavourable to you - same reason as mage or druid, you're so goddamned slippery that you'll very rarely have to take a fight you don't like.
---
Thanks mate.
---
You can always strive to do better. That's being competitive. While it's true that most rotations are simple, there are always steps to keep improving.
---
Started at the end of Vanilla, was 11

I actually thought he was joking and was going to suggest the app called a browser.

* Druid: mark, rejuv.
---
* Warrior: charge, taunt
---
* Rogue: stealth, cheapshot
---
* Priest: fortitude, shadow form
---
* Warlock: voidwalker, soulstone
---

---
* Hunter: mark, trueshot aura
---
* Mage: arcane intel, sheep

* Paladin: bubble, hammer
---
"Zero problem". Sure thing.
---
Has the no forums been confirmed?
---
The Stormwind texture update we deserve
---
Oh interesting. I'd never seen the G600 until this comment prompted me to go look it up. I didn't realise there were alternatives like that.
---
I only just recently replaced my original naga from ~2008ish I think, so it lasted me a solid decade. Everything still worked except the left click would disengage sometimes while holding it down which didn't seem like a huge issue at first, but I'd try to drag a window and it would let go half way. Very annoying so I replaced it.
---
My Naga held up perfectly for ages but in general I have a vibe that Razer's build quality isn't the greatest. It's good to know there's a logitech alternative out there!
---
Sulfuras is nothing more than a status symbol. It isn't a good weapon for anything other than PVPing, and by the later tiers, PVPers are going to want to use better weapons that drop from AQ40/Naxx.
---
Keep in mind that Sulfuras requires a ridiculous amount of gold to craft. It's a few thousand gold's worth of mats, and it's a weapon that brings nothing of value to a PVE raid. In comparison, Thunderfury's mat cost is much lower on top of being a massive performance increase for your raid since it massively boosts your tank's threat output.
---
That's the way Reddit works due to its voting system. In any case, this sub, like most game-specific subs, leans casual. It's been progressively getting heavier on that side, which ends dictating the flow due to numbers alone. I guarantee you that the majority hasn't even read it.
---
I believe the only 2 classes that completely lose a standard bag are Hunter and Warlock. Warlock's bag is optional BUT DO USE IT or go insane (discover the macro for it too).
---
At least 90% of this sub is in that picture. Some are not very clear though as they only had a couple seconds to take it whilst they were busy doing their weekly clear of Naxx.
---
He's been my favorite character since season 2!  
---
I call him Papa Lannister
---
Just because it was crafted from a single legendary item drop (Eye of Sulfuras) making it much easier to obtain compared to the two separate rare bindings.
---
On my server the few people I saw with them were Paladin and Shammans.
---
I was 26. I was curious to see what World of Warcraft is, and a friend of mine told me about a private server. I logged in and was immediately hooked. The PS was unplayable, so after a few days running around and admiring the beauty of Eversong Woods I bought WoW and payed my sub till 2014.
---
No, except for ud.
---
REEEEE YOU DON'T KNOW ME REEEE.
---
Seriously tho, do you know me? You are right tho.
---
I forgot, priest (shadow) is a class I would enjoy too, thats why i mentioned the healer question.
---
There are no ads in this vid. This channel is not even monetized
---
If everyone unsure of what to roll just rolled a fucking hunter like they'll end up doing anyway everything would be fine lol
---
OSRS did increase the level cap and the original gear has been relatively power crept past. The thing is their new content has become so core to the current state of the game people don’t mind and essentially ignore that there has been power creep. Another big point is they stayed significantly different than RS3 which could also be translated as true to OSRS. However you want to put it, they didn’t release RS3 (aka TBC, etc.)
---
Shadow priest isnt a healer. Roll hunter.
---
char planers have been around since vanilla most  noticeable in tbc for jewelry and ep stat comparison. taking a 15year old idea and implementing it is hardly "stealing"
---
Omen
---
Spec Affliction, Imp out, dot everything, run around and re-dot if needed, Life Tap for mana, maybe drain life to get the tapped health back. Easy.
---
Druids, Warriors, Shaman, Paladins, and Priests will all lose a bag too.
---
&gt; You can play another stress test
---
Keep in mind that the starting zones on the last stress test will be an absolute shit show.
---
Well an app for choosing a class isn't that far fetched.
---
If you think how much ppl ask for help because they can't decide.
---
And i have see ppl doing much more work just because they are bored. :)
---
Every expansion just forgets old world. It feels like previous world do not even exist anymore. Every expansion just introduces new small island in middle of nowhere. And then there is one new main city where people hang out.
---
You are right.
---
&gt;In a PURE PvE World ... Ashkandi goes to the undergeared Hunter your guild just recruited... but double Dawn's Edge with +Agil enchants is far superior, IMO\~
---
Naah, playing on private server, got Ashkandi on my pally. We just /random 100 rolled it since its not really PVE item for anyone at that stage. I loved that SM lore part. Not really using it for anything else, tbh.
---
He's on the list already.
---
God yes, me too.  
---
(After MC clear) "You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning... Speak no more of your rights to Sulfuras. Go."
---
Pretty sure pets aren't affected by it or hunters in my guild DEFINITELY would've used their pets.
---
There's an add-on called autolootplus for retail. I'm sure it'll release for classic as well.
---
How to impress him. 
---
If hes a caster, roll a priest and power infusion him on cooldown
---
If hes a melee dps or tank roll a shaman and keep him 100% uptime on windfury totem
---
If hes a healer roll a class that can peel for him
---
And if you really want to get his rocks of make your name something super nerdy that hes into
---
May you have a happy birfday then!
---
...so you want one of those Facebook quizzes from 2010?

c) Prepare casting a powerful fireball!

I didn't have misses on lvl 30 ,idk why.
---
Hmm... I think SL warlocks are God Tier, then shadow priest, frost mage, cb/prep rogues S tier, and everything else below that as far as duels gi
---
Haha canny
---
Jeah you are right. And lets be honest, I wont be in a top guild, pushing for AQ and Naxx.
---
I just hope I won't get killed 24/7 in wpvp, because of the issues the hunters in beta apparently have.
---
#HOGGER
---
That was added only in early cata or late wotlk. I still have a macro attached to immolate that disables error messages, furious button smashing was a basic gameplay element required for 100% activity in fights.
---
The classic: a dwarf paladin in full judgement armor, or
---
a gnome warlock in T2, the mixture of dark purple and glowing green should look great.
---
Go mage cause you keep going back 2 it
---
Lol that actually sounds funny. Probably not usefull but funny. Im gonna search that quiz right now.
---
Hunters are monsters in PvP lol
---
Mend pet was also instant, like a renew unless my memory is corrupted by age.
---
Oh I absolutely would never consider raiding as a cat with 0/30/21. Mind you I'd never consider raiding as a cat in the first place. Flexibility is the name of the game as far as what I want to do.

Currently weekly clearing NAXX in private server, tbh, i have no idea. When the pull happens, im spam healing my tank so hunter pets are least of my worries. Maybe ill remember to check it out tomorrow.
---
What you can is right before leaving wow, you farm the mcp for 20min, then tomorrow when you log on you can farm again before doing something else.
---
Or if you have a few thing to do, farm for 20min, do the thing you need to do for 40min, and farm again for 20min.
---
Funny enough, at least on the server I played on, 45 minute baron runs were touted the standard UD Stratholme runs. Not necessarily because players were doing the quest for it, but because it was just some sort of point of pride or just the standard that became expected. 
---
There wasn't really any logic behind it, but I remember there being a very strong attitude about if you couldn't do it in 45 minutes you were shit.
---
And if you messed up and did anything that could compromise a 45 minute run you'd get kicked regardless of if anyone in the party needed the quest run or not.
---
I don't think that they are the "best" though I could see how you could say they are the most well-rounded. They have tons of utility, CC, and damage, but still aren't quite as important or impactful as a warrior in the raiding scene.
---
For real though, check out [this post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky3V7LJunEw) which outlines the MANY problems you will face as a mage trying to AoE farm. These things affect mages much more than other classes, with hunters being a close second. Leeway alone has me rolling lock over hunter.
---
Classic+ 
---
New raids, new maps, 2v2 arena, balance patches (little tweaks only, nothing major), maybe some new special tabards/titles - nothing that affects the game.
---
Well fk, it says I'm a monk....
---
Always take the tank one because it's bis (and other trinkets don't even come close) meanwhile you can find some good dps trinkets to replace the dps one.

That is the realm i used to play on in Vanilla
---
/farewell
---
People that want to get there and play from beginning to phase 4 will get there. 
---
Were not in 2004 anymore.
---
Night elf would be completely fine, too. Druid warrior and priest covers tank and healing needs, rogue and hunter covers dps and utility. Twin emps will be fun, but that's it.
---
My problem is: Solo viability vs. group/interactive viability.
---
Lvling solo its totally rogue for me..
---
But in a grp and (I love dungeons) and even in group pvp there are the support classes(druid pala shamans priests) that really shine and make the game.
---
I was confused as to why I should be impressed by a low res looking image of a gnome before I zoomed in. Holy shit, this is incredible.
---
Except some of them aren’t vanilla mechanics and instead are artificially produced to try and replicate vanilla like spell batching is
---
That's an IV drip not a catheter
---
it really just depends whether or not you know someone who is goblin engineer or are willing to level an alt to craft goblin stuff.
---
nothing in gnomish engineering breaks so its fairly safe to drop once you have gotten all your stuff and/or do not care about having the gadgetzan portal.
---
If you don't re roll goblin then every time you want to re-make all your goblin boots or sapper charges you need to find someone who is or be prepared to level an alt to 35 just so you can craft your own stuff.
---
The battle chicken is actually really strong, its level is based on your skill in engineering, so for twinks (level 39) for example can summon a level 60 chicken, or 63 if gnome(due to +15 racial).
---
it can also give a 5% haste buff to your party which is useful in dungeons/raids / it can enrage and do really strong damage / can be summoned and will stay summoned even if you equip a different trinket.
---
I'm quite certain the mount drop rate was unchanged.
---
What's the rarest? I'm guessing atiesh?
---
Oh yeah, like a level 56 Holy Paladin can -easily- farm DME. xD Not as fast as a mage, but it's really easy gold for a paladin.
---
Ragnarök online for me. Reaching level 99 back in the day took ages, way longer than 60 in classic, and a single % of exp at 90 and up was an accomplishment.
---
Needless to say, dying meant losing a ton of said exp.
---
Freezing Trap and movement has absolutely nothing to do with Spell Batching, but please keep talking out of your ass. And a rogue wasting vanish for a  flare is in the hunters favor, especially if it's Orc Hunter. Flare is used when you're trying to avoid getting opened up on (aka the start of a fight or after a reset) so if the Rogue wants to waste the most valuable cooldown across all rogue specs just to ensure an opening then let him, the Hunter (especially orc hunter) already has a relatively easy matchup vs rogue so unless there's a massive gear difference, the hunter is not dying in a full cheap to kidney shot. All the skill in rogue comes down to knowing exactly when to use vanish and prep because they're so versatile and using vanish that early in a hunter matchup is basically a death sentence. You shouldn't even be allowed to talk about WoW Classic if you're just going to talk out of your ass like you know something, just admit you don't know anything and ask others instead of mindlessly shouting "iS tHiS sPeLlbAtChiNG????"
---
I never heard of it, just that people who mananged to do it was cool.
---
Librams won't be in the game till phase 5; yeah.
---
Oh me too, it was just part of the Vanilla magic with those types of urban legends that sprung up in the community.
---
Taunt isn't why paladins are bad in raids. There's no properly itemized gear for paladins, so they have significantly lower health and avoidance than warriors. A good number bosses are immune to taunt.
---
Rough
---
I love the class and its intricacies, but I already put my time in. 4 months of Naxx raiding, still stuck in T2. Never got a single piece of gear in AQ, even though I had priority on Badge of the Swarmguard (never dropped, cleared from day 1 till Naxx, had priority because I hadn't gotten loot since my last piece of T2 + xbow which took 7 months to drop). Amazing class through ZG though. After that, well, I guess its fun in a meme guild that doesn't care about loot distribution. Which means you likely won't ever kill KT and get your last upgrade, the KTxbow, which I also never got because we only killed him twice. Naxx is a guildkiller!
---
Hell of a year and a half though.
---
Spell batching may have always existed. They may have merely reduced the interval as hardware got better.
---
'do all this crap to be as good as a prot warrior using a nightfall'
---
Accurate.
---
It is also great in Maraudon if bad things happen, rocks don't have friends, so you can fear those elementals all you want.
---
I live in Asia (for now) and plan on playing US, probably East Coast. How do I get the best possible ping?
---
You will put out more damage than a prot warrior using night-fall, and definitely have higher healing. And provide a blessing which allows the raid to have another Dwarf Priest instead of a Holy Paladin.
---
Would it be cool if after the final phase they added the Scarab Lord titles?
---
I think Kara is the most obvious choice for content. It could also be a bridge into making Classic TBC. They could make it an actual RP point that you have to defeat Classic Karazhan to transfer your character to Classic TBC servers after the first phase of Classic TBC is over. Past that it's anyone's guess. The real problem of actual new content is making new areas match the vanilla artstyle. Elaborate BFA scenes just wouldn't feel right. It's a weird box to force people to be creative in.
---
it is said that the taurens cut all the trees in Mulgore to master their long distance melee'ing true true
---
I have no idea what most of these people are telling you about pets dying on most bosses. Once you get hit capped through gear you usually go MM/BM and maybe 3 points in survival. Meaning you have some nice pet talents to choose from in BM.  I can honestly say after alot of practice I can keep my pet up on 80% of the fights. With the standard raid buffs. The damage my pet does is about 10-15% of my total damage which is pretty significant imo.  On ragnaros for example my pet stands where melee stands and he goes in when raid leader tells the melee to go in. Then when they go back out it just goes back. This will keep your pet up throughout the fight if it's specced fire resist and health
---
The year was 2005 and I was 16, but I only played a bit on my friends account.  
---
Didn't properly start playing on my own account until 2008 after I had gotten out of the army at 19.
---
At 10 during TBC. Didn't have powerful enough PC at the time so I played at a friends house on his laptop. Good times.
---
They are trolls mon they aren't meant to be perfect and clean cut, they are meant to be tribal, savage, a bit rough around the edges
---
Why isn't there an app... The app you need is located inside your skull.

brokentooth will have 1.0 attack speed in classic

shadow priests don't return mana in vanilla :)

Mass dispell

This made me jizz back then. Man I was hyped for release at the time and spent a few hours in the front of the queue at the mall at midnight on release day a few years later.
---
Did one big mistake tho and that was to roll the opposite faction of my friends. Lol, my argument was "so I could kill them" haha. 15y old me had no idea what an mmo really was. 3 years later 18y old me had no idea what a woman really was and this is how hooking the game was at the time haha. 
---
My mother used to say I had an addiction. I used to say I had determination ;).. Lol she even took the fuses at night to my room, I solved it by using an extension cable from the laundry room  which went out through the window and into my adjecent room to power my rig and the modem. 
---
Poor mom.
---
The reason to care about punishment is that it serves as a deterrent.
---
You are right that it is the automation that is the problem. People are just a little careless with the phrasing, making it easy to unintentionally as well as intentionally strawman them.
---
But what if I don't know, what is important, if it comes to choosing the right class?
---
Oh dear, where to begin.
---
You focus entirely on Nightfall. Which sucks. Nearly nobody wants to raid as a ret paladin and just be the Nightfall bot, who works his ass off and doesn't get any gear unless nobody needs it anymore because their only purpose is applying Nightfall. If that's good enough for you, fine, but making a guide, saying that this is the ONLY way you can play ret in pve and every ret must go for this, is ludicrous. Nightfall is necessary to have and if you feel the need you should switch to it, as it provides a raid dps increase when raiding as AP ret, yes, but using it all the time is a no go for me and many others. You also ignore spelladin ret.
---
The problems begin with you recommending dwarf, human is far superior due to the weapon skill. Yes, it doesn't matter when using Nightfall, but by going dwarf you pretty much gimp yourself to be a nightfall bot already, because you miss a very powerful pve racial.
---
Then the spec, two question marks for me. guardians favor 2/2 instead of repentance. Why? Vindication 1 point why? It procs on bosses and blocks a debuff slot. Also why those alts and a recommendation not to farm? This is pretty much the best paladin farm build. You'll certainly lose more time levelling two chracters to 60 than you lsoe from farming a bit slower with your ret.
---
A few tidbits about the gear, I could argue more about it, but it's a lot of personal preference and points where there certainly is contention. You also need those 3% extra hit comapred to a normal pve ret by going pure nightfall. So I limit myself to the objective problems:
---
pre-bis: 
---
* Arcanite Reaper. Why? It's marginally better than Demonshear or Malowns Slam. Both are much easier and cheaper to obtain and benefit from human weapon skill bonus, which makes them better than arcanite reaper. Completely stupid to recommend this weapon. 
---
* Your gear has 5% hit. What? That's too much for human and not enough for dwarf. Human needs 3%, dwarf needs 6%. 
---
* Libram: good luck getting a libram pre-bis, those are phase 5 items.
---
phase 1:
---
* Nightfall, good luck getting that phase 1, it's a phase 3 item. Also, if you truly think Nightfall is availble in p1, making arcanite reaper is even sillier as you would pretty soon after craft another weapon.
---
phase 1-4:
---
* generally lacks spelldmg. Rank 12 and 13 pvp items, yeah, technically good. But putting the blue ones here is more realistic.
---
phase 5:
---
* Wtf is up with suddenly using dmg proc trinkets? What's the point? Neither scales with spellpower and while I'd accept Maelstrom as possibly useful, I'd need more testing on this, heart of wyrmthalak certainly isn't good enough. And if maelstrom is useful, you could have put this in much earlier, as it's available from Phase 3.
---
* Gauntlets of the righteous champion. Those are nice on paper, but compared to annihilation, you lose 20 str and 1% hit for 16 spelldmg and 13 int. I do understand adding them here, as you generally want to pass on annihilation in favor of the fury warriors and righteous champion is only useful to a ret, but technically, they aren't bis.
---
* Ossirians binding. I don't get it, compared to Onslaught, you trade 31 str for 20 agi and 10 int. That's a downgrade. Since you have onslaught on your list in previous phases, this is puzzling.
---
Overall, I'm not a fan of this guide. You advocate a ret paladin playstyle, where you are a nightfall bot, who also spends his time and mana cleansing the raid of debuffs instead of maximizing dps. Yes, that playstyle is fair enough, no problem with that, you play a pure support raid, who helps his raid and doesn't care about personal dps. But to advocate this playstyle and at the same time advocate farming consumables like crazy and spending tons of gold on expensive crafts like arcanite reaper and lionheart helm just so you can pad your dps, which you already gimp by using nightfall and spending your mana on cleansing instead of consecration is ludicrous. 
---
Nightfall ret is the lazy build, it's the ret build you use, when you want a raid spot without spending too much time. Going the extra mile, to squeeze a little more dps out of this, just so it's only slightly behind a normal AP ret build without all those consumables is pretty silly.
---
Well, it's more interactive than just standing there mostly auto'ing the mob.
---
Thursday and Sunday, till naxx is out then possibly Tuesdays too. Is best schedule.
---
Yeah that's stupid. If you wanna do a specific run, then make sure the players you invite are up for it and expect a majority to not answer you.
---
loving this 0.2% accuracy meme
---
as a mage just suck it up and respec, you farm gold faster then any other class in the game anyway, especially once phase 2/pvp comes out since DM:E will be out.
---
trying to make a hybrid spec just gimps you in both PvP and PvE.
---
That's right, usually those dungeons are done in 5 mans for their quests but sometimes if you're farming for specific items (like Righteous Orbs for your guild) 10 mans can be done.
---
Nice troll post.  
---
Go back to playing runescape again
---
Maybe I misunderstand, what do people mean when they say "loot lag"? Guessing it's not the fact that the loot window stays up half a second when you auto-loot.
---
Aye. I used to use sweeping strikes in PvP when facing a priest/plate user. Focus priest, and attacks would hit the plate user as if they had cloth armor. Not sure what I’m going to play, but it was an extremely useful tactic at the time.
---
WC is an annoying place to tank anyways. So many casters, spread out groups, mobs that sleep etc.
---
If you have a competent group with some cc or ranged, it is easy. If you only have melee grunts that only know hitting stuff makes them dead you have to be really careful and line of sight pull etc.
---
Both works, but the difficulty difference for the tank is huge.
---
early on this build is going to suck balls due to lack of gear, not only are you missing 15% mana reduction in the frost tree but are skipping arcane meditation.
---
this build is also 100% worthless if there is another mage also doing winter's chill.
---
&gt; Spell batching is quickly becoming the new phrase for blaming shit play. 
---
I thought spell batching was needed to prevent you from hopping layers more then 3 times a second, singlehandedly crushing the economy while dominating PvP?
---

If you hold RMB down, your position is continually updated as its constantly issuing an action to the server. if you autorun or charge, the server updates your position less frequently - presumably, defaulting to the 400ms of spell batching which makes sense in the Charge case. Combine that with autorun in sprint before a trap, and you now see rogues IDGAFing traps. I think this is called position interpolation though so I may be wrong on spell batching, but the concept is quite similar.
---
The vanish-flare thing isn't a dealbreaker, its more that it's possible that I don't like. Maybe I'm not full HP sitting in a flare. Maybe I'm drinking at half HP. Still stupid that it could happen to me. 
---
By the time AQ hits hunters get outgeared. You have BWL xbow, they have Death's Sting. Getting hit in T2 gear by a Kingsfall rogue is NOT fun. And this WILL be you unless you are the hunter GM of a guild running no loot council. So for over half the game you will be very inferior to the equal-skilled player of a rogue and be punished heavily. You'll get bursted way too hard and have prior-tier gear to answer to it with. I've played 4 hunters to 60 and played through Naxx, I know my class and I tell  the truth.
---
The thing that gets me with the hate for "meme" specs, is that those specs are legit some of the most powerful specs in pvp. But some people here talk like pvp doesn't exist, and everyone will be raiding 24/7

Ah, I see your Schwartz is as big as mine!

Good gold and good XP

I obviously wasn't good at it,  but I started playing WoW when I was six years old, at launch. I had an uncle who worked for Blizzard at the time and most of my Dad's family was in game development, so it made sense. Never found a game that could replace it, and it saddened me to see it go the way it did. Been yearning to play Vanilla again for so long, even if I don't have any right to.

Well, to be honest, Tesla is announcing a number of cars that they will produce every year, they actually produce about 1/3rd of what they announced, and sell about half of those.
---
It only looks like they sell more that they can produce, because they deliver even LESS than they what are selling.
---
Word of mouth is powerful...but Tesla clearly isn't the best example. They do also do fuckloads of advertisement.
---
Thing is...Tesla sucks balls, and they actually sell about 10% of what they SAY they will produce. 
---
But yeah, for Classic, social media and word of mouth is probably enough, and I also don't see an advertisement campaign for Classic.
---
Maybe later down the road.

This is cool. I noticed that some of the icons occur twice. Perhaps a variant is possible where every icon must be unique? Granted I understand that wouldn’t turn it as nice but it would be equally interesting.
---
I play shaman and druid. 2h Enhancement mostly, and druid ive tried everything from tanking at 60 to levelling as balance (dont do that btw). I think hybrids are the most balanced in Vanilla, and no, im not trolling.
---
 I think it is possible to create more five man progression. It should be new dungeons though. No "heroics" or "mythics". The difficulty of these dungeons should be set at tbc heroics (as they were in blues= mechanichally harder than most raids) when at tier 0,5 level and you might need to do the full d2 chain as an attunement? This way it would never turn into a catch up mechanism as that is some major work that very few did back in the days. 
---
 A way to keep this vanilla and not replace raiding gear is to require "awful"  attunements like the d2 chain. This means a LOT of grinding coupled with weekly lockouts, making it an option that is harder than getting gear from raids. The Bosses loot tables could also be pretty big.
---
But there must still be a gear incentive to run content. I remember how fun I thought the challenge dungeons were in WoD but I couldnt get anyone of My Friends to run them much at all. Same thing in wotlk: I wanted to keep raiding Ulduar until completion but as soon as ToC released ni one in My Guild wanted to go back.
---
&gt;  Ashkandi goes to the undergeared Hunter your guild just recruited... but double Dawn's Edge with +Agil enchants is far superior, IMO~
---
Double enchanted Dawn's Edge would only give 60 rAP (2 rAP per agi with each enchant giving 15 agi) and 2% crit. Compared to the 136 ap (and 33 Sta) that you would get from Ashkandi(86 ap base) with enchant(25 agi = 50 rAP). 
---
There is no way 2% crit makes up over double the AP.

I am really curious as to how many are still playing? It has been a while.

It's moving in straightline because any other movement, including camera turns and RMb down, updates your position. So you have to be moving in a straight line and be moving at at least 110% bonus or more. That clip you're talking about is him with pots+40mount and trying whenever spring was off cd and he still fails 90% of the time. A hunter is going to hit FD x freeze or Frost, it's unlikely in any situation where a rogue is just going to retard walk into a frost, and if you want to be the rogue who saves sprint for fdxtrap to MAYBE run over the trap (are you even sprinting in the right direction because you can't turn once you decide to run over the trap) instead of just saving the Sprint for something more useful and 100% more likely to actually work.
---
It’s also my birthday
---
This is basically my goal as Shaman as well, but the way we'll attain gear is hoping no one requires it for their main specs
---
Huh, I missed that in 1.10. TIL, thanks!

Although that was still 1.3 for the changes I mentioned
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0
---
*Dungeon Player Caps* 
---
*All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.*
---
*With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:*
---
* *Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members*
---
* *Blackrock Spire - 15 members*
---
* *Dire Maul - 5 members*
---
*All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange. In addition, will have their loot improved significantly for the next content patch.*
---
I hope someone comes through with some help.  I would like to know also
---
My trolls always were bold, because the hair colour determines the colour of the war paint. So I don't care. 😊
---
&gt; I stand by the Nightfall for reasons that should be obvious;
---
Yes, that's fair enough, but it's not the only way to play ret and a any other ret can equip his nightfall and play  this style as well, when needed by the guild. There is no point gimping yourself by deliberately only considering Nightfall. Nightfall is a tool in your toolbox, it's not the end all be all.
---
&gt; If my guide did not rely on Nightfall, I would 100% recommend human; but Dwarf is stronger in PvP
---
Correct, but by going Dwarf you also gimp yourself for PVE for everything else. Even if you focus Nightfall and use it on progress, you can use better weapons against bosses on farm and then you reduce your dps by not being human. It's personal preference as a nightfall focus, whether you want stoneform for pvp or more pve power as human. But for any ret who isn't nightfall foxus, which will be msot pve rets, human is the way to go.
---
&gt; Vindication Does not proc on any raid bosses
---
Ok, I'm not sure about that, whether it's a private server thing, but it's there in the 1.10 patch notes, so I guess I misremembered.
---
&gt; Malown's Slam (the way the proc works -- and I did consider it)
---
Are you sure? That would be pretty silly. I'll test that on my private server.
---
&gt; because I am pretty sure that wyrm's heart did scale with spellpower
---
Would surprise me. Afaik only lifesteal procs scale with spellpower and if heart did scale, it should also easily beat out darkmoon card. I'll test that on my private server too and I'll keep the item in mnid for classic.
---
&gt; I do know the Kazzak neck piece scaled with spellpower 
---
Would be insane if that scaled in classic. Easy bis item, if it did and would likely turn spelladin into a top dps spec.
---
For bis items, you can also consider spelldmg pieces for neck, cloak, trinkets and especially rings. The physical dps rings are all pretty terrible. Wrath of Cenarius is easy bis, if it procs on consecration ticks.
---
And yes it's no argument that t3 hunter has maybe the worst upgrade from t2 of any class and pets don't scale and yadddadadadaddaafa, that shit hardly matters for PvP, which is all anyone should actually care about.
---
Horde (for life!)! I want to play a Shammy and fully embrace a tank spec and see how far I can go! Have been reading guides and watching footage literally all day today! How about yourself -- still circling round with idea like many others? :D
---
Should only use mage skillicons when making a mage ;)
---
Pick his faction and server. Other than that, don't look up anything, be a complete noob and just have fun.
---
If he's a vanilla player, you discovering stuff on your own will hit him in the nostalgia so hard he will have fun just being part of the experience.
---
Try to not get explanations about everything but if you feel stuck, don't wait till you get frustrated and ask him for help.
---
IMO this is the best way to impress him with playing the game.
---
My wife and I have just started season 2, it is a bloody good show.
---
Too bad the callendar shows June though
---
Damn, even the wiki is wrong?
---
This is some nice mental gymnastics you are doing here.
---
First of all, there was no balance in classic, you should rephrased it to "known vanilla rankings". 
---
Secondly you are wrong about moves and abilities being designed with bathing in mind. Let me give you a very fast example:
---
*Vanish -  Allows the rogue to vanish from sight, entering an improved stealth mode for 10sec. Also breaks movement impairing effects.* 
---
Now please let me know where in the vanish tooltip does it say that it prevents CC, damage, basically a bubble??? Let me give you the answer - NOWHERE. Yet I can vanish mortal coil if i'm fast enough, or an Aimed shot and so on.
---
Nightelf Hunter comprised solely of weapon icons
---
I wonder why...

Could be because pservers are wrong all over the place, including drop rates?

Going to check this out stat-wise, but I'm not using private server data for my list.

 **\[EU HORDE PVP\] Melee Cleave Dungeon Farming**
---
We’re recruiting a few players for our semi-hardcore dungeon-leveling team. Our main goal is to ding level 60 before 5 days played time, over a maximum 7 day period, while also getting multiple pre-raid BIS items and attunements in this time. 
---
It’s very important to us that you are both **trustworthy and trusting** in us, as all of the items that is not used within the group will be sold and shared equally among our party. We are expecting to be able to afford mounts and training for all our members at level 40, and still be wealthy at 60. However, gold farming is not our main goal.
---
Our setup will consist of 3 warriors, an enhancement shaman and a priest.
---
As of now **we’re in need of 2 warriors and a priest who knows how to play their classes well, with a good knowledge of the game**,but most of all **is communicating well, and is fun to play with**, as we’ll be hanging out for a week straight.
---
We'll always try to keep you updated with two handed weapons and wand to keep you hitting hard at all times.
---
**Expectations**
---
* You’re someone who will take at least 7 days off from all responsibilities and don’t mind meal-prepping to shorten the time AFK. We will take breaks once in a while, but this will be worked out among the group to find breathers where it fits all.
---
* You’re willing to play for 16-18h a day for the time it takes to achieve our goal (max 7days). This is with the exception of our first gaming session which will be from 00:00 to 23:00
---
* You’ll prepare a good leveling route upto level 10 for your class (sub 2 hours max on empty private servers). The route from 10 to 14 will be shared. If you’re leveling orc or troll, we can provide you with a good route up till level 14
---
* You know that trust goes both ways, and you’ll therefore always do what’s best for the group and the group will do what’s best for everyone.
---
Once the group is filled, we’ll jump on our own live private server to show the basics of how we'll clear each dungeon the most efficient and agree on stuff such as schedule and extra stuff such as professions.
---
Once the Classic WoW stress-test is rolling out on 25th.July we’ll log in to test our 1-12 leveling route and practise our RFC run (as it caps out at level 15)
---
**Our Goals**
---
* Reach level 60 within 7 days with a playtime of under 5 days /played
---
* Get multiple pre-raid BIS items before reaching 60.
---
* Completed multiple attunements, such as MC, Scepter of Celebras and ZG mallet, and getting Onyxia Attunement once 60 is reached.
---
* Afford mounts to all- if not then atleast 4 members already at level 40, the shaman (me) will then be the one not getting mount - and use Ghost Wolf until mount is afforded for me as well.
---
Once level 60 is achieved, we’ll go ahead and share all the profit we’ve made between level 40 and 60 and hopefully still remain as good potential "dungeon-/honor farming buddies" to have on friends list and maybe even become good friends.
---
If you’re curious to know more about us, or our plans - feel free to hit me with a PM, and I’ll try to fill in the blanks.
---
If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please send me an application on Discord stating the following info:
---
* Your Class
---
* Age, Nationality
---
* A brief overview over your experience with WoW and exp with your class. Both Retail and Private servers. 
---
* Other info, such as your plans for Classic and how your schedule will look from the week of release.

You are telling me that you want to get 400 sp preraid? Is BWL a preraid raid or what?
---
i think i can count on one hand how many times i actually summoned a doomguard.
---
no, there is no patch 30, that patches are always listed 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12
---
Could you make Carine Bloodhoof with only warrior and shaman icons?
---
2.0 nerfed the stats of every Vanilla NPC and upped the XP gain from kills and quests.
---
So, no, 1-60 wasn't untouched. It was VERY touched.
---
Depending on your class and spec you are not going to clear DM/WC fast. Furthermore, on a relatively fresh server the AH will be filled with drops from these dungeons, so the prices will be low. 
---
I would just recommend grinding from 38 to 40 if you are lacking money.
---
Join a better raiding guild than him, and make a warlock, show him your charectar in T2, blow his head off

Do you have any evidence move speed on boots stack with feral swiftness? I've never heard it should.
---
Just don't give up...I started during classic with my husband. You will learn it. Don't be afraid to ask other players questions..yes there are some rude players , but the community on a whole is friendly and helpful. Have fun!
---
I'm confused, who said 30?
---
I thought it was a cat litter box. My cats would definitely love it
---

---
If you're farming healing gear while tanking, you'd need to run with a priest healer, no? Paladins, shamans and other druids might not appreciate you rolling on their main gear for your ofspecc I imagine?
---
When people give up their free will because they don't like the weight of their decisions, that is when dictators come in to fill that void promising all the answers.

Amazing that you get downvoted despite so much evidence that spell batching is done wrong on the beta client to how it was in vanilla. But Its clear the majority just dont know and wont care. People dont know what theyre missing out on. All the people downvoting you have never played competative pvp or learned how to spend globals, predict and bait properly. They dont understand batching was important because you could trade spells if you predicted them and timed your own globals to the exact second. This was a huge part of pvp from vanilla-wotlk. But yea just let it die, and lets play bfa-classic wow :))

CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!!
---
Raspberry..!
---
True for warriors. For druid tanks, the armor gets multiplied by 3.6 and the trinket is bis forever, while BB will get replaced eventually if u raid a lot.
---
No. Have *always* played PvP servers and considering the time i’ll be able to put in, i don’t want to spend my time being entertainment for some neckbeard basement dwellers.
---
Depends how fast you level. If you play efficiently and solo quest to 40, you have no chance of getting mount at 40 unless you go on skill rations at lvl 30 and grind a lot.
---
My dad played from launch but introduced me to WoW a few months after that. He saw me playing Ragnarok Online and told me "no you need to play a real MMO" I think I was 9 at the time.

He's getting older now so retail is a lot to try and catch up on so im looking forward to classic and playing with him again in August.

**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting:**
---
\- knowledgeable raiders (all classes);
---
\- LUA Coder who can help our tech team build our custom DKP addon;
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, we are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy in both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, those raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 80% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
​**Intended raid/play times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to raid on Mon, Wed and Sun, from 19:00 (CET Timezone). Each raiding session will last around 3-4 hours.
---
**Aditional info:**
---
\- While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core;
---
\- Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet. It all depends if we can finish in time our custom DKP addon. Hence our need for a LUA coder.
---
**Bottom line:**
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/) ​ or check our Discord here [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK ](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK)

May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

So people have to explain themselves to you why they want 60 asap? They need your permission or sth? Use the time you spend writing around your insecurities to practice leveling and maybe you won't have to worry about lagging behind.
---
so play how you say, not how I want?  Fuck scenery
---
Christ this sub really is full of fucking morons that completely missed the point. It was more aimed at people that feel that they NEED to rush. If you want to play 16 hours a day and piss into a bottle and shit into a doritos bag then cool.
---
I guess People that lurke around on Reddit are more likely to be hardcore Players :P
---
If they like rushing to 60 in order to farm some mats before everyone else etc. - just let them be!
---
That means that there is less competition while leveling for you and everyone is happy playing the way they want. 
---
No one will feel pressured to rush to 60. If you have 18 hours to Play a day - you will be 60 quite fast either way :P If you don't have that much time - you can't rush to 60..
---
&gt;Also, I believe it was confirmed that buffs like lotp do not provide their full benefit vs bosses.
---
This is true but not true. As everyone crits less all the raids dps is lower increased crit on the tank group still proportionally increases threat.
---
&gt;If you're going 31 feral, there's no reason to go that deep into resto. You're better off picking up omen of clarity.
---
There is. One from 0/30/21 you only lose NS. Which is big in 5 mans, and pvp, but not that big of a deal in raids.  Two Tranquil touch is nice for healing. Three, this is a spec that doesn't offer a raid as much, Sure the druid gets to do more but the raid gets less. 
---
You are already a hybrid with a triple role spec, not you aren't going to buff the tanks to increase the raid threat cap.. no one needs or wants such a druid. 
---
I could see 1/31/19 being fine. But there is no reason to bring a multi spec druid who isn't high balance or feral. NONE. Id rather just not have a druid like that in my raid.
---
You sound like a 13 year old moron.
---
Nah bruh. Poison cleansing totem ain't havin none of that.

With a heal pot + Healthstone I can survive long enough for my Corruption/AmpCoA to tick them down. And imp does pretty nice damage with imp imp, though likely I'll have succubus out and be spamming drain life.
---
And because I have succ out, I can just seduce and load up a soul fire/shadowbolt.
---
This post didn't age well
---
Lol damn good spotted.
---
Of course, but the sure thing is that mcp with full ap bis set will be worst that full caster bis 😁
---
Is this when they released 'Invincible' song?
---
which has ALWAYS been in retail, still to this day, and has never been there on private servers
---
Commenting on this to watch it later :)
---
Its not that itsbad for them, it just benefits other classes more.
---
What about that one in the barrens where an army of centaur spawn and you have to protect that one bunker.
---
That was a really sweet quest for me as a kid.
---
I think it is the end of a quest chain after you collect the centaur bracers and kill a couple of their leaders.
---
I'll be 40 September 9th.
---
I'm going to play as many hours a day as I can.
---
Only logging to take the garbage out, pay bills, and play Dungeons and Dragons.
---
I might work a shower into my first 48 hour stream.  
---
We'll see if I make it to 41.
---
Yeah raids would be 60 obviously (although I could make a decent case for Gnomer to be a 10ish man raid at the same level with only minor tweaks).
---
But you can't load everything to level 60, there are enough dry areas that could make levelling less grindy and more fun.
---
Which makes it bad for us going up against those classes I guess
---
Exactly - like Teamspeak just way easier to use and no Servers have to be rented AFAIK.
---
Don't Need to make an account either and don't have to download anything - just benefits ;)
---
26th in the americas ;)
---
Just save as much gold as you can while you level, and grind the rest from mobs the drop a lot of vendor trash then you don't need the AH.
---
Lmao people actually wanted leeway? In my memory i remember everyone hating from the start
---
What do you think?
---
Are you high?
---
Well... For Classic I suppose? I mean why not :o
---
They brought back Classic so they might as well :D But yeah I guess it is unlikely... Would Need Moderators etc. on Reddit the community just does it themselfs which is cheaper for Blizzard which will be the reason we won't have Forums... 
---
I get your idea now :D
---
Drop a letter in bwl or w/e starting a questchain about how the bad guys try to corrupt hyjal which you can only enter with the quest
---
If he refuses to play with you because you're to slow, unskilled, or get him killed a lot, but you really like the game....
---
He'll be single in no time, cause some smooth talking guy playing a Protection Warrior gonna carry you everywhere and make you feel amazing.
---
Just saying....
---
Nonono, I respect that achievement and I hope to be among those who do it.
---
It's just the kicking ppl for not being at the meta lvl yet that I don't care for
---
I was actually 11 when i started playing vanilla, seems like a great age to get some epics.
---
I have atm setup of ESC, tab, T and shift on the furthest left buttons. Then its 1234,qwer,sadf,zxcv. But the problem is that its doesnt feel as natural to use the shift as combo key as lets say ctrl on keyboard. Not that i have had to try to learn it before. The most obvious "alt" key is the thumb button, but have been using that as discord voice activation, as now, playing a pally i can fit everything on the keybinds i got.
---
I have like insta crit+trinket, few judgements, 2 big heal ranks, max flash heal, 3 consumables etc in naga. So basically all my heals + instacasts + consumables.
---
I really like orbweaver regarding ergonomics, the 8 direction pad might as well be 4 directions, unless you use it to move a char, its bit too flimsy to do more critical keybinds to it. Atm i have mount, map, quest log and open all bags on it so i dont have to open those from the actual keyboard.
---
I think ill try to learn putting the discord push to talk to orbviewer pinkie and use the more reliable thumb as alt button and get another 12 buttons for naga with that. The thing im also trying to optimize is accessibility. Imo 1,4,7 and 10 are the hardest to reach buttons, aka i will put things that are very situational to those. Like consumables and nature swift biggest heal. I want to keep the main heal buttons in the 5, 6, 8, 9 buttons because they are by far the easiest to reach and dont require odd thumb movement (and you are going to be spamming that key a LOT so less strain on thumb overall).
---
And ofc the reason i need to setup everything now, is to learn the keybinds to muscle memory "correctly" while levelup before raiding.
---
That's not lag. It's intentional from Blizzards part to let you see what you're looting. You can just cancel the window (by walking, for example) as soon as you click the loot button if you want and you still end up looting normally. Some people claim that DCs you, but I've been doing that for as long as I can remember and I've never DCed so I dunno.
---
True.
---
 I doubt you will be able to raid bwl, aq40 or naxx, you mean as druid ?
---
Just let me save you from yourself, okay?
---
Agreed!
---
And we all look forward to you and your guild "pushing progression" on a 14 year old game that's been solved. I bet you'll invent new metas, new tactics, and beat records.
---
&gt; 14 day on/14 day off schedule 
---
That sounds awesome, what do you do if you don't mind me asking?
---
The Arena gear was the worst of the tbc wellfare epics. I played in a very casual Friends and family guild with low play time and some quite bad players. We got arena weapons before most Kara weapons making gear progression less fun.
---
One of the most important aspect of "the vanilla spirit" is no catchup Gear given out for just logging in.
---
Too late that was some cringe shit and a know a little too much about that stuff. I hope everyone sees this
---
What about postures ? Are you on Berserker almost all the time ?
---
Why taunt pet when they use trap ?
---
If they did post-Naxx content, I wouldn't want it to just be endgame content. Something that TBC did that I greatly appreciate and find to be underrated is add more content to leveling zones, such as expanding Theramore and adding the draenei/nelf settlement of Forest Song to Ashenvale.
---
It keeps leveling fresh, and I've always preferred the leveling experience of WoW over endgame content. Of course they'd need and should add more stuff to do endgame, but I wouldn't want them to neglect 1-60 either.
---
But which mount can handle the deepest water before dismounting?
---
Yeah, just like all the crazy legends about what to do or not do to influence the chances of onyxia to do a deep breath.
---
Don’t fight it. Think of the bonus intellect!
---
Oddly enough I'd be nearly just as happy with faster land speed instead of flying.

Raid Attunement? No way. They need to stay. They MAY be changed a bit, but never removed. 
---
Onyxia Questchain? Good attunement. 
---
Heroic dungeons and therefor reputation grind was the only bad part on TBC attunements
---
DEY TUK UR 'TERMS!
---
Thanks! How far along can you find something that beats blackhand's for dps?
---
Do you know any examples? Always wondered how ppl do this.
---
the AH will be flooded with dirt cheap herbs and maybe ore, you could go back and level alchemy/smithing easily once you can generate gold at 40. I reckon mining and herbalism should be done as you level because by the time you are 40 the zones will still be populated and that will slow you down the most.
---
Something to remember is that every resource can be reduced down to time investments. If you look at the totality of 2 accounts. You might think getting to 40 and spending 8 gold on herbs is insane and not worth the gold. You can do pure gold farming runs and achieve 100% gold efficiency, or prioritize exp and get 100% exp efficiency, or you can do both and achieve 70 or 80% in both, working out to 140-160% gains overall. I always value actual levels because everything gets easier when you outlvl it.
---
This is the one to beat:  [https://sixtyupgrades.com/](https://sixtyupgrades.com/)
---
Not only its unfun and cluncky but also people ignore the fact that when you get hit you gain rage and although its better to hamstring kite its still totally fine to tank damage for more damage output.
---
Not to mention the risk of pulling extra mobs with the leeway in addition to some funky hitboxes sometimes. Id rather spend more time eating food then kiting with every single pull, hell no.
---
At first we were 2 old players of Wow classic willing to play. After some talk, I managed to bring 6 new wow players to play with us ! 
---
I think there's still gonna be some newbie like back in the day, but more easy to find info on the web.
---
Our guild MT in TBC replaced his thunderfury with the tanking mace from Lurker in SSC but I dont think it was truly surpassed until the tanking axe from supremus in black temple.
---
It was so fun tinkering with the speed of the mounts. All those things one could use. Bridle,Spurs, stopwatch etc. I have forgotten the names of most of them but it made a noticeable difference.
---
His reply is perfectly intelligible, while also being from EU (second language most likely).  
---
What a complete buffoon you are.
---
\- Character Max Level stays at 60.
---
\- Release new Raids and Dungeons (There are a few spots i can remember and was wondering whats going to happen with those as a hyped 14y old boi, 1. Ulduar protected by those elite giants for example - this area was very spooky to me. 2. Grim Batol in the Wetlands, also pretty much unused area in classic with potential)
---
\- Add new legendary Items, obtainable within the new content/raids
---
\- Add new open world/outdoor bosses
---
\- Add new crafting recipes for professions
---
\- (Add Arena)?
---
30+ is super fun once you get zerker stance / ww axe / pummle and ww not to mention sweeping strikes.
---
Just google "mosaic maker" and you will find a couple of programs. Im thinking writing one that uses wow icons so anyone can make similar images.
---
They tried doing "WoW2" - It was codenamed Titan. It ended up being semi-scrapped and they turned the remaining assets into Overwatch.
---
The shattari skyguard and Ogrila dailies were the first "bad" dailies. They awarded some really Good gear which made them non optional. (Bis feral tanking trinket).
---
Vile
---
Without having any math to back it up. Just from the feels i go agi till like 40 and then strength

yeah....no. As Zelnoth already remarked the droprates has been well documented. The reason TF is so common on private servers is mainly because a larger percentage of the playing population on any given server are able to clear MC. in vanilla it wasnt a small feat to clear MC, let alone getting the elementium ores from BWL.

In beta it was just like vanilla AFAIK (i.e. \~30 min respawns with static list of possible spawn points)
---
It's simple really. Eye of sulfuras is a 4-5% droprate. You only need to be lucky to get that. The other mats are easy to get (although expensive).
---
Does the movement speed even do anything in classic?, i feel like it doesnt. Whenever you learn a new rank of stealth you get faster during stealth but im not sure if base movement speed changes stealth movement speed but i might be wrong. I also feel like sprint during stealth does nothing but i might also be wrong on that.
---
Fixed and will not work in classic
---
Toxicity calls toxicity.
---
I love the toxicity that this sub has invented, it's amazing.
---
Because I think that a technical limitation then shouldnt be included now -- im a tourist.
---
Because I would have liked a toggle for newer character models -- im a tourist.
---
It's absolutely ridiculous.
---
I played Vanilla from Closed Beta to BC launch, I never even made it to having a flying mount in WoW.  Vanilla is all I know and love about the game, but because I believe in having current technical advances applied to the better game of yesteryear, Im a jabrony.
---
Be honest with yourself about some of this crap.  The spirit of the game back then was different.  You were out in the world or at least in IF/Org BSing with people.
---
From what I understand of retail you sit in your little pillowfort all day and wait for queues to pop.  These are two fundamentally different ways to experience a game world and it is things like that which set retail apart from classic.
---
Some bullshit about "i could sheep someone at the same time they sheeped me even though the other guy casted first, and this is a necessary thing, because I need to feel like archaic networking technology exists!  It's imperative to recapturing my youth!"
---
Listen.  Piss and moan all you want, but from this vanilla player... 95% of the malarkey going on under the #nochanges banner has nothing to do with what Vanilla was.
---
Give me a friggin break.
---
Yea they did, there is the ad where there is a guy looking for a seat on a bus and there are 2 choices. 1 is a relatively attractive female with an alliance sticker on her laptop, the other is a big overweight tattoo artist literally giving himself a tattoo on the bus, he doesn't take a second glance at the girl and sits next to the tattoo guy because he has a tattoo of the horde symbol on his arm. 
---
Idk why I didn't just link the actual ad but whatever lol.
---
Gnomes have +10% intellect (?) so that Might be the difference?
---
please dont tell me and others how to play the game.  
---
Everybody is experiencing he journey on its own speed i assume.
---
Any mana user will have the first aid poison cleanse with him ready to go, it's worth farming those poison sacks.
---
&gt;had a almost perfect 50/50 split and so did vanilla wow.  
---
I have no ideea where you got this piece of information but it's already been stated that the reason blood elves were switched last moment to the horde was trying to even the faction imbalance. That doesn't sound like perfect 50/50.   
---
In vanilla there were a lot more alliance than horde, because of pretty races. In current, there's a lot more horde, with 30-40% of the players being blood elves.

Complete BS, i was scared shit of skilled or well geard hunters back in the days. (In pvp and on the dps meters)
---
This nonsence that Hunters suck in vanilla is absolutely BS.
---
It  comes with this attitude that appearenyly everybody is gonna be a mythic level raider in classic and in turn the meta that goes with that is used to calculate everything.
---
I'm quite sure you're not because you owe me 6 points of IQ I lost reading your post.

# Our Plan for Classic WoW
---
We are adults with responsibilities, jobs, kids, college and lives outside of WoW so we understand that real life always comes first.  Despite that, we do want to progress through the content casually and run world-class battleground premades.
---
We have an experienced raid leader who has led all our past raids throughout the various World of Warcraft expansions.  We also have an experienced battleground leader whose focus is to help members with ranking. Our primary aim is to get drunk and have a laugh and throw some of the best parties that Orgrimmar has ever seen!   We are about 60 people so far, but not all those people plan on raiding or PVPing. Some will just be downright casuals and altoholics!

Total is actually really good then for % based racials.
---
So far I have not seen any evidence that leeway extends the deadzone to 11 yards. Just talk, but no proof.
---
Idiot
---
Yes, as a meme spec, your role is to be the meme mascot of the guild. One with perfect attendance rates and the one that does everything perfectly. That's what it means to be a mascot.

1991 representin'

It's a thing on private servers
---
Both classes are tier 1 leveling classes along with Warlock.
---
You will both be competing for the same gear(leather first 40 levels)/drops/loot (rings, cloaks, necks)
---
You should be easily able to down most elites for elite quests between the two of you. 
---
Pro-tip: always Thorns and MotW on the hunter pet. 
---
Your strength in Wpvp is kiting, rooting, dotting.
---
Have fun!
---
Yeah, he fact that you have to be "in a raid" -- and can't really 5-man him at the gear level you're expected to take on Nathanos, means he's a raid boss.
---
I mean, I love tesla, but they are not the best example. Everyone knows they exist. But at least here in germany people just dont know what they do. They are not aware of their range and speed and practicallity. everyone here can see the difference between a BMW 5 series and X5 series. Take a Model S and X and ask people what those cars are and the answer will be "A Tesla!" 
---
I know a guy who drove a Model S and couldnt name it. He said he drove the Tesla Sedan. I asked if it was the 3 or the S. He couldnt tell me.
---
And Tesla only sells "more cars then they can produce" because they are not building that many cars. First, they only have 3 cars. 3,S,X. Compare that to Volkswagen who have Polo, Golf, E-Golf, Passat, Tiguan, Touareg, Turan, Caddy, Sharan, Arteon, UP!, T.Cross. And thats only their main brand. They also have Bugatti, Audi, Porsche, Lambo and others. They probably build and sell more cars world wide in 2 weeks than tesla in a year. They exist for a hundred years and have a huge market. with more than 100 million cars on the road. Tesla will need decades to get to that level. 
---
WoM only works for tesla because they are tiny. 
---
And its also wrong to say tesla doesnt do ads. They DO ads. They just dont run them on the TV or in magazines. But they do have a promotion program for their next roadstar and use other platforms to promote their brand. Like youtuber who promote them.
---
I do love their cars, even tho I have only seen one of them in person 2-3 weeks ago. the Model S from my doctor. 
---
What happens there on cali is not really representative for the rest of the world
---
Who the fuck runs around 1-59 with an extra full set in their inv unless it's an optional spirit set??
---
Nope. No ads
---
Please say you're joking.
---
oh god ... you just reminded me of the grind to open AQ ... the nightmares are coming back now ...
---
You should probably go with a pet which can hold AOE aggro (owl I think is the one)
---
Also, a druid could role-play a hunter's pet, in case you're into it :)
---
If you are alliance and a hunter is NE you can ambush people from stealth and have a great time in STV and other PVP-heavy zones.
---
Can't wait for the seen by warlock.
---
Doesn't work for rogue in raids, they constantly pull aggro with it and die. Thunderfury would only be decent for a rogue in PvP.
---
Movement speed increases stealth speed.
---
Oh he meant to post on the pirate server reddit. This is for classic wow.
---
Loved the bag full of soulshards on the Mages seen by Warlocks row
---
I always used healbot as my raidframe. This way i can have all my healing spells on my mouse buttons which frees up my actionbars for cooldowns and totems.
---
It was total originally and then got changed at some point, as for when it was changed I can't remember I just remember Taurens having it changed because they were very strong as tanks.
---
**&lt;Songflower Serenade&gt; is a PST/Late Night Raiding Guild**
---
**[H][PvP][NA][Hardcore][Tues/Wed 8pm-12 PST (11pm-3am EST)][Loot Council]**
---
**Ideology**
---
Our goal is to offer a balance between time, efficiency, culture, and the WoW experience. Like-minded individuals interested in a fun atmosphere who can bring their A-game in raids are encouraged to apply.
---
Farming consumables, BiS gear (including PvP ranks), and other materials for top raid performance is required. The time commitment will be fairly hefty with ~8 hours of raiding each week (probably less with just MC out), 8-16 hours for farming, grinding gear, and helping guildies achieve their goals as well. We must use our knowledge of Classic WoW to position the guild to clear content quickly.
---
**Requirements**
---
Consumables and BiS gear are required for raiding. Deep knowledge of your class, the ability to perform under pressure, learn strategies, implement strategies, research &amp; understand encounters prior to raid, give and receive constructive criticism, and bring a positive, calm attitude is paramount to our future successes.
---
**Loot System**
---
Loot will be determined through a Loot Council. Most loot will be decided in council spreadsheets before zoning into raid. Wish lists and discussion between Raiders, Class Leaders, and other Loot Council members will be considered. Loot priority will be determined by reliability/raid attendance, raid performance, consumable use, effort into Pre-BiS and other gear, overall guild contributions, attitude, etc. Each raider will begin with a blank slate, and previous retail or private server achievements will not be taken into consideration when determining loot priorities. 
---
**To apply, ask questions, or chat join our Discord:** https://discord.gg/XBwxuTB
---
I just think they should have made zones like storm peaks in wrath, zones that was large both horizontally and vertically and only allowed flying in that type of zones.
---
And here I am sharing what I did to make that happen, sry if it doesn't seem to have been an issue for me I guess :p
---
No read the question then pit your foot in your mouth
---
No, the question here is not whether it's easy to play feral, but whether you understand what the word viable means. For something to be viable it simply has to not be impossible. Feral is viable. End of discussion.
---
Tauren is base, human and gnome are total. It was like the first thing stay safe tested
---
&gt;Taurens can melee across the entire map as long as it's in a straight line.
---
Mental image of Cairn bitchslapping people from atop TB while cackling maniacally
---
No inner fire or crit heal talent surprised me
---
This one took around 5 hours.
---
I know this is hyperbole but not every couple wants to get married.
---
Blizzard can put in whatever attunement they like - as long as it's not an attunement that requires lengthy questchain in RAIDS.
---
Those put an enormous administrative burden on the guild manager, because every week or two you have to go back to the fcking old raid instance to attune one or two people.
---
I'm all for painful and long attunement quests - as long as people can do them by themselves without requiring the entire fucking guild to help them.
---
Seems pretty rough around the edges. Look what happens to your secondary stats between levels 59 and 60, for example.
---
It feels just as difficult as before. I'm just better at the game. That makes it easier for me for sure but my perception of the difficulty is still the same. 
---
The strength of dungeon / not dungeon Mobs really is confusing me. It might be correct (probably is) but I don't remember it that way...
---
It probably is that way because "tanks" are not actually real tanks until Level 40+ really :d 
---
Having aggro of 3-5 Mobs that hit like non-elites is too much for most 30 tanks already so I guess it makes sense if they are a Little bit weaker - just due to the density of Mobs you sometimes get in dungeons
---
Im 100% with you. Its important to require lots of legwork to get to the new dungeons though. Something akin to the Tier 0,5 questline would be an excellent way of handling this content. It would last long and would also not replace mc/bwl as the optimal gearing Path.
---
Some RPG games have perma-death options......
---
Gravestone sceptre is replaceable mid 30s , certainly not 50s
---
Mouseover throw/shoot is really something useful against totems. I didn’t think of that so thanks.
---
Funny xD... could consider it...
---
Stances honestly always depends on the situation, you Get ccd and know you’re gonna be stuck for a while u use def stance to reduce dmg taken, enemy Dodges you switch to bstance and use overpower then back to berserker stance. U taunt pet to make him attack you when you are freezed by the hunter, his pet is then gonna break cc and the hunter wont be able to make it out of your intercept range or his deadzone
---
I have around 2000 icons to work with, the shape of the image in icon matters alot too!
---
You are wrong.

Something is "viable" if it's realistically possible. The word for "not impossible" is simply possible. 
---
Feral is only viable on the condition that farming weekly Gnomeregan for several hours is considered to not be problematic.
---
Using the word Retarded when the guy presented his case in a polite matter makes you look incredibility stupid and childish. 
---
Now that is said, am no Druid expert however if you look at raw stats and the benefits from it, 29 agil provides 1% crit and 1% dodge, some armor and AP at level 60 and obviously the scale goes up slightly with every level below while every 11 strength provides 1 dps-ish.
---
Now if you look a how the class is designed, you'd see that surviving is not that much of an issue for a druid as you throw one big heal after every fight and thus ACTUALLY survivng is not that important because its not needed in the first place.
---
Stacking strength will most likely provide you with the most raw damage without relieing on RNG to crit and thus as OP said that it will provide you with an overall higher average dps.
---
The only time where it is Agi&gt;Str all the way is when you get more combo points on crit from talents then the scale shifts heavily towards stacking crit.
---
This is strictly from PvE solo leveling prespective as in you will not engage in PvP.
---
Over 14 years. 
---
More than 168 months.
---
Exceeding $2500 in sub costs alone. 
---
I'm still here.
---
I think there will be 3 types of players: 
---
- noobie players, 
---
- returning "Been there, done that" players and
---
- returning "Didn't get to clear everything" players.
---
Most importantly, I hope the community allows for all types of players and doesn't expect everyone to know every fight mechanic, etc. The game may have been around the block, but not all the players have!
---
Here's hoping eveyone has a great journey regardless of their experience level.
---
I know this may be a hard question to answer beforehand, but I'll ask anyway. I envision spending most of my ingame time running dungeons as a healing priest. Do you expect the guild to do a lot of group content as well, or will it be more of a "show up to raid"-guild?

 &lt;Region&gt; Oceanic New Zealand and Australia (and around about there)

---
 NZ times raiding guild 7-10.30 pm New Zealand time Wed/Thursday optional Sunday for farm.

---
Anyone that was in the Guild ArtofWar in Vanilla shout out to your GM Arcon orc Shaman 📷 (was Hord)We have several Mythic raid leaders from hard core prog guilds (Frostmorne Alliance) 
---
 Also NSFW guild with brutal jokes and such just dnt be a dick.  Loot will be a mixture of loot council with monitoring system 
---
 Looking to Level Semi Fast 4-8 weeks on average but casuals are more than welcome  The server we are on will be announced in the discord 
---
 We aim for a super fun raid environment with lots of banter and shit talking while also getting all content done in a fast time. When you get to the boss everyone shuts up and kills it!.  We expect all members to play fair and well with all players on the server and not be a troll or ninja you will be kicked, guild reputation meant something in Classic and must be maintained.  
---
Come join and talk shit with us until classic is out!!
---
I think they need to lower the item level jumps between Raid tiers. I think the easiest way to do that would be to just decrese ilevel on Naxx/aq 40 Gear by 20 % and bwl Gear by 10% while retaining the tuning of the instances.
---
TF was not BIS for fury and was replaced very early on IIRC.
---
I played Tibia before a MMORPG released on 97. It's a endless grind game. When I started in 2002 the highest level was 120 with around 25000000 experience points. If that person died, which was likely because the game was fucking hard and player killers were everywhere, that person would lose 7% of total experience which is around 1750000 exp, which took atleast 17 hours to grind. Was even worse on a low level, I died on level 68, with 10% loss and lost 23 hours of grinding.
---
RPGs can be hard.
---
Hunter: 
---
Best race: PvP is NE by a lot. But Dwarf is also okay. For pve no very small slight favor to dwarves (like so small it may not exist)... just go NE.
---
Leveling/grinding - best leveler there is.
---
Raiding - typically always 1-2 , early on they do respectable damage just no scaling so by Naxx you were there for utility (and there are some good utility/kiting options.) Ammo, you have to use a bag for ammo and buy it also (farming and inventory space). Also have to feed your pet.
---
PvP - One of the highest skill cap classes in PvP, you could be crap or good. I would say favors AB and WSG over AV; in that order. Stronger on alliance than horde (paladins cleans poisons. Verses shamans, and well shamans will often favor dps over a cleanse in a bg.)
---
-
---
Mage: 
---
Best Race: Ga'nome in all cases. (Ga'nomes racials are good, but not AMAZING so you will be fine if you go human, still lose out some int, root break, etc.)
---
Leveling/grinding - Could actually beat a hunter if on a pserver. On classic mid to lower leveling speed (compared to others, i would put them ~5th). Nice in that you just blast stuff then drink. Loved for your amazing CC and water for leveling also. Greater farming if they fix mob AI/leeway which is nuts on classic atm.
---
Raiding - Best caster the entire time, Scale well. 2nd highest overall dps behind warrior. Once you respec Fire, if you get the ignite roll (1-2 mages per boss), you will beat everyone else on that fight by a good amount (fun to trash talk). Honestly, if someone makes a good addon for dps meter it should divide the ignite between all the mages; at this point you would see actual mage dps (its still very high). Once you respec Fire later on, you are rather shit in MC and BWL if you go back for some reason.
---
PvP - Another higher skill cap class. Can be played in the same spec as you raid, which is honestly just a lock thing otherwise (some others can kind of do it but mages and locks are the best at this for sure). Stronger verse random bgs (polymorph will often last the entire time.) Good.
---
Best Race: Still Ga'nomes for the same reasons.
---
Leveling/grinding - 2nd best leveler there is. Also good at farming. I enjoy lock leveling far more than hunter or mage. You can handle elites very well or groups. You can burst, aoe multi, or drain tank to never lose any hp or mana while largely non stop casting. Two less bother than hunters for leveling, no need to tame the world or feed you pet, just make a soul shard, do a quest or two, and you are good.
---
Raiding - Always have 2-3 (for utility/debuffs), can have 4-5 per raid. Early on they do bad damage (honestly its very low, to the point where a few hybrids trying can beat you, hunters beat you). GREAT scaling so by Naxx You are 3 or 4th dps (largely tied with Rogues on Alliance and just a bit under them on Horde.)  You have to farm soulshards and have a bag of them (less inventory and bothersome.)
---
PvP - Very solid. Kinda like a better shadow priest who doesn't have as much mana issues. You know how tanks have pocket healers? You just found the next most likely class to pocket heal. Their CC , horrify, dots, tankiness, and endless mana (as long as you have life) make them VERY strong in premades or with pocket healers. Less upfront killing like warriors, but far more solo ability and outlast (protection for healers also). 
---
Well that is my take on them.
---
just continuing a perfect game.
---
I left my job so everyday.
---
&gt;wish 
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha fuck man rip the dudes who gotta listen to that
---
Ret was insane for farming in bt though
---
1) Yes  
---
2) Honestly, no. TBC was fine but id rather not follow the path that takes us back to retail.  
---
3) Yes! I would very much like to see new content in an alternate timeline. I think there is so much that could be explored with this and it will give classic its own really strong USP.  
---
4) Yes. But as long as they are done anew and arent just copied from live. Would really love to see some alternate storylines in these places.  
---
5) Yes. I think its important that power gains are incrimental and that large pools of content remain relevant. This is one of the reasons classic feels so much different.  
---
6) My ideas? Well im glad you asked haha. So below i have detailed some of my ideas about classic+ content and how i think progression could be handled to preserve the feeling that classic has:  
---
\- Have older raids' gear decay in power over time effectively shuffling the raids along each time a new one is released. This will leave a large pool of "entry" raids with the newest still being the ones to chase.
---
\-  Maintain consistent power level but have new raids provide alternative gear with new or different aspects to make them worth getting (new stats, procs, sets, etc.).
---
\- Use smaller level increases (1 or 2) tied to specific updates to move players along slowly. This way there would be no massive 10 level grind that leaves everyone behind like with expansions and older raids would still drop relevant gear. You could even gate the levels behind specific achievements (the word, not the modern WoW feature) like completeing a new quest zone or intro dungeon.
---
\-  Allow power creep. Design the power creep to be such that only the last  X raids are really relevant for cutting edge players creating a  "rotation" of raids. And with the raids falling out of "rotation" make  them no longer required for fresh 60's by releasing dungeons or new  quest zones to aquire intro level gear.  
---
Out of the above solutions i would love a combination of the last two. Keep like 4-5 raids in a "rotation" (similar to card game formats) and when you want to move forward release a small story update with some questing and a new zone that gives you like 1 or 2 more levels. Then you will leave older content behind slowly but will always have a large pool of relevant content. I think there is a perfect balance between live and classic and its not unobtainable. The design issues with itemization and content progression arent impossible. WoW classic *can* create new content that doesnt break the classic experience and i hope people can be open to that.
---
u mean the zero-fun Challenge ?
---
They can recreate the game as it was. They cannit recreate the ignorance of the playerbase. It will be easier simply due to the huge amount of info now on how to play the game.
---
One year of paying for classic is 170$ so assuming Blizzard sees that there is a large enough group that play Classic exclusively there would be a financial incentive for them.
---
Oh. Looks like I need to brush up on my TBC knowledge.
---
Have you seen the female orc dance? Yeah, that. Someone twerking on your corpse is infuriating.
---
It would make perfectly sense to put the stronger mobs outside to protect the weaker ones inside the dungeon
---
I don't want new itemization or talent/ability changes that cause power creep. The only new acceptable changed are the ones that affect classes that see zero play at top-end raiding, and the changes can't be powerful enough to make them suddenly useful for top-end raiding.
---
For instance, I am fine with protection paladins gaining an item that gives them some defensive stats and + 10mp5, I am not okay with warriors getting an item that has 1 more strength than the current BiS for that lvl.
---
I want new music.
---
I want updated art assets, not to change the style of classic, but to make it less 2004 and more 2020. It shouldn't break my immersion to zoom in on something.
---
I don't want to add quests that cause lvling to be easier. If a quest is added, it can't have an item reward that matters (no whirlwind axes), and it can't give so much xp that it is automatically included into any speedrun route that lvls by questing. 
---
Possible locations where new quests can (carefully) be added without causing lvling power creep: eastern Azshara, southern silverpine forest, western hillsbrad (for alliance), Tyr's hand (behind several elites), Far east in wetlands (behind the elite red dragons), and so on.
---
Fishing quests that award experience like the ones in Auberdine can be added everywhere. They are never worth taking for the xp, but they are a nice way to motivate people to skill the profession.
---
The economy in classic wow is a bit broken, inflation is a fact, and certain spots and methods of acquiring hard currrency (gold) exist that cause inflation in the economy. Once classic has been out for a while, I think blizzard should make changes that benefit the health of the economy.
---
In a similar manner, materials that are being botted, such as oily blackmouth by fishbots, would benefit from changes that motivate players to acquire them and make it difficult for bots to do the same.
---
The wintersaber trainer grind for alliance is fine, but I don't see why the horde equivalent can't be added.
---
If you play warrior you will probably need a mage alt to farm gold.
---
Damn. It must be snail speed then unskilled. I probably always had it skilled since that was the first thing i skilled afzer grtting cat form and i believe you dont get stealth at 20. Does sprint work tho? Cause i could swear it doesnt but again i might be wrong
---
You’re dumb op are you 12?
---
We absolutely do not plan on being a "show up to raid" guild. There's enough of that on retail. We want there to be a strong social aspect, where people enjoy doing stuff together, be it questing, exploring, dungeons etc. We would much rather accept a friendly and casual person than a hardcore raider who's a dick to others - and we have quite a large amount of socials in our guild as well (people who joined with no intention of participating in progression raiding). So yes, we absolutely plan on doing stuff together as a guild!
---
Yeah i never got to play vanilla paladin horde had none
---
That's a good tip. I'm using a logitech g700s mouse, so mouse wise I'm set:)
---
This is absolutely amazing
---
slap a antlion modmic on your headphone and you got yourself a nice headset.
---
The arena gear destroys pve progression for People that joins later/plats slower.
---
Tbc as it is in 2.4 is a lot worse as a "museum piece" than Vanilla.
---
You will look dope with 2 pets.
---
Thoughts? You're looking for attention. Anyone can do this with a simple mosaic programme
---
 Seriously this reddit is full if attention seeking lonely nerds.
---
Well we are talking ret pallys
---
Haha true!
---
Which then broke hunters completely in pve lol
---
Isn’t is simple like that: you get items 4str and other 6(5)agi - u take agi. And if items with 6str over 4agi - u take str? Not something like that?
---
Rested experience will still accumulate, just slower.
---
In honorable warrior's mind - yes. Remember Indiana Jones scene with duel on the market square?
---
The 30’s are the best. BFD to end the 20’s, RFK, RFD, Scarlet Monastery wings. 30-42ish is my favorite. Everything after that sucks major dick
---
Best value is probably that AT2020, but I'd rather get a mod mic and just strap it on your headset
---
Honstly its all about your mindset. If your fun is only playing at max level which is the case with most people then yeah only 60 will be fun for you.
---
As a warrior I seriously enjoy my journey from 15 to 60. Everything about it is fun for me, the struggle and overcoming it, obtaining new gear and instantly feeling the difference, being noticed by other group members for your tanking skills even at low level dungeons and using the limited tools you have well.
---
Lets just say I find my fun in the whole process which makes me really happy as I feel like this is how everyone should be enjoying their jornuey to level 60 no matter the class.
---
So act on what you say and go do
---
It's not like we have a real choice to prioritize one over the other, unless you exclusively use greens with either +str or +agi.
---
Yes, pets are great tanks and you can heal pet. If you get aggro, just feign death. You can also use yourself as a tank while healing pet and then feign death when you are low.  That is also 2 frost traps you can place. 
---
In pvp, 2 hunters can beat any match up through kiting on opposite sides and having pets attack.
---
Druid + hunter just slows the overall dps you will be dealing vs 2 hunters.
---
How is entrapment better if u can spam rank1 wing clip?

I stand by what I said that sword guy was stupid af

**We Do Not Sow**
---
**Horde EU PvE/PvP Guild**
---
**Introduction**
---
We have been an established raiding guild on multiple private servers under the names of Argonauts, Imperium and We Do Not Sow. 
---
Throughout our time spent on private servers the guild has progressed through most of the content Classic has to offer such as 10/10 Molten Core, 8/8 Black Wing Liar, Full Zul’Gurub &amp; AQ20 split into 2 raids of our core groups which we race each other to keep a fun aspect going. We have successfully downed all of AQ40 minus C’Thun and the easier bosses of Naxx. We also had our place in the world boss coalition and expect you to understand the processes that go into these type of boss kills. 
---
We plan on finishing the content this time around now we have a stable server that we can devote our time and effort into without the the risk of the server dying. 
---
AQ40 - https://youtu.be/g-84vwiZXgw

BWL - https://youtu.be/uY4Ia55DWiE
---
**FAQ**
---
Realm: Will be announced in discord when character creation can be made.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Timezone: GMT+1
---
Language: English
---
Guild Type: Semi-hardcore raiding, social and PvP.
---
**Our Expectations**
---
We would like our members to have experience from classic private servers although that isn’t going to deny you a place in the guild if you lack this. 
---
Having a solid understanding of the meta of classic and the ability to learn and adapt in a quick manner from your raiding experience in other expansions will also be wanted in this guild.
---
Being able to level to 60 within the first 3 weeks is a generous expectation and getting your pre raid bis for phase 1 within the next week so we can start our raid progress the beginning of the second month. 
---
We also expect our members to be nice friendly people who are willing to listen to our guilds management so we can have an enjoyable experience together. We as a guild want to be able to clear content without drama and want you to be able to trust our knowledge of the game. 
---
Reputation is a vital part of Classic and we want our members to be proud of the guild name they represent so we expect everybody outside of guild content to act like mature adults.
---
**Vision**
---
 - Clear all content with a group of people we can call friends.
---
- Be well known and respected on our server.
---
- Be apart of the world boss coalition or even run it ourselves.
---
- Have a guild that has vast knowledge of the game that can help others.
---
**Loot Rules**
---
The loot rules for this guild are straightforward &amp; easy to understand. Core Raiders always have priority over Trial Raiders which always have priority over Socials. Loot can be passed down if allowed by the Class Leader and/or GM, any disagreement will be discussed &amp; voted upon. Those of General, Officer &amp; Deputy rank are treated as if they are Core Raiders.
---
The player with the best piece of Pre-Raid BiS in the slot that the item has dropped for will receive the item. If all of the players have raid items then the piece of gear will go to where it will add the most Healing/DPS to the raid. If all of the Core Raiders in the raid do not need the piece that drops then the exact same system will apply except to the Trial Raiders and if none of them need it, then the same rules apply for the Socials in the guild.
---
This works on a loot council base with the players themselves getting a higher priority based on their current set of gear. This has worked extremely well in the past and can be explained in more detail if needed.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
We will raid either a Tuesday or a Thursday (8pm UK time) 
---
Sunday’s (8pm UK time) 
---

---
In general or with Priest? Because I’m about to pick Troll for just about anything.
---
Haha seems legit :)
---
How is Thunderfuries mat cost much lower? Sulfuras is 50 arcanite bars, Thunderfury is 100.
---
Yes, there's also the sulfuron ingot, but those are hard to assess in value, as they pretty much are never traded openly.
---
Same
---
Although I do understand that I disagree. Attunements from previous raids are doable easily if, unlike TBC, older raids hold value. You go there anyways. That's how it is meant to be.
---
That question was answered, but I'll repeat it here. You return mana or provide massive top-off-healing to the whole raid, and allow the guild to bring another Dwarf Priest instead of another Holy Paladin.
---
The Judgement of Wisdom allows mages to go longer with less down-time, so they don't have to stop to Evocation mid fight on long fights, and allows chain pulling. You're basically a mana battery for the whole raid.
---
Holy paladins, especially in progression, can't get their judgement mana back. And judging it every 30 (or 40) seconds requires them to move into melee range and puts them in the danger area of melee DPS.
---
Sorry to disappoint you esraphel91, but I'm 10 years older than you.
---
Now can you add anything constructive to the discussion or just came here do say I'm dumb?
---
You better leave KT's cat alone
---
I wasn’t entirely convinced either, until yesterday when someone posted a guide of how to make money from skinning/other professions, and it had the leather vendor prices in a format that was pretty easy to read. [Scroll down ](https://wow.classicraids.com/how-make-gold-with-gathering-profession) for the prices - but have a read of this.
---
You just described every professional sport. They are very simple activities in its core.
---
Everyone can hit or throw a ball, to become "skilled" you better train that for hours every day.
---
Patience, determination etc. is the hardest part about it.
---
dont forget trap and scatter shot sharing same DR
---
Fifine k667 is what I have personally. Spent a couple hours looking into the best value budget mic. Everyone in discord says it's great. 40$ USD.
---
I will go farm Maraudon instead
---
feign death best spell ever, along with viper sting
---
Myself and 3 other guildies used to sell these Baron runs. 100g a run, 25 for each of us. You'd be surprised how many people actually really wanted to get their tier .5 set done.
---
We also sold the UBRS boss. I can't remember exactly how much, I wana say 400 but I cant be sure. Only did him 2 or 3 times though.
---
Same! Was there on Day 1, early in TBC.
---
What is in his hands though? A chicken in his left hand perhaps?
---
Reddit should make it impossible for u/supligeN1 to post on classicwow since his the stupidity of his posting history hurts my brain too much.
---
I'm considering him because he is very different than anything I've ever played. I don't enjoy the idea of kiting, but I stay open minded and I'd be happy if anyone could convince me. It seems to be a lot of trouble to run turn shoot turn run turn shoot etc. Why would this be pleasant?
---
Its my humble dream honestly. Little QoLs like auto dissmount, bigger banks, guild banks, right click triggering range attack for hunters instead of just auto attack, better postal etc are minor and i believe we will see some in classic. Bigger QoLs like tbc classes and pvp mechanics (like cc timers set on 8/4/2/imunne) are hard to do. It would require completely rework of raids and item stats. If done correctly and it would be supported with updated graphic, it could create mmorpg game of this century
---
But for a gun you won't replace till naxx for the stats is the precisely calibrated boomstick that's got agility for days.
---
The world difficulty definitely is as I remember it. Unlike current WoW, the enemies pose a threat to you and you can quickly get in trouble if you pull an add or a patrolling mob finds you low on health.
---
Dungeons are tougher to evaluate as there is a huge difference between a group of skilled players on Discord and a PuG.
---
how about showing me one of those videos then lol
---
That would result in 100% more female gnomes, are you sure you want that?
---
From a psychological point of view asking a question "why would I not ...?" puts you and everyone you've asked into a very limited frame of how an answer to that could look like.
---
Better questions to ask would have been: "What advantages does this have?", "How can I enjoy doing this?", "What is it that makes playing a mage exciting to others?"
---
I'm convinced that this would have given you way more useful feedback while also preventing to trigger people's defensiveness.
---
So many druids
---
well, i´m (shame on me) playing bfa and some of the boss mechanics and stuff are rly fun.
---
Just take these skills and knowledge and build something new on the platform of vanilla.
---
without lfg/lfr tools, no different difficulties, say no to the mentality that every class can nearly fullfill any role, say no to itemlevel as the only scale for itemization
---
Imagine retail had only mythic as difficulty for raids. No one except some hardcore well prepared guys would clear the instance within a week.
---
Imagine preparing with tons of consumables and world buffs for a raid night.
---
Keep it classic. keep it home.
---
....home..
---
I use a  Kingstom HyperX Claud Stinger for just under 50€ and my friends say my voice sounds really good at discord with it, would buy it again. And its rly comfortable to wear over many hours :)
---
in Cloth of all things
---
Can’t believe I haven’t seen this posted here yet! This track really takes me back to the good ol’ days startin’ our life in the valley of trials.
---
I'm interested. Please throw those links my way:)
---
Why would hunters not get tier before other classes?
---
So including pservers, a mage who hold the fastest 60 leveling time was talking about the leeway changes and said they may go fire off the bat and switch to frost in the 30s. As shatter is just so strong. 
---
Could you level fire sure, is it better probably not (but people always do it, its mostly a questing ST spec but its really good at it.) Arcane is also an option. So are x/arcane builds for leveling. Without aoe farming i bet playing mage like a priest early is close to the the fastest leveling way if questing. Front load damage, channel arcane missiles wand to finish off. 
---
https://youtu.be/Wi-7oKvOM4c?t=1409
---
I don't mind an arcane spec even past 30. (But you are going to want to pair it with frost or fire). 
---
Its just hard to beat frost solo. Once in a group fire is very nice.
---
It would be shit. LMAO if u think retail is great ur gonna hate classic.
---
When in doubt alway go for female they are more "bouncy".
---
tell caius i said hi
---
if the book is not in the game then yes, you must drop engineering and re-level it all the way back up if you want to switch.
---
if the book is in the game then you simply pay the fee (150g) and it will change your specialisation to Goblin or Gnomish(whichever you do not currently have).
---
Well... When a mage is Standing still you will also run through him in order to cancel his casts. 
---
So Mages should be allowed to kite and run :P Everyone uses their strength's and abilites to their best. 
---
~~As Long as you don't use a health potion in a honorable fight we are all good :)~~
---
Male play male, female play female
---
Male - for bearded muscle guy sex fantasies.
---
Aura and MotW do not stack. And I would guess the LBRS buff and Aura don't stack either, but it's such a  pain in the ass to get I don't think it matters much. I certainly have never been to a raid where people bother with it.
---
One thing that works is the Juju Ember for an additional +15 FR, but that's about it I think.

Damn I didn’t think about the bounce factor
---
20 hours a week yet won’t be able to play with a guild? Whaaat? I really don’t understand this. Just choose a server that works with your schedule. IMO the only way to experience Vanilla is to play with a guild.
---
Bad wording, my bad.
---
Because while "You can't touch me" is playing in your hand you're dismembering your oppenent. Never even had a chance.
---
What the actual fun is that comment xD
---
Literally at School, boring math lessons, on his phone on reddit...

Get learning to make it to 6th grade!

OP you have a very valid question don't let him tell you you are dumb just because you Play warrior :P
---
I never said retail is great.
---
I only said that the blizz devs have abilitys designing some interessting boss fights which could be used creating more difficult and new content for vanilla.
---
I love classic and I loved it 15 years ago.
---
No good. I see bloodlust twice

I assume you're talking about pvp, I'm not a pvp'er, but mage is my favorite dps class, powerful ranged attacks that freeze or burn enemies, polymorph/frost nova for cc and utility, strong air damage, powerful at both pvp and pve.  I'm a tank main, but when it comes to dps mage will always be my go to class, plus ice and fire magic is just cool.

I will get a lvl 60 Epic Kodo for my UD... it just look to badass, did this at vanilla too and i love it :D
---
All I can say that I had a blast playing a mage on a private Server for a couple of month's at 60. 
---
I mostly did PVP which probably is the reason for that. Since Frost Mage is pretty boring in PVE.... But hell of a lot of fun in PVP :)
---
1.) Yes!  
---
2.) I am biased towards TBC - it was the best expac WoW ever had and brought so many quality of life improvements to the game without making the game too casual and easy.  
---
Tho maybe a slightly different approach, making more relevant content happen in the old world and make us spend more time there instead of just afking in shat would be awesome.   
---
Separate realms would be super ok
---
3.) why not, could be fun! But pls gimme sl/sl lock back
---
4.) oh pls yes, so much yes
---
5.) Lets go TBC but make the old world relevant and the story more consistent, change the fate of Kael, make us reason with Illidan, we can use the TBC as a starting point for completely new story development and new way of designing the game
---
apart from t2.5 which is understandable to gear out the other classes first, i dont see why a guild would not get their hunters some shot at t3
---
Yep, have to raid frost off the bat really. 
---
Lock and hunter are funny as they are almost a mirror image. opposites. Where they are similar is leveling ease/speed and pets. Where they are different is everywhere else :P.
---
Would you rather have a power spike early in raiding or later? (Hunters favored early) 
---
Would you rather be good 1v1 and require a lot of mobility kiting in pvp (hunter), or use CC and tankiness (lock)?
---
Would you rather a more important job in raids (Hunter, kiting is a thing if you are good at you can help a ton, traq shots too), or just curse, dot, or shadowbolt? 
---
Would you rather have higher ganking power (hunter) or higher ability to handle being ganked (lock)?
---
Thanks, Fouad.
---
Have played since 2005, quit after BC, rejoined in wotlk, played off and on till legion
---
I think everyone’s first mount will be a little trickier because the whole server will be broke, an established realm has a going economy and can afford to buy herbs and whatnot, but at first we’ll all be broke and can’t afford crap.
---
But your advice is still solid
---
Ah, forgot to mention that this is for 99% PVE heal/totembitch instance/raid usage.
---
Was definitely around for it, don't think I was arsed to actually send a pic in then. Several of my friends from around that time are in there though.
---
Then i’ll oneshot all of them reckbomb style
---
Adding link for lazy because of how great the site is:

https://sixtyupgrades.com/
---
Yeah I'm sure blizzard has a ton of faith in classic and I also think they don't want it to take attention away from BFA
---
?? Druids are the 2nd fastest levelers lol
---
Nice, enjoy man. I'm 26, no kid yet and a salary @60k, renting a small apartment. I hope i will be like you one day.
---
I remember having so much fun leveling an affliction warlock in wotlk. There was something so satisfying about flinging a load of dots onto something and having them crit every so often as they wail about in fear
---
&gt;  if the rogue jumps the hunter when they're at 10% then they win. Are you really dense enough that that's an argument?
---
Where did I ever write that? Are you really dense enough to assume a weak argument so it makes your counter argument easier?
---
A decent hunter stays at 100% HP in contested zone when his pet tanks
---
&gt; As for cooldowns; tell me exactly which cooldowns a hunter has that you'd feasibly use while "out and about"? You don't Scatter, FD or trap when you're just grinding, come on dude.
---
Again, where did I say scatter/fd/trap? Are you really dense enough to assume a weak argument so it makes your counter argument easier?
---
Seriously, start assuming your opponents strongest argument instead of their worst, and you'll have a better time discussing/debating with people in your life.
---
Intimidate/Bestial Wrath/Rapid Fire are two strong CDs that are frequently popped while PVE grinding. A good Rogue will watch a pve hunter to see if he pops any of these, not to mention watch to see when he's low mana / any other opportunity.
---
Again, you are talking theory I am talking practice.
---
In practice, a rogue jumps hunter in the middle of something, or waits for him to use CDs. *Generally a rogue is jumping you at a bad moment*. Seriously you must know this?
---
Your *only* option is trinket out of stun, FD, trap, hope they hit trap and run.  Since the *vast majority* of hunters level BM while levelling you don't get scatter until the end of levelling experience. 
---
You spent all this time talking about scatter defense, without realizing that apart from the duels you watch in beta, *no one takes this while levelling*.
---
And druid is not slippery for a rogue with CDs up. They're forced to use trinket, to which they'd bear shift and bash, and then either try to root or heal. A gank specced rogue with full CD's can resume disables and stunlocks after that and its gg. 
---
Mage is the only one who gives rogue a difficult fight. 
---
Watching YouTube duels don't suddenly make you a pro on vanilla fights my dude

This shows how stupid people are on this reddit. You can literally do this by downloading  a mosaic programme and then do post editing with filters. I can imagine you guys drooling smiling wondering how he made this masterpiece.
---
Mortaugh did two phase 6 bis runs in Naxx and managed to do 1000-1500dps depending on the boss with full world buffs. E.g. 1200 on Patchwerk, 1300 on grobbulus, 1800 on thaddius.

You need to select best overall to see him, because he only has done two runs and doesn't show up on the best 4 out of last 5 category.

"If your tank isn't using consumables"
---
Note I said "assuming your tank isn't bad"
---
Hmm i see. Ty!
---
Mid/end vanilla when I was like 8
---
It makes me cry.
---
Whelp........
---
I wasn't planning to play on retail for too long anyway &gt;.&gt;
---
Thinking about this, it's kinda weird that there apparently was no lag-compensation tool like melee leeway for relative positioning in the original server scripting, right? Because the client certainly has a grace window, else it wouldn't work on private servers when using the original 1.12 client.
---
I cant play during set times. So i cant raid on a schedule
---
The real difficulty is coordinating 40 people.
---
This is interesting. Many people seem to be quite hyped about modmic 5. Would you please elaborate why you would rather have a AT2020?
---
Haha, this is awesome. Thank you for sharing that!
---
Yea, I’m fine wasting my time with you.
---
Thank you for the suggestion. The thing is I already got a headset which cost a few hundred bucks. I'd rather just buy a separate mic this time.
---
Got to Best Buy and get a snowball for 40 bucks
---
so paladin it is
---
I agree, screw these gay troll mohawks.... This shit is gross.
---
Me too, there's literally dozens of us!
---
It gives 1 and +1 for the crit equivalent yes.
---
Idk all I know is that mages will be laughing when they hit level 60 and they’re watching the honorable warrior still have to eat after every pull as a lvl 50
---
So in your mind it’s “I got big sword I hit thing, mage do blasts out of hand but walk backwards he coward”
---
i think kicking a sheep is just a bad example and you are beeing downvoted for some reason.
---
a better example would be gougeing a blink. when you try to go for it your playstyle changes completely. you match your spending of energy to the gcd of your enemy and predict the blink. you do that by using abilitys that are commonly blinked early on gcd of the mage, position yourself infront of the mage during the gcd and then gouge. also youll push back your reset-saps back &gt;15seconds for the dr.
---
and before anyone says its more luck than skill; have you ever dueled a mage for more than 1-2 times? its incredible how accurate your gut feeling gets once you start to get to know your opponent. youll start to know when he likes to nova so you can try to bait the range, youll know when he tries to reset and you know what he likes to blink and youll know when he likes to blink what.
---
im sorry, but people who dont understand that clearly never really tried to get good at the game.
---
I bought a microphone preamp(pre73jr by golden age) to add character to my recordings of music. So I just needed to get a cheap condenser (I got the berringher 30 dollar one) and I spluged on the rode mic arm, which was worth.
---
If you use a condenser, please please please use push to talk. Noone wants to hear every noise in your house.
---
I had a friend used to run Druid tank as a bear. Was pretty effective
---
Druid are stronger tanks in 5-man dungeons than warriors in tank gear
---
You can't know that until it's done. We now have decades of experience to draw on, to understand what works and what doesn't
---
Two full days with no sleep? Are you guys trying to get an extra level on the rest of us?
---
# Arcanite Reaper Hoooooo!
---
Yup, that's my expectation as well.
---
Ah okay! Then i misread ur post, would do the same but i have no knowledge of standalone mics to give u any advice in this regard, sorry :D
---
If you're gonna disallow Warriors, Druids, Paladins and Shamans from rolling on DPS gear if they choose to heal or tank for a dungeon, good luck finding tanks and healers for your groups. Sure, you could make rules before you go in, but chance are that they will either ditch your group or roll on it any way.
---
I see that and raise you a poop bucket... https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3w53ui
---
We clean'd AQ40 in vanilla with a ret pal, a spriest and a feral tank. The ret didn't wore nightfall.   
---
Sure i think going to naxx would have required more min-max, but for 80% guilds, there's a spot for meme spec, as long as people are willing to go the extra mile.
---
If you think people are gonna let you take a 1500g recipe just because of your profession then you’re going to be disappointed
---
So it was a 500 IQ play, just not the expected one.
---
You're right
---
&gt;They're probably anticipating 50000 players and will prepare for as many as 250,000.
---
Deja vu anyone?
---
You could just have it implemented and not balance it, just for fun like duels
---
Get a usb mic from a real audio company. It makes a huge difference. I originally gamed with the Samson Q1U mic back in vanilla, and have since upgraded to the Blue Yeti.
---
The Blue Yeti is great, you can adjust the mic amp on the fly until you get it right for your room, it’s easy to mute, and it sounds great. Chances are you’ve already heard the audio quality of the mic as it’s the most common mic used on youtube, podcasters, and streamers. I got mine for a little over $100 as I wanted a specific color, but you can regularly find the silver version for a little under $100.

I 100% expect to see TBC released at some point.  The real question is whether Blizzard will have it be a new server type with the option to transfer characters there, or move the classic servers to TBC, and this decision will most likely be made based on the population classic holds.  It makes sense from a business perspective due to the fact that they have millions of dollars in assests and man hours for TBC already done and making money from them for little investment makes sense, rather than making new content.
---
Personally, I would like to see a slightly different version of 1.13.  Essentially I would like to see TBC released, but change how leveling works for the expansion, by making it similar to how Proffesions work in retail WoW.  Your character would have Outland levels and while in TBC zones, your character would act as a lvl 70, and when you go to a classic zone, your character would instead act as a lvl 60.  Then make the stats from gear rom classic zones only give a percentage of stats when in outlands, and outlands gear give a percentage of stats when in classic zones...  This could be written off in lore many ways, have  it stated that the fel magic inhibits classic equipment, yada yada.  This would allow there to simultaneously 2 different raiding progressions that don't interfere with one another, where classic endgame would still be viable since you could not gear for it with TBC content.
---
There would certainly be a lot more needed to make this work for example old world changes introduced in TBC and how to handle that, and obviously I would have missed a lot of issues with this system, but I trust Blizzard with classic, and ai think they could figure it out.  This way they wouldn't kill classic content, but would instead have servers that would be able to show a history of WoW in general simultaneously.
---
Maybe Layering could even be used here, where instead of each layer being a different classic world on the server,  each layer could be a separate expansion, and the player could toggle what expansion to play in.
---
That's irrelevant, you're saying it ain't all that and anyone can do it. Well then do better bro. Why even say something when you won't back it up.
---
thanks

---
- step 4: profit
---
you should, with pops at the normal size fishing will be boss
---
Really? Every guild? You checked them all? Even the ones I've played in that didn't? Amazing
---
TRUE!  
---
Sitting at work and just browsing reddit/youtube on and on most of the day about what to play. Good thing it's summer, and that most people are on vacation.
---
When I finally think i've decided, then I spend the time on planning what to do and what gear to get. Just to watch a cool video og remember something nostalgic from my original vanilla time, to then decide on another class .. /facepalm.
---
Generally Main Spec &gt; Off Spec. If you came as your off-spec, be sure to ask up front if it's alright to role for your main spec. (or vice-versa). Tanks and healers usually get a bit of leeway in that regard since the run typically won't happen without them biting the bullet and doing something few people want to do, if there's conflicts, it's usually best to haggle those out before the run starts.
---
A lot of pugs, if they want smooth runs (especially pre-raid prep pugs) will usually just ask what gear people want up front, make a list and then have them roll off for it upfront, then award it via master-looter if it drops. That way if there's any conflicts that people can't agree with, you haven't wasted hours of your time to have them leave mid-dungeon.
---
Generally most groups don't care as long as everything is agreed on before hand.
---
It's the only system that's fair, and therefore the only one that makes sense in every situation.
---
Guild run in \*\*UBRS\*\*.
---
It had taken a good long while, it was getting late, and lots of mobs had respawned behind us.
---
Right before Drakkisath, our tank had to leave, but we found another from the guild. While he was on the way, our warlock... fell off the bridge... So we were down a tank and a warlock. I was a hunter, and suggested that my pet tank Drakkisath, because why not? Better than giving up and HS'ing.
---
Luckily our guild had just started MC, and I had brought my raid-pet with lots of fire resistance. It actually worked. That's when i named my pet "Dragonsbane."
---
The scarlet 2i2 works as a preamp as far as I know.
---
No worries man:)
---
Imp. Inner Fire grants you roughly 3.5% more physical damage reduction. For 3 talent points that's not a bad deal but weigh it against the fact that it's an optional cluster that you don't need to progress to your 31 point end talent and buffs getting dispelled a lot.
---
Which crit talent are you referring to?
---
AT2020 USB+ is what ya need. I've seen it as low as $70, and it's quality is stellar.
---
They need to do another one of these for Classic launch.
---
There's no loot lag in retail.
---
Druids can offtank every single raid encounter including the back line of four horsemen in naxx, not the front though with morgraine‘s damage output. 
---
They are actually better maintanks than warriors in most of MC, especially for horde. (Warriors are very gear dependent and druids can put out A LOT more threat). 
---
So yes they are viable, extremely good in early game and an okay offtank for mid/late-game. You‘ll just have to adapt a lot and perfect your gameplay.
---
You‘ll definetly have to learn to time your potions in between auto-attacks of the boss without fucking up or deplete 100 rage for nothing and micromanage A LOT. But nonetheless very much possible with the right dedication.
---
Was that changed? I remember that at some point in the beta mouseover macros did not reset your CPs
---
Getting stuck in combat never felt so great
---
Hunters are easy to play but hard to master. They can level faster than any other class and are one of the best options for solo leveling, because of the pet as a tank.
---
The problem in Vanilla was, that many hunters would play group content in their solo playstyle. Pets would taunt mobs from the tank because the player didn't turn off Growl. Or a pet would aggro half of the dungeon because it was too low level or because the hunter jumped down a shortcut and the pet took the long way with a train of mobs behind it. Or damage was low because they never learned to weave abilities in between auto shots. And since hunters were a popular class choice, there were a lot of hunters who couldn't play.
---
Also hunter items overlap with rogue and warrior.  So you ended up carrying a noob hunter through a dungeon just to see him ninja an item you could use for yourself.
---
It's a meme to poke fun at hunters.  Also, 50% of this sub plans on rolling prot warriors, so that's probably part of it.

Ele and resto shaman pick up that 30 yard radius totem, which reaches out pretty damn far, especially in a duel "arena".

i definitely want tbc. the heroic gearing up phase is among my best memories of wow. that said, i'd welcome new vanilla patches too. i think if classic is REALLY successful, they'll do both, if not and they have to choose one, they'd go tbc. if i had to choose, i'd also vote for tbc &gt; classic+. 
---
tbh, i think classic is already finished. it's the core experience of wow, that i'll, probably, be playing forever. anything on top of it is better suited for expansions. tbc has like 10% of the content of classic, but i don't care when i can always go back to classic.
---
They are by far the worst class in 1v1 PvP, or 1vX. Only good when they have healers, so in battlegrounds (and honestly even then only in a premade group, don't expect randoms to ever heal you in PvP, I mained warrior in vanilla and it almost never happened). So yeah, wrecking ball if you are Naxx geared and have friends to give you a hundred buffs and constantly heal you - otherwise a wet noodle.
---
Brokenly op?
---
You must have played on a very private private server
---
Dueling, world pvp (large and small battle), and battlegrounds are all very different.
---
In duels, unless you can remove the SL buff from the pet, warlocks are a pita to deal with. So damn tanky.
---
Good guide if you have infinite gold
---
I love our tranq shot bots
---
Herbalism + Alchemy is definitely a better money maker than Skinning + Leatherworking. But if you're serious about tanking, then you need to drop one of your professions for Enchanting as soon as you hit 60 and grind that out for the armor trinket.
---
I'm going Skin/LW, then dropping Skinning for Enchanting as soon as I hit 60. LW to make my own Cured Rugged Hides (for crafted gear) and Enchanting for the trinket. It will take me forever to get an epic mount like this, but I will get my BiS gear early.
---
This insane focus on mechanical difficulty over time investment is what turned WoW into the monstrosity it is today where only a fraction of the playerbase are skilled enough to clear the mythic raids. 
---
That's not how it's supposed to be. Anybody should be able to clear it but it should require a lot of farming gear from within the instance itself until you're powerful enough to beat the encounters. A raid shouldn't be possible to be beaten within the first month, that just means that it's either too easy or you're handing out way too powerful gear way too fast.
---
How are you this bad at reading? He said it benefits other classes more, I pointed out it ONLY benefits melee classes more. So literally just warrior and rogue, no one else. Rogue in 1.12 is one of the weaker classes for PvP, and Warrior is as always, complete trash without a raid group of support.
---
A warrior is not going to beat your fucking hunter in 1v1 no matter how much leeway they get.
---
2nd and third gear sets
---
I agree, but arena was still a much better ranking system than r14 imo. I think it's important to reward skill over time played in PvP.
---
I would like even the whole path from vanilla to BFA again. Except for Cataclyzm world map changes.
---
You don't queue for dungeons in classic, by the way.  For example, someone leveling as feral can still be the group's healer. They'll want loot for cat or bear form even though they're healing.
---
Dude it's a pirate Server subreddit.... Obviously some pirate already stole it... 
---
You could try looking for it in the Bermuda triangle but you may never return
---
Mine sounded flawless. More crisp and clear than any headset mic I've ever owned.
---
Out of combat too. It basically turns you into a rogue with constant rage ticks.
---
Did you not play vanilla WoW? A warrior isn't getting anywhere even near 8 yards close to a hunter. They'd be lucky to be at 20 yards.
---
Thanks for confirming my choice being always a dwarf. I prefer BGs over Raid Dungeons.
---
Raid Dungeons could be fun for the game lore, but what's the point to run Raid Dungeon endless for only to get more gear and beat your previous time record because you know all the fights? At least, every BGs are different even it's always the same context.
---
Anyway, thanks for your input. :)
---
Wow is something cool with life
---
For anyone curious, this is a screenshot from my vanilla guild c'thun kill in 2006 (not a pserver).
---
Well... I gotta give it to you... It sounds like an honorable fight that you are describing... Pretty much the mages own fault if he is trying to cast in a melee fight..
---
I mean you also don't bring a knife to a gunfight right? :D
---
My experience is that it's unusually A matter of expectations. Being proactive by talking about those types of issues BEFORE the run will take care of 90% of the problems. When you encounter the odd 10%, the up front disagreement saves everyone time.
---
Yes. That's why I said "the begin". But to me was pretty significant deleting the Black Temple Attunement.
---
In that case you must make sure it is a night elf male with a moustache.
---
Ever see a level 52 solo a fresh level 60 warrior?

Hey there Telefondude, yes mining is a common second profession to take with engineering.  
---
Some people, however, end up taking two crafting professions (more advanced) for various reasons.  This guide attempts to show you how to make engineering less of a money sink so that you can pick it up earlier on and actually profit off of it.
---
Bathory - Nordland full album when ever I play a dwarf.
---
This is a great point. We're no longer 14 so we shouldn't act like it and instead should talk
---
When you tell everyone you're resto but press that moonkin form after the boss is dead.
---
He is actually right that Classic has more leeway melee range, but what he does not understand is that it was the exact same in vanilla WoW than in Classic, and warriors sure as fuck lost 99% of the time against hunters.
---
These people are overreacting, when in reality nothing has changed, it's just like in vanilla: a very skilled warrior will need an insane amount of luck or an extremely bad opponent to get anywhere withing hitting distance to a hunter/mage.
---
Just buy gold
---
I already payed my soul playing Path of Exile for the past 7 years.
---
Not concerned at this point.
---
For progression Cthun fights, sometimes druids would go boomkin and priests would go shadow. Its a solution for a raid that's having trouble killing small tentacles and is dying to the slow. Boomkins can hive quick dots and a little burst while shadow priests have their silence.
---

Don't sell right away though - Keep for later patches and when economy has build up

Caring about somebodies mental health is being a dick now? Lol alright then. I've seen people be abused and nobody say anything for years.

You do present a thorny issue and playing a hybrid or dual spec‘ing is not simple. If you want to talk etiquette, and not personal preference, here goes...
---
When you join a group and all five members are present, but before you start the instance, ask the group if it’s ok. Especially if another person playing your class is in the group (or don’t ask in this case). In this specific case, if you didn’t ask, watch the rolls on items that you need for your alternate spec, if the other person playing your class rolls greed then go for it, but be prepared to state your case.
---
Always keep in mind that playing a hybrid, tank/healer/dps will make it easier for you to get into instance groups which is a huge advantage over someone going straight dps. The dps players won’t appreciate you needing on items they can use right then. Those items might be the only reason they came in the first place.
---
Sleep....
---
During my time in vanilla my guild never ever used any consumables except some cheap ones if people wanted to. We got up to the four horsemen and was stopped by lack of tanks and nothing else.
---
I don't know what weird fucking shit you are up to on those servers masquerading as vanilla but I can tell you that it's completely unnecessary.
---
Gear and enchants are more than enough to beat the entire game with ease.
---
Yeah and many don't?
---
Short for alliance, nothing more i think
---
If u mean world pvp to gank ppl off the mount and camp their corpses then yes, on the other hand, to do anything in the world like quests/farm mobs/mining etc, requirred to dismount (druid can gather herb in flight form but thats it) and stand on the ground, which means you can be attacked.
---
So if you ment the world pvp by attacking the opposite faction to scare them off of your items/npcs, then flyin mount did not really affect that. The only thing you could not do to gank ppl when they tried to reach a point and was in midair, like goin to a dungeon, but guess what thats a good thing :D. Atleast for me i did not enjoy these type of ganks, also if u want to do it like in blackrock mountain then you could, i mean there were some dungeons where the entrance could not be reached by mounts (coilfang for example).
---
If you ask me, with epic flying you could easier locate targets to kill in world pvp than in classic. But it was much harder to corpse camp as it was easier to run away. Idk is it really a bad thing that you dont want to waste your time for a bunch of idiots who wants to corpse camp you? :D
---
What Server and guild was this?

take a long nap I guess
---
They are literally remaking the original game. Not remaking + redesigning and updating. The only changes they are making are unavoidable. I’m fine with that. 
---
I don’t hate change, I just liked the original product. If I want to play something else I have retail.
---
get some sleep for the upcoming 72 hours.  
---
i'll assure you, you need it !
---
Can't wait for my collectors pet. I am so shallow I revel in the whispers about how I got it.
---
I WAS THERE YOUNG PADAWAN. I WAS THERE WHEN THERE WAS BLOOD IN THE STREETS AND PEOPLE TOOK LIVES TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THE COLLECTORS EDITION. I WAS THERE WHEN AZEROTH OPENEND ITS DOORS.
---
For managing action bars what you want to do it keep your caster form spells (your heals, faerie fire, root, etc) all on the same hotkey.  You shift out to cast them (except when you get feral FF) anyway in forms. Then for bear and kitty, try to have spells that conceptually do the same thing as much as possible on the same hotkey. 
---
Although warlock is great as well, highly desirable for group content.  Been debating those two choices myself.  Really, anything is going to have an easier time than a rogue, as every warrior secretly wants to live that fury dps dream and doesn't want you rolling on their gear.
---
LIVE TO WIN!
---
Im not sure what you game you're referring to.
---
Getting full tier 2 within the first 6 months of play time is very achievable without no lifing it in any regard. (Say 20-30 hours of playtime per week). 
---
Tier 3 and aq40 is a bit of a different story but you are talking about upper percentile content which not everyone needs to do. If you are that personality that has to be top then yes there will likely be a problem.
---
Don't play a healer, be the chad in the duo.
---
13 for myself. 
---
I had a bit of alt-itis and had got a 42 paladin (first char), 33 rogue, various other level 15-20's, and then finally a 60 shaman. 
---
Still remember trying to convince my parents to put their CC on an online service. $15 a month, are you crazy? My CC is going to get stolen, no way. Oh how times have changed.
---
&gt; I feel I couldnt allow it to be that way, so I chased the top like others.
---
Sounds more like a personal problem.
---
"Imma chargin' *my fireball*!"
---
I got to do very little naxx 40.  I suppose I should have clarified in that I don't dislike the raid per se, but the gear scaling that came with them.  I think we're going to have a much harder time with post-naxx content if they go out in their vanilla form, gear-wise.
---
A buff to dungeon gear, however, is exactly what I don't want.  Dungeons are tuned fairly well at a pre-raid level.  They become stupidly easy once you add raid gear into the mix.  I'd rather keep raids appealing without further trivializing existing content.
---
I played a few characters to mid 20's in vanilla just by grinding mobs as a 7 year old young boy lol (I of course didn't read a word English back then). I had a much greater time in WoTLK where I managed to hit 70 on a belf paladin (being ~11 years old)
---
Ganking the shit outta the enemy faction and farming massive amounts of mats.
---
Mainly because Raids are where the best gear comes from. BGs are going to start feeling reeaaallyyy painful around P3 and especially once Naxx gear is out if you're still rocking dungeon blues and PvP blues.
---
Very few servers have large or stable populations in patch 1.12 so good on you for being needlessly pedantic.
---
Vanilla was definitely way harder than beta (the stress test at least).  It was a self-inflicted difficulty though since I keyboard turned, and clicked abilities.  It was way easier this time with key bindings and not playing like it was my first computer game (it was my first computer game).  I'll never forget losing a duel to my IRL friend at the crossroads.  "Of course I can't hit you if you're hopping around me!  Just stand in front of me and fight!  I'm a warrior!"
---
What's that?
---
Just accept that like in any mmo people will outgrind you and therefore have an advantage over you.  Once you decide to play for fun and not try to compete with the folks who turn a game into a job it gets a lot more fun.  Hell if it really bothers you chose a class that isn't super gear dependant.
---
Definitely you want to make sure they are ok with it up front, or ideally they already have what you want.  Healers are still way more common than tanks so you have the upper hand.  Just be courteous and respectful and I don't think there will be a problem.
---
It's a "personal problem" lots of people have. To the point that when you dont play for 3 days everyone thinks you are gone for ever and that was a really long time. Because they play every day, like you do. And expect you to.
---
I meaaan.... if your guild isn't setting aside certain items for the tanks... you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Any guild that took the time to set up a legit DKP System to monitor and distribute loot is one that's going to prioritize items. Thunderfury goes to the tank, 100%. If you're in a guild that lets any melee roll on it, you're in a guild that won't ever clear BWL. Just the honest truth my man.
---
Hunter Mage or Warlock.
---
Archer with Pet, Tolkien Wizard DnD archtype, or spooky Wizard archtype with a demon pet.
---
I'm likely being downvoted because people having a hard time accepting that having high latency doesn't matter as far as how good you are. By all appearances and by anything that matters, that player is bad. 
---
I was actually correcting the kick misconception, since indeed it was a bad example. The person I was responding to doesn't seem to know what spell batching is.
---
Ah thanks! I missed that bit of info.
---
My advice would be play whatever classes you enjoy. If your buddy wants to roll druid fine...but don't get locked in to a specific class over leveling.
---
They are viable on most fights / trash mobs if you put in the extra effort.
---
It absolutely lends it's self to that you don't have to nolife it to have a good time.
---
I write. I write my story.
---
PvP gear is so underdeveloped then. No wonder why still poeple think the way to enjoy end game is only by raiding. It's kinda suck for those who like BGs/PvP.
---
Lol more like "don't live,  to win".
---
questie shows all the spawn locations for the current quest. the guide just one. if you need more mobs than are there questie will quickly show you where else to look. i think they complement each other nicely.
---
It will cost you approximately one account worth of time and effort.
---
Yeah, but it's not my fault he comes to a battlefield in a dress wielding a stick, then runs away calling rain or snow to fall and aid him, instead of fighting like a man. Prepare, stand your ground and prove your worth in battle :)
---
Are they re-releasing this or are you itching to drop a ton of cash for a 2004 version?
---
Aren’t the classes operating at 1.12 at the start it’s just the content that’s gated? Or did that patch not do enough to make classes more “viable”. Or does no one know because obviously those changes happened after the content
---
Rule4 on gold trading i bet.
---
My guess would be around $10/100g once the servers are a little settled and the farmers are up and running.
---
This thread is getting locked, btw.
---
Lol.
---
"You looking to buy, rich 'mon?"
---
As a warrior - yes :) ME SMASH!
---
It's leveling gear. If you're going to use it, roll on it.
---
MS &gt; OS matters more at max level.
---
it will cost your account.
---
I am seriously considering rolling a druid as an alt and play as DPS or Tank. Bears and Oomkin have some serious merits to them, not even memeing.
---
Raiding is half the game bro. The real game stats in PvP. And raiding is a pre-requisite to that
---
[here](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/000137431)
---
around 30 bucks or so...depending on how aggressive blizzard's anti-botting/gold seller catching/punishing is.
---
Ye that's the thing we both want to play hunter and druid, so we want to make it work, and I think it'll be good! Mainly curious about what is the optimal pet for our strategy as well any other possible tricks we could utilize to enhance our leveling!
---
There's a sticky at the very top of the sub with an active discussion on this exact topic. Go there.
---
I have used a nice add-on called Call Of Elements, which has a useful functionality. For example, in a dungeon or while leveling you always  use a set of totems repeatedly.  With this addon you could define those sets, and bind just one key which will throw the totems in the specified order. 
---
I had to make some modifications to check for buffs, for example if you already have strength of earth totem and your fire totem expired, it won't cast strength of earth again but only the fire one. Anyway I think it was the best thing for avoiding countless binds.
---
do you really need dbm for the 2 abilities bosses have...
---
How can you kill that which has no life?
---
For me anyway, the difference is that I was leveling 1-60 in the same game world as everyone else.  In BC, it felt like I was in a separate game, because no one at 70 was in Azeroth anymore - they were all in Outland.
---
It made you feel isolated, and it made the world feel dead and desolate.  It made playing the game "lonely" until you got to Outland.
---
I...never implied otherwise...?
---
The struggle was my case being held together by scotch tape and the card running so hot i needed a desk fan. Weird how suddenly accounts that never post are all replying with the same comment though 🤔🤔🤔
---
&gt; I don't enjoy the idea of kiting
---
100% don't play mage.
---
60k is still solid, I wasn't intending on seeming like some egotistic shit head, just took his comment a little personal
---
You won’t get any gear until phase 2 and a lot of grinding
---
Disadvantage yes, "ass handed to you" not until late phases AQ/Naxx.
---
Exactly, I agree with this.
---
Thanks for the guide !
---
For some reason, i cannot make a copy of it on my own drive (to save it). Do you happen to know why ?
---
Then again, you could also fight like a *real* man like a monk in later expansions.
---
A monk only uses his fists, has barely any armour and has a hardened mind.
---
A warrior hides behind huge plates of armour, needs a 10feet polearm to outrange his opponents and is generally a whuzz.
---
Disclaimer I play warrior and love my shaman doing the heavy lifting by purging everything helpful off the mage or priest or warlock. &lt;3
---
Yep!  Also let’s be real, the “meta” is tired as hell and doing the same old same old is tired and EASY.  We have YEARS to replay this 15 year old game.  People need to try different things because it’s fun and interesting.  1% of people who played retail actually saw naxx in vanilla. So that means there’s 99% of other guilds that can do it THEIR way.  People have had a lot of time to become better gamers, and I for one can’t WAIT to see people really try, rather than just saying “no you can’t”.  They have the taunt, the HP, they can wear resistance gear, they can attain much higher armor than warriors.  Let’s see what they can do!
---
Well T2.5 sucks for hunters anyways, but yeah true
---
Mirah's song is on my list for tanking.
---
Premade groups are what's making a difference
---
There are a lot of medieval and medieval-rock/metal bands in germany. I find they go really well with immersing yourself in this world of adventures. 
---
'Schandmaul', 'Subway to Sally'and 'In Extremo' come to mind...
---
the dude was just sharing an old screenshot bro chill.
---
that's kinda the point, people are fed up with he shit show snooze fest  that is "content" for the brain dead "casuals" to consume.
---
People want something more meaningful and if something takes that much effort/time then it becomes meaningful and something people are willing to spend money on instead of quitting.
---
I think that could work quite well. Little side game, and the Org arena might get some use
---
&gt;druids can put out A LOT more threat
---
druid damage is op on private servers, this isn't true on classic
---
Hey man, before you try to make warrior guides you should really do some research. This guide is at best misinformation, a lot of it just seems like your opinion.
---
 The talent recommendations are bad. They are just a little bit off, but that small window of error you jump through proves that you don't fully understand how to maximize a warriors potential and that you aren't qualified to make guides. I'd even be on the fence saying you are qualified to give your friends advice on the class.
---
I understand there's an anti elitist thing going on in this subreddit, but that doesn't justify giving you a pass for claiming to make a guide without doing bare minimum research. I suggest you visit classic warrior discords or subreddits next time before putting out any more guide content.
---
Dont tell warriors to not take anger management, don't tell them to take two hand specialization over parry, don't recommend hamstring kiting without showing how differently kiting works on beta.
---
Your gear recommendations come off as though you Googled a bis list, without strong reasoning for the choices or viable easy to obtain alternatives.
---
There is nothing comprehensive about this.
---
&gt; A few more people will ding 60 in the next couple of days 
---
You think the person who finishes first is going to be days ahead of the next 4 players?
---
He's talking about lvling. Do you really think Mainspec &gt; Offspec (for the dungeon run) is even close to fair while lvling up? The healer or tank might just do those roles so you, as a dps, actually can run the dungeon?
---
Ok man, whatever suits your consciousness.
---
But If I really had any mental health issues I would not want to be treated like this just for venting my opinion of a game in a subreddit about the game.
---
It was funny. However a very incomplete analogy and mostly for marketing purposes.
---
it's 10 seconds or 13 seconds with DR (if ur clevr traps specced). because the trap duration is actually 20 or 26 seconds, the reason it lasts ~15 in pvp is because of heartbeat resists, so a DR'd trap actually doesnt get reduced by 50%, it gets reduced from 15 to 13 sec, it's really not that bad
---
Here’s a summary of the guide. You level up engineering and produce the following which is the sum total of the gold making aspect.
---
9 x [Deadly Blunderbuss]
---
5 x [Lovingly Crafted Boomstick]
---
5 x [Silver-played Shotgun]
---
3 X [Moonsight Rifle]
---
21 x [Aquadynamic Fish Attractor]
---
Some leftover materials
---
My question is what makes these items “goldmakers”? Are there not quest greens that are loosely equivalent and approximate levels? Aside from the lure, of course. 
---
It doesn’t seem like you’ve done much research at all, OP. The comments here are a far better source of goldmaking and when you steal dudes comment to incorporate to your guide do the decent thing and link him for credit.
---
Can you solo them at fresh 60?Just asking
---
Reported
---
Mate, stop and try using ur own brain for just a second. Look at how the classes play in BFA and then compare then to how the classes play in Classic. There is no comparison.  
---
You cannot copy/past content from BFA and put it in Classic. Nor can they use the same style of mechanics because the game plays completely different.  
---
The core engine is not even the same... well classic is running on Legion core so its already a frankenstein version with bad mechanics, broken spell batching, broken classes, 100's of gamebreaking bugs and a layering system that will ruin the economics and pvp on all servers.
---
Classic will be a shit version of Vanilla wow do we really want it completely ruined by having blizzard add content.?
---
Uh-oh, complete dealbreaker, just as I thought I might get into this. I used to moonwalk all the time on my trusty rank 14 shaman. Came back to the game a while ago only to realize that this magnificent feature was gone and wondered why. J/k though, ofc its no dealbreaker but I am a bit sad to hear its not here anymore.
---
? I don't know who that is I can guarantee you a majority  of raid leaders in classic don't either. Especially in EU, since I guess it's a streamer and we don't really have that problem here.
---
Cause everyone is already pissed they have no shoes.
---
You ignore list is full
---
Classic's difficulty is logistical, rather than mechanical.
---
The fight themselves are not difficult, nor is grinding to 60.
---
The difficult part comes from dedicating the time and resources to succeed. If you don't have tranq shot or buffs for progression, you ain't winning. 
---
The hard part of any raid or dungeon is getting the correct people and the correct number of people to do their role. Not the actual combat per say.
---
This also is what makes classic interesting to the hardcore but still extremely approachable for new players. New players don't necessarily need to know the exact numbers or nuances of every fight. They just need to do their one role. Its the hardcore players that can then min max and go the extra mile by doing so to really mastet the game.
---
So yeah. BFA is an action game with boss mechanics, vanilla/classic is a proper mmo with logistical challenges.
---
actually hilarious how highly upvoted this is
---
Besides the top thread devolving into talking about duels, this post has been very wholesome and good advice imo. Play the class you think you would have the most fun with, and just enjoy sharing a game to play with your boyfriend. Making this post is already going above and beyond bc it shows you really care. Anyways don't stand in the fire and Lok'tar Ogar bitch.
---
I'm just saying, I wanted that too, luckily I didnt pay for it.  
---
The irony is you realise how meaningless it all is after. Unless you make some kinda internet career with gaming vids about wow out of it. It's meaningless effort that leaves you with nothing IRL. Perhaps only a better understanding of human psychology, but thats about it.
---
Fair enough. Personally, I hate leveling with or without people around. To me, it's just a means to an end to get to raiding.
---
xD
---
Thanks, boss!
---
Yeah I remember doing a couple of AB matches
---
They were fun! My guild was mostly interested in PVE though so we never paid much attention to PvP though. We had this one guy though who did a lot of pvp by himself and got to rank 13 or 14 on his hunter but other than him nobody really cared much for PvP.
---
Do what you enjoy. If you enjoy pvp then go for it. If you don't then do other things.
---
DOPE! How was this made?
---
i would say they would maybe give it 6 month to a year after all the stages are deployed, then they might be on the way to doing tbc.
---
If they do though, they should do it as an optional upgrade/transfer of the player account and keep classic running.
---
This could net them even more money, as i would expect that people might want to have access to both, and the only real way to do that is to have 2 accounts running (one for classic and one to transfer to tbc)
---
I think the word your looking for is "expect".
---
Main spec &gt; off spec is a max level thing, and even then running level 60 dungeons i feel it still doesnt apply.  
---
main spec &gt; off spec is a raid thing.
---
The sword of 1000 truths of course.
---
Nobody will notice me... until I /dance.
---
lol what, soloing 5 mans as a fresh 60 yeah no.  You’re a pserver guy who thinks it’ll be easy like the fake wrong numbered pservers.
---
As of right now u/Veoj also made a fork of MoveAnything that worked in the beta and will on the next stress test/launch if for whatever reason Reslike’s isn’t updated in time.
---
https://github.com/joev/MoveAnything
---
Why on a pvp server? What's the difference. Fighting Blightcaller also flags you for PVP on a PVE-Server.
---
This is why im completing as many story games i can before august 27th (just finished RDR2), and why im working out now to get fit for playing, why im took vacation in september, why i told my friends i would respond to messages, why i sent my mom to a retirement home, why i told my gf to find another man, why sent my dog loose on the streets (it came back, good dog), already bought and gifted chrismas gifts to my family,
---
I AM SO READY TO PLAY!
---
No worries i was just sharing my experience
---
You can use focus addons on private servers so i figured i add the focus macros just in case
---
Yeah this is really perverse.  I dont understand any of them but good job.  Thumbs up
---
1/29/21 is not a feral spec. Most people with this spec are still going to be healing/decursing in raids, maybe tanking occasionally. The idea behind the spec is to keep all of the necessary talents to be able to do whatever you want outside of raids and be flexible. They would not be in cat or bear form enough to justify lotp.
---
0/31/20 and 1/31/19 are bad specs. Losing the point in NS defeats the entire purpose of the hotw spec and leaves you with a gimped tank/dps spec. If you're tanking, the spec is 11/33/7. If you're dpsing, I believe the ideal spec is 14/31/5 +1. These are the specs where you pick up lotp.
---
If a server is dead they used free server transfers to a more populated servers. I guess this is how they'll manage it or even just merge 2 servers.
---
I would guess that paid character transfers will come (but not racial, class etc changes)
---
Any plans to update Crafty to Classic?
---
And you’re looking for the concept of being wrong
---
37
---
Started in the first year of wow, so yeah I was around and I’m still around playing casually and still loving it. I will not play wow classic. Not the most popular opinion I know. But I love how the story evolves. Every expansion has its ups and downs. But I’m definitely not going back to vanilla.
---
Kek  
---
Bur
---
In 6 months
---
Half that if you can manage a year
---
I got that response on a PS I played on last year. I hope you’re right, because streamers seem to add nothing more than toxicity to the servers they’re on. 
---
I’m an EU player too.
---
It's usually not an issue because the tank is one of the first people in the guild and they show up, so they would earning the dkp they need.  Also, dkp doesn't mean a hunter gets to roll on priest shoulders. 
---
If I'm there week after week, boss after boss, farming consumables all week and our tank leaves and we get a new one, you're damn right I deserve loot first. 
---
Don't forget there are people behind every keyboard. Not everyone wants to sacrifice week after week for the amorphous 'good of the guild' that might change players or even disband, where the leadership gets to make arbitrary decisions on rewards.
---
Only the top guilds should use such a system, and that isn't most guilds. You'd have to care more about the name recognition above your character than getting any rewards, because even a dkp guild is going to clear the content, it will just take slightly longer.

20 hours of gaming is very doable for full time workers like myself i usually get 40-50. I give the low number for people with families and stuff. As low as 10 will get you t2 if you are diligent

This is not a big commitment

Exactly, and I've just given you a handful of truths. Maybe when you collect the other 9000 or so, you'll die to be reborn, with a life.

You can complain all you want but the fact remains that boomkin is worse than any other caster.
---
someone make this app and just have it randomly display a class.  sell it for a $1 and make a tidy little profit.

What the hell are you talking about?
---
1.11 was the patch that introduced Naxx. Nothing prior to the pre-TBC patch (2.0.1) did anything to really overhaul the meme specs, nor did it fix the lack of itemization.
---
However you'll also only be up against MC gear phase 1, so the advantage won't be too much.
---
Your time is coming, get ready!

fax bro. hunters and druids are extremely high ceiling, Currently playing a druid rn on p serv.
---
So no - u dont know or it wont be available?
---
I agree with this, I think paid transfers will come but not in Phase 1 or maybe even Phase 2. A realm will need to be well-established before that happens.
---
Ret

Ugh dude.
---
Thats probably why gold selling is a thing
---
Blizzard likes money.
---
Roll need on what you need. Just say you're gonna do that at the beginning. If they're mad about it, now you know it's not someone to play with again, and if they're cool and cooperative in the dungeon then friend them for more dungeons later.

I find these responses really weird. Especially to something like this.

---
I do?
---
No, but it can be done with third-party programs and there will likely be an add-on.
---
Pally!!
---
Well, considering that you can kill C'thun with 30 or less people ... some of them could have been afk.
---
Yup - wrecking people in Felwood is my first thought - ~10 level difference, and you can farm tubers/breaths while you're there.  If you're an herbalist obviously Winterspring/Plaguelands for dreamfoil/black lotus. 
---
If you're an enchanter maybe try to farm up crusader enchant - being the only person on your faction with the ability to do crusader could be a huge money maker for a while.
---
Shamans, all day. Chain heal spam and delicious totems.
---
The thing is that its a slippery slope. If you allow players that intentionally cripple themselves into raids, where do you draw the line?
---
If retripaladins are fine, are melee hunters fine? are warlock tanks fine? are unarmed warriors fine? are melee mages fine?
---
All of these speccs are examples of players intentionally crippling themselves in order to have fun with their class. But if you make a raid consisting of them, I'd be surprised if you got past the first boss in MC.
---
What is it that makes your way of crippling the raid more legit than anyone elses? What is it that makes retribution paladins entitled to getting carried through content they refuse to play their class properly for when melee mages aren't? The difference in dps is just a few hundred afterall.
---
I've been leveling on a pserver alone and with my shaman friend and honestly I'm moving slower and am getting less mats leveling with my friend but we're having fun so that's all that truly matters.

I was 16 I feel you on the whole responsibility thing. Enjoy your time off I know I will.
---
You still use the stealth animation, just faster.
---
I think it's not unfair to say any spec any class can beat any spec any class depending on the circumstances. PvP is not just duels and even in a duel, there's a lot that can happen. What a warlock could do is wait till the rogue has got the void to low health and then just sac it. Warlocks can still issue commands to their pets while they are not in control of their character, so you can sac the void any time. Sap can also brake fairly early in PvP, and voids have decent health / armor.
---
I've thought of doing a no pet warlock or hunter challenge for if I feel adventurous.
---
Literally no, if people think you're gone forever if you log out 3 days in a row, that's a private server elitist attitude.  Nobody I know on retail thinks like that.
---
are you sure? Those werent in Vanilla were they?
---
Well, I mean.. never seen that one video series?
---
In vanilla base values are a lot more impactful. This'll be less true as time goes on because of better itemization releases, but yeah. Rogues scale extremely well with items but they have powerful base values as well. And the 1v1 control ofc.
---
Blue snowball is cheap and has the best quality for how much you pay. I’ve been using it for years and no complaints.
---
This isn’t r/wowservers. This is r/classicwow not everyone here has played on a pserver.
---
Don't be naive, this isn't retail. There's no official alternative to dissuade people from buying gold from third parties. You really think they want a guy saying "hey guys I just bought gold, Blizzard caught me and didn't ban me"? You think they want other companies profiting off their game?
---
there’s also nothing bad about doing it on a private server. But everyone has to weave a story.
---
Ummm no? I think they are even more retarded than those doing it on Classic. cuz atleast classic is fun?
---
I'm really starting to get fed up with these arrogant private server raiders coming here trying to tell us what to expect or how to act.
---
I'm sure they've done a deeper dive than that.  If they haven't, they haven't properly done their homework (again!).  
---
Private community is one area, sure.  250K for that is potentially accurate.  
---
New players - I have no idea what to expect with this one, but they do exist.  
---
Current subscribers - this is where I think things can get crazy.  How many of them unsub for content droughts, that won't now because they have something else to play?  How many decide retail isn't fun anymore and come over to the "dark side?"  I don't know what numbers in this group look like either, but again they will exist.  
---
Returning subscribers - how many neckbeards like myself will return to play the original game they loved, yet didn't spend much (if any) time on the private server scene?  
---
I think that the requirement of subscription to get into beta, or the Blizzcon ticket to get access to the demo, while ultimately cashgrabs, also gave them important marketing information.  I think they'll get a ton of data once we're able to reserve characters/names as well.  
---
Ultimately, my bet is on 1 million net subs they get from Classic - a success by any measure.
---
Server transfers came in classic with stipulation u could not transfer from pve to pvp
---
ToS are the same as in BFA. They are both retail. They won’t ban you.
---
"The community" isn't about to shut your thread down.
---
Right and only adults play wow?
---
I kinda wish naxx wasn't a thing, I feel like with bwl gear is ok, aq40 gear gets a bit insane, with naxx it is so excessive gear (most people won't have naxx gear tho).
---
I think this is one of the best daggers you can get without raiding, 47.2 dps.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19324
---
AQ40 dagger, 66.4 dps.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=21126
---
Naxx dagger, 73.1 dps.

People on this site love to talk up priest healers because they're the best natural healer. What isn't considered is enjoyment. Some people will be turned off by the lack of mobility, lack of stealth, and lack of melee that other healer classes can fill. 
---
It also doesn't account for the fact that not everyone wants to pick a class just for raid healing. 
---
At the end of the day this sub is a small sample of players, so only time will tell!
---
I always thought it was: MS Need, OS Greed, DE Pass and loot for BoP, Need and equip, otherwise Greed for BoE.
---
In pre-made groups we would even roll for the DE mats after the run, with first reserved to the enchanter as a payment for service provided.
---
No, not the same mechanic. The dots are simply damages that break spells, but you can basically vanish with dots, it will break the ennemy's targeting, while vanishing inside a flare wouldn't break the targeting, as I remember. But again, I might be wrong : I played rogue in vanilla and BC and hunter from TLK to Cata so I might remember wrong. 
---
But from what I remember, when I was stuck in a flare, I would have to run out of the flare, and even 3-5 yards more because of leeway / latency or whatever the reason, then after only I was able to vanish to break a targeting / cast. I clearly remember trying to break aimed shot with vanish, and miserabily fail because I was inside the flare.
---
Imagine "hating" a support class because they don't top DPS charts
---
2 hours tops, and that's really pushing it
---
Gonna say lol. There are people on here who actually are so into pushing no changes but don't know how Vanilla actually was. It's such a strange thing.
---
Furor is a critical talent for Feral DPS
---
Yeah, already bought a new keyboard and some more RAM. Thinking about pulling the trigger on a "gaming chair".
---
You do realise classic wow is vanilla, not tbc, right?
---
Very cool!  How long did this take you?
---
Shaman will be one of the more popular classes, but I can see Priests being the most popular dedicated healer. With shaman you'll have a number of people grudgingly agree to heal, while trying to figure out how to dps every other fight.
---
haha - you were wrong
---
try looting one mob
---
I know the top endgame healing goes pretty far into balance for the crits and some nice augment stats, so you may not be optimal but depending on how geared the raid is it might be ok.
---
This. Unless you've got some secret method and are literally not sleeping you'll get 60 and then within hours you'll see others who no lifed with you.
---
You'll see. When teams only win because some players or OFFLINE on enemy faction who actually follow the meta. You'll know what I mean
---
Didn't exactly worked that way. Faerie fire would prevent you from even trying to use vanish, while you could try in a flare - and fail. Meaning that somehow the flare is more powerful because you can make a rogue waste his vanish.
---
Hunter. The extra 5 min it takes to form a dungeon group pays off when your gear is literally handed to you when it drops in raids.
---
Bar swaps the way to go imo. They're obnoxious if you play warrior/rogue/druid because stances/stealth/forms don't work with them, but for everyone else it's just free binds if you plan everything out well. There shouldn't be any conflicts with totems since they're all on GCD.
---
Basically all mice have those forward and back thumb buttons now, those are good for it.
---
No Changes! &gt;:(
---
A bit off topic butttttt Let's be real, nobody is playing feral at 60 for dps. Well not many, and if they do go feral it's for OTing. The real spec at 60 is resto for pve and full hybrid for world pvp.
---
You're
---
The game's not even *out* yet. The TOS can be changed to cater for Classic.
---
What makes you think they won't bother banning people for buying gold in Classic? BFA's a wasteland already, it's far, far too late, and they offer an official solution for those who don't trust farmers. But allow third party gold selling in Classic and you're poisoning the well from the get-go.
---
This is either a big bait or a really cool girlfriend. Honestly, however you do, just the intention is already great. Best of luck!
---
It's always DNS
---
Raids aren't necessarily undertuned on pservers.  They actually found the opposite is true insofar as what we've seen up until this point is concerned.
---
Bears are absolutely viable and will be in classic. They won't be optimal at surviving, but you can't beat a bear in terms of threat generation.  Manual crowd pummeller gives bear even more crazy threat through a 50% higher frequency of maul.
---
You're already the most gimped healer, gimping yourself more isn't gonna look great to your raid leader. 
---
That said, MC is braindead easy so it's hardly gonna matter at first.
---
you're making a mountain out of a molehill. it takes a long time to do anything in classic. you will have plenty of time to be competitive before getting steam rolled by naxx no-lifers.
---
Eh, only a fraction of people back in the day could clear AQ and Naxx, which is why they changed up their raid designs and everything for TBC (which was a step in the right direction IMHO). O get what you're saying though.
---
However, I'm okay with mechanical difficulty, I think most people are. The problem with the current expansions of WoW stem from piss poor loot systems in place (which you alluded to). There's just too much loot everywhere and none of it is unique in any way. 
---
You don't even have to do hard content to get an ilvl comparable to someone who raids heroic raids and you even have a chance to get gear comparable to someone who raids mythic raids. It makes no sense as to why someone doing world quests would get this type of gear.
---
In a sense there's no gear progression at all since they force-feed it down everyone's throats, which is where the older expansions differ. There was gear progression and you could only get the better gear by putting in the time doing the "harder" content. Even when they added catch-up stuff that gear was still not as good as something you'd get in the harder raids you could be doing, or at least not every piece, which drove people to do more content.
---
If modern WoW went back to one raid difficulty with their mechanically challenging fights (perhaps with an option to do hard modes like Ulduar) and simultaneously curbed the hell out of their lootsplosion design I think the game would be doing a lot better. People would progress through raids at a decent pace and also put some damn character progression back into the game. That and actually put some effort into class design.
---
*chuckles* I bring a crit buff!
---
&gt; or is it just all an illusion that we created in our heads when we always thought of Vanilla to be way more difficult than it actually is?
---
define difficult.  
---
its more time consuming, not mechanically challenging. well not PvE.
---
Freudian slip
---
Battle of Dazar Alor is one of the greatest raid I played through. Fight are technical and hard, some boss NEEDs you to communicate, other have unforgiving mechanic so no place for mistakes, lastly the final fight of Jaina is really impressive.
---
I don't really care about the leeway, still rolling hunter.
---
Your DPS is not lower than tanks without MCP. What nonsense. It's a significant buff but it's like 15% DPS max
---
Not to mention those that have spent countless hours playing vanilla for the last few years will be the ones experienced enough to just rush through the content with ease, even if some numbers may differ.
---
That is one factor, but how large is it.
---
Can you? Yeah, if you're raid doesn't have an aneurism the second they see a chicken.
---
Should you? Probably not, it's kinda bad form to raid in your off spec even if you could get away with it. 
---
(Insert some confused statement about Viable vs Optimal here)
---
Classic is easier than private servers.
---
Don't lash out just because you lack reading comprehension.
---
LOL, wasn’t ready for that 2nd part. Nice
---
Well yeah.. that is the Thing :d 
---
A hunter is quite good at it - I mean you are most likely going to be a hunter anyway if you get Server first 60 :D
---
I don't think AOE farming is strong enough in Classic. I know mage was first 60 at last PServer Launch - but AOE farming will be much harder on retail classic.
---
Otherwise I think Rouges can do it - but on cooldown with Evasion.
---
If you can't solo then just grab the 2nd 60 and you will not be ganked as much while doing it either :P
---
&gt;whatever suits your consciousness.
---
Lol that reads really weird.
---
&gt;But If I really had any mental health issues I would not want to be treated like this
---
Treated like what? I didn't insult him, I didn't belittle him in anyway. Somebody disliked my comment, so a bunch of other people jumped on the band wagon and assumed I was a "the bad guy". You show up trying to white knight it, since I had downvotes for a very mild comment. 
---
I told him to get help because it sounded like he needed it. Turns out he already did. Amazing! Better get a mod because Holy shit did we ever have a horrible conversation after that hateful bile I was spewing out /s
---
pwlocke13 stated that last sentence iaw rule 4 of this sub.  Buying gold, by classic standards, would be viewed as cheating or illicit game behavior.
---
Blizzard made it acceptable later on by purchasing directly from them in order to boost their internal sales and better control the previously untapped market.
---
Buying gold in Classic wasn't just a bannable offense, it was a reputation loss for your character, which had significant impact on how the rest of the realm viewed you.
---
Yeah you’re probably right. Also as easy as it all sounds, situationally performing the ideal outcome isn’t always in the cards.
---
This is just a list of reagents.
---
https://youtu.be/FZgsywzP3wY
---
I main tanked as a druid all the way tthrough aq. It isnt hard if you pay attention and gear yourself up. I had 305 fr set for mc which made it easy peasy. I did solo 10 man ubrs as a tank and we flew through them. You can do ALL TANKING OPTIONS. Tge problem is warrior just makes it easier and can do some things better. You are pefectly capable of tanking rag, vael, chrom, and dont forget you are needed for naxx bosses. Aq was the only spot (aq40) where i felt warriors just outperformed me in every way. But i think its because i am a noob in that raid
---
god I wish boomie was viable in classic
---
That is true, but scroll down a bit and you will see some popular posts glorifying Nostalrius. I would say that the intersection between those two communities is quite big.
---
Ah, Captain obvious has arrived. That's why all the better faster gear in the back end of the game has minorly more stam and int and much more sp, and you don't see 7k hp mages running round.
---
**TBC classic** all the way. Maybe WotLK after that. Beyond that though, no thanks.
---
I know it still uses stealth anination. But is it really faster?like do the legs move faster or so you just glide more on the ground?
---
OSRS was dead in the water until they added new content.
---
For 99% of players not min-maxing and trying to be Nihilum/server world first(lol) every spec is viable. You just have to *gasp* socialize and make friends that are just there to have fun.
---
Yes but why does that matter? You dont level as bear most of the time
---
little tweaks were the bread and butter of vanilla. The meta was constantly changing with all the class tweaks.
---
What? 6 months is $77.94, that's $155.88, not $170. 
---
And BNet gift cards (sold by Blizzard) often go on sale on Amazon ($50 for $43), bringing it down to $134.06.
---
A running trend on this sub is that every class simultaneous sucks and is good tier, every raid will be a joke while requiring only the most elite hardcore raiding guilds with min-max players in order to clear, and you can't play the game unless you pick engineering while making sure to level alchemy.
---
People are just very passionate about this game and tend to operate only in extremes. I comes with the pre-launch excitment haha.
---
Simply put, take what people say with a grain of salt. Hunters do have some unfortunate features that many people here consider bugs while Blizz considers "working as intended". But I think hunters will still be a competitive class, and if nothing else, less hunters will mean less competition for gear. So it's a win for true hunters lovers.
---
Thanks
---
Since spellpower is based on 3.5 second cast times, does affliction lock (with mostly instant casts) care about spell power, or int?
---
Makes sense
---
oh look another idiot who doesn't understand the difference between a fact and an opinion.
---
Really? All of those specs you mention are much less useful than a retri paladin. It's ridiculous to even compare them. 
---
You are saying a bow rogue, who literally has zero abilities to use but auto attacking or a melee mage, who not only has zero abilities to use, but also zero gear are comparable to a ret paladin?
---
Those are also completely out of scope for the class. Ret paladin is simply a suboptimal spec, completely within the scope of the class, who will deal 60-80% dps of a fury warrior for the majority of the game (the difference really only opens up in late aq and naxx), but offers more support for the raid. A bow rogue offers 10% of the dps of a normal rogue and no support for the raid. A melee mage offers 5% of the dps of a mage and no support for the raid.
---
Sure, you have to draw the line somewhere and it's easy, you can bring 4-7 hybrid spec dps to the raid without affecting the overall performance too much.
---
And if someone wants to play bow rogue or melee mage. Well, if they find a guild, which lets them play this fantasy. Go for it. Even having one or two of those intentionally crippled specs in the raid won't affect the raid.
---
Why is it considered "getting carried" when you do a bit less dps? In the same notion, you can also say, a fury warrior gets carried, because his 1000 dps also don't matter overall, when the other dps aren't sleeping.

---
Oh, then I was mistaken. I'll fix that in my post.
---
So vanish and redo?
---
&gt; The current situation is that hunter will suffer massive blows, mostly related to its viability in pvp, compared to what people got used to on private servers
---
How?
---
This community seems to have a very strong loce/hate relationship with the word viable and nobody seems to agree on what it means. 
---
Let's say that Viable means you are pulling your weight, unviable means you aren't, and optimal means you're pulling your weight and then some. 
---
Given these definitions, feral and balance druids are absolutely unviable. If you were to replace every non-essential melee DPS with a feral druid and every non-essential caster DPS with a boomkin you would find it essentially impossible to progress in raids. 
---
Now, whether you like it or not, that means these specs aren't pulling their weight. They're being carried by optimal specs that are pulling their own weight and then some extra damage to cover the meme specs.
---
Just because you can complete content with a spec does not mean it is viable, as raids do not need all 40 people to be completed when everyone is *optimal*
---
also you do not need to travel, like in questing, you must travel from the q giver to the npc, to another q make circles in best cenarios on the maps and finish 3-6 quests in the same time. So u basicly wastin a lot on traviling from A to B, while the dungeon grind only needs minimal running while u dont gain xp, and thats it when you run out to reset or swap dungeon.
---
I think the data just looks skewed when your on this reddit or if your someone getting prepared for classic. I didn’t play vanilla and I’m planning on playing warrior. Here are some things I’ve gathered from this reddit and prep before launch. 
---
1. Warrior was the most common class I classic and is the only class playable by all races. 
---
2. Not all these warriors make it to 60 and apparently a lot will reroll before having their 60 main. 
---
3. fury/Prot is a tank spec utilized on pservers by guilds that are more hardcore - the typical casual to semi hardcore wwould prob have difficulty using this successfully 
---
4. There’s only so many classes and I see at least a post a day on this reddit about some aspect of every class
---
I don’t think there is going to be an overwhelming number of lvl 60 warriors or at least not a difference from vanilla numbers. It’ll be the most played class again but as someone else told me on here “a good warrior at lvl 60 will be sought after” (I forgot exact words lolz)
---
Wasn't in the mosaic but got the 4th anniversary achi if that means anything
---
When you don't make any sense.
---
Have you not seen the state Blizzard's in right now..? Do you realise how much money Classic's going to bring in compared to every other game they have that isn't BFA (and soon Diablo Immortal)? How many copies of Overwatch d'you think people are buying..?
---
And what happens when they ban someone for buying gold? Does that person just leave Classic forever or does that person, I dunno, make a new account and have to resub from level 1? You think that might be in Blizzard's favour?
---
You seem to think they're not going to support Classic whatsoever. Less than in 2004? Sure. But you aren't gonna get away with spamming racist shit in /1 and you're not gonna get away with buying gold either.
---
Well, you are. Everyone did. It's not hard to get away with. The argument is that if they find out, they'll still ban your ass.
---
Wasnt it backwards from this? Didnt they offer free xfers to the dead servers from several full servers?
---
'TILL YOU DIE
---
I'd like no more gear progression and just extra content with gear that can help flesh out the less played/nonviable specs like Ret/Protection Pallies, Balance druid, etc
---
This shouldn't be the case because druid tanks stack armuor instead of defense stat. The problem is crushing blows but that isn't much of a problem when the mobs are level 60(dungeons).
---
Every healer needs a farm set since, in Vanilla, +spell damage and +healing are separate. Warriors also need to carry a tank set. Druids have it the worst because they often carry a tank set, a healing set, and a damage set (either feral or spell damage).
---
If you want to be the dedicated tank in your group (good choice), roll Warrior.
---
It's nice to shape-shift, but a Warrior can also get as much pussy as he wants.
---
I did record a small audio sample with my modmic to try and convince you it sounds fine for the price:  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDxLmweGx8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMDxLmweGx8)
---
to go with some of the classic clips of that time you can take a look at the laintime clips. In aall of his videos with group vs groups fights he can't do flip to save his people or threaten anyone despite full R14 gear due to the lack of rage. Simply because the players know how to play against warriors. If no one attacks them and they only get the occasional crowd control - they don't get enough rage to be a threat.
---
Only when his group is dead on the floor and people don't focus him down with force does the 'wrecking ball' come into play.  When that rage bar is up heads start to fly
---
I hope so
---
Noo?! TBC = the beatiful classic... Karazhan was a Thing back then! /s
---
But no - he was just talking about tanking in a different form than bear. Which he happened to do in TBC
---
Windwall can be relevant in BGs and can save several hundred HP worth of damage if you have a hunter that you can't do much about.
---
I love your analogy! Although I do think there is more than what meets the eye.
---
Personally, I think the difficulty in classic comes from a more logistics perspective. There are so many things you have to 'manage' in classic i.e. bag space, mana, mob pulls, gold, travel times, quests, attunements, profession grinds (i.e. flask recipes, reputation). I can keep going. These things are not hard to learn by any means.
---
Each individual task doesn't require much skill of itself and require only basic knowledge/information. However, managing everything from a 'higher up' perspective (raid leader, guild master, recruitment officer, pvp premades, AH flippers etc.) can be very daunting. You need to have (reliable) knowledge about all aspects of the game and be able to utilize this to your benefit. But I guess this is true for any MMORPG though and applies as much to BfA as it is to Classic.
---
You've probably already made friends with some of the other racers (if not, ooof...), so the best thing you can do is go help any tanks/healers who might be lagging behind so you can get into dungeons asap.
---
I actually played on a server where a hunter soloed his way to 60 (got server second), but since he wasn't in a guild and hadn't made any friends everyone else just blew past him in the next few days.
---
IIRC a picture of my Alliance tattoo should be somewhere around Mekkatorque's head? Was just a pic of my back, near my right shoulder and it is just the Alliance symbol in black. Not sure if submitting that as the pic should make me cringe or not. In fact I wonder how many people would find their picture and cringe. Lots of mid 2000 emo kiddies in there :P
---
And you are still wrong for the reason I mentioned above. You brought nothing new to the table. Very well done.
---
1000 weeks = 19 years and 65 days
---
It's also the fastest way to get to Onyxia's Lair.
---
incoming
---
Is this a joke?
---
No level boosts.
---
Lupos fixed, melee leeway, fd + trap (at least was) weird
---
RemindMe! 40days “watch this”
---
No, im actually broke.
---
Spot on. Can confirm, was a horrible hunter.
---
I had not thought of that strat crates method. But I can see that being annoying early on because so many people will be doing Houses of the Holy quest and they need the holy waters from those crates too.
---
 I usually leverage my tanking role as group leader to fill the group with classes that fit the dungeon requirements the best. And to eliminate loot competition :D My favorite combo is shammy heals, shadow priest, and then mage / lock. Mind control is OP... you can effectively CC 2 mobs with 1 mind control. Not to mention the shackle option
---
Can’t tell is sarcasm or...
---
There sure AF better not be any level boosts in classic.
---
So is strength or agility the better leveling stat? To answer that question you will have to use applied math.
---
Gear is just as important but if you're doing progression it's iffy.  I guess if you're raid healing just by spamming rejuv and downranked healing touch it's one thing
---
hoo troll, shoo! \*fetches troll broom\*
---
That's the good stuff...ohh yeahhh
---
I'm assuming this is a joke post, but just is in case:
---
Any kind of financial means of bettering your character in classic is prohibited. If you want something in classic you cannot pay real life money for it (legally), you have to earn the reward yourself.
---
Well, the whole point of classic is to not have such things in the game and I'm pretty sure if they'd add something like that the core audience would be pretty pissed. I would be.
---
So, no, that's not gonna be a thing.
---
Yeah, like if your shaman or druid says at the start "Hey priest I'm trying to gather some heal gear is that cool?" they at least get a chance to say "I'm just here for the robes, if i can have those you can roll need on everything else?" then the druid can say "F this I'm out" or "I'm rolling need on those too" so the priest can leave. At least its happening up front instead of heartbreak later.
---
Shitpost remove. GG.
---
No chance of boosts for Classic for the foreseeable future. Possibly, possibly, in 3 years or so when the future direction for Classic is announced. In any event I can't see a level 50 boost costing any less than three months worth of subscription (~$45).
---
Yep
---
The shorter a fight is the more beneficial + healing gear is. To be able to crank out as much healing in as little time as possible will be the limiting factor.
---
As fights get longer, you need to balance total intellect with mana regen stats as well - +Healing is still the king (due to downranking), but the others (int, spirit, mp5) start to creep up in value. 
---
Sounds like you need to either A) do some theorycrafting of your own to figure out the true stat weight of +healing for your intended class. B) google search classic stat weights for +healing and use someone else's work.
---
are you talking about the rogue beating a rank 14 warrior without any gear ?
---
Its about doing them on farm fast, early on people are there for the fun of going in fresh, not a load of people enjoy their 50th Garr kill as much as their 1st or 2nd.
---
I guess I will never understand the "hardcore classic" raiders... as if they are clearing content never before cleared before and _everyone better take them seriously_.
---
I wouldn't take you in my guild minmaxing out your ass either so enjoy I guess? My guild will be about having _fun_ not working a 2nd job to beat a game I beat 1000 times 15 years ago
---
You could prety easily sacrifice the void (assuming the rogue can even kill the void in the duration of sap). Then just use fel domination and boom you have a bubble and another void. Sure the rogue could try to vanish and reset but at that point it's probably down to whoever's more skilled. Rogue vs warlocks were always fun matchups in my experience.
---
Tas'dingo
---
You won’t get good advice about retail here, most people seem to hate it.
---
Classic advice: just jump in and enjoy the ride
---
I did the same thing leveling my first rogue haha. I even had a long decision over whether to go with a bow or a an xbow. I eventually chose xbow because it seemed like a rogue would use a mechanical advantage.
---
I did eventually learn how to play rogue though...
---
I feel it says something telling about modern gaming that I see a post about "how do I leverage a server-first 60?" and immediately assumed it was referring to streaming and $$$.
---
i didn’t really get it either 🤪
---
Players are going to leave the private servers anyways, and Classic is supposed to provide a more exact experience.
---
The beta has proven that some spells are missing from the pservs, some stats are incorrect etc.
---
it will cost more around $100, as it was back in the day.
---
But im sure the chinese will reduce the price thanks to farm bots and sell level 60 characters for only $40 or so
---
Haha getting him definitely counts as some sort of skill
---
I played original wow since 2005 and every expansion pretty much all the way through with very little breaks except for warlords of draenor. BFA was the last straw and I have not played it if that tells you anything.
---
Just play classic, you won't be disappointed and then when you try retail later you'll have a great perspective of how they ruined the game.
---
For healing **entry raids** (only MC,Ony,ZG) yes, but you will struggle healing BWL+.
---
Feral can mean tank.
---
DPS-wise for warlocks:  
---
1 sp ~ 0.25 int  
---
1 crit ~ 11-15 sp  
---
1 hit ~ 11-15 sp  
---
Actual values depend on your gear / consumes.
---
Nah, it’s quite diff but ok.
---
That’s the beauty of being different, you’ll have fun doing your own thing and I’ll have fun min-maxing and clearing content as fast as possible with people who have the same mindset as I, despite it being over a decade old.
---
Ok
---
yeah they did, my server got tons of folks that were fleeing the que times that were rampant on Arthas I want to say
---
we all know where those innervates went to
---
Hmm, I wasn’t apart of the mosaic but possibly I played around then? I started at the start of tbc. When was the mosaic done?
---
&gt;Thank you, I actually didn't know this.
---
I played BWL as soon as it opened. Our guild was racing (and losing) for server-first kills. Figuring out the bosses was a huge portion of the challenge. There's first wipe was like an episode of CSI, figuring out WTH just happened. Few people had recording software, so it was just comparing what everyone noticed.
---
Even once the mechanics of the fight we're known, it took runs off trial and error to figure out the best way to overcome them. Forums were filled with digrams like a Napoleonic War strategy map. Classes met to work out their individual roles. THAT stuff is gone forever.
---
But that was forever ago. I look forward to relearning stuff.
---
My Thoughts are that Retail is a totally different game to Classic, I don't even consider then Cousins much less siblings. 
---
I have enjoyed Retail and i think its still on sale. 
---
In saying that if you are only really interested in Classic then wait until the 16th/17th Sub then get your name Res and play Classic with the rest of us. Give classic a really good 80hrs played before you say "i don't like it".
---
Good luck
---
Sounds like confirmation bias. Since it happens to you, you notice it happen more in other people.
---
I knew roughly ~20 or so people who played WoW regularly and never let it control their lives the way you're describing.
---
Is that 30 minutes across the entire run really worth alienating those 5-10 guys who were there to get your numbers up to 40 and have been there since the beginning.
---
You know the guys who were always down for the LBRS run to get you your key.  The guy who had no problem helping run you through a dungeon on your alt. The guy who farms and hands out potions to the raid for free because he likes doing it?
---
Because that is the component those min/maxers are forgetting.  That oomkin is that guy, that ret paladin is that guy. If one of the best guys in the world wants to run an off spec when we have no problems killing the bosses?  Then I got zero problems with it.
---
Because private servers did not have the code or the correct modifiers for anything, they had to guess a lot of things about information that had been lost and only Blizzard knew. You ask anyone who has played on vanilla privas for years and they can confirm the privas have less leeway range.
---
Honestly, retail isn't a bad game, however I don't think it can truly be considered a RPG-MMO anymore. Most people on this reddit refer to retail as a lobby game. I consider it a single player game with some end game grouping. Raids are probably better in Retail, however it lacks quality in the open world. There are too many quality of life features and people don't feel engaged with the game anymore.
---
Classic on the other hand doesn't hold your hand as much and you have to put time into the game to get things out of it. As a result its possible to build reputations and friendships (or enemies) based on this. In classic the world is dangerous and immersive.
---
The game is hardly ruined. You may not like it, but it’s not a bad game. Just different. 
---
BFA hasn’t been a great expansion, but plenty of the others have been fun.
---
Not quite. They just said it *would* be available but didn't give a time frame and said it would use the in-game store. [Source](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=553).
---
WoW Classic doesn't require a large amount of skill just to play.  With time and dedication you can reach level 60 and raid no problem.  However, that doesn't mean increased skill in the game doesn't pay off.  When you build up knowledge of the mechanics you can start optimizing things like time to kill mobs, your health between pulls, the 5 second rule for mana regeneration, kiting mobs, and killing elites solo.  
---
That's what makes WoW fun for a lot of different kinds of people.  There are casuals who are super happy just going through the game, reading quests, and getting more into roleplaying their characters.  Then there are hardcore players that find fun in optimizing their gear, mechanics, and routes to level fast and speedrun raids.  
---
This is very much organic difficulty which arises from the player being given broad direction and a set of game mechanics.  The fun in a game comes from the player trying to figure out how to utilize game mechanics to overcome problems they're presented with on their journey towards filling their own goals.  The goals arise, again, organically from things present in the game world.  
---
With modern WoW, the player isn't just given mechanics and a world with interactive elements.  The player is given explicit direction on how to play, where to go, and what to do.  That removes the need to apply thought to figure out the puzzle of how to use game mechanics to solve organic goals.  The players clicks a specialization, they get handed a series of pruned abilities, and they click whichever ones the game lights up.  There is no figuring the rotation out.  There isn't any debate on which skills to buy, use, and leave off.  This is especially so in a non-skill driven game like WoW.  In an FPS, the player is explicitely told what mechanics they should use (shoot gun at enemy, it can't get more simple), but the fun comes from the skill in aiming at enemies and killing them before they can kill you.  That's what makes it so much more important in WoW to NOT be told by the game what you should do.
---
If you also add in the fact that the player is also explicitly told what their goals should be, then you remove all player agency from the world.  Back in Classic, they gave you a world that was entirely too large and gave you no direction.  In retail, you log in and a book pops up with all of the things you should do and breadcrumb quests take you right to the next zone which holds your hand and leads you through the experience.  At max level, you're told to run dungeons, given world quests to complete, and handed free loot.  There isn't a thought of, "what do I want to do?" It's the game telling you, "This is what you do and here's how to do it."
---
&gt;Viability
---
It's an end of expansion patch. You could probably have a Rogue tank everything before AQ/Naxx if you really wanted to.
---
You sit there with your arms crossed and tap your feet on a DDR board.
---
Not me.  Once Classic goes live I will have no desire to visit any WoW related forums/social media.  I would rather be playing the game.
---
Sure. It's just really bad.
---
So what build do you reccomend to be good healing in raids but still in pvp/grinding?
---
Zero chance of corruption: you aren't going to have some donation incentives or rogue GMs destroying the economy. 
---
Stability: zero fear of the server suddenly vanishing because Blizzard came after them with lawyers. If you dedicate 1000 hours into a character on a private server, you have zero guarentee that it'll even be around tomorrow. If you dedicate 1000 hours onto a Classic character, it will absolutely be there tomorrow/next month/year/(forever?). 
---
Better community: f2p private servers' communities are often fairly ... *not as good*. There's more bots, more spammers, more cheaters, trashtalking, rule breakers etc ("if I get banned, who cares? Just make a new account and you're back on in 5 minutes!")
---
Ok ok:)
---
Well, yeah, you can technically pirate lots of games, but that doesn't always provide the best experience. ;P Classic offers stability, actual support, and an attention to detail that private servers can't, a larger playerbase, authenticity in general, and continued support. Private servers don't get everything right, don't always have all the right scripting for events, and don't have the *actual* experience that Classic offers. Totally worth resubbing. If the modern WoW experience isn't your cup of tea, then definitely wait until Classic drops to resub; play the game you really want to play. But do it right. ;)
---
Right, but 144 AP doesn't take you from "best in the game" to "worst". The AQ20 mace alone adds 140 AP. Blessed Qiraji War Hammer adds 280. Simply wear one of those instead of the Warden Staff if you ever begin to have threat issues.
---
Seems like there's a pretty nice mix of people saying "Hey guys; balance druid *was* really bad. Remember?" and people saying "Nooooo; you can play what you want. Remember some guilds would take their friends even if they *were* bad!"
---
I can´t imagine how you would want the real game to be more like a made up game. Was J Allen Brack right all along?
---
You mean on retail?
---
&gt;  In vanilla, you may well run out of zones to quest in at your level, so  you can advance into higher level ones. Your levels themselves were  huge because the blue bar at the bottom moved much more slowly. 
---
It wasn't just might run out of zones your level to level in and have to move to higher level ones, these are some points where you might have to stop and take a look at zones you can go too and realize heading there and trying to quest is impossible and you might have to grind mobs for an entire level or more.
---
This is a less previlant problem in the 1.12 patch world we will be getting as players but I remember earlier patchs where the world just made you stop and go 'huh' guess I'm killing mobs for the next 2 levels cause that next zone everything is dark red for me.  
---
Also the you hit lvl 55 and the game runs out of quests and you had to literally grind the last 5 levels.
---
Thank god I was a kid with not idea how boring that was the first tiem I had to doit cause I probably would have quit if I had a single intelligent thought in my head back then.
---
Yeah even when I was playing, to me WoW was starting to feel more and more like a F2p. Not sayin it was bad quality...just kinda generic
---
Sorry, mixed threads m8 😅
---
Long story short, 15 years ago I....
---
Retail is not in a good state for newcomers/returning players, others will lambast it more thoroughly I'm sure.
---
Vanilla was always the accessible mmo.
---
If you want to spend a lot of time in endgame you'll have to make getting there your goal. That said there's way more game than endgame, so you can very much just hop in and enjoy the hour sink.
---
Retail can be overwhelming (which becomes underwhelming) really easily if you focus too much on the end game or the grinds. 
---
I just got back into wow since Cata (with like a month during Legion) and really enjoyed the leveling up to 120. The zone scaling was annoying at first but I really enjoyed going through zones I would normally never see.
---
I have no source, I forget where I read it tbh.
---
Yeah! I am only concerned with leveling when it comes to cat
---
Why do you use arcane shot in your 50-60 rotation, and not another aimed shot?
---
I'm not surprised that people on classic wow praise a game that is designed for the unemployed and inapt.
---
Im taking 1 day off 3 weeks in a row. Steady flow, ya know?
---
If you want a PvE balance of “*Moonkin / Healer*” id go this build https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/31105003025012--50500311501403
---
You only really lose Improved Starfire and Moonkin form for DPS but then you can full heal all raids. (Moonfury only boosts base damage, so it isn’t that good sadly)
---
Harpies in Northern Barren's, so many of them that as a warrior you had to pull with your ranged weapon and by the time you got 3 or 4 mobs in the ones behind you had respawned and you were now surrounded and dead if you fucked up a single pull.
---
Blizzard wants you to convert over to Retail. It's where all the money is at. Even if, after ~3 years, there's still a sizable contingent of Classic players - if Blizzard thinks they can convert ~30-40% of them over to Retail by shutting down Classic, they will.
---
How does gearing and loot work though? Aren’t the Druid tier sets for resto? So would you need to compete with cloth users for spell damage gear?
---
Exactly. 100% spellpower are applied over 15 seconds of the dot. So the more targets there are for you to dot, the more you benefit from spellpower.
---
pet healing gear
---
warrior
---
If you zoom in on the corner of thralls left pauldron (his left) and his head, in the white area, you can see the same picture 4 times.
---
Not really. The blue gear is aq 40 level and the weapons are good till naxx
---
Saw more Thunderfuries than Sulfuras for sure. Almost all raiding guilds had at least 1 TF, sometimes 2-3 (like mine). Meanwhile, my guild never had a Sulfuras, and you'd see them very rarely. More common than MoM or Ashbringer, but less common than the AQ40 2-handers.
---
For the look or/and for making meme spec actually not so meme.
---
If you really want a "gaming chair" get an office style one without the side "wings" or whatever theyre called, otherwise theyre pretty comfy in my opinion.
---
Nope, did that for my own enjoyment and accomplishments.
---
As a rogue it was so easy taking these from hunters, just wait till they are done kiting sap/blind and take their leather :)
---
There is no way they would shut down classic.
---
They could basically let it run with no/minimal GM support. No updates etc. To save money.
---
But shutting it down means they lose a majority of the players that played there.
---
I doubt the average player spends 3x as much money on retail compared to classic either. So would be a loss of money if they could only convert 30% into regular players (and then even that number would drop off after time passes and they would get less new subscribers because they shut down 1 of their services).
---
I added you back! Hope to talk to you soon.
---
I can't compare because I did not get into the beta.
---
But your implication that all the top players from private servers are wrong about there being less melee range on privas - why should I believe this, when it's your word against all of theirs?
---
Nice value add.  Looks like the content within my 'shitpost' was creative and valuable enough to be pinned to the top of this sub for the next four days.  I'll admit, my mistake in not seeing that before I posted but at least I'm attempting to contribute interesting topics to this sub instead of being the quintessential reddit police like yourself.  Pat yourself on the back bud, you dun good.  Justice served at the hands of Reddit user msbr\_
---
Where you getting that weapon recommendation from? He mentioned mirahs, and axe alternatives. Along with finkle skinner. All legit weaps.
---
Thanks. Any other good builds you can enlighten me on?
---
"Hello, customer service? I love this game, but don't want to play it. What are my options?"
---
Int is terrible for aff warlocks because dots can’t crit and one of the primary benefits to int is bonus crit chance.
---
You'll be able to log in to the server you want, create and customize your character but you will not be able to enter the world. Rested xp does not start until you log in for the first time, so that's not an issue.
---
Um, MOTW too bro, cmon.
---
There’s no way there will be rested xp
---
People keep saying that but I just don't see it happening.
---
They scale much worse with gear. They don't even come close to have the same toolkit as warriors have. In my experience they can't do anything if a person accidentally over-aggros. It's just a wipe. Whereas a Warrior has multiple taunts, shield wall and other low rage threat generating abilities.
---
I'm not really sure anybody knows yet, what blizzard said, was when we are closing in the servers will be announced and you wouldn't be in doubt 😁
---
No you won't get rested do.
---
There is a way. If Blizzard believes enough players will convert after slowly shutting down Classic, then it's worth it to them.
---
The meme spec players are having bigger orgasms here than Asian guys watching that new cinemax series "Warrior" lol.
---
Dont be the healer. Just dont do that to yourself. Too many girls end up as the healer. While it would probably benefit your boyfriend and his group of friends, you also become the stereotypical healing e-girl. Do yourself a favour and go for a damage class.
---
Gear progression can be very strange - none of the Tier sets are really oriented towards Bear tanking, since most of the raiding Druids are healers (although individual set pieces are good for Bear tanks.)  If you look at Taladril's spreadsheet (for example,) you will find that some of the best pieces pre-AQ are quest rewards and drops from 5-man dungeons, as well as PvP gear and crafted items. One of the BiS (for the whole game) trinkets comes from a level 60 quest. It really pays to do a little planning, so you're aware where the best items come from.
---
I dont love Uldaman and ZF nearly as much those, no. It really doesnt get good until 53/54 when you can start pre bis dungeons
---
No I will quit if they ever add an expansion to this game.  They need to allow players to stay on classic only servers forever.
---
I mean...no joke...literally same here. I thought it'd be amazing if she was a priest or pally and me a warrior but all she wants to do is run around the world and collect mounts (she played a bit before)...
---
Yeah...no thanks, I got Hordes to slay.
---
The terms like cc, taunting, etc. existed before early wow, at least in EQ. I think most people picked them up from wow being their first mmo, rather.
---
No, the subscription fee isn't even half of Retail's revenue. Microtransactions and expansion sales make up about 60 to 70%.
---
A soundcard can improve your mic quality. Instead of an expensive mic you might want to buy a good soundcard and a cheap mic to get a moderate mic and great sound.
---
I don't get this.
---
I can understand grouping up for timezones and language.
---
But you want a guild that can meet up for a beer ?
---
Yea it wasn't bad. Got to hang out with the boys and make some gold. We took all the loot and DE'd it as well for some extra shards / dust for everyone.
---
Damn, I use the hell out of the wings at work lol. At home, I use like a drafting stool. It's just kind of hard and uncomfortable.
---
Lucky for you, someone already did the test on beta, you just need to replicate it on any private server. Its not that hard.   
---
Classic beta:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3GH5cWPFOE)   
---
Why dont we just cut all this "word against words" "it feels like" and so on, and ACTUALLY DOING THE FKING TEST YOURSELF?? Holy fck, its like people are not able to test anything themself anymore but blindly trust anyone who argue the best.
---
I thought you were the hero we needed.
---
Very important question before any other advice: Is your boyfriend a PvP-er, and a good one, or is he just some casual?
---
No rested exp.  you have to actually log into the char to get rested and you won’t be able to do that.
---
I'm do something similar with my warrior now. I have the stance specific spells on their respective bar and then the multi stance ones on another bar. I also use an mmo mouse so it's pretty easy to bind 36+ keys. Maybe I'll give druids more thought though. You make some good points about 5mans.
---
&gt; playing the reigns of Castamere at a wedding
---
He wasn't at that wedding.
---
It was ruined for me. I played on Tichondrius the entire time I played basically and I always had fun pvping out in the world even when people said world pvp was long dead. Warmode ruined that and it caused two of my friends to quit as well, one another veteran. Warmode sucks.
---
It's frickin freezing in here
---
Wtf dude no. In Vanilla wow you will get banned from the game immediately if you even consider playing a moonkin or shadow priest. Be realistic pls.
---
Asking questions helps. 
---
Also playing on your own and learning the game without him holding your hand along the way should help.
---
Spacing your shots between auto shot is a concept I couldn’t get through to so many hunters. Shot timers were met with a “wut” 
---
Also so so so many thought that their pet tanking alongside the tank was the greatest idea ever.
---
This is going to get removed by the moderators.
---
Tauren is total in classic
---
...wtf are you on about? Are you losing your sanity? You just linked a video of one of the guys that PROVES that privas have less melee range than Classic does.
---
You literally just provided evidence against yourself. Are you stupid?
---
cool
---
It would have been pointless to spend money on making classic then, converting retail players to classic players.
---
They would lose 100% of revenue from new people subbing to classic and probably 90% of classic players would stop playing right away or within a few month.
---
It would also be bad PR for them.
---
There is cash opportunities in classic and similar projects, dropping classic would mean they won't get any of that money.
---
Turns reddit into echo chambers
---
Are you sure about that? Like do you have evidence of that being the case towards the end? Because I know at the start there was no scaling and it only affected base hp
---
I was 5. Had no idea what I was doing. I mainly remembered just leveling characters to lvl 5-10 then just making a new one. My brother got me to ask our mom to buy tbc for us lmao. My step dad wouldn’t let us play the game so we had to kind of like sneak play it. Played only Mac laptop so wasn’t too hard. I use to cross my arms to play putting my right hand on the number keys and my left hand on the arrow keys. I was rarded.
---
/GINvite huh? We having martinis?
---
That one fucking quest in the Barrens where you have to harvest beaks from Plainstriders near the river. You only need to get 10 of them but good luck, you'll have to kill at least 50 Plainstriders.
---
well yes, they existed. What I was talking about is these terms becoming widespread staples for basically every game through the popularity of vanilla wow. Everquest was a veeeery niche game so the amount of people to have played an mmo competently before was very small on vanilla release.
---
I just dont like spending money for something I'm not gonna play, which seems perfectly reasonable to me, but hey, go off I guess.
---
As has been fortold by Salzman from accounting
---
&gt;I wonder if the cap will stay the same.
---
Classic at release will have the player caps from 1.12 in place.
---
This is what classic is all about, you nailed it right there!
---
That’s fine, but you presented it as if the game was just terrible all around. 
---
Instead of saying “the game is ruined, don’t play,” you’d be better off saying what ruined it for you.
---
&gt; It would have been pointless to spend money on making classic then, converting retail players to classic players.
---
No, that *is* the point. The games are bundled and they're making huge changes to Retail that appeal to Classic players. Anyone that thinks this isn't Blizzard's strategy in the next 2 years is delusional.
---
Don't quote the ancient magic to me witch. I was there when it was written!
---
I just pre-ordered WCIII for a few minutes of relief.
---
I heard Skarm Tank talk about bears recently in a podcast and he sold me on the idea. First off, warriors don't scale as well with MC gear. Another benefit is that it is a lot faster to gear two tanks of different armor types than two of the same. I don't remember what he said about Balance.
---
yeah I just said how the talent works not how a warrior works.
---
It's exactly how I remember leveling in 1.12, which was significantly easier than leveling in 1.2, due to a combination of: talent revamps, bug fixes, just knowing what the hell I was doing and where to go and what was dangerous.
---
Especially playing warrior. Warrior was both my first class and the one I picked for my Alliance reroll (which was after the warrior talent revamp), so that's the class I had the best basis for comparison on. My initial reaction was "this feels easier than I remember" followed very shortly by "no, this feels easier in the same way I felt when I rerolled."
---
Priest felt correct as well (my second character, first to hit 60, and my main for half of Vanilla and then from mid TBC to present on Live).
---
Dungeons were easy in particular because everyone I ran into in Beta was a relatively experienced player. Verdan the Everliving wiped one of my groups once, and another time with a different group the fight ended with me kiting him around as the last one standing to kill him, as he hits like a fucking truck, which tracks with my memory (these dungeons were all on my priest healing as shadow). Didn't really have any other problems in dungeons except when a hunter pet randomly decided to aggro an entire room due to bad pathing.
---
 I think it really reinforced the idea that most of what made Vanilla "hard" was just lack of game knowledge and lack of experience among the playerbase. I definitely remember thinking in late Vanilla "this game is easy, these people are just bad at it", and at this point most people still playing WoW have gotten passably good at it, especially by Vanilla standards. At least the type of people who would get into beta and actually level up in it.
---
Lookup skarm tank on YouTube. He makes mostly tank videos. Many of which show how viable Druid tanks actually are.
---
I might be a masochist I still enjoy playing old games like everquest and I like when my game requires time sinks because it gives the rewards more meaning. But fuck man I wish that they would combine old time sinks with new difficulty.  
---
Modern ff14 savage / mythic wow raid difficulty throughout the entire game with old school dedication / grinding. I don't know how popular it would be, but I'd be in heaven.  
---
That being said a lot of my friends aren't that great at games and the most fun they had in WoW was when it was super simple in vanilla, but since the time requirements were high it still gave them meaning and enjoyment.
---
That sounds so fun. You'll do amazing.
---
Since you have the druid you might consider either a cator raptor if your druid will be tanking mobs, or a boar if you want your pet to tank mobs. Might even be better to go marksman for damage since bear form is a fantastic natural tank.
---
You have a ton of options, but you'll find the world to be pretty easy with this combo.
---
Reminds me of the rogue I was trying to explain poisons and sharpening stones to  
---
...at level 60. He just didn't believe in using them.
---
I see his point, though - a smart player should leave that stuff in a bank and only take it if they know they are going for a dungeon run. This is where warlocks shine - if someone is short a healer for SM and whisper a paladin while he’s out questing, tell them you gotta grab your healer set and then they’ll summon you.
---
I was agreeing with ya! 👍
---
&gt;Is that 30 minutes across the entire run really worth alienating those 5-10 guys who were there to get your numbers up to 40 and have been there since the beginning. 
---
A large amount of people are signing up to guilds before hand (on here, discords, and other 3rd parties), the guild I signed up for has a meme spec raid planned each week, and we also have our 2 hardcore progressions planned as well as 2 alt raids planned (100+ signed up). I think in the Hardcore group and everntually in the alt group, we will not be alienating anyone. This is also clearly and obviously stated everywhere, the person playing the character makes the choice themself wether they want to play a low priority class/spec. Getting the 40 people is going to be a lot less difficult this time around, we have up to 3x more people to choose from on each server. That 30 min a night really adds up fast too, thats an hour a week if you have 2 raid nights.
---
&gt;You know the guys who were always down for the LBRS run to get you your key. The guy who had no problem helping run you through a dungeon on your alt. The guy who farms and hands out potions to the raid for free because he likes doing it?   
---
&gt;Because that is the component those min/maxers are forgetting. That oomkin is that guy, that ret paladin is that guy. If one of the best guys in the world wants to run an off spec when we have no problems killing the bosses? Then I got zero problems with it. 
---
I understand that being nice and kind should be rewarded, but not everyone is going to care. I can be nice and kind in my workplace all day, but if I don't get any work done, I am still in deep shit. Same way you can be nice and kind to your raiding guild all day, but in the end they want you to be a raider. If you don't want to be in a raiding guild you don't have to, you can still pug and I am sure 9/10 pugs won't look at anything about you. 
---
People want to be able to fit in anywhere while being any shape, you can't force a square peg in a round hole of the same area, and you shouldn't try to do that to yourself or the hole either. Fit where you think you fit. 
---
I want to play a meme spec, I always have wanted to play a firelock, but I want to do it well, I am going to test and practice after I feel it will be viable, and prove it is something good. It is going to be a pain in the ass but the reward will be worth it if I can obtain the results. I wouldnt in 50 years expect to just walk into a progression raid as firelock and start using searing pain, its going to be an ongoing discussion between me and my guild leaders. My last progression guild ran 1 boomkin and 1 spreist. Boomkin is one of the best classes for chromag arcane and nature are some of the worst weaknesses to get if you have 0 boomkin. Spriests are great for creating phantom warlocks, for every 4 warlocks you gain a 3/5 warlock, add your dmg in and profit. 
---
TL;DR
---
Imo if you manage to fill the very few competitive roles for a memeish spec, all the power to you, I persoanlly think they are just more relevantly placed in alt/meme spec raids where it is less serious.
---
i'm realistically solid and cringing at your comment
---
Rule 1 of Counterstrike. Never play with speakers.
---
I grew up with games with shitty graphics so I'm slightly biased but graphic quality almost has no meaning to me whatsoever so long as the game is fun. Vanilla's models and animations are actually pretty smooth, very smooth for their time actually. Aged perfectly.
---
How can one cringe unrealistically?
---
Big oof
---
I tested the gnome racial during blizzcon and way back in 2004 and found conflicting results.
---
In 2004 I stripped my gear and put it back on and found NO scaling with gear.
---
During Blizzcon I stripped all my gear off and put it back on and found YES it scaled with gear.
---
One is based on memory of a specific test and the other was real data so I could have been wrong.  That said, unless they have changed it in the beta expect that gnome’s int racial to scale with gear.

The reason this build was good for healing was because of HOTW which does boost healing, pure balance spec doesnt have an equivalent (he was talking about pure moonkin spec not hybrid balance)
---
Yeah difference is you'll be done in a week and bored while I'll still be playing for years.
---
You would already have you druid healer for your locks likly
---
For the record, those terms all came from the games that came before WoW, going back to text based telnet MUDs. The main thing is that, yes, those concepts had not migrated into literally every other game genre before that, and before WoW MMO games were extremely niche at a time where video games themselves were still somewhat niche.
---
Can you link something?
---
patch 1.12 did buff feral druids quite a bit. Such as innate threat reduction in cat form, another rank to ferocious bite which drops as a  book from UBRS and some talent fixes.
---
1.11 was naxx, 1.12 was crossrealm bg's and silithus/epl world pvp systems.... which noone did hehe.
---
you will eventually get out geared by the raiders (how soon depends on whether you get the rank13/14 gear).  though a large portion of the battleground population will not be raiding and will have gear on par with you.
---
why don't you spend a few hours a week raiding to solve the problem?
---
That's why I gave up on VW pretty early on in Vanilla and just drain tanked everything.
---
Are you retarded?
---
You know what I mean though. He's the one who had them play it. So the Starks would know where the D was coming from.
---
Well, that's your opinion and mine disagrees. Which means they'll happily let you quit if it means I'll convert to Retail.
---
This really is it, especially looking at 1-40. The clusterfuck of the first instance runs I did with my friends is hard to recreate.
---
I am doing it right now it’s so easy

---
Rets are the worst nightfall wielders since they lack instant attacks.
---
Give the pservers some credit.  They are pretty close numbers-wise.
---
The main reason pservers are a lot easier is because they don't generally have progressive itemization.  The 1.11 catch up blues are available immediately, and are significantly more powerful than what will be available at first.  Specifically, they give tons of spellpower that isn't available originally.  This means that healers can downrank more aggressively, which means they don't run OOM, which means they heal more often, for larger values.
---
But, I think the main effect of this difference is going to be that, while on pservers, pugs full of memespecs can still clear MC and ZG with fresh 60s, in classic you will still need organized groups and a little more care to who you bring and how you play.
---
The biggest difficulty WoW classic will have is folks who ghost their guilds when they get bored of old raiding, which is an overall loot drain for guilds.  They'll be filling buckets with holes in the bottom so it will require constant recruiting and raiding old content.  I don't think that's a bad thing for the game or the community, but it will slow progression for the semi-hardcore and under crowd.
---
And why does downranking fix this?
---
If you don’t like the idea of hanging out with guildies, that’s cool. But certainly you can understand why people would...right? I’ve been active friends with 6-7 guys from my BC guild for 12+ years. We see each other at least once a year. It’s great.
---
you can bring a druid tank to raids.  they wont be the maintank but they are a useful offtank.  
---
the druid tank will be looted specific druid tank gear and this will allow your warrior tanks to gear up faster because they are dividing the tank gear among one less person
---
lol
---
&gt; The amount of hours you need to spend in game just farming consumables for the big day is INSANE! The amount of gold you need to buy the stuff is also insane.
---
That's what China is for.
---
don’t do it. trust me. the anxiety of which pet to choose is crippling.
---
That would be amazing
---
Druids are a viable tank at level 60. You wont be the main tank for a raid but could find a spot as an offtank.  
---
they wont bring more than one so it might be hard to find a raid spot
---
Because as a hybrid they roll on everything and are most common ninja looter class.
---
Serious progression or classic WoW, pick one lol.
---
Yes, up to a gear point
---
This guy also suggests having 2 level 60 alts as Dire Maul releases. Good luck doing that and doing your best to farm gear outside of raids that early into release.
---
In terms of lore.. After Deathwing is defeated and Garrosh is made Warchief the Horde and Alliance start to fight more. Both Varian and Garrosh are not exactly peacemakers. Horde bombs Theramore almost killing Jaina but only manages to dye her hair white. She abandons her previous peaceloving attitude and vows revenge on the Horde. Alliance and Horde expeditions find a new island which turns out to be the forgotten continent of Pandaria. Both factions struggle to win over the Pandarians as well as a few minor races on the continent. Their actions awakes the 5th element; Sha and it starts to pollute and corrupt the land. A league of Pandarians awaken the old thuder god to purge the land, but ofc he's under the influence of Y'shaarj, an old god similar to C'thun and Yog-Saron. So we beat him and then we realise that Garrosh has been ensared by Y'shaarj as well and he digs out the old god's heart to absorb his power. We invade Orgrimmar and kill many lovable lore characters and annoying goblins. Then we don't actually kill Garrosh, we just subdue him. This of course leads to trouble as the Alliance wants Garrosh to answer for his crimes, with his head. Vol'jin is then chosen to lead the Horde.
---
Warlords of Draenor:   
---
Garrosh escapes of course and through some timetravel diddling manages to go back to before the first war and invasion by the original Orcish horde. He stops Gul'dan from corrupting the Orcs and boosts their fighting power with modern (30 years older) technology and they start invading Azeroth, but in our timeline. So now when we enter the Dark Portal we are taken to Draenor, which is Outland before it got destroyed by Gul'dan's fel magic.   
---
We beat them back and secure strongholds on Draenor to fight the Iron Horde. Thrall tracks down Garrosh and challenges him to a Mak'gora, but cheats and uses his elemental magic powers to kill Garrosh. As such Thrall is ashamed of himself and disappears for a while. We kill many important lore characters and eventually we fight Archimonde for the third time in Warcraft history and kill him yet again. The Iron Horde is vanquished, a suttle peace has settled for now, but it won't last..  
---
Legion:  
---
So the Burning Legion is back and wants Azeroth to burn again. They do a good attempt but are fought back to The Broken Shore where the heroes suddenly realise the powers that are facing them. The legendary Tirion Fordring is killed quite easily and in the end both Varian and Vol'jin dies in the battle. The Alliance being a hereditary monarchy is succeeded by Anduin and Vol'jin chooses Sylvanas to succeed him. The Horde and Alliance work closely together to defeat the Burning Legion and with the resurrection of Illidan they push deep into the Tomb of Sargeras and actually manages to destroy Kil'Jaeden who has a moment of repentance with his brother Velen. Sargeras himself appears above Azeroth and tries to consume its world soul. We then board some spaceships and fight with the titans to make them essentially arrest Sargeras and Illidan presumably kills him. Before that though he plunges his sword into Azeroth which reveals a new resource; Azerite. 
---
BFA:  
---
The Horde and Alliance go back to squabbling amongst themselves over this new resource and this leads to an all out war between the factions. Sylvanas orders the Horde to burn Teldrassil while Varian tries to assault Undercity. Thrall, I mean Chris Metzen, who left Blizzard a few years ago asks the panel at Blizzcon if there are any warchiefy positions opening up soon to which they reply, "there could very well be." Saurfang is pissed at Sylvanas for not fighting with honor but is captured, then released by Varian who hopes he will end Sylvanas. He then tracks down Thrall and is participating in many epic cinematics. The big bad of this expansions is Blizz.. I mean Queen Azshara who teams up with the old gods and becomes a squid until we make calamari of her.

It would seem the ranks of rain of fire and blizzard while lvling do surpass each other every time in dmg.  However I do agree blizzard seems to do more dmg based on lvls and max rank and first rank.  Hellfire does do more dmg once you unlock it at lvl 30.  About 50% more dmg than blizzard actually.
---
The reason I brought up the open world scenario is because alot of AoE spells are not considered in dungeons or not used because they are bad at lvling.  You can't AoE lvl as a warlock because your hellfire doesn't slow or cc the mobs at all.  In many cases because of the above reason, many people do not even buy the skill while lvling.  Therefore its not used in dungeons.  However if you are doing an AoE build it could be good to get Hellfire and Rain of Fire.  However I would imagine it would be really hard for the tank to hold aggro off of a Hellfiring warlock.  The dmg is good but the threat is probably too much for a tank while lvling.  Together with Hellfire doing dmg to the warlock as well the warlock will probably die.
---
In the same vein as warlock AoE, mage fire AoE, flamestrike and blastwave do more dmg than blizzard and possibly more dmg than warlocks.  If a mage specs into fire they can still use Cone of Cold and Frost Nova and Blizzard.  The flamestrike initial dmg, stun potential and ignite procs would melt mobs faster than blizzard or hellfire ever could.  However again this would be an issue with threat and the mage would probably pull all the mobs off the tanks.  The spec isn't conducive to solo lvling tho.  However could melt dungeons with a good tank/healer.  You still have access to all the CC as well.
---
Fantastic!
---
The thing is most people were new to mmo's in general and with wow's massive time sink and little catch up gear it required most guilds to progress through all the raids. Well what if you started in patch patch 1.10 ? There's a very small chance you'd end up clearing naxxramas compared to someone who had started at the beginning farming every tier.  
---
Watch this time around we'll see a massive amount of people clear naxxaramas compared to before and not because it's easier, but because the community will understand mmo's nuances and more people will work toward that goal from the start of the server.  
---
I agree with your thoughts about modern wow doing a lot better with that design, but just like time sinks alienate some people mechanics also alienate others. Some people just aren't capable of clearing anything above normal no matter what and some people just can't or don't want to commit the hours to a classic like design.  
---
Personally I'd love to see a WoW where the game has the time sinks of old and the difficulty of modern WoW, but I have a feeling that would be too hardcore for a lot of gamers.
---
🤣👌
---
There is already something that set up rhythm in the game, it's the GCD. Spell batching doesn't add any kind of skill to the game because you can't take any advantage over your opponent due to spell batching
---
&gt; I think it is an error to raise the level cap and get totally new equipement. 
---
Had the same thought in the car the other day. One of the crappy parts of TBC was tossing out your epics for TBC blues/greens. Feels...wrong.
---
An interesting idea that's floating in my head (inspired by some posts here) is a completely different model for expansions. What if:
---
* You can't send your characters into an expansion server. They must start from lvl 1.
---
It seems to solve some problems. Your old chars can remain in classic, with their epic gear. Didn't finish naxx? Thats fine, come back to it later. Classic never goes away. Never replace your epics with TBC blues.
---
It also brings the leveling experience back into focus for *each* expansion. Something folks complain about is the relentless focus on endgame. I think you need endgame as a motivator for leveling, so each expansion will have an endgame, but they are *separate* from each other. Leveling remains in focus for each expansion.
---
Leveling may or may not include repeat quests from past expansions, but would also have lots of new content. 
---
The game takes a more generational approach. In classic, you were the first generation of adventurers. In TBC, you're the next generation. Kinda cool in that respect.
---
I'm guessing blizzard didn't do this due to the high cost. Its essentially them releasing a new MMO every so often, but iterating on it between each release. That said, it isn't a ridiculously far cry from the work they needed to do for expansions either. Basically, wow becomes a series of separate games. Pick your poison. Still a big worry about splitting the playerbase too much, but maybe its not as big of a problem as we all thought.
---
Just not pvp
---
you are going to be stuck tryna clear day1 content for years with that «everything if viable»-mentality. 
---
hf.
---
But a classic player is still worth something.  I'm sure that the $15 a month more than pays for itself.  If I'm not mistaken, they're using the same exact hardware they're using for retail servers so it's not like it costs a lot.
---
What are you on about? The entire contintent is on a layer. Layering absolutely works in cities. The *entire point* of the piece of shit system is you can layer hop to your friends when you join their group.
---
Maybe *you* need to watch the developer's videos some more because you don't know how it works.
---
I think he's right... More utility, easier aoe tanking and clear speed and easier to heal in dungeons allowing your healer to dps more
---
Thanks for the in depth!
---
Not as OP as 2.0 ret pally, though
---
It might not be until next week (I’m on vacation out of the country currently) but yes for sure.
---
Out of curiosity why wouldn't you recommend pally to a first timer? I feel like they're a class that's pretty mechanically simple, can heal itself, has oh shit buttons, and is naturally tanky with mail and plate.
---
Yes. They'll only shut down Classic if their research suggests that would push enough holdover players to Retail.
---
costs less mana, at the cost of damage. that's why healers downrank their spells too. since 50 dps (or hps) for 5 minutes is way better than 100 dps for onebandba half and then just wand
---
I started when I was 9 or 10 (can’t remember)
---
this way pls:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/)
---
&gt; He's the one who had them play it.
---
That's my point, though. Orchestrating stuff from a distance isn't a "rogue" behavior.
---
I mean this boss is super fucking boring as a healer anyways there is nothing to do. You can do it with 6.
---
Viability of Hunter Turtle Pet Tank?
---
They're launching Classic to get you back on the tit, to get you back into old-god-whispers-in-the-ear range, and to use the modern client's data gathering tool to figure out what people actually liked about Vanilla WoW so they can better make changes to Retail that attract those players. They've already announced changes to Retail like this, such as the level squish (which would allow you to transfer your characters from Classic over to Retail and be ready for new expansion content).
---
It is easy to fuck up as a hunter in general. You have to not tab target for fear of autoshotting and aggroing a pack. You can't use one of your core dps abilities (multishot) a huge chunk of the time due to breaking cc. You have to melee sometimes or risk backing into and aggroing mobs. 
---
Then there is of course pet management which most people screw up on, at least in early instances (I see warlocks wipe group much more often than hunters, they should get more hate).
---
Then you have your cc kit that isn't as straight forward as other classes. A mage just targets an enemy and sheeps it. If sheep breaks, they sheep it again. Trapping then again with fd/trap isn't really difficult, but it is easier to screw up. And if a trap gets resisted you can just put another one down.
---
Thank you for that.
---
Druids are some of the best OTs in the game for a lot of raid fights, and can be on par or even better MTs than warriors for some fights too. There are obviously certain fights where you literally can't have a druid MT, such as nefarian due to the class call and no fear break. But then there are fights where druid OT is far and away the best, such as Patchwork, and druid MT the rest of the abomination wing.
---
This is exactly how good loot councils work. They factor in attendance, BiS, longevity of use, and contribution to the group.
---
Deadly Blunderbuss is used for a Horde quest in Ashenvale to get blue items so would definitely be a good source of money on a fresh server if you're Horde. I can't really comment on anything else though.
---

---
Um, what?  You're clearly looking for some easy karma for a knee jerk reaction.  Why don't you sight these mythical comments yourself, oh right, because they don't exist.  Try reading any other engineering leveling guide and ask yourself if you'd make more money with those.  Seriously.  
---
I've been making good since vanilla, don't shit on some original content just because you're having a bad day.  I'd love to see how you'd make good with engineering at level 150.  
---
Are you joking, what makes these gold makers?  These are upgrade items that have proven time and again that the demand will be there.  Yes there are quest and dungeon equivalents.  Are you so naive as to think every single person will always have the best quest and dungeon rewards or are you used to getting handed everything in BFA.  Go back to your handouts and your daily freebies or w/e the game has devolved into.
---
&gt;Druids can tank everything in Classic.
---
Yeah, don't spread false information. It is literally impossible to tank Nefarian as a druid tank.
---
Yes that was a good one:)
---
And how much stamina? Neck, boots and hands are p2 btw
---
Maybe the reason I am in a financially stable position is because I'm careful with my money?  
---
Maybe I don't spend money without giving it a lot of thought and gathering information? 
---
And even if I wasn't, why the fuck is my financial status any of your business? God forbid poor people play a game once in a while, amirite?
---
Jesus I hate reddit sometimes.
---
So they're doing item progression ? Where did I miss that
---
If you are going to equip or use the item, roll need
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Yep it works but I've done minimum work on it so there are likely bugs (at the very least there are many frames referenced which don't exist in classic) - Please test on the stress test at the end of the month and I'll try and resolve (and supply to the add-on owner) before release.
---
It will be slow.
---
First they'll announce no plans for TBC or new content.
---
Then they'll announce no new character creation and you must login to your characters once a month or they get deleted (this is what they did to D2).
---
Then they'll announce realm mergers until there's just one or two per region.
---
Then they'll announce Classic's closing.
---
We're talking over a year in this timeline.
---
A lot of people seem to forget to mention that retail raids are balanced in regards to people using addons such as DBM (Deadly boss mod). Addons like that created a vicious circle that made raiding too easy so raid mechanics were added more and more to a point that I feel is ridiculous. I feel like retail would much more enjoyable if addons like this didn't exist and less mechanics, would take skill to actually look at where you're standing and your debuffs, etc...
---
This addon is coming to classic and people are going to run it and it will make everything even easier than supposed to. I feel like most of the player base are actually pretty bad and if they didn't have such addon they would actually struggle even with vanilla raids.
---
I feel like you shouldn't worry about loot from dungeons until you hit the mid 50s and start approaching pre raid items.  Everything else you will out level soon enough, and it's more of a hindrance to farm for the item than just leveling past the item.
---
Day1 content? What is that? Molten Core? Lol. MC can be completed with like 20 people did that in 2006
---
Thanks for all the feedback! I really like the idea of adding an RPG element to this as well as the tabard idea. Granted, we'll never see any of this in classic, but theorizing over this has been really fun. I keep trying to think of ways to make the community more tight and you came up with some really good ones.

I ran my Samson Q1U &amp; my current Blue Yeti with an old set of Klipsh 2.1 speakers, and if you set up the mic right, aka close by, your voice is much louder than the speakers. My brother went with a boom arm for his USB AT2020, but I went with a desktop stand &amp; shock mount for my mic to position the mic close by.
---
I still use push-to-talk though, albeit with a foot pedal (because I'm using too many keys already).

Huntards
---
Over half of their **overall** revenue. Of course it did, once you buy a copy of Overwatch, you own it. The only way they can make more money via that game is loot boxes.
---
WoW has a subscription fee. If you weigh that against what WoW specifically brings in via microtransactions the result will be drastically different.
---
I played on Mannoroth and participated in the war in Silithus (as much as you could anyway with all of the lag and the server crashing every 10 minutes), but I'm considering playing on a PvE server this time.  As epic as the world pvp was on that server, I'm not in college anymore and don't have all the time in the world.
---
The argument isn't about stamina, you just didn't believe it was possible. And yes some items are phase 2, but it's still pre-raid. A huge majority of players aren't even going to be 60 before Phase 2 launches.
---
And  Ashkandi too.
---
People claiming its going to be so easy but you know a lot of the pug raids will fail...
---
I remember being so defensive of people ragging on hunters for ninjaing shit since I never did.
---
Then I leveled a warrior on alliance. First Deadmines run this hunter causes us to wipe 3 times before taking the taskmaster axe from me. "Hunters can use axes, too, retard" before blocking me and leaving the group.
---
"Retail is already out" is not criticism of the idea though. It's a low effort way to make someone feel like their ideas are invalid. Obviously you're entitled to be condescending, but it's just unkind, immature, and not very nice. You're obviously too young or too reclusive to understand the concept of working together to create better ideas from initial brainstorms. And, that's sad to me. But, I'm not here to teach you how to become a productive adult, so have a great day.
---
If you target somebody and right click, you have the option to inspect. What would impress me is if while you're running around in the major towns or waiting for the zepplins/boats, inspect people that play your class and are somewhat close to you in level. Then look at the gear they have and look up where to get the good ones. Then tell your bf, I plan on getting x peices of gear from y dungeons in 2 levels. :)
---
&gt;The way you do anything is the way you do everything.
---
Of the myriad crocks of shit that this ridiculous parody of a community spouts, this truly has to be the dumbest I've seen. 
---
The simple fact that you folks are gearing up for "progression" raiding in a 15 year old game totally belies your bizarre cultivation of an elitist culture. You are nothing special, I promise. 
---
Trying to draw a correlation between how someone plays a game and their general value as a person in order to justify derision is borderline psychopathic I would say. 
---
I guess I shouldn't be surprised; mental illness is almost seen as a badge of honor among some of the folks in this community.
---
if they try to recycle TBC i will immediately quit, i am likely to quit either way because i doubt classic wow will evolve into anything competeable to pantheon
---
This is true, even more with the Alliance, I didn't have that in mind!
---
Can't wait for when the Brazilians do this on every NA server
---
Druid is probably one of the best pairings for Hunter because they're the only class with enough movement speed to keep up.
---
P servers for one will be dead lol so there’s your reason
---
No, I'm specifically talking about WoW's in-game net bookings.
---
If the pserver im on currently is any indication, it will be dead in less than 2 weeks. A month ago we were progressing in BWL, now we can only run ZG and AQ20. People arent logging in due to classic proximity. I predict the server will be dead dead come classic.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
It isn’t for one because the mind control would wear off before the cast would finish and secondly you only have pet controls while mind controlling. Just like how you can stop a bubble hearth if you have really good timing skills
---
With that logic theres no point for a need and greed system in the first place.
---
I guess thats my point, this only works if everybody goes along with it. Sure there are allways outliers, but out personal experience those are a whole lot more common on private servers then back in vanilla.
---
wow grats, beating MC after being stuck for years is a huge feat my guy.
---
Hot take: flying didn't ruin the game. Look at the percentage of people who complete the flying requirements in order to fly.
---
We're talking about 5-man dungeons, not raids.
---
The non existent one LOL
---
You likely won’t be grouped with the tank warrior, unless you are friends. In my experience, warriors tend to screen out gear competition.
---
I M A G I N E
---
TURN OFF ASPECT!!!
---
Higher horde populations on PvP servers and in general far more world pvp in the plaguelands by nature of the server.
---
Kill the pets first when ganking a hunter so they have to rez it.  Mind control or otherwise force them into aggroing a mob to last hit them so they take durability damage.  Force them off a cliff to die from fall damage (MC, distract, etc.).  Make sure to finish with drain soul for that sweet soul shard if you're a WL.  Just start RP walking away if your dots are going to finish them off, bonus points for doing a /wave.  As a hunter, feign death after a close win so they think they got you too with dots (pet has to be dead/dismissed already), wait for them to rez and gank them again since you'll be at full hp/mana.  Let your pet do all of the damage (WL / hunter) while you run around jumping and farting on them.  /sleep in the middle of combat or otherwise bind all your abilities to emotes (I use alt+ button to toggle emotes on abilities).   Take off your armor mid fight, get last hit with a level 300 unarmed skill punch to the dick.  Bubble / use CDs for no reason.  Change your demon pet out 3 or 4 times for no reason mid combat.
---
I don't mean to pick a fight, but even *that* guide says that the best case scenario for a feral tank is off-tanking.
---
The fury warrior needs bis until naxx items as much as the alchemist needs easy gold farming methods in my opinion. 
---
Same goes for the Druid tank who can buy two bis items for 1500g, the caster who can buy bis items etc etc
---
Not to you, but to some people it was
---
Day one, still playing. Waiting on Classic. Can not wait.
---
Oh yes, thank you Pbtwerkacct, I forgot to mention that those are quest items.  Pretty much every class will want one of those blues, they're pretty nice!  This gives the deadly blunderbuss a nice margin on the horde side.  (Bronze tubes are also used as quest items on Ally side which should increase margins for the tubes.)
---
The other items are main weapons for a hunter (very common class in vanilla). Rogues ands warriors also benefit from ranged weapons in order to pull mobs but hunters will be your main market.
---

It’s not quite that but almost, it’s more about charging your next shot during the cast time and not getting in the way of your next one. 
---
Essentially the same I hope I made myself understood
---
Druid can with entangling roots and wrath spam.  But it's slow for sure.
---
&gt; And if a trap gets resisted you can just put another one down.
---
For anybody reading, /u/YohnStamos meant you *can't* just put another trap down, since you can only trap while out of combat and they're on a 30 second cooldown.
---
I take the answer is no. Thanks.
---
I'll continue with the retail then.
---
I've seen sons of flame in some shit-tier private server pugs. Those same garbage pugs will exist in Classic. So there will be sons of flame. Uncommon? Yes, but they will be a thing.
---
Absolutely. Running a guild is a completely different story. It's like running a business and require a particular set of skills and more knowledge than your "workers".
---
Very little has to do with playing the game if you're in that position and a lot to do with managing people.
---
Probably because they are expected to heal in dungeons, and that can be a little tricky / unforgiving for new players not used to threat management, mana management, etc.
---
For some reason it has always been hardest to find a tank for 5 mans though.  The distribution we see for classic is very close to every private server ever, and at 60 the most sought role is tanks.  
---
It’s probably more to do with raids needing 2 tanks and 10-12 healers than anything.  But full fury warriors with decent gear can tank everything up to and including UBRS.  I think a lot less people like tanking than claim they do.  Or they powerlevel, get all there gear, and never touch a 5 man again.
---
There was one weird exodus where they offered free transfers from popular pve realm Hellscream to PvP realm Dalvengyr. I felt like that made two bad realms out of a good one.
---
Ap's value also depends on crit that's smth to remember.
---
Oops, yeah that's what I meant to put.
---
Could bring a gorilla along for AoE threat and just have him walk into multiple mobs. Might have to do mostly auto attacks to not pull aggro between the both of you for whichever pet.
---
Flag carrying
---
Local guilds are the best kind of guilds. As long as 40 people agree on raid time.
---
potentially also recruit a friend info
---
Have you played any Pservers, even lately?  The information is out there, just like it was before on forums and Thottbot, but people refuse to use or understand it.  People aren’t really any better at the game, I don’t care if some pserver guild named after a primate can speed clear MC.
---
My SFK group wiped like 7 times yesterday, because people didn’t get that wailing guardsmen have aoe silence and need to be kept away from the healer, group leader wouldn’t mark or give me leader to mark until like 3 wipes, mages had to be counseled on how to poly and did not figure out how to poly on the fly when adds happened.  
---
People are generally not much better than before, it’s going to be hilarious to see all the obsessive theory crafters in this sub experience what the actual game is like again.  They are already easily in tier 3 gear and the heroic MT of their guild already in their heads.
---
Thus the huntard was born
---
You’re an idiot. Thank you.
---
You've really got to get your anxiety in check.
---
Thats the definition of being a ninja.
---
But yeah i think we both got our points across
---
I must have really struck a nerve with what I said. Hilarious. If trying to do well in a videogame is psychopathic and worth of having a mental disease, having such a meltdown like yours after my reply is what exactly? 
---
Have some self-awareness please.
---
Priest are the best group PvP healer and one of the best 1v1 classes. Also the option to mix it up by playing shadow or shadow weaving.
---
Druid can tank most of MC. Since they can stack resist gear without losing too much threat and dont need as much defense or gear as a warrior. They are actually better tanks in pre bis than warriors and on some fights they are actually better. 
---
The problem is the druid itemization sucks in MC. No one wants tank leather gear so gearing a druid is super easy.
---
Okay, I haven't seen that before, got a source? All I've seen is the articles about Blizzard's overall annual revenue.
---
Regardless, if cash shop mounts are legitimately outperforming subscription fees, I think that's more indicative of a small group of whales that dramatically outspend a rapidly dwindling player base, rather than the whole player base being interested in the cash shop. I don't think it proves that the Classic fandom would be prone to the same behaviour.
---
the vanilla (classic) pservers will all be dead once classic is released.
---
unless you want to play on a server with less than 100 people online
---
Let's get down to reality first... the only realistic thing that blizzard might do with these legacy servers is create TBC and WOTLK servers... hopefully with a character transfer feature.
---
But for fun, let's say blizzard for some reason invests a ton of dev-work into a classic server. I would like to see a parallel raid progression to the current one with alternate gear sets and some sets that flesh out previously unrepresnted builds like prot pally, enh shammy, feral/balance druid.. etc.
---
I'd also like to see world PVP options built in to contested leveling zones as well. Clearly when developing the original world they made quest hubs that were meant to be PVP targets like maestra's post in ashenvale. It would be nice if these had actual capture points / benefits to holding them for the factions to encourage questers to take a break from the grind to secure some helpful xp buffs or something.
---
New zones would be interesting, but I don't think extremely necessary. These could be leveling zones or maybe max level zones with rep grinds for certain gear, but I worry about max level zones turning in to "daily quest" hubs.
---
I'm not a huge fan of healing, but I also know what vanilla raiding is like and if I'm not healing then I'm just spamming a 1 button rotation into the boss. Point is, I'm not too focused on the rotation part of raiding as I am about the overall progression and getting loot. Tanking 5mans has always been a favorite of mine.
---
This just reeks of someone who has very little experience with MMOs lol.
---
&gt;That's still requiring pet travel time and attention. That's not auto-anything. You have to divide some of your resources to suppress a shaman, as it's always been.
---
When a pet is sitting on the Shaman with a 1.0 attack speed (less with talents) it isn't a meaningful amount of "attention". If you had ever PvP'd in WoW you would know that "divide resources to suppress a Shaman" is not the intent of the design of the class. Killing a totem is no different than cleansing a debuff or purging a buff in the context of PvP. You do not divide your time "more" when facing a Shaman than you do any other class in the game.
---
And it is automated. That's why Decursive and Healbot are banned. Decursive automated using abilities like Remove Curse or Abolish Poison without the need to target the player. The addon would detect who had the debuff, give you a button to click, and the addon would automate targeting and casting of dispel... You know, the exact same thing the totemstomp macro does (automate your pet targeting and initiating the "attack" command).
---
&gt;I was under the impression that we were here to emulate it as accurately as possible.
---
We're going in circles and you are being obtuse on purpose. There comes a point where you have to remove the nostalgia and read into Dev intent. The Developers did not intend for the macro system to be used in a way to automate the game and that has *ALWAYS* been Blizzard's stance on their game, even going back to the original game. That is why we are getting the modern API system and not the 1.12 one that automated near everything.

---
Don't listen to the noobs. You will regret rolling a druid if tanking is what you really want to do.
---
Just out of interest, what is the core issue you have with some classes being able to roll for a large range of gear? There's no gaurentee they'll win the roll after all. Surely it's the jack of all trades aspect of those classes that enables them to roll on a large range of items
---
It's not a good idea overall, but my old guild druid tanked Nef once. Easy enough with a fear ward rotation. And some crazy healer focus during the cat phase of course.
---
It's because of how the back and shoulders curve.
---
&gt;I plan on rolling on a PvE server
---
No need for keybindings, then. You can just keep clicking. There’s no challenge left that requires quick actions/reactions.
---
Isn't improved aspect of the hawk way better than improved revive pet? I mean, how often are you gonna be reviving your pet?
---
No one disputes that warriors are superior tanks. You said feral tanks are “bad” which I think is objectively untrue. Ferals are arguably the best 5 man tanks and are clearly viable in end game content. I’m not trying to pick a fight either and we may be talking past each other, but I think conceding that warrior tanks are necessary / superior in end game content does not = feral is a bad tanking class. I agree that anyone who expects to seriously raid as feral is going to have an uphill battle to say the least.
---
Do you really think he doesn’t know that? What a bad question.
---
Love this, but for the BFA section you mean Anduin and not Varian correct?
---
”Okay, hit him with a pyroblast Kyle.”
---
“Casting.. there’s a 8 second cast time.”
---
“Aren’t you spec’d to reduce cast time?”
---
“No, ah. I’m a arcane fire mage.”
---
“Christ..”
---
It wasn't a shitty comment. I told him to get professional help with what sounded like a serious problem. Turns out, he already did
---
Oh shit, yes! Thanks!
---
Bad troll is bad.....
---
Argument is still the same.
---
And DPS
---
The full earnings calls aren't public, just the top sheets. But you can do some pretty good research into WoW's yearly revenue, expansion sales, and number of subscribers and reach a similar conclusion.
---
One WoW token a month is all it takes.
---
Well if you're poor you should probably play a cheaper (or free) game. There are plenty of options out there.
---
Cant get it to load on my phone. Shame. I had tested this already and knew you guys were testing it too. Wanted to see the results.
---
Patches in Duskwood!
---
Yes, this guide offers no insight and just repeats all the meme/incorrect information about warriors... but hey more bad warriors around the better I look.
---
You'd be surprised with how often you wish you had a quick revive mid-combat. Your pet isn't as invincible as it was back in WotLk or later.
---
You’re delusional if you think they’ll shut down classic servers.  You cut off the portion of players that are willing to pay for classic but not retail, and for what?  To save a few bucks on maintenance?  Classic IS retail.  It gets people paying again instead of playing on any number of private servers.
---
Noone believes your bullshit
---
Yup 6 more weeks until you are silenced forever when you realize how wrong you are.
---
&gt; At what point is it decided that a macro makes something too easy?
---
When it's something you automatically click on every single encounter. 
---
It would be like having a macro that autotargets anything with magic buffs and dispels them when you're in range. Shaman totems are so visible that a totemstomp macro is basically doing that for you.
---
Exactly. People love to throw out Patchwerk as the dream boss for bears, but it's not that realistic honestly. The bear is only superior if your warrior offtanks are so undergeared that they're getting one shot. Otherwise, combined armor and mitigation on the warriors will be way less healer intensive. Shield block ensures that.
---
I mean.. I've been in many guilds that used LC. I never felt like they were corrupt. Hell I used to run my own raiding guild and we took loot very seriously.
---
DKP has its own host of problems and is not a perfect system. It's a matter of picking your poison.
---
I believe you can only have 4 totems down at once, 1 per corresponding element. There will be a set that you pretty much always use and toss down others situationally such as tremor totem when you know a fear is coming and such.

---
Totally sweet guide.  Thank you for that work!  I'm doing it now!
---
Honestly this is nearly trolling - there is no way shutting down classic, while people are still paying and playing it, will bring more money to bliz.  Diablo2 you didn't have to pay 15/month.  Bliz knows people will just migrate back to priv srvs and they'll lose their revenue, and it would cost them nothing in development time at that point, just server upkeep [and they'd merge servers if pop declined too much].
---
This is a reddit first, but I think you might be the only one.  
---
Mind telling us what information you still need from Blizz?
---
Stats are all dependent on class-spec. And if you choose to divide your gear up because this piece of gear gives me +20 intellect, but this other piece gives me only +10 stamina, while all your other gear you put stamina on it, you are only going to cripple yourself. Because stats are exponentially better when stacked. 
---
Hunters have low dps output at end game, everyone knows this. But to make them lethal for pvp, you are wise to stack stamina. Thats why pvp gear has stamina as the primary stack. I played around on the insta lvl 60 pvp server, and i did a test, stacking my hunter with only crit %, and then switching to maximizing stamina. At all crit, id die fast and my damage wasnt that amazing. But with a lot of stamina, i think i went into 5k health with all blue gear. Granted, i also had the survivalist talent to give me 10% extra stamina. Needless to say, from my test, stamina geared hunter is significantly better than crit geared or agility. Because your pet doesnt stack with gear, and damage comes from your pet as well. So it would be wise to live long as possible to maximize your hunter's dps output (from both you and pet) which is better than hitting slightly harder.
---
On the other hand, an elemental shaman, you want to put every peice of gear with increased nature spell damage or increased spell damage. Nature damage increase tends to have higher number than increased spell damage because its handicapped to only one tree of spell type so its a way for that gear to compensate. Anyways, with the increased spell power, you are indefinitely better than any other stat increase because a crit will do significantly more from your talents. So that .3 dps becomes .6. You do not need to worry about the gear being cloth, leather or mail. I mix and match, because your shield will have majority of the armor on it, like 2000, while gear only gives you like 200 per piece. So in the end, having a shield is like having plate armor without a shield. No need to worry, a rogue wont be able to 1 shot you. SO STACK SPELL POWER. 
---
On enhancement shamans, the number one thing to do is stacking crit %. Theres a peice of gear everywhere that gives you +1% crit. Or +2% crit. The devilsaur set does. Is it effective to pvp like this? Yes and no, you are relying on getting a WF, because thatll do a lot of damage when its all crits. But because of lack of defense, you might die easy too.
---
Yeah I know right? People act like you can only play certain specs, what a load of bs. I'm playing druid (I think) and I'm speccing how I want to spec all the way through naxx. :) Should be no problems at all.
---
me 2, stay away with the expansion crap
---
Show me your evidence of that.  These servers are happening due to the success with old school runescape.  Blizzard have seen this and are following in their footsteps.
---
Just replying here but this is my most recent and slightly revised version. 
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/22/treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla
---
Your objection, here, makes no sense. Bears do more threat, all else being equal, and bosses aren't taunt-able after MC (and bears have two taunts for when they are), so Warriors are at the same risk of losing aggro and causing a wipe.
---
I mean, some community spirit, right? :/
---
You call that a cringe? I’ll show you how to unrealistically cringe!
---
I have one on a pserver wotlk, and yes, moving clearly keep the auto attack on wait, but as soon as I stop moving abilities and auto attacks go off without interfering with each other. No idea if this is a wotlk thing or just my server.
---
What class tho?
---
WoW peaked in wotlk.
---
Flag carry, AB defense, AV stealth cap or heal, great wpvp
---
Wut u talking bout m8?
---
Hunter shots basically have a hidden cast timer, so if you use them within 0.5 seconds of your auto-shot, it delays your auto-shot until after the ability.
---
No, private servers are going to be dead and impossible in a year or two due to the new copyright laws. If Blizzard shuts down Classic and you want to play WoW, your only option will be Retail. If 4 out of 10 people end up doing that, then shutting Classic down was worth it.
---
There are plenty of macros throughout every class that are clicked in every single encounter though.
---
eh? Thats so odd to me. There are literally dozens of games with better PVP, and PVE.. why do you play WoW if you dont like the lore?
---
I'm not as good as this guy lol.
---
Orc Rogue
---
No, it has nothing to do with maintenance costs and everything to do with revenue potential.
---
It did not, the subs were actually incredibly stagnant then.
---
It at the time (makes more now I believe) peaked compared to classic and TBC because of be addition of   Race changes etc.
---
Being a raid tank is extremely difficult no matter how many or few warriors there are in the game. You basically cannot be MT unless your guild is extremely casual (0-1 dedicated raid nights) or you are extremely dedicated.
---
Yup that's exactly part of what made the game such a huge success. Everyone was on a equal playing field, skill could get you a little bit ahead but not a lot. 
---
When they started introducing multiple difficulties is when they started losing raiders because if you can only complete the easy difficulty it doesn't give you any sense of accomplishment.
---
For the guys who can complete the hardest difficulties on the other hand the process become tedious and watered down having to do the whole thing over and over again.
---
There was something special about your whole guild slowly getting better gear week after week, being able to overcome hurdles you previously couldn't. When you finally stood face to face with the last boss after possibly months of progress it felt very special.
---
and now it finally happens?
---
?
---
For my taste totem stomp macros are just too close to kickbots. 
---
It's just not skill involved anymore. You just bind your totem stomp on mousewheel and keep wheeling up and down while doing everyhing else while pets just keep nuking them.
---
You'd have to give totems 500health if totemmacros were to stay.
---
I don't really think any guild in their right mind (even OP states in their post) that guilds will give priority for loot to a ret paladin.
---
Ultra try hard guilds will be filled with human sword/mace rogues/warriors, so any.
---
Come up with your ideal survivability set in Phase 1 and it's still possible to hit 400 sp.
---
Whoosh
---
Isn't druid tank gear the exact same gear that all of the rogues in your guild will want?
---
Speaking as somebody who raided almost all of Vanilla (joined my guild part way through MC), played a Druid, and tried bear, cat, and even balance.  In a guild that had good competition for server firsts, and had server firsts in late Naxx, BC, and Wrath ...
---
Balance sucks.  It sucks due to lack of tools and lack of mana management.  No life tap, no evo, no mana gems, no mage armor, no VE.  My time spent trying balance was in early-mid Blackwing Lair, and your mana pool just does not compare to a cloth caster.  Plus a terrible lack of gear, since you have to fight clothies to get spell power gear and much of the leather gear was mixed garbage.  
---
The 1.12 patch will be a better experience than I had, but Moonkin will struggle badly to match a Mage of lesser skill.  And there isn't much skill to be had, since you put up your dots and hold down the Starfall button.  The skill comes from correctly guessing which rank to use so you go OOM 1s after the boss dies.
---
You might have better performance in 5 man, as I have no idea how the burst compares.  Probably poorly, but I don't know for sure.
---
READ. EVERYTHING.
---
Yapp. Also crafting and 5 man heroics gave decent stuff. Not easy gear, but decent.
---
The text is just a summary, the whole video is showing their testing.
---
Honestly, i don't even care what people are typing here. I mean, the crazy stuff, not something with common sense like your's reply.
---
Assuming i won't kill myself before classic release, i want to play just for the sake of leveling, because it seems like fun than what it's on retail. I have no idea which class and spec i'll pick, probably not a shaman for sure.
---
I just want to feel my character as... your ordinary schmuck being thrown in the grinder of all the horrors of warcraft franchise. Pulled 2-3 mobs of your level? Good luck wining that one, because this is how it should be. I dropped the game during WoD because my BDK in Tanaan jungle with pre-raid items could just aggro half of mobs in my sight/path and 2-3 elite ones (these gronns) and do fine. Like wtf is that? And all that special treatment "You are teh hero/commander/captain/general/chose one/etc." made me feel sick, like when you ate too much of sweets, bleh. There there is the matter of the lore and story, there is no over-arching enemy of the expac, no cosmic powers at play, it's mostly personal stories and local ones.
---
As a side note - it's pre-TBC bullshit where devs thought it was such a cool idea to just kill my beloved TFT campaign's protagonists out of the blue, just because. Seriously, can't forgive them killing Kael'thas among other things, how cool it'll be to see his tension with Jaina through expacs and especially his interaction with Arthas in WotLK, but no. Fuck Lor'themar Theron he is boring and a nobody to me.
---
No reason for extensive binds on a ove server is what he's saying. You can literally just click everything.

Yes it will, Ret's pve dps is absolutely horrible.
---
Even if you disagree that Blizzard might close Classic in the far future, there's still no argument they would release TBC Classic and definitely no argument they would develop new content.
---
An ideal survivability set does not have 400 sp preraid.
---
What happened where?
---
I agree so much
---
We only give some competitive pieces to our boomkin. Like we wouldn't give Neltharion's Tear or Leggings of Polarity to a boomkin over a mage/warlock. Those classes can also usually use some pieces of tier gear so they pass on off-sets in those slots.
---
Or just equip it to bind it then switch back if that eases the minds of the group.
---
don't expect it, but it's possible.  they sure picked a suspicious time to decide RAF needed a rework
---
Sure it's great to do that.
---
I'm saying, no matter what, if he wants to *tank* he will do a lot better, with the same effort, as a Warrior. 
---
If he wants to do what Druids do, fine go Druid. 
---
If he wants to only 30% of what druids do, roll another class.
---
Just make a control point in the world that acts like an AB node, and the faction who gets the most points each ?day ?2-4 hrs then has access to rewards.
---
&gt;Skarm is a complete minmaxer
---
He's just the messenger. The message is that Druids can tank. And you don't need to be as good, or as much of a minmaxer, in order to do the job sufficiently.
---
&gt;Nothing compares.
---
A Druid tank has more armor, more health, and higher threat than an equally geared Warrior. There, I just compared.
---
I love bear tanks in 5 mans
---
Wrong sub you retail scum
---
Only if you're lazy.
---
Sure. Again, I didnt want to imply that these terms did not exist previously but rather that they were not present in gaming culture as a whole.
---
A little bit down the thread I also talked about having objectives like those towers in low level leveling zones as well for helpful buffs like 5% xp gain or something. So while questing you might be convinced to join that idiot yelling in general about taking back the keep for the Alliance/Horde.
---
Yea, big woosh. I explained the woosh in my comment so obviously it wooshed past me.
---
Where do you see reference to the old talent system for which you said that I didn't know what I was talking about?
---
This only talks about the level squish which I already said was entirely cosmetic.  I.e. you do the exact same thing you're doing now, but levels take twice as long because you have half of them.  Instead of 100-120 giving you no abilities it would be 50-60 and would take the same amount of play time.
---
&gt;wives and girlfriends
---
Funny joke
---
Visit the official forum and look for a blue post. If it doesn't exist then nobody knows.
---
Good point :)
---
Gonna have to disagree with you on the “have social skills part” seeing as how that’s one of the more obvious signs that someone falls on the spectrum.
---
So you're saying I should play Warlock?
---
People envy players that like to play hunter. YOu have fun and you hav easy time lvling, farming etc. SO dont listen and have fun.
---
Yes which is why it’s hard to justify gearing a feral (tank or dps) over the rogues.
---
This is a pretty decent guide explaining totems and how they are used and for what purposes.  Hope it helps.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkO9EOezu8o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkO9EOezu8o)
---
What a great argument. Show me the 400 sp preraid p1 with stamina.
---
He's specifically talking about the level squish in relation to "giving the player a reward every level". It is not purely cosmetic.
---
Nah, they're worthless.
---
Every character like this has thousands of them. The supply is insane compared to the niche demand.
---
That’s far more likely than classic ever shutting down.  It’s not even that big a deal though.  There will always be a RMT economy.  Tokens make it a lot more difficult for the Susan Expresses to operate since they have competition from legit players.
---
&gt; And you don't need to be as good, or as much of a minmaxer, in order to do the job sufficiently.
---
Yes, as a druid, you actually do need to do that.
---
Oh look another post complaining about streamers.
---
I played Poe on and off, I think I am above 4k hours on steam, as I payed for a month to get in the wow beta, I looked at my character playtime from a year and a half in vanilla and BC and I think I clocked above 100 days played.
---
Windfury is superior anyway
---
i use 
---
12345
---
qert
---
fg
---
v
---
for interupts, CC i use side and mid mouse button, also using mouse scoll up down
---
also alt modifiers
---
so thats like 30ish keybinds
---
also use macros for stopcasting/interupts if playing caster
---
Might be interested. Can you set up a discord to join with a permanent link?
---
Cool idea. It really does need a longer timespan like that. The dumbest thing about the EPL towers, and they repeated it again in TBC with the Hellfire towers, was how short-lived the buff was. Basically you would fight to get a buff....then you couldn't use the buff because if you didn't defend all bets were off. 
---
How much better would a world be where you had horde and alliance raids fighting to control the towers before running Nax since whoever capped all 4 would have access to the buff for the next few hours of their raiding.
---
Cute. I should say I'm not looking to *again*. I put my time in years ago, these days it's not as easy to dedicate time and commitment to.
---
&gt;Ok, i did all the work for the whole week during my monday and tuesday now i have to pretend i am doing something for the next three days.
---
Can't really do the mount collecting in classic unfortunately.
---
Do you make it a habit of summarily dismissing dissenting views when engaging in a debate of ideas?
---
I'm sure it's an easy way for you to come out of a disagreement feeling always the victor.
---
I played Classic, TBC, WotLK, WoD, Legion, and BfA.  I was in a top 20 world progression guild in Wildstar.  I've climbed ranked PvP in SWTOR, coming in #4 across an entire server after just two weeks with a class/spec that people thought was underpowered and underperforming.  I've set trends for talent builds and strats for battlegrounds/warzones alike.  I've participated in and founded guilds in MUDs and MMOs across 20 years.
---
That you would presume that my opinions aren't informed by experience says more about you than it does me, friend.
---
I’ll look into that, thank you!
---
Pretty much lol
---
According to this sub, many players here are going to be in a speedrunner guild with poopsocks, adderail, 2-hour daily polyphasic sleep cycles, and take vehement offense to other players holding them back with sub-optimal specs.
---
I'm not personally very worried about it though; later down the months, I'd even find it interesting if there were "challenge guilds" which do raids exclusively with black sheep specs.
---
Also, from analyzing Joana's videos, this is NOT consistent with classic as he had multiple items print the chat message on the same frame, which I never saw happen in videos from classic.
---
but part of BCs greatness was the additional abilities / talents, so a 'best' game should ideally have BC class design, rather than itemization to allow offspecs to compete.
---
That's hilarious, soling stuff is always fun. I fondly remember the short time MoP allowed warlocks to semi-tank, and also gave em a drain life talent making it super strong.
---
I used that to solo quite a lot of stuff, world bosses, older raids, you name it.
---
Shift + spacebar for mount you wont regret it.
---
Blink on mousewheel down (if your mouse can press it down)
---
Counterspell on V has always felt good.
---
Since I have my thumb resting around that area so your always ready to use it, if u have interrupt on example 1-6, its harder to use since you use the same fingers for strafing or moving forward, 
---
meaning instant cast spells is best left to your mouse or keys
---
u can click with your thumb.
---
Days? You probably minutes, and at most a few hours haha. I was 30 minutes off from server first 85 priest but I just had to stop and get a snack from the gas station.
---
As a healer main i love having a druid for tanking 5 man content, especially after they learn swipe
---
I think he sais so, yes.
---
That druid&lt;&gt;warrior on BG got me.
---
No disagreement. I'm expressing that priests don't have some things that other healers have, and that will sway some people. I played a priest in vanilla and liked it at the time, but don't enjoy that playstyle anymore.
---
The /sit macro thing won't work on official servers.
---
#3 is written a little wonky
---
&gt; Prehots placed by a healer on a player out of combat will start to accrue threat, WHEN that player enters combat under some placeholder name. IF the hot is still active when the healer enters combat, the threat is then transferred to the healer.
---
I think what it's saying is:
---
Prehots placed by a healer on a player who is not in combat will start to accrue threat once the player enters combat.  This threat is applied to a placeholder name, but if the hot is still active if/when the healer enters combat, the threat will transfer to the healer.
---
I think the case that is missed here is whether or not threat is transferred to the healer if the prehot has finished ticking before the healer enters combat.  
---
For example:
---
Priest cast renew on tank, neither are in combat yet.  Tank pulls, loses health, renew heals it, threat is generated but put on the placeholder name because the priest did not enter combat.  Renew continues generating threat, finishes ticking, *then* the priest wands the target and enters combat.  Does the threat on the placeholder name transfer to the priest? Or is it wiped as soon as renew is done ticking?
---
Good at ranged, not best. A shadow priest will likely mess up your day. And if you try range game with hunter it could get bad too if pet is pushing back your cast or they get aimed shot off or the shot that interrupts or drains mana. Thays why you'd wanna get in there dead zone. However, with damn melee leeway kind of hard to know where their weapon swing radius ends.
---
Warlocks can be an annoyance too depending on pet. Felhunter can basically silence a school of magic for 6 seconds and purge your damage shield. They are also demons so you can't sheep them to take them out of equation. So you'd have to do it to lock and kill pet and hope they don't break sheep. Then you're gonna have to decurse a lot and hope you have fear breaking abilities. Most locks in PvP I assume won't be using shadowbolt and using instant curses, fears, and channeled abilities so can't really counterspell them easily.
---
So while yes mages are great at ranged dps. Only if they play well and use all abilities to fullest. Even then, shadow priest gonna prob wreck your day.
---
many current servers announced shutdown, silverhand is going down in 42 days etc
---
Like I said, pick your best pre-raid stamina/survivability set and it's still possible to hit 400. Not my fault you aren't willing to use consumables.
---
Your argument is that my using 400 sp in the math was wrong because it's not possible to reach 400 sp before BWL. 
---
That was false. Then you said it doesn't matter because you can't reach it if you stack stamina for PVP. 
---
That was false. Now you're saying it's because you don't want to use consumables.
---
Oh well, no 400 spell power for you.
---
I never got much past Huhuran, and it was more of an alt.  Of the four elemental totems, you can choose one of each.  I had one of my bars (Shift+3) with all my totems I realistically used.  I would have three keybound for that fight (realistically, I think fire was the one I used the least).  I would drop windfury (I was not smart enough to do totem twisting), a water totem (mana spring usually, but poison cleanse was big for certain fights; mana spring had it's own keybind somewhere else), and the +strength one for earth usually.  These were all flexible since I had a row of the totems I needed.  If I needed earthbind or tremor totem, I would go to Shift+3 and switch it out.  for the fight.  Again, because I am not very smart, I knew which button was my earth, water, and air totem.  I had fire bound, but I just don't remember using it much in raids.  I could see that being bigger in later Naxx raids, which I did not do horde side.
---
Obviously, if you are in a melee group, windfury has to always be down.  If you have windfury down, it is equally as likely you will want a +str buff on melee.  You want to keep mana spring down at all times for your own regen with rare fire resist fights breaking that up.  If they don't have you in a melee group, you probably have situational fights where it is useful to have other totems (tremor totem).  In that case, it might just be better to have an extra priest than a bunch of shamans sitting around without totems down
---
This because I’m moving to LA from NYC around when classic comes out (and am also too lazy)
---
In vanilla in later servers warriors were super super common.  It was common knowledge how well warriors scaled in later patches.
---
Esfand is a Paladin.
---
A warrior that can't tank is no warrior at all.
---
Druid tanking was really fun for me. I played a DK tank for most of WOTLK and Cata, and when private severs were a thing I loved druid tanking. Now, the differences between private servers and classic will likely shift some of the meta, but I don't think enough to change viability.
---
Popping a HoT then dropping into bear form for a big pull keeps threat on you and allows your healer to finish taking a quicky-sippy. They have a single target taunt, which is a must have IMO for any sort of tank. Lacking a shield and the ability to proc weapon effects is kind of a downside, but I think this is a minor issue. My number one issue during early dungeons was lack of focused targeting from my dps, leading to a loss of threat on one mob or two, creating kind of a clusterfuck situation. I was always chasing some rogue or mage around (how many times had I said "RUN TO THE TANK" I cannot remember). This is completely on the dps though, I found that asking to wait until I get a swipe in or so before starting dps worked for all competent players. Not having to stance-dance was kind of nice, especially when you get the talents to keep rage on switching forms (Furor I believe). I had adopted a strategy on dangerous pulls of dropping out of bear, battle rezzing the healer, and then dropping back into bear with only like \~25% health loss?
---
The whole point of void is to sacrifice him. If the rogue tries to kill it the Warlock will just use Sac right before the void dies. Also there’s a real chance that sap will break way before the void is dead and then it’s game over for the rogue.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we see guilds with full Paladins or Druids trying to tackle content.  I know there was a full Druid guild on retail at one point.
---
I’m going to multibox level in dungeons personally.  I keep swapping around if the warrior should tank or make a Druid tank and have the Warrior DPS.  Bear tanking is super simple, so it will be much easier to tank with.  However, going all ranged DPS (Hunter, Lock, Mage) makes managing the ranged easier by a mile.  Either way, I want a warrior, so I won’t just drop Warrior for Druid; I’d drop Hunter.
---
I’m currently thinking that I have a hunter pet that “tanks” whatever has current kill priority while the warrior tab Cleaves/Sunders to keep aggro off healer.
---
That's cool.
---
"Now I will preface this with the fact that this is experience based on private servers, but having a druid off tank on Patchwerk was absolutely miserable compared to warriors from my perspective as our guild healing lead.
---
The druid had quite a bit more hp than the warrior tank did, but his armor was basically the same due to the warriors popping stoneskin pots and his avoidance was significantly worse.
---
The druid had a larger buffer when getting but by hateful strikes, but he the number of hatefuls he dodged, parried, or had miss was a lot lower. This meant that the total healing per second healers had to output him needed to be much higher. I couldn't understand why the fight felt so much more difficult than weeks previously until I broke down the attempts in SW Stats. I was blown away by how large the difference was, Patchwerk seemed like the perfect fight for a druid OT, they have huge HP and armor... But ultimately having the eat 10 to 15% higher number of hateful strikes made healing the druid far more stressful."
---
He sounds like he knows what hes talking about way more than you do.
---
Last day of beta we got some insane world pvp going on, we started at STV, after that we moved at Hillsbrad Foothills for the Classic South-Shore vs Tarren-Mill.
---
Yeah I bet on August 11, but could be before then...
---
Thats crazy I just had a raspberry vignette with lunch!
---
That's was Bubble, she was also the first level 200 and if I remember correctly eternal oblivion didn't pass until level 240-270.
---
Yes those mass sd bombs were annoying. They added a deny to making actions after logins to reduce that.
---
Tibia has walked the same road as most games though and becoming easier. I don't know if you remember but around 2005 a 200+ sorcerer getting 100k/h was amazing exp. It's pretty easy getting 800k-1000k/h below level 100 and real high levels is getting 6-10m/h. Also reducing the death penalty. I think it's a rule that you never lose more then 100% of a level.
---
Not a joke. Your significant other will impair your raiding time because it's such a long commitment.
---
Spacing shots was not an obvious mechanic, and since a hunter could level solo to the cap with autoshot + mend pet pretty effectively there were a LOT of hunters that were, frankly, absolutely terrible.
---
Plus certain pets were impossibly annoying to be near.  Like the plainstalker birds.  Every melee in the guild hated that hunter.
---
You’re saying 1 int provides the same dps as 4 spell damage for locks?
---
good bot
---
hell yeah panda day 1 master race
---
The instances are insanely more difficult.  The only time you wipe in current instances is when someone accidentally pulls a huge room.  People are going to be shocked when not only do you wipe more often just because you pull a single extra pat, but then you have to do a corpse run after.  Retail is so easy mode, it's just hilarious to see people sit around and talk about how easy classic is going to be.
---
Imgaine that...
---
i am actually older and own a home.  wife and kid...
---
i miss that basement though...
---
This is why you should open a dialogue with him. It’s very easy to make  arguments using generalities but it’s pointless and no one learns anything. Find out how we makes something work using something that doesn’t make sense to you and you might end up with a greater practical understanding of how to excel with the class. And then report back, because I could certainly use the help!
---
You can still FD + trap but yes, 30 second cool down
---
Lol no...
---
&gt; My guess is they push it back 2-3 months. 
---
Anyone can just randomly pull things out of the air I suppose.
---
Cross realm was a horrible choice in killing communities, lfg is even worse. Everything that reduce interaction between players is wrong in a MMORPG
---
Rebind it to ctrl mouse up/down. Dont use it that often. Max distance most time.
---
Around 4 spell yes, it varies with your stats.
---
Just wondering what information you want on a 15 year old game? 
---
Also what bugs and issues are you talking about?
---
Trying out nether. Its not bad. Definetly not well scripted for 1-60. I haven't seen a chest yet lol, but its an option. Most importantly its an option that exists now. I'm betting the laws aren't strong enough to attack an iteration that doesn't exist, hence TBC pserver
---
Having played on a ton of private servers myself, in addition to your character being completely at the mercy of the private server staying open, these private server staffs are often corrupt and extremely unprofessional to deal with.  I stopped playing on them the day Classic’s release date was announced and never plan on going back.
---
Hm... in my opinion this would only be relevant on world PvP - other than that, it'd be a waste of training points. But you're right, maybe I should include this aswell, so that people have some more choices regarding pets.
---
Once official classic servers are launched ,private servers will lose the justification for thier exsistence
---
Are there talents to reduce pyroblasts cast time?
---
also hunters pvp are probably the most annoying class to deail with when they get the jump on you.
---
Yep. Blast out your work, and then you are waiting for reviews or replies for the rest of the week.
---
Grab a Shure sm58 and be set.
---
Just do some general research and try to improve and be a good player. Don't just memorize one or two factoids to bring up. It will make you seem ingenuine if you just know a couple random trivia things but don't know basic general things.
---
Read this and change your mind: https://classicwow.live/guides/726/by-the-great-winds-i-come-classic-balance-druid-theorycraft-spreadsheet-v1-1
---
They are still inferior dps, but fine.
---
There's a lot of pictures of dogs here. Explains a lot about gameplay back in the day...
---
Also gotta love some of these super edgy horde players lmao
---
Doing a battle roar into the camera, rocking a fedora/eyeliner combo or just staring menacingly into your soul hahaha
---
Final shoutout to the kid with both alliance and horde logos. That kid has *alts* my dudes.
---
yea i hated resilience. splitting the gear like that was like splitting the community
---
Frostbolt for your mousewheel, literally the only
---
Spell you’ll use endgame
---
Yeah. Sounds like my aunt at family meetings, trying to stir up anxiety.
---
&gt;But I was wondering if we get to actually create characters on a server and if they will gain rested exp for 3 weeks until launch.
---
Why would they do that?????
---
You won't be able to log out at an inn so no - even when they let us create the characters we can't log in.
---
Even the Halloween event gave an epic - but not a freebie, as it was pretty hard. Burning crusade was the best, although I dislike the alien stuff with drained etc. Blood elves were dope.
---
Just drown your character and ress at spirit healer like normal people?
---
You have it backwards. 4 int = 1 spell damage.
---
Gocha, that makes sense. Maybe I'll try that. On my rogue, "Sap closest hostile target macro" is definitely one I was thinking would be great to spam on the mouse wheel, I'm sure there are others.
---
I asked about preraid PvP gear (aka has stamina) in phase 1. You come up with later gear, PvE gear and PvP gear just to prove your 400sp. You can also call r14 preraid and get full epics with BG exalted, AQ silithus quests and Naxx opening event quests. They are all "preraid". Whatever
---
What guild/faction/region?
---
After the normal rotation the mob should be dead anyways - that is for normal units, not elites. Aimed Shot costs a lot of mana and after the 2nd one you'd probably take aggro from your pet away, which may even make the encounters longer in the end, if you need to kite/melee.
---
IIRC the patch that added the Baron Run also increased the drop rate generally from something like 1/1000 to 1/100, but I could be misremembering. Either way, theoretically this feature shouldn't be added until the tier 0.5 phase.
---
Off-Tanking is more fun than main tanking anyway.  An off tank usually has to run around and pick up adds and actually move around.  The main tank just kind of stands there facing the boss and keeps hitting him to maintain aggro.  Maybe they'll pop a cooldown once in awhile.
---
I must be seriously lucky. I started farming MC solo when TBC came out (official WoW) and I got both bindings and the Eye of Sulfuras in what I think was only roughly 10 raids. 
---
Fast forward to WotLK, and I started farming BT with a few other randoms every week, reserving the warglaives. I saw 3 warglaives drop in about 8 attempts. The Left glaive dropped first, and then the next week dropped another Left. And then a few attempts later, the Right dropped for me. I even have the achievements to prove it.
---
Unfortunately, I really don't play that character anymore because retail is absolute Whack imo.
---
Started Christmas Day of 06. I was 9.
---
Day one of tbc? Or launch of Vanilla
---
Yeah it was much more reasonable to get geared in TBC without being too much work.  Don't have to gather up 39 other somewhat competent people to get some epics.
---
&gt;Give us a couple years in between and make those servers of the next xpac and let us carry our characters over if we want. I think it’s a cool idea.
---
You and about 50 other people. 
---
If they do other servers, make those that send characters over - permanently send them over.
---
You could hang outside in the sun all day tossing a ball around... or you could sit at your computer and do something that matters!
---
&gt; MCP is a special consumable they need to farm, but it's not that big a deal.
---
It's not a big deal!? It's a *huge* deal! 
---
The item has a 35% drop chance. You can only kill the boss 5 times pr. hour due to dungeon lock-outs. 
---
 In one dungeon lock-out there's still at 12% chance you didn't even see it drop once. Sources: [1](https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/13/drop-chance-probability/?guccounter=1), [2](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler), [3](http://tiny.cc/pgir9y)
---
You need *at least* 2 pr. boss *attempt*. If you raid 10 bosses pr. week (Onyxia and Molten Core). You need 20 Charges considering zero wipes. That means you need at least 7 Manual Crowd Pummelers if you have 0 wipes. *On average* it takes 20 Gnomeregan runs pr. week to get 7x Manual Crowd Pummelers - because of it's 35% drop chance. That's 4 dungeon lockouts pr. week which 4 hours. 
---
As more raids are released you're going to need more Manual Crowd Pummelers. 
---
Can we at least agree that that's a whole lot of Gnomeregan runs? 
---
When Blackwing Lair releases then that's *another* 8 bosses to kill on the weekly. 
---
At this point you have to ask what for? Just to be a worse version of what a Warrior tank does?
---
Following Joanas guide and I'll be level 60 in 140 hours tops. That's a bit more then 3 months for me. I'll have time to raid after that, no point burning out
---
oh thanks, will definitely take a look!
---
Time is free. Spend it as you like. But its much more valuable than money. Some people don't have either. That's when you're truly poor
---
This is also what I do, I also have an MMO mouse for numbers but usually only use 1-7 then shift variants
---
One thing to mention (directed @ OP) is that it will be very uncomfortable for a while , muscle memory has to develop for binds so give it time
---
The best thing you can do is not take the easy way out, hit every key properly (ie hit shift with your pinky, not ring finger, even if your pinky is really weak)
---
Sure thing man just hit me up when you can chat.
---
They want them to convert to retail after awhile? Oh yes, they want everyone to buy the newest expansion.
---
Do they plan to shut down servers in the next 3 years? Avoiding an entire bankrupt company, no way they'll shut down a server after working on it for months. At the very least they would merge servers first. Blizzard would not risk bad exposure like that, people would be more likely to play the next expansion and buy tokens if they like the company.
---
No you didn’t. You only mentioned PvP *after* I already said it was possible.
---
&gt; ~~Even Spirit and Healing Power for your petheal gear~~
---
Wait, is that not true? +healing power doesn't work on mend pet?
---
&gt;
---
Can anyone expand on what the advantage of resubbing would be?
---
... playing the game?
---
Have you looked at the idea of Spell Power Paladins - Support Ret Paladin's that have stronger healing via Spell Power ?
---
BTW great write-up that i will recommend peeps.
---
That's what I said, 1 int is around 4 spell.
---
Sent you a message.
---
Hmm that's pretty interesting.  
---
There is an aspect to this that isn't a clear tank/healer dynamic.  Say I'm pocket healing a mage, but don't want to aggro things to me (could be LoS, range, whatever reason).  In this scenario, I could PWS + renew prehot when my target is out of combat and never be on the threat table of their target.  In the mean time, I could pull another mob to kill myself and my dps friend would never be put on that mobs threat table.  
---
What if I prehot a tank in a dungeon, but then heal a dps when they are in combat.  Will the prehot threat then go to me since I'm now on the mobs aggro table?
---
That’s cool.
---
Except the entire tanking community disagrees. Druids are easier to heal on that fight than warriors.
---
We'd love you have you on board then! Send me your details if interested
---
You mad? Thats cool if you like to pay people to play video games, no judgement here. Not interested in playing a streamer server, more power to you if you are. Have you seen Twitch chat? Pure trash, no thanks.
---
They actually want 0 pieces of rogue loot in MC. I don't think they share a single item on BiS list until boots of the shadow flame off nef. 
---
Slotting a feral druid isn't even really a sacrifice. One of your warriors gets to keep on dpsing and you get another brez and 3% crit aura. This is only a downside if your healers are geared enough that they can heal the third tank ripping enemies to shreds in mostly dps gear.
---
Oh yeah fixed it.
---
&gt; They also get to choose a cute pet and everyone is super envious
---
For **sure**
---
they jelly
---
I loved flying around. I played on a PVE server so the WPVP is foreign to me. 
---
One time it really pissed me off. Running for a herb, I see this Dwarf pally dive bomb it from the sky, pick it and fly off.
---
a great example of why everyone should have engineering on their character :)
---
Sweeet. Will be setting up a discord this evening. In terms of faction, it appears most people are in favor of Horde. We will roll a PVP realm. We can definitely run a poll in terms of which exact server to join. Let me know if you want to move forward by messaging me your discord ID tag.
---
My comment was referring to crushing blows in dungeons. Raids is a whole different story. I was just pointing out that dungeon mobs that are level 60 will do fewer crushing blows than a level 63 raid mob and therefore 5man dungeons with a bear tank shouldn't be so intensive for healers.
---
It felt so good to finally craft Thunder on my master Hammersmith warrior for Arena. I'm going to have fun in battlegrounds and leveling and RP, but if too many people have insane gear in pvp I'm just going to focus on leveling up characters and professions and wait for BC with a bunch of 60s.
---
I'm assuming you meant online shops? There's no way someone is going to know where in all of Europe you happen to be for a local store...
---
There is tons on Amazon and Ebay, both of which have EU sites. Or honestly you could just google search.
---
Eh...it will get old without new content. If everyone is just running around in T3 there will be no real reason to login.
---
&gt;retail has a lot going for it that vanilla didnt have
---
What exactly? Grindfest where the only things which changes are things like - decorations/models of mobs/tilelists? 
---
Lore? It's systematically being killed since like TBC, each expac it's worse, which is suprising considering that during each one it seems like there is nothing can be done to kill it more.
---
Community? Apart from, probably, good raiding guilds it's non-existing.
---
Raiding? If only for achievements.
---
Idk about pvp, never bothered with it.
---
Seriously, what current wow has? I really want to hear.
---
All arena gear except weapons are replaced by entry level PvE gear, and there's even a rating requirement gating a good portion of it. That's hardly "destroying" progression, it barely makes a dent in the typical progression path.
---
Now I'd actually support further separation of PVE and PVP gear. Rogues being able to gain a huge arena advantage from wearing Warglaives and 4 piece T6 gear is pretty awful, so ideally there would be some sort of system that weakens such gear in arena relative to honor / arena point items. Could make that have some item budget cost making PVP items less viable in entry level raids.
---
But we're not going to have any big changes like that, much like poorly designed Vanilla classes and systems won't be fixed.
---
Vanilla wow is a much worse "museum piece" than TBC, on account of being a less fleshed out and polished game. Classic even has the nerfed version of every raid as well as buffed classes and talents of 1.12, so the OG progression path of vanilla is not going to preserved anyways. TBC at least didn't make as major changes to its systems over the lifetime of the expansion.
---
We're talking over a year or even two after Naxx, all the whole bombarding you with ads about Retail and offering character transfers from Classic to Retail with the purchase of the expansion.
---
Did you mean inept?
---
Im a bit late to the party, but just get the ModMic 5, its about 62 Euros and will sound great, just make sure you set the switch on the mic to Uni-Directional to reduce background noise. That is unless you want to get an XLR mic or something higher end, but that is not really needed unless you are a streamer or youtuber. The ModMic 5 will be more than enough. Save that extra money.
---
&gt;All that said, it’s looking like (1) tanking spots in raids will be excruciating to get and (2) there are going to be a lot of people sorely disappointed by social dynamics.
---
1 - If you aren't already in a guild as a tank... yeah finding a raid spot as a tank will be hard. Just like every other spot.
---
2 - how so? Just because there aren't enough slots to have 12 tanks... most people that are going warrior won't enjoy prot and will go fury or re-roll.
---
After about phase 3 releases there will be a massive warrior dropoff once they realize they won't be getting R14.
---
that was my bad, pepega moment. but i meant to say that hes been brought to the raid as healer but then reveals his true boomkin form after boss is down
---
Clearly if anyone is mad it’s you, OP. I couldn’t care less about streamers or what server they’re on.
---
1 minute cooldown on pservers, no experience with beta information on this topic.
---
Will the item help you level?  If yes then it's a justified Need.
---
If not and you're just needing for gold you're a dick and I wouldn't run with you again.
---
That sounds too simple.
---
This is a good comment. I play retail 'cause it's a good way to waste time, but I basically level in dungeons and/or do island expeditions at the cap (looking to get Expedition Leader title); it's not exactly the best thing ever, but it's the way I enjoy the game right now.
---
I definitely think it's overwhelming though--while being underwhelming at a closer look. It's like there's too much to do, and none of what you do matters/feels good, but it also feels like it needs to be done. I probably won't drop retail for Classic completely but...I'm looking forward to some social interaction that matters.
---
There are "active/combat" totems you want hotkeyed for pvp or normal play, and there are "passive/niche/utility" totems that only get used in specific pve fights or situations.
---
After identifying the ones you spam most, it doesn't become nearly as a bad as people say it is.
---
Us your best "hotkey" realestate for things like grounding, tremor, searing, fire nova, psn cleansing, earthbind, etc.  Leave the lesser used ones off to the side for when needed.
---
There are a few I like to leave "in the middle" such as fire/forst res,  windfury totem, stoneclaw etc. that do see general use, but aren't critical on their timing to place down.
---
Aftering trying this out right now, straffing with a right click seems almost more natural than the regular keyboard way. Wow thanks for that tip. I wonder how well one can get the technique down?
---
I do not see them for any reason delaying it after having had the date posted and publicized as they have had it. Yes we would like more info on servers, but we will probably just login on the 13th to create characters and find out then, maybe a day or two before.   
---
Developers are not obligated to inform you on the progress on every bug and issue they are working on. We are 40 days out and " We've heard practically NOTHING" - What else is there that needs to be heard really?
---
Theres a sticky post in the sub that has links to tons of builds and guides for each class and spec.
---
Indeed. Most fun in wow I’ve ever had.
---
cya on classic
---
they'll easily beat it
---
Only here? they are also hated in every iteration of wow lol. They often are hated from pulling unnecessary things, pet going crazy with the path pulling every mob and its mother, the damn barrage talent that pulls everything and their mother, etc
---
Well I knew the answer so that actually makes sense.
---
Yeah, it could be. But if it's for the random totems that are used in niche PvP situations, it might be alright.
---
Private servers usually start to tank right after AQ comes out as well. The gear gap between people who don’t raid and people who do raid gets huge.
---
Fuck streamers, they can have a huge impact on a server.
---
There are pve servers you know
---
I’ll be the warlock stuck at level 18 because I suck at the game
---
Simple solutions that cut directly to the cause of the problem are best.
---
I still have bitter memories of hunters taking gear I was after on my rogue and warrior. A hunter got out guild's first Ashkhandi. They always did bad dps and wiped groups due to pet pathing.
---
Good ones were pretty handy to have along but there were so few of them compared to the bad ones.
---
Someone’s bitter
---
You say this is covered to death, and then you go and repeat the misconception that Druids aren't suitable tanks for raids. Please stop that.
---
Tier peices and a 2hander are basically free. Most pallies won't even want T1 because it's not on any BiS lists since it's outclassed in pve.  Warriors might get some prio on 2handers super early on but after that no1 gives a shit about them and it'a open roll for pvp outside of certain weapons that are objectively better for other classes.
---
If you pvp regularly the Rank 10 set will hold you over very nicely for spell damage while finishing T2 which can take awhile since everyone wants it; perhaps consider bribing other pallys for it.
---
You could also just not raid weekly with a guild. The gear isn't necessary to pvp effectively early on. Most people prolly won't take pvp seriously until phase 3 anyway. If all you care about is simply getting the gear then why spend countless hours farming consumes and developing good relations? You'll save lots of gold by not needing raid prep and lots of time by not needing to run more dungeons than necessary, helping guildies with god knows what, ect. Use that time to farm even more gold.
---
Just wear lightforge and the nicker for awhile while stockpiling gold that you can eventually blow on guilds who sell carrys. Carrys where you can show up in any pvp spec and your performance doesn't matter.
---
It’s a load of bullshit
---
It’s possible, those are top dps classes and there’s much more competition for gear. Although, there are other ways of getting epics like from professions or if you’re lucky world drops.
---
This depends entirely on the looting system the guild you are going to be raiding with uses. I certainly went months without getting any gear upgrades, but it was because I was saving DKP for a major item purchase.
---
Yes. That way you can learn the basics.
---
People are straight up wrong when they say you can't main rank as a druid. Watch this long, but extremely informative YouTube video all about feral tanking: https://youtu.be/oyWQlXtkuJ0
---
I don’t think you’ll be pugging naxx or aq40. Even though they’re not very hard, commanding 40 random people around isn’t easy.
---
It does, just at a lower rate than you lose it. So out of combat you lose 2 rage a tick instead of 3.
---
got'em
---
I totally agree. After playing since near the beginning of vanilla, I slowly realized that TBC had killed everything that WoW was for me. Don't get me wrong, I really liked outlands at the beginning, but once the "new" allure began to wear off I came to notice how much the community had been fractured, and the original WoW regions would never feel the same.
---
Can't expect everything to be perfect
---
Uhmmm.... no?
---
You mean you didn't just reserve a copy and then show up to pick it up?
---
Hated?  I'm pretty sure the only thing said about hunters is that their DPS is sub-par compared to other classes.  They still have tranq shot and are needed for fights in BWL to kite.  If you're asking about hunters, then you're going to be in a more casual guild and will probably be in the top 10 DPS because the rest of them can't be bothered to do anything.
---
depends how in you are with the guild and if ur guild does loot council or something.  if ur mage #10, might as well find a new guild.
---

---
It sounds fun as heck to me! Druid can come in clutch with a heal too, if you end up needing it/overpull/feign death doesn't work (as it often didn't, iirc).
---
Splitting the gear is definitely useful, warriors and druids only share trinkets and because of the way druid tanking stats work, even there they don't really share anything because of the significant value of dodge and armour for druids. For instance the BiS feral trinkets are [Mark of Tyranny](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13966), [Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811), [AV trinket](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17904) and maybe [DFT](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19406). The rings are where warriors usually wear TPS gear like [Accuria](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17063) and [Quickstrike Ring](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18821), here the feral will use armour rings as well because they don't really need the TPS. Also, druids can't use Thunderfury or shields heh. 
---
Ferals do get many good pieces from PvP though. Especially the [AB shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20059) are extremely powerful as are the [WSG pants](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22749). [R13 head](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16451) is also very powerful and [R12 gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16448).
---
Next? We play for 2 years, and the 80% of the playerbase moves on within the first year.
---
Classic isn't intended to replace BFA, they will still have patches and expansions in that.
---
I want to be able to log into my classic level 60 character 7 years from now.
---
Whether that means they start fresh servers after a certain amount of time or just let people that want something that's NOT classic - just transfer to a different server, that's what they should do...
---
Oooo buddy you said alot of words in an order that I really like! This is my ideal world. Shit imagin being able to raid any expansion you wanted anytime!
---
I was 12 in tbc when I started,
---
Like 7 is when I first played
---
Depends on how many bosses your guild can kill, but 4 months seems very unrealistic unless your guild only kills a single boss each week.
---
Do you want huge pvp events on your server?
---
6, sitting on my dad’s lap hurling shadowbolts at troggs.
---
What a long strange trip it’s been...
---
Instant /gkick
---
Still, a couple years of playable, officially supported Classic, with *correct* spells and data values, high-quality scripting and secure servers that aren't subject to suddenly and irrevocably going offline forever, followed by a downward spiral of the end-of-life events like you've described here, is still better than playing some skeezy pirate server for a short while with far fewer people, more bugs, and missing or incorrect content. :P
---
It’s a bit of a stretch, but it of course depends on the progress of the raid. 
---
Each boss drops 3 epics, so if you’re full clearing MC each week, about half the raid should get a new piece. But if you’re not full clearing (i.e during progression), you’re looking at fewer than that.
---
I think just your server.  I don't think they changed the autoshot timer until Cata when they changed other hunter mechanics.
---
Rogues distract and blind.
---
It used to be so, long time ago. Few raids, lots of people to gear up and dkp really slowed down epic looting, tier 0.5 used to be the welcome barrier to enter MC.
---
Druids are great in 5 mans, and they're useful in 40 mans as off-tanks. They're not optimal as MT in raids but they can still work on most bosses, especially in speedruns.
---
The more I think about it, the more I want classic to essentially be a living wow museum.
---
I think you missed the point. Based on the emotionality of your unnecessarily hostile reply it’s easy to see why. 
---
What I was looking for was a guide on how to make money with engineering. What I got was a guide to leveling engineering to 150 and a short list of craftables, but without context or any suggestions as to why a deadly blunderbus, for example, is a gold maker. Consider, you presented this as a guide. Guides are most helpful to people looking to learn and are often inexperienced on a subject. 
---
On that front this failed for me and I felt like I would be better off just looking at classic dB and making my own guide, which is disappointing. This just felt like click bait.
---
Aside from the above, the commenter in this thread (I’m sorry I don’t recall the username) seemed to present a few very practical uses for making gold through engineering that felt like HE/SHE should have written a guide to help YOU out. 
---
Also, your comments here make you seem like this subject is new to you, or that you haven’t really given the subject much thought. This makes you seem like you aren’t an expert on the subject and undermines the credibility of your guides, 
---
I hope this helps to put things in perspective and that you’ll see something constructive in this criticism. I’m not trying to crap on you. I think your content in its current form is pretty weak and could use a lot more effort especially if you’re asking for clicks.
---

The theme music is just replaced by J Allen Brack's voice on loop, "You think you do, but you don't."

Just wanted to point out that HoTing yourself has the added benefit of an additional 0.5 threat per point of healing you do to yourself.
---
Gl with your no druid premade WG
---
Thanks! I'll make sure to update my bookmark when I get home.
---
I agree, 1-30 is a massive slog, but once you get 30 and get SS(I opt for 35 because I need my 5% crit) you're killing speed increases to just below hunter levels as you kill two mobs faster than any other class. The only problem is you'll have to eat after every pull. But there is where duo leveling with a healer rockets you into surpassing most others.
---
&gt;  HoTs don't generate threat for the healer until he enters combat himself.
---
... on the same target of the prehot target.  You can still go into combat on a target that is not in combat with your prehot target, and you still won't get any of that prehot threat.  That's kind of a neat detail when out questing with a friend but not wanting to have mobs running around between people.
---
I would wager you need an asterisk next to fury warriors being significantly better damage dealing tanks in dungeons to say: well geared fury warriors. Druids are far less gear dependent than warriors, and thus will likely be the preferred dungeon tank for much of your leveling experience. How much that matters depends on how quickly you plan to get to 60.
---
Or when they quit leveling and make a hunter because they died 20 times at level 12.
---
If you don’t have time to raid then you definitely won’t have time to rank up. Even the blue set requires multiple weeks of playing every single day. 
---
I don’t see why you can’t raid though. Raiding is max 8 hours a week. While ranking up in pvp can easily be 8 hours a day.
---
Positives:
---
1) Better (any?) anti-cheat and anti-bot measures.
---
2) No fear of servers being shut down randomly.
---
3) No worry that GMs are abusing their power to help friends or make money on the side.
---
4) The most accurate recreation of Vanilla game mechanics possible.
---
5) More stable and consistent servers.
---
6) A modern client that's guaranteed to keep working on future OS versions and without possible security risks associated with running networked software that hasn't been updated in 13 years, and will continue to get security patches for any new potential threats.
---
7) Blizzard has some of the best customer service (they're not perfect, but they're generally really good) and good account recovery and other features associated with handling online accounts.
---
8) Battle.net integration, which includes built in voice chat.
---
Negatives:
---
1) Costs money.
---
2) Many people who have played on private for a long time are used to the quirks and inaccuracies more than they're used to accuracy (see: leeway and spell batching arguments) and actually prefer the inaccurate way.
---
3) Some private server customizations are things players actually like (faster XP, seasonal servers (Blizz might do this post Naxx, but haven't committed to it yet), removing world buffs from current raid content, higher player caps, spawn rates based on those higher caps, differences in loot drop rates (e.g. greens in chests)).
---
4) Old macro/addon API allows for a lot of things doable in Vanilla that won't be possible in Classic (Decursive, Emergency Monitor-style healing addons, rotation bots).
---
If an item was/is available from the start of Vanilla but got updated during some time, it will be in the lastest "1.12" state.
---
If an item was added part way through Vanilla's lifespan, that item will also be in its final 1.12 state **but only available during the time/phase it was added**.
---
I.e. there are very strong leather shoulders from BRD arena that were in the game from day 1 that got updated during 1.10 patch to very strong blue spell caster shoulders.  Those shoulders will be in the game from the start but in their latest 1.10 version.
---
Items that do no exist until a certain content release patch (or for simplicity a phase in Classic Wow) during vanilla will not exist until that patch content is released.
---
So with that logic, Cenarion Herb Bags will not be available until Phase 5/6
---
If you put enough effort into it EVERY specc is somewhat viable. Player &gt; Class in Vanilla. I'd rather have a active Ret-Pally who knows what he is doing than a semi-active newbie Mage.
---
Then a team of mages show up to your door irl and spec shame you.
---
Is the project on github? If you're looking for contributors, I might be interested.
---
They may not share the same BiS, but lets be real, most players are never going to achieve BiS across all of their gear, even in high end raiding guilds. Also, a lot of guilds are going to force people to take upgrades whether they're BiS or not.  You can't wait around in blues forever waiting for the perfect item to drop or you'll be too undergeared to keep raiding with your guild.
---
Just to be clear, I am not at all against bringing a Druid tank to the raid.  In fact, my Vanilla guild had a feral tank that, if I remember correctly, always had a sizeable amount of extra health over our most geared warrior tank.  However, I also remember our druid tank having to wait for gear sometimes because the rogues would get priority.  It wasn't a huge issue, but I mainly posted because the person I originally commented on was saying how it was easier to gear up a druid tank because they don't share loot with your warrior tanks, but they failed to mention that they did have to share some loot with rogues.
---
Communicate expectations and be a good group member.  There's not a ton of blue drops so if you're needing on multiple items across multiple specs over other group members you're going to come across as greedy.
---
A good practice is not to take more than 1 blue item if others can use them in a single run.  There's no requirement or rule that you do this but people will appreciate your consideration.  The runs can also go quick and if the drops are worthwhile, offer to run again or farm certain bosses if there are key drops like corpsemaker folks are after.
---
For me, I’m going to roll warrior and plan to tank. However I mainly plan to tank 5 mans and OT in raid. I’ll probably be Fury once I get a little gear so I can do more DPS when I’m not needed to taunt. I imagine I’m not alone. 
---
Also, Keep in mind that we are the self selected hardcore bunch. The majority of future Classic players haven’t sniffed this sub or classic forums etc. I think that many folks who are more hardcore and doing more preparation ahead of time are angling to be tanks. I bet the mass of rogues and hunters will come when it launches.
---
It's playing wow
---
Thanks!
---
Well, Whaaz has his cloak of shadows on shift U.
---
paladins only have 30 pts worth taking.  Resto shaman can spend 39-46 pts.
---
Yeah I purposely remember this being in pre-wotlk because it was the ONLY defining factor of a good hunter... stopping the steady shot spam for .5 seconds to allow your autoshot to shoot whenever your autoshot timer was up. I believe because this was the primary playstyle of hunters pre-wotlk, blizzard decided they did not like this and allowed autoshots to shoot through hunter skill casts in Wotlk.
---
Don't turn 'can tank everything' into 'are ideal to tank everything' in order for you to make a contrarian point.
---
If your wiping in MC it ain’t because of the boomkins.
---
I always thought it would be appropriate to "shard" the servers into two or three versions (ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN):
---
*One server is a copy-pasta of the original (think PTR) where we can continue our characters onward into TBC. Only change I'd make to TBC would be flight speed. 60% and 100%. Don't make flying strictly better than running. Only make it a necessity to getting to certain areas by yourself (remember locks and summoning stones can be used for those without flying). 
---
*Second server is classic as it was, classic as it shall forever be. No more progression, its at the end of 1.12 its a "museum" of sorts that players can still play through, no new content, no changes.
---
*Third [potential] server is a vanilla season server. Think D3, how it is now. Yes D3 gets "new" content but I think it could work for WoW. Basically it would be a no changes patch 1.12 "season" server where players progress as far as possible in whatever time span (throwing out 5 months), and at the end, your seasonal characters get that 30 days grace period to either be "curated" into the "Museum" server or theyre deleted, gone forever.
---
empty sack, no slack
---
I don't know for use because I can't find anything about moonkin form in the patch notes. All I can find is this:  
---
* Due to significant talent changes, talent points for Druids have  been refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent  spell/ability replacements have been significantly reduced.
---
* 📷 \[Hurricane\]  - No longer a talent. Now available to all Druids at level 40. Damage  and Mana cost increased on all ranks. Spell is now cast on a targeted  area up to 30 yards away and affected by 📷 \[Nature's Reach\]. Multiple Druids casting Hurricane will no longer stack the slowdown effect. Radius of effect decreased slightly. 
---
From patch 1.8, but it doesn't actually mention moonkin form, but I think that's where it was introduced.
---
Innervate was made baseline in 1.11 though so throughout AQ40 and the T0,5 patch moonkins didn't have innervate.
---
Yea well look [look at this dude lmao](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccw6dd/recommended_food_and_sleep_plans/etpucw1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Considering that the dungeons are infinitely scaling and around 1% (if that) of the playerbase can clear mythic raids im gonna have to disagree there. If you do lfr and lfg, sure.
---
Wow native action bars dont have enough slots so you’ll need a custom bar add on or macro with modifiers. Just to ballpark it
---
PULL THE BOSS BEFORE I PISS MYSELF
---
that’s where i’m at. sleepy panda or fire-breathing diablo?
---
I totally agree that Classic will be great and successful, I just don't agree with people that its availability is immortal.
---
All of that is true with priests though and priests are much squishier on top of it.
---
I agree that Shaman, Warrior, and Druid are all poor first time classes. Not sure I agree with paladins though.
---
Lazy Peons in Durotar ;)
---
Assuming they fixed it, Diablo is a minion and not a follower. He is also full bright which makes him stand out in the mostly dark dungeons.  He also has a cool fire breathing animation.
---
Panda sleeps though which is cute.
---
Zerg has nothing special, but he looks similar enough to a felhunter if you are a warlock.
---
I know there were always contemporary server emulators, but they never became popular in the way they are now until about 10 years ago, and the more accurate ones were always at least one expansion behind. Being able to walk through the world and fight monsters that have zero spells, and half your class skills not working correctly is not what most people would call "playable".
---
I submitted a picture for that mosaic, but I submitted too late. I felt really bad and completely forgot it existed until now.
---
Absolutely you have a great perspective of old mmo's and what made them attractive in the first place and what skill focused gameplay can do to a game that wasn't based on that in the first place.
---
True, I'd be content with a Vanilla+ if it could capture a lot of the good of BC, but I doubt they can re-create that.

Our plans for Classic WoW include being top guild on our server while still providing an atmosphere that also welcomes more casual players. We intend to have two 40 player raid groups totaling 80 hardcore raider slots. We have a ranking system that provides raid slot and loot priority to those that align with the hardcore play style and plan to show up to MOST raids. For more information, please review a detailed breakdown on our website: https://www.oranthul.com/home/m/49064920/article/4842852
---
Our core members are extremely knowledgeable of all Classic WoW content and provide an environment where you can learn your class, ask questions and improve your skill set. We have cleared all content in Classic WoW including all world bosses and 15/15 Naxx. Furthermore, we have achieved world-best standing in past MMOs, most notably ArcheAge.

---
Yeah I tried it again last year. There's now a bit of Pay to Win where you can essentially buy mana pots and stuff. I got a sorc to lvl 100 pretty quickly. Got boring real fast when it's that easy and the sense of danger is reduced so much.
---
Well being meticulous like that doesn't make it hard but it gives the illusion of it being hard. Wich in rpg's is actually a good thing.
---
No it isn't, unless you are pugging every raid or something.
---
shhh don't tell them
---
No
---
I remember him, but the only instance he wanted to tank was BRD.  Inevitably he'd give up on tanking after two wipes and the fury warrior would take over, but sham still insisted on reserving ironfoe and hand of justice, for his tank threat of course. 
---
So you'd say well then you won't mind the warrior tank rolling on those items too, seeing that he tanks, and sham would say 'but I'm the one who made the group so I should get it!'.
---
Assuming you have prebis then no
---
And something being very time consuming and requiring meticulousness can be defined as being "hard".
---
brez?
---
4 months is overblown, but it can still take quite a long time. Only a handful of epics drop from a bosses and it'll be split up between 40 people. Realistically if loot is your primary concern, play Warlock (Alliance) or Druid. They are very underrepresented in raids. The only one that might beat you to a full tier set will be the main tank.
---
I believe from talking to Melderon about it that it's tied to the mob so even though your heal is on the tank the mob is reading "someone" healed the tank. Until you get into combat you aren't that someone but once you are in combat with the mob, the mob will put 2 and 2 together as long as the hot is still ticking. Now if you prehot a tank who attacks mob one and then heal a mage who is attacking mob 2 and they aren't linked or anything then I think the tank's mob won't see you. But that would require some verification, especially in a dungeon setting.
---
This is a game changer. Can't believe I went ~14 years without even coming across that. Thanks dude.
---
I moved to LA a little over a year ago from Boston...am still too lazy for this. LA is too big.

I had just turned 29 when WoW was released. When I finally started getting into PvP ladder ranking I would let my 5 year old son run me around in AV (admittedly sometimes I wouldn't let him play his own character. I need honor kid!) He's 19 now and a big time gamer. I created a monster.
---
Yeah I'm not trying to be on a twitch server where everything is "Kappa" and "OMEGALUL" shit is so cringey
---
Then go ahead and list all the items that no one pre-bis player in the raid will use.
---
MY GRANDPA WOULDN'T OF DIED IN THE THIRD WAR IF A HUNTER HADN'T OF NEEDED ON A STAFF OF JORDAN FROM HIM!
---
How is Canada? I'd also like to move to Canada. Too many people and not enough nature here :(
---
Yeah "Pom Pyro", or "Three Minute Mage". Where you would blow your load all at once and then recharge for 3 minutes.
---
Agreed. Classes that I would consider good or bad for beginners is based more on the difficulty of the class mechanically as well as how forgiving the class is if you make mistakes.
---
I think Hunter actually is a really tough class mechanically for new players. Dead zone can be frustrating, same with pet micro. It's also a class that has lots of tools that can minimize those mistakes. 
---
Warrior, druid and shaman are all classes that are mechanically difficult, be it warriors needing to stance dance, druids with form shifting and shamans with totems.
---
I think Mage is the best beginner class. It obviously has a high skill ceiling, but is pretty simple to get the basics down as frost and has a lot of ways to avoid death should you need to.
---
I have over 70 keybinds put to muscle memory. They easily are filled when playing a shaman if including popular consumable as well. Also, mmo mice were invented for a reason.
---
The problem with mining isn’t copper it’s silver and getting from 115 to 120 because tin will be green and you can’t mine iron until 120 it happens again between mythil and thorium but it isn’t so bad because mythil will still be yellow.
---
Ayy, mines empty so I don't have to be tempted!
---
It was done by standing as close to the target as possible (before they started to move to adjust to your placement) and then stepping through them while pressing backstab keybind. It was easier to do if you bound backstab to mouse wheel up or down so that as you stepped through you could roll the wheel and it would attempt to stab so many times per second that when you got into the sweet spot it would activate.
---
I also think that it was a private server thing.
---
It was a thing as early as 1995 (probably earlier but that's when I really became a part of it via Doom and later Quake). Not in the same way it is now, obviously. It was mostly an online culture, in IRC, BBSes, ICQ, AOL chat rooms, newsgroups, static forums, etc.
---
Again, very niche, a lot of overlap with other hobbyist stuff online like MtG, D&amp;D, hacking, general computer hobbyist stuff.
---
Anyway, I'm not trying to disagree with you generally, just expanding a little on specifics.
---
Kinda boring if everyone has the same professions
---
Yeah that's definitely true.  Farming silver sucks.
---
You will get spell batching and melee leeway on classic. 400ms lag on every action and NPCs hitting you 10yards away from you is
---
This is a great meme, but I wish they'd actually make a Shaman tank spec, similar to what they did with Druids.  I'd play a mail wearing tank class, but I play every tank class, so meh.
---
&gt;Fury/Prot is a Thing and it is very strong I saw Skarms Videos
---
Yeah, it's a thing on private servers.
---
Won't be in Classic, because, well, we all know why.
---
&gt; Realistically if loot is your primary concern, play Warlock (Alliance) or Druid.
---
This is literally my plan.  Although, concerning Druid, I've read some interesting takes on gear acquisition.  I've heard arguments on both side of the "Druid is an easy class to gear in raids" discussion.  On one side, Druids are more rare in raids, so less competition.  To counter that however, Druid has 3 specs, and it's likely whoever is Resto might like to play solo as Feral or something - so their shopping for a TON of gear.  What's your opinion of Druid gearing in raids, first, gearing for your healing spec, and second, your opinion on how difficult it would be to also gear an offspec?
---
What are the best peeling classes?
---
God the aq40 sets are ugly.
---
Sadly I had to laugh since I made a shammy tank but only got up to sunken temple, did it just fine but was having too much trouble with multiple mobs.
---
Okay THIS is epic 😂😂😂😂😩😩🤙🤙🤙🔥🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👌💯💯💯💯
---
Source? All of the Druid and Theorycraft discord's testing seemed to indicate that the damage loss is negligible or nonexistent as you reach level 60. Only lower level damage was overtuned.
---
On top of this, in classic it should be easier to lower the boss' armour rating down to 0.
---
If someone does this for SF / Bay Area, my wife and I are looking for a guild.
---
I did include z x and c in my "stretch" they are close, but a bit awkward to press as they're under your hand when moving, z and x specifically.
---
But yeah, they'd definitely be options if I need them to be.
---
But like...I didn’t. You did. In the post you wrote. I think you’re confused.
---
The funny thing is the top guilds are the ones who can most easily accommodate non-traditional specs. I’m sure after the world firsts (technically seconds :P) are over you’ll see plenty of ret paladins/boomkins etc in those top raid groups
---
What the fuck are you talking about?  
---
They're literally having a stress test next week, released a bug report update yesterday, and have the realms names coming out on August 11th where you can create your character and reserve the name.
---
What more do you want?  What other releases have you been a part of that gives players more information?  This post is dumb.
---
what’s the difference?
---
I actually did this fight as enhancement for our first kill.   I forgot to respec.
---
The rest 50% is shamans
---
Oh yeah? How do “things work” then. Please inform me
---
Feel free to visit classic db
---
We are over a month away. Relax.
---
If you get max rested XP you have it for 2.5 levels.  That could save you about 15 minutes at level 1 - 2.5!
---
Dracova is best Paladin 
---
Esfand obviously most handsome
---
Yeah, it's actually pretty fun too play with people you know irl... We used to just call these people friends and you would interact with them in the real world too. Crazy, I know.
---
If the guild isn't called "Deadass" it will not be official
---
Okay cool! Just message me some basic info like Discord ID or email. Will be setting up the chat later this evening. Your friends are also welcome!
---
Interesting!  It sounds pretty terrible then lol
---
Huh, never knew that guy.
---
Oh...OH!  Oh no!!
---
LOL.
---
&gt;If you are disappointed with what came out, bin the choice, you subconsciously know you don't want that class.
---
This should be labeled the, "Class Picking Guide for Those Too Inept to Make Their Own Decisions"
---
You barely need to use any totems at a minimum.
---
Mana stream is really more for other mana user's benefit as ~3 mana ticks (6 seconds after the 5 second rule) will recover more mana than the totem can without using the water totem in case you are needing it.
---
The only impactful buff totem for trash mobs is windfury, assuming you have warriors in your group.
---
Tremor and grounding are situational in PvE, but have their uses.
---
Resistance totems depend on the instance/raid and mobs you are fighting.
---
Healing stream while mana efficient per actual heal restored, heals a pretty lousy amount of actual HP.
---
Can U give discord Link?
---
pics
---
Are you disputing that rogues have usable single target damage and CC despite not having amazing items?
---
That's kinda one of the nice things about vanilla wow, spell damage gear wasn't REALLY a thing. Int/spirit was god tier for all caster classes.
---
It also depends on the class
---
On the more recent server there was a guy who played holy pal and had shit gear but was really good. He recently just got rank 13 and is now obviously insane. 
---
If you wanna like blow people up and kill them, then yeah you’ll want good gear cause the people you’re fighting will be doing more damage and have more HP, so even if you can outplay them they might still be alive.
---
Yeah, AoE is basically multi dotting or swipe.

Huh. I am impressed. Going in, I honestly thought I was going to see your private server boomkin testing some mechanic that might be completely different on private servers. using beta footage to explain your point was.... very convincing.

Absolutely, but it's perfectly fine for discord. He probably won't sing with it anytime soon.
---
I'll try to make some after dinner, right now my phone battery is at 3%  and I just put it on the charger
---
As alliance getting to winterspring can be a chore unless your getting ported to Darnassus. Even from Darn it's a long flight. For me Everlook is important as I'll be farming the firewater, ekos and possibly the frost saber mount.
---
Gadgetzan is obviously better for AQ but to be fair AQ is only out in what, phase 5?.. So I'd much rather have Everlook port for phases 1 to 4. Not to mention if your doing AQ progression you should have your hearth set to Cenarion hold so you can hearth after getting world buffs.
---
Very interesting. I'd like to know why there's a difference.
---
True. The one exception would be huge aoe pulls where a shield (for blocking) + cooldowns come into play
---
Would you rather tank, heal and have the option of being a flag carrier.
---
Or tank, DPS and have the option to be the hardest class to gear but shine the brightest once you do.
---
You get rested xp outside of safe zones, too. Just even slower. 
---
Not that it matters, you obviously wont get rested XP here.
---
You can’t maybe. But others could.
---
You definitely can still click to target while holding right click. You really don't need right click for anything if i'm not mistaken. For me its just muscle memory at this point.
---
This is fantastic
---
Cool. But maybe try using the US internet from Australia, and then tell me cable length doesn’t matter.
---
If only all of us could speed up time and level on boars in 2-3 minutes of perceived time.
---
Druids are not taken alot in raids since horde is going to stack shamans-&gt; priests and alliance is going to stack priests -&gt; paladins, leaving little space for druids, but even the most min/max guilds take one or two.
---
That being said, not alot of people play druid, especially on horde side (cows are ugly, and catform is inferior to alliance druids-&gt;pala blessings work, windfury totems don't). So if playing what is rarest is your tactic, druid is only an option for horde side really (and lock only for alliance side).
---
That being said, horde can never get enough shamans in a raid :)
---
The math checks out
---
ah good idea, thanks
---
Ah I misunderstood. Gotcha, he's saying he had enough money to make it instantly, and was estimating the gold spent at around 3k.
---
The 2020 sounds better. Your voice will have a better quality and there won't be as much background noise. However you need to sit in front of it when talking. With a modmic you can lean back in your chair without worrying about volume. It sounds worse though.
---
in classic 1.12 ? man I never knew I thought the only one is in gadgetztan.
---
When said streamer(s) decide to move on to other games/gets bored there goes a decent chunk of the servers population with them. (Yes I've seen this happen.
---
Druids can tank everything where having multiple tanks matters.
---
Their threat generation is good enough, they have a taunt, and they take more consistent damage than Warriors due to having more armor, but less overall avoidance and no shield block.
---
We used a Druid tank all the way through Naxx40 back in the day and he did just fine. The need for Warrior tanks is more of a threat thing than a survivability things.
---
Anywhere in a city sure, not just anywhere in the world.
---
it's quite nice! I'm a big city guy though, spent too much time in nature in my day
---
I never had to wait for loot. I just looted and walked on. Items still got in my bag. Dont have to wait untill you see it.
---
I was playing wow for sure at this time too, I only quit really after a month of bfa. But this is the first I've heard of this mosaic? I wonder how I never heard about it back then
---
“Streamers and their fanboys”
---
Yeah clearly you weren’t complaining. 
---
I commented because I find it hilarious how salty people get about streamers and can’t seem to stop from basing every decision they make in classic on them.
---
Druids take way more damage because they can't parry or block at all. Even though they have more health than Warriors they need to be healed more because they don't block or parry any attacks. 
---
This means that healers need to soak way, way more mana into the Druid tank which eventually leads to more wipes.
---
Druids also have more armor, but it really doesn't make a difference since Warriors usually get on par armor through consumables.
---
I agree it's a stretch, but not every boss drops 3 epics. Some drop 2, some drop more.
---
This is why finding people to consistently group with is so important.  Nothing worse than loot drama.
---
Oh yeah, I’m totally sure you have.
---
Thought it was a PC Case
---
Usable? Yes. Usable to the extent where you can permanently lock down a R14 geared character and kill them in a realistic scenario while naked? Not unless you somehow found the only R14 coma patient in WoW Classic.
---
Felguard at 60 lol.
---
Yes it is.
---
Legendary drops in vanilla weren’t the actual legendary item, usually just a piece that would then require other components (other raid drops or expensive endgame mats) in order to actually forge the item.
---
Exactly. Flying really didn’t have a point other than not getting ganked/dismounted. Storm peaks was a really cool zone for that reason.
---
It's not and I don't have the energy to explain to you how 40 man raids are very different from 5 man dungeons.
---
Speedrunner types take all the fun out of the game.
---
Can we bitch about the work any of those 4 does for us when we hire them? :-P
---
shouldn't the HEALING community have the last word on that?  They do the healing after all.    I am not saying you are wrong, I am neither tank nor healer, but it  strikes me as weird to let the tanks decide what is best in a healing debate...
---
So a hunter, rolling on an item a rogue or warrior could possibly use is considered ninja looting?
---
Hahahah
---
if the guilds looting system is incredibly unfair then maybe, in mc 30-40 epics will drop per week. It would be very hard to not get 1 epic in 2 weeks time if you are always pulling your weight and being a key player
---
You can't say that then not explain why you think some people could take an advantage off of it.
---
Perplexity 100% ABSOLUTELY says that the leeway range is more than on private servers. You are hopeless and delusional.
---
viable and optimal are two different things
---
off tanking warriors can wield nightfall
---
off tanking warriors have shieldwall
---
bears have armor - that's all there is to them. They are a big mana sponge for your healers. Sure an overgeared raid can heal a yikes MT druid. But would they rather heal a warrior? You bet your ass they would as it makes life so much easier for them
---
If you say so, lol.
---
If you are working so much that you don't think you can play, you gotta decrease your ambition man... they'll never fire us.
---
At least us lobbyists get to call going to parties work. ;-)
---
If your warrior isnt stupid he should do more dmg than most dps in 5mans. Get a warrior that knows how to swap stances and doesnt go full prot + only defensive stance. 
---
Did this with friend. He went full arms, i went shadow while we were levling priest + warrior. 
---
Never seen a druid/paladin come close to dmg in the cases we let others tank
---
Good choice. PVE is home of the wholesome folk.

LF NA Horde PvE Casual Guild.
---
My wife and I play, her less than I do. We are on random times. She's never played during classic, but I've been on and off for years. 
---
We aren't looking to raid, although I might be willing to as I do enjoy casual raiding. She is not a healer type player, but likely will never be into dungeons or raids. She's a see the world and that's enough player. I play to make gold, and have fun (making gold). I'm happy to help with crafting for a guild, and jumping in for raids where I can.
---
Her: Prolly a Shaman, maybe a Warlock (she wants a pally, but won't play Alliance so...)
---
Him (aka Me): Mainline a Mage, play a Priest with her to keep her alive. 
---
We are never going to be in a hurry to get to the top of the heap. We play to have fun. I enjoy crafting, and will eventually make an alt or 2 if needed to help my main craft choice. I'm happy to help stock a guild vault for raiding purposes. 
---
What I'm avoiding: Family Friendly. Nothing against, but I don't want to worry about telling a joke that might offend delicate ears, and scarring another generation. I want to have fun, but not go to weird. Like no racism stuff, or the like. Just don't want someone to get on my ass for telling a joke with a raunchy ending. Voice comms are preferred (I mean seriously, who doesn't love discord?).
---
Central US time zone. I do go to bed at a reasonable hour (Dude, I'm like pushing 50) as I enjoy sleeping and not being cranky. Did I mention having fun? Won't be on every day, and Nov is the new Pokémon games so.... heh heh

I hate this. Unless you are an absolute min/max elitist jerk there's no reason why a Shaman can't main tank your raid. Seriously it's Vanilla you can play what you want! Some people are real jerks. smh.
---
Absolutely, but remember we also have to stay within budget. Don't mess with your T&amp;E!

Using phase 1:
---
Lucifron:
---
Warrior, shaman tier, choker useful, druid, mage paladin tier useless. 3/6 useful
---
Magmadar:  Strikers mark, medallion of steadfast, warrior, rogue hunter, shaman useful, earthshaker is 50-50 depending on faction, priest warlock paladin, mage druid useless. That's 6.5/12 useful
---
Gehennas: Hunter, rogue, warrior useful, priest paladin shaman crimson shoker useless. 3/7 useful. 
---
Garr: Aurastone, drillborer, hunter, gutgore ripper, warrior, rogue shaman useful. Warlock priest mage druid useless. 7/11 useful

---
golemagg: 
---
Mageblade, hunter rogue blastershot warrior shaman useful. Druid paladin priest warlock mage useless. 6/11
---
Sulfuron: 
---
Hunter, rogue warrior useful, priest shadowstrike useless. Already counted crimson shoker. 3/5.
---
Domo: Has no loot entirely if proper itemization
---
Raggy: Druid, mage, rogue, boa, priest, warlock( i think), warrior, cloak of shrouded, spinal bre shaman tier useful. Shard of the flame, paladin dragonblood useless. 11/14 useful
---
Onyxia:
---
Hunter, sapphiron, bloodfang, priest, warrior, shaman, deathbringer, scale, viskag useful,  ancient warlock druid mage paladin useless. 9/14
---
Total: 51.5 out of 88. 
---
Close enough tbh.
---
That's a funny way to spend your energy lol
---
This is why I'm tempted to be the guy who sets it to ML if I wind up tanking  BRD runs.  Which is the goal.  Well, warrior if I choose to play on a pve server, but druid if I play on pvp. Though I played on tich back in the day, I dunno, I like being able to afk while going for a smoke or the bathroom etc. without getting ganked.
---
I mained Enh and actually did tank through BRD.  
---
Aoe threat and inability to reach uncrushable is what made it so challenging.  Trying to tank a place such as Strat was just beyond painful.  
---
Parry
---
Shield
---
Earth shock
---
Rock biter
---
A lot of the tools are there but they were just missing a couple things to make it realistic.  No taunt, no way to quickly threaten multiple targets aside from CL pull.
---
Ooo you found a good fake job, nice. K street?
---
Don't sacrifice a bar full of rage for hots, though.
---
Personally I'm going Warlock this time around just because I want to be a loot whore. As for Druid I can't give a first hand account, but from what I've read it's resto first as nearly every set is geared towards that, then you can build towards feral or balance. The blue pvp set is supposed to be great for feral especially with the move speed buff and is just a pvp grind away in phase 2. However, with balance you will be fighting with a lot of casters as you will mostly be using cloth, so that'll be a little more rough.
---
Dang, I think it is linked to my Account, I'll grab a screen cap.
---
My argument shows that, that argument is likly to be false, my example shows how little at least one class needs at all from of phase 1 raid, its a microcosm. I really don't feel like going through every class, but the majority of classes are akin to warlock in that they have very little to upgrade past Pre-BiS in phase 1. More than half of the gear is also class specific. 
---
It might take months if the only peice you need is Mageblade.
---
Do you happen to have any videos recorded during that time?  I'd really like to put some concrete numbers down.
---
I know there will be time to play, just not as much as I would like....
---
M street, though I only go into the office about once a month.
---
on pvp server for sure. One carebear server just drop the rogue and add a miss
---
The old loch Moran part gave me goosebumps, as a horde player I remember loving it so much I made a dwarf hunter just to level there and Dun Morough :)

Do you happen to have any videos recorded during that time? I'd really like to put some concrete numbers down.
---
We really don't, though. Most of the people talking about druids on this sub haven't even played them.
---
I mean, you can just look at [something like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#). There's a ton of loot that is better than pre-bis. And that only lists things that are also BIS. If a gutgore ripper drops, you use it, you don't wait until you get perdition's.
---
Girls? Where is this house at? Tell me now!

---
I do have some recordings but not of looting sry
---
You only get rested XP from logging out at an Inn, so that's a definite no, and thank God for that.
---
It's the same reason why improved reincarnation is a spotty talent point investment. It's a talent cluster that only benefits you once you die, with limited advantages once you do.
---
If the healers died, something else went wrong somewhere in the raid and from a problem solving perspective it's much more productive to solve the issue. SoR or imp. reincarnation are bandaid solutions.
---
&gt;in PvE
---
The power of rouges is far overblown in Vanilla mythos. Just to get it out of the way, any class still kill people in PvP with little gear. This isn't Wrath where being in full PvP gear makes you immune to damage from scrubs.
---
Rogues, especially average/mediocre players, are very vulnerable to getting near instantly killed by geared players. Watching perplexity carefully cc chain a warrior and kite him makes it look easy, but a couple lucks hits or a revenge from the warrior can easily turn that fight around. It's far harder than it looks.
---
Mage, on the other hand, still isn't easy but they have a much easier time against warriors. You are never forced to go into their combat range and r1 frostbolt, cone of cold, and frost nova all directly counter warriors in PvP.
---
Well that plus Kara was a really fun first raid. I thought it was really mystical when I first experienced it in BC compared to all the chaos settings of vanilla.
---
Exactly my point ;)
---
I might have something, but just packed up my PC in anticipation of a move. =/
---
Back in Vanilla I raided with my wife who was a Boomkin. She DPS’d trash and when we needed to push DPS and off healed and decursed some fights. One Chromaggus kill she was last healer standing.
---
Right my mistake. They had some really Good rep gear though thar was better than what you got from heroics and way easier to get, ie catchup gear
---
Thanks for making a rogue guide!!!
---
remind me! 42 days
---
I'm confused. Does this video prove that it is a good decision to tank Nefarian as a druid compared to a warrior?
---
Creepy.
---
I tanked shazzrah in vanilla molten core after pulling threat on my hunter from high damage... I thought it would be funny if I spammed all my melee moves and funny enough the raid healers just healed me through the rest of the fight.  But sadly made the guild officers mad, and cost me -15 DKP even though we easily won.
---
Word of wisdom, don't pull threat and then start spamming all your melee moves.
---
sweet thanks, that's pretty reasonable
---
I just shift click and move on before the window appearing, i get 100% of my loot. Did this on both stress test.
---
the problem with tanking is that any mistake is blamed on you. Not pushing fast enough? Tanks fault. DPS pulled the cc marked target? Tanks fault. Healer pulled aggro by healing the DPS that aggrod the cc marked target? Tanks fault.
---
From my own experience on vanilla and pservers, once I find a solid group to run dungeons and raids with I lose interest fast in tanking for new groups unless a friend asks me to PUG. Let me mark, let me pull and let me get into my rhythm and everything will be fine. But too many these days are assholes, especially those Hunters who are pulling the next group of mobs while your healer's blue bar of awesome is nearly out, I hate That Guy.
---
Absolutely dog shit take.
---
Do you really think people only wipe in Mythic cause of dumb pulls? You realize how much more difficult the mechanics are now right?
---
I think cause makes the game more sloggy.
---
Brazillian Realms are hosted in Chicago
---
&gt;One bubble of rested XP (5% of your current level) is earned for every 8 hours spent resting in an inn or city, or for every 32 hours spent logged off in another location. 
---
Just because you don't undertand a mechanic that hasn't been changed since the vanilla beta, doesn't mean you should be a dick because the mechanic worked the same way a few expansions later, too.
---
Get that util down, you can do it!
---
&gt;Don't turn 'can tank everything' into 'are ideal to tank everything'
---
I thought that was implied. Yes you can have a cat formed/no fear break druid can Nefarian. You could probably also have a rogue do it too. What is your point?
---
Yeah, unfortunately I have a wedding to go to on Saturday or Sunday that weekend and my girlfriend has off from school for once so I'll be spending the time with her.  She knows I'm going to be taking off the 27th and playing during almost all of my free time, but I'll still give her enough time too.
---
Well your rage does tick just like a rogues energy... Just in reverse. And it's a known fact that the functionality of this talent is not reducing rage decay but simply providing the warrior with 1 rage every 3 seconds in or out of combat. Technically it's value isn't even correct as it's actually a 33% decay reduction, not 30% as rage is reduced by 3 every 3 seconds base.
---
This is the right answer, if you try to keybind everything as a shaman you will not have a good time.  You don't even have room on your bars for all totems, items like mount or PVP insig, and any downranking.  I hotkey some that are needed in regular 'rotational' kind of ways like grounding totem, strength of earth, GOA/wf totem, and I click the niche totems like mana spring/healing stream, resistance totems, astral recall, or stuff like that.  
---
That can be changed slightly, like if you're PVPing a lot you will never use grace of air (grounding or windfury or even windwall are almost always better options) or you might want to, as a PVP player, have frost/fire resist totem ready for when you encounter mages.  
---
I only use 1-6, q e r t f g z x c along with shift modifiers for most.   I also use shift w a s d for various actions that can only be done while immobile so you'd never be moving with those anyways.  it's doable but IMO the most difficult keybind setup of any of the classes I've played which is most of them.
---
Good work.

**&lt;Completion&gt;** Horde | East Coast NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  Sixty iterations off the central finite curve, there's a semi-hardcore guild named &lt;Completion&gt; that will dominate world PvP, raid Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm, and create a family like community. Our discord has collections of all of the top class guides, profession guides, and BiS lists. Come home to the impossible guild of your own completion.    
---
**Who are we?**   
---
Our guild is run by experienced and skilled players that have played since 2004-2006. Our raid leaders have raided in vanilla through Naxx, and have raided through Naxx on private servers. Others have achieved PvP ranks ranging from Rival to Gladiator on retail, and raided at a mythic level with exceptional parses. In short, we raid to gear for PvP. We are looking to min/max our characters at a relaxed pace to dominate all aspects of PvP and PvE and have a blast doing it.    
---
**Who are we looking for?**   
---
We are looking for more like-minded players with character min/maxing aspirations with a passion for PvP and raiding to join our ranks and fill out our 40+ man roster. Our current raid roster is full, but please still apply as there is inevitable turnover that will occur. Everyone that joins will have every opportunity to earn a raid spot. We are also accepting any casual players looking for an active community.    
---
**What will we be doing?**   
---
We will be raiding Tuesday/Thursday, 8-11 EST and will use a 25% weekly decay DKP system for loot. There will likely be a 3rd optional day added in the future during BWL progression and onwards. We also will be doing many world PvP events and PvP raids, as well as an extensive amount of premade BGs. We will make a valiant attempt at rank 14 without killing ourselves in the process. Also, we will have other weekly community events such as dueling tournaments, "where is X" events, and weekly bounties against certain Alliance players, all with gold prizes.

---
I agree, tbc was my height. I liked the 5 man end game content better. I played a lot of alts, so it was nice to have some difficult end game stuff that didn't require raiding (I just raided on my main mostly).
---
Vanilla is great of course, just tbc felt like a worthy upgrade.

The disappointment when I first used that talent. Such a sad day!
---
Because that's a different picture.
---
Nice troll
---
posted this this morning too...
---
To expand upon InspiredByBruceLee's comment...
---
By the time you fought good mages in good gear, you were also a good druid in good gear.
---
In particular, you had the 4 set PvP bonus of +15% speed increase at rank 8. Since speed bonuses multiply, it means the +30% talent results in a +49% cat, a +61% cheetah (even bear was +15%). Note that horses run at +40% and +60%, making druids faster than horses.
---
So you abused the hell out of it.
---
The bread and butter tactic is to use that +49% to stay in melee range, trying to attack the back of the caster, by strafing through, circling, running through, etc, as getting on the back breaks line of sight, which cancels casting.
---
The key advantage is that you do that routine all the time, against lots of classes, so you're used to +49% combat, fighting people who don't normally have to deal with someone else going that fast. So anyone casting longer spells, like 2+ sec, got line of sight broken all the time, and even shorter spells regularly got broken.
---
It forces mages to fight with instants and 1.5 sec casts, rather than their high dps longer casts, as they don't have a counter that could lock down a druid long enough to get a long cast off.
---
Damn, must have been difficult to find a new shaman.
---
I wish I could find it. Where did you bought it?
---
And show us some pics!
---
It shouldn't take too long before you get your tier gear. It's usually the first type of epic that gets disenchanted other than the meme epics like vendorstrike.
---
Yeah having tons of 5 man options instead of the handful in vanilla is a huge upgrade.  I remember having tons of fun trying to beat all the different heroics.  TBC felt like an improved version of Vanilla as where retail feels like a completely different genre of game.
---
This conversation goes round in circles endlessly. Just tweak dead specs/memespecs to be decent already and let this topic die.
---
As a tank I'll have these rules. 
---
1.Spec in dungeon for.
---
2.Disenchant roll/greed. You can equip rather than take mats. 
---
3. If no disenchant and no main spec in dungeon that wants it, you're welcome to take it. 
---
Also up to group to give up on disenchant to give but should not be expected. I need money and mats too.
---
Have you checked the classic forum? It seems like blue posts are regular occurrences.

The weekend after labor day I have to travel for an esports event thursday to monday. I swapped the hard drive out on a busted laptop just so I can bring it with.

I've used the addon, and it loots so fast I can't recall the loot window opening.
---
It's not like the totems just instantly go away. The pet is taken out of the process during this, so that is time the pet isn't attacking the player and causing damage and pushback, isn't seducing or counter spelling or stunning or whatever things hunter pets can do.
---
Likewise dispel does the same thing for warlocks and it doesn't even require a macro. Warlock loses all of its dots? Well, it's a decision of fuck it keep fighting or waste 5 seconds in the middle of pvp to re-up them (only for them to all go down in 1 second again?)
---
Oh fuck! Well I think layering will let us hit 40 by friday for sure - Wednesday and Thursday you're going to have to put in a bunch of hours!

I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a cool thing. It's funny how I think of that time as the WoW era, like if the game wasn't around anymore.

Lucky! I ended up login into my brothers account and just downloaded it to my PC - Seems to work, I just want to know if someone else is having the same issue
---
I plan on playing a warrior and I only plan on tanking because I think it will be necessary, if I don't have to tank I won't. I'm sure there are others in the same situation.
---
Some of your totems are really niche to the point where they almost never get used at all like windwall, flametongue or sentry.
---
You could find a use for most totems if you wanted to, especially the DPS totems tend to get underused. Resto for the main part use utility totems like tremor, mana spring/healing stream, strength of earth, windfury, grace of air and mana tide.
---
or when you tell someone something really helpful and they say
---
" ah hahahahah , i know !! im trying something "
---
Definitely wasn't Vanilla or classic thing lol. Which is what this reddit was I thought
---
"quick look"

&gt;over 9min video

shit argument
---
In my experience it was Thunderfury. Guilds that couldn't kill Rag yet still had a chance to get the bindings to drop. I've actually never personally seems the Sulfurus Eye drop from Rag, even when running it solo many of times.
---
Fury tank will be even more prevalent in Classic because of undertuned bosses.

&gt; Hunters who are pulling the next group of mobs while your healer's blue bar of awesome is nearly out, I hate That Guy.
---
That's where you ask your tank to politely, let the idiot huntard DIE (and refuse to heal him as the healer)
---
I play druid so I get both the tank blame, and healing blame depending on the day.
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
Reddit's hive mind garbage, so you can take everything you see here regarding the hatred of hunters with a grain of salt.
---
It's almost entirely one thing that ppl fixate on: ppl fucking up aggro/accidentally pulling mobs with their pets. It's annoying but the class is nowhere near as annoying as ppl on Reddit make it out to be.
---
There's a simple difference: itemization. Warrior has great and smooth tank itemization, while druid has a very wonky one, with quest blues and PvP gear and, at certain steps in progression ( early BWL, Naxx), there's quite a lack of available gear. 
---
Druids have the upperhand in certain fights (many resistance-based, and Jin'do -ZG- due to his polymorph) and are quite better in dungeons  but warriors rule in raids. 
---
To be honest I am in a close spot as you, but I do not consider warrior at all. Being a PvP player I find PvP warrior playstyle quite unengaging.
---
But he's not paying $12.99, he's paying at least $14.88.
---
Don't forget dodge -&gt; OP -&gt; Miss.
---
Yeah, I don't trust the shareholders and upper management at Blizzard whatsoever either. My hope is currently being placed in the Classic team, and their ability to maintain a high degree of independence and freedom. It's a tough situation and impossible to know for sure. I know that OSRS/Jagex isn't a perfect example because Blizzard is a much larger company and have bigger shareholders, but I'm going to use them as the ideal scenario anyways. 
---
I picture current, retail WoW as equivalent to RS3 in this situation. Littered with micro-transactions, largely relies on cash-cow customers, playerbase mostly in China. 
---
Classic can be what Old School is. Dedicated dev team, creative freedom and complete decision-making power, high amount of community feedback. 
---
I'm hoping that since Classic and Retail are on the same subscription, in the eyes of the shareholders they are essentially the same product. Sub count is going to shoot up with Classic, which makes them more money. Meanwhile, they can still milk the cash-cow that is retail for all it's worth. So they still get high subscription revenue and microtransaction revenue, from essentially the same product. That should be enough the keep them placated in my mind. 
---
But, I did end up having to type the word "hope" more times than I wanted. These are all just hopes, ideas, and opinions. If this is a possibility, then we have to make it clear to Blizzard it's what we want. If they don't listen, or if the community is mostly gathered behind a different opinion, then so be it.
---
Gank people that are leveling of the opposite faction in stranglethorn vale
---
I don't think you quite appreciate just how op 1.12 is compared to when MC was progression.
---
Thank you for the interest, however none of these raid times really fit into our available schedule.
---
Nah.
---
Skarm brags that he can complete MC with a raid in greens. He's really arrogant, it's that he speaks with a nerdy authority the community either idolizes or [has trouble disputing](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8e/26/03/8e2603ed613f6ad08c51b8782c33d4cb.jpg). But we know already that private servers vs. Classic aren't quite the same; anyone guaranteeing they know what's up is a bullshitter. I think druids will probably be fine MTing early content, as there are a few factors like itemization and game knowledge that will make that stuff less challenging; and for later raids will settle more into role as offtanks primarily with the occasional dedicated MT, just as they were in vanilla.
---
Swings times are reset after instant cast spells.  There is speculation about DPS boosts from using 1.5 speed weapons to get off a swing between instant cast spell spam.
---
Big numbers on that TPS meter bro!
---
Hi! it´s based on the Corsair 280x :)
---
Did we see if totems triggered gcd? I'm switching faction so I have not checked. As remember vaila had both.
---
Right!? :D
---
Never understood why booms got hate. They could top Dps meters after AQ came out.
---
Gear only goes so far.  I've always been able to outdps people with far better gear than myself.
---
People often went into dungeons too low in Classic, since you could usually get in 3-5 levels below when you SHOULD be trying to complete the dungeon.
---
Not to mention, several dungeons had a 5+ spread of mob levels.
---
Druids can tank any fight in the game minus 2, Magmadar in MC, and Maexxna in Naxx. Magmadar needs fearbreaks, as relying on fear wards or just eating the fear hurts your raid, and Maexxna REQUIRES shield wall. (Sorry, that stun is a death sentence without it)
---
Druids have a massive advantage over warrior in 5-mans: threat. Much higher threat, less gear dependent, and you can eat a ton of damage.
---
Yes you will be under crush/crit cap, but even with that, the higher hp pool, and ability to hit armor cap (yes I said that, armor cap of 75% damage reduction from armor), you can manage those spikes without an issue. Your health drops very consistently, making is much much easier to heal. (You can downrank and be healing just enough to cover the incoming damage, and not be overhealing as much)
---
Go for druid.
---
Undead DoubleD gets me everytime.
---
He's clearly joking in this case though.
---
If its good enough for a cat its good enough for me :D
---
It sure is :D Thanks :D
---
Just need what you need always and forever.

Yes it works. No, you won’t be riding a saber for a long time. In the Beta, I only reached 3,715/21,000 exalted with Darnassus by level 40, despite completing nearly every single Darnassus quest as well as most Alliance quests that gave spillover Darnassus rep. After Desolace and Feralas quests, you’d have to supplement with Morrowgrain/Un’Goro Soil turn-ins at level 47 and/or Runecloth turn-ins at level 50 to finally achieve exalted.
---
Importantly overheal does not generate threat however, which impacts how effective it is in the first couple seconds of a pull quite substantially.
---
Nice. I heard it was hectic. I started on Boxing Day, 2005. Got the game for Christmas.
---
Blizzard has banned you that's why you can't install.
---
I have the same issue. The drop down version tab on the bnet launcher for WoW only gives me options for 'World of Warcraft and 'PTR World of Warcraft', both of which are for retail of course. No mention of classic. It is like this for me on both computers I have access to.
---
I'd assume it was just an EU region thing if there weren't so many people who claim to have it on this subreddit.
---
I have reinstalled the bnet app to ensure it is up to date but it doesn't change anything.
---
If you are inviting people from Long Island here, you might as well start inviting New Jersey. This is insulting to the title of the post.

since horned viking helm lasts so long and breaks on damage , ima put it down as an incapacitate

Well there's ya problem

Or maybe I'm just bored at my well-paying job and decided to use some downtime to pick peoples brains.

I'm sorry that offends you so much but tbh I just dont know what to tell you.
---
I didn’t.
---
Ah yes forgot about that, but unfortunately, prot warrior isn't going to be big numbers on TPS (just barley over the mages unfortunately). Raid boss parry chance is higher on classic, and player crit chance is going to be lower against raid targets which should be interesting to see.
---
Not a thing in vanilla. I used to do this cool little trick where I would start a front movement+jump+gouge. While mid air I would spin the camera and be right there for a backstab. Sometimes I would wait for a bit of energy to pool before the backstab. Same with kidney shots.
---
After a certain point it pays for its own token, really

Wow you must work for an incredible company, it is rare that they have yet to be burned by the 4!

Lolol okay - can't wait for classic when people complain about things pservers did wrong  😂
---
Exactly, only warlock was viable.
---
Please remove it ... its so uneccessary and annoying
---
Like I said, I thought it would be funny to just start melee, from my perspective we'd killed that boss easy so many times, it was trivial.  Somehow it still shook up the guild leadership and they wanted to punish me.
---
That's rude.

So, I haven't been playing retail long, been back maybe a month. I re-subbed for the stress test and retail is on the same sub, so why not eh. I kind of dig the Zandalari, and if I unlock the race I figure I'll give Druid another shot. 
---
Yesterday, right when I log on, I see this character about 15 feet away in a really cool looking outfit! Quick click inspect, and what do you know, **none** of it is transmogged! So I whisper them "hey, just wanted to say that's a really cool outfit! why are you wearing the actual gear instead of transmogging?" A couple minutes later they answer back "I dunno, I guess I'm old fashioned, I have my set of town gear and a set of leveling gear." We talked for a few minutes, and plan to run some dungeons this weekend with his other friends.
---
Then I get back to my questing, and I'm running on a path in Zuldazar. There is a cute little Direhorn off to the side who's owner is... well anyway. I better take the little hatchling back to the nearest village to get guidance on how to raise her the right way... Feeding her, training her, giving her (ahem) medicine, took the rest of my night. It was fun! And also, one particular link in that quest line made me stop playing about five minutes to have a personal debate about the ethical implications of &gt;!injecting an animal with growth hormone (especially goblin growth hormone)!&lt;. I eventually had to check the comments on the quest on wowhead to settle my conscience on the issue before I continued. I was seriously considering just dropping the quest line right then and there. When I got to the last part, it seems like the quest will become part of a daily?
---
I guess what I'm saying is this. The game is, and always has been, what you make of it. I'm not using guides to find optimal paths. I talk to the people around me, take quests that look interesting, and read *every* bit of text I'm presented with. In a couple hours on a pretty average night, I met new people, found a unique quest chain, and learned about life in a Warbeast Kraal (lore). Retail is not Classic, but that doesn't mean it's 100% garbage.
---
I agree that the OP's overall statement is well intentioned, but it's also somewhat unfair. Do you absolutely HAVE to downrank? No, but the game is definitely designed around the idea of multiple spell ranks and this is especially true when it comes to healing, where mana efficiency is basically the measure of your success (hence why paladins are considered to be the 'best' healers = illumination means their mana efficiency scales insanely well with gear).  HPS and HPM are extremely one-sided metrics that don't really apply well to Classic.
---
Not downranking at max level will we nigh unplayable, especially at the start of Classic when no one is geared. Once tanks' damage intake starts to smooth out with gear, you might get away with it but even then you'll just have a bad time. Downranking isn't absolutely necessary as you level, but doing it (even just adding one rank heal to your bar) will mean you'll have a better time healing. It's not even about being optimal, it's just about making your time as a healer more enjoyable.
---
You earned rested xp logged out anywhere in the Beta.  I did it plenty of times.  It has always been this way.  Not even a pserver thing.
---
But the important thing isn't whether or not they can infinitely cast a spell by downranking, everyone knows they can do that easily, the important thing is how much damage the spell they're downranking to does.
---
This pretty much sums it up ;)
---
Its in the chain, people read their way down... 
---
Also from your comment it appeared you didn't understand what it was either. 
---
How is that weird? As I said "not ***ONLY*** just for you, special guy".
---
**NA Alliance PVE Raiding wanted.**
---
Quit playing retail after i hit 110 on two characters. Just got burned out. I have played since a few months before TBC came out.  
---
I have done your super hardcore raiding putting in almost as much time as I worked real jobs, and casual raiding.  I plan on playing classic like crazy, as I am divorced kids live away from me and I live on my own so I need something to occupy a lot of time after work.
---
I plan on playing a Mage, as it's what I've been since the beginning.  I am also open to maybe Rogue, Hunter or some type of healer.

**Shitpost warning**  OP is just here to stir stuff up, pay no attention to this troll...
---
Ayee, that's why I'm here playing retail. Cool cool
---
Lmao get out of here with all that shit. I did this constantly in Vanilla, if they called for backup I’m a rogue.. just stealth back and don’t engage until they are all gone. Like you said they are looking for profits, the more time they spend protecting one person thats 4 people wasting time to protect the resources of one.
---
While your imaginary movie sounds nice it doesn’t work like that. Also I’m a rogue and love pvp, a bad rep with the opposite faction is actually a GOOD thing. 😂
---
"You also become rested while logged off in the wilderness, but the accumulation is slower. When logged off "outside," rest is gained at one fourth the rate in an inn, or one bar every 32 hours."
---
Again, requirements you're arbitrarily making up in the context of what?
---
I don't care how much you're planning to play. Play 1 hr a week, play 100 hours a week  But I just don't get why so many people in this subreddit seem to have really skewed thoughts on what is casual to the general public, and seem to have this need to call a significant of hours in a game casual.
---
Feral tanks are fine in Tier 2.5 and 3. Their weakest point is probably BWL progression since they don't get much gear from MC. But after that you have some nice pieces in BWL as well as pvp faction rewards to tide you over until the explosion of bear loot that is AQ.
---
A lot of these people won't make it to 60 as a warrior, they will reroll around 40.
---
Also a lot of these people will be in casual guilds and maybe not steobinto a raid until the content is on farm. 
---
There will always be a place for another tank in the game.
---
Must suck suffering from sarcasm blindness :/

There is a short time before an auto attack goes off that if you use an ability it will cancel the auto attack.

A siwng timer will alert you of this so you don't 'clip' your auto attacks and lose dps.

Yeah, Fury warriors only have the highest PvE DPS possible to attain in vanilla WoW.

I'd rather speak truth to power than farm karma lol. Your priorities are off.

That’s factually untrue. Warriors take 1K+ more damage than druids on hateful strike. You also might want to try a Druid tank, might clear up that ignorance you have going.
---
Speaking of respected sources, skarm seems pretty popular on his sub. Maybe this might enlighten you https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8

Not really sure what you're going on about.

Seems like you probably just start frothing at the mouth if anyone mentions private servers or says something you dont like about your beloved wow.

Awww here forgot alliance landed in menethil harbor that’s on me
---
Classic won’t be undertuned.  Private servers were overtuned.  It’s semantics, but it’s important.
---
This is so hilariously correct, 35 threads on how if you don't mind/max you're a casual. But equally how face roll all the content is, I'm over here asking myself if we are all actually talking about the same game.
---
Yea, I've returned a few times over the last decade. Last time I quit was in 2017. Didn't really have a problem with runes since they're incredibly expensive in the shop but XP boosts is really p2w.
---
No they don't? Rogues and bear tanks have close to zero overlap for what gear they want
---
Well, I don't know where they will get gear, as a warrior whoes going to tank and dps,  I won't be inviting any to my groups
---
I just found out the other day that moonkin form has the same armor  as bear without thick hide, you can facetank even quite hard hitting raid trash/5 man bosses in that form, especially with barkskin.

As I have a similar question, Do you guys think a laptop with a 1050ti will work on max settings in 1920x1080 ?

Lol gtfo kid I actually know how to PVP unlike you who believes everything hard counters everything. I can tell you are a fanboi who get's angry by getting ganked. Grow up kid it's a game.
---
Unless of course you want to be decent at dungeons, or PvP, or kiting, or you just like convenience. 
---
Personally I don't need as much of a reason to become quicker and better at the game. Being so willing to wallow in mediocrity like all these 'no bindings needed for PvE' parrots seems miserable and depressing, PvP server or no.

Yes he still had it, but eventually leveled and no longer has it on his armor - https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/blackrock/savorx

TIL
---
&gt;the fury warrior would take over, but sham still insisted on reserving ironfoe and hand of justice
---
and that's when the fury warrior hearts out
---
Don't know much about this, but doesn't the dps difference from armor get affected by how armor reduction debuffs stacks differently between private servers and classic?
---
Star of Mystaria versus Choker of the Fire Lord.
---
Were not not about pvp, were talking about farming pve. Derp?
---
Shaman tanking was legit on the Beta. There were tons of shamans doing it, including myself. I definitely tanked more than I healed on the Beta, and often times with a warrior in the group who was happy to slap on their WW axe and dps.
---
I know this was only up to level 40, but the only problem through RFD/Cath/Ulda was regenerating mana between pulls, but I'm talking about very fast runs with good players where we did AoE pulls without CC and they went hard on dps and I had to use Earth Shock on cooldown and max rank. In your standard group you're using much less mana and/or taking it slower so I don't envision a problem through at least level 55 in 5 mans. Also I was using a 2H quite often (Ravager). Biggest threat to survivability was Scarlet Monks with their WF attack and Scarlet Myrmidons when enraged, but those guys chunked warriors with shields too, anyway.
---
&gt; But back in Vanilla the hard part was just getting 40 people together and maintaining the fucking politics that went on with that many people. 
---
You serious? Haven't seen anyone mention this before. Unique angle, you must've put a lot of thought into this one.
---
Are you able to find a source for that? As far as I know it should be available in phase 1.
---
Suffer compared to what? Private Servers?
---
You will really miss Nature's Swiftness in both PvP and while healing, but yes it can work.
---
Let people know your spec and try to heal the raid if possible. If you must heal the tanks, try to pick a tank that also has another Druid or Shaman covering them. Druid heals are slow and you have no way to recover from unexpected spike damage without NS.
---
Not getting Engi is a massive nerf to your character. Most serious guilds will force you to go for AQ.
---
Don't worry, they should get a lesser guild rank.
---
I went to UBRS as off heal at 54 with a couple friends. Probably one of my favorite wow memories

I'm in this thread because at quick glance I thought the title read "Visibly drunk tank"

I'll see myself out.
---
Demon Hide Sack quest is one of the best quests.
---
In TBC bosses hit significantly harder than vanilla relative to a tank's HP. In vanilla you basically can't get 2 shot even by 2 crits as a bear.
---
And then you realize if the mages actually decurse and you bring a fury warrior instead of your wife Chromaggus is dead long before.
---
But what if you're mage #91?
---
4 Months is a stretch, honestly one month is a stretch before seeing your first epic.
---
That being said the hunt for the BiS pieces that everyone in the raid is looking for could definitely take months of committed effort to acquire.
---
4 Months for a BiS item like a trinket or weapon is not only reasonable but depending on your guilds luck with drops, well, 4 months might seem like a relatively quick amount of time.
---
This is my plan as well, with my wife healing me on her priest the whole time :)
---
No. I dont even play them. People are saying that mages are gonna be a pain in the ass to play because of spells lagging and melees hitting you from far away. And not just mages, apparently hunters suffer even more.
---
Thats awesome!
---
You're so hard bro.
---
&gt;Crushing blows only happen when the mob is 4 levels higher than the player
---
3, it's 4 since WotLK
---
So why are you complaining about how overall DPS would be too low?
---
There's a reason why they're tying it into the regular subscription plan. They don't care what the numbers are, They're going to keep doing it regardless.
---
I do too! Ooze Priest has a video on the Undead racials and he comments a little on spamming Touch of Weakness against melees, can't link it here though cause it's mostly pserver. Touch is great
---
 though cause not only does it eventually deal more normal damage than Mind Flay, it can also crit unlike Mind Flay! *And* Vampiric Embrace heals can also crit separately from the damage, so you can actually get "double-crits" (once on the damage, once on the heal). It opens up so much more gearing possibilities for Shadow Priests.
---
It's a reddit bot, using the command he wrote a bot will message him in 41 days when classic launches to remind him of the post he replied to.

It is being greatly exaggerated by a number of the people posting on this sub.
---
Spell batching and leeway exist in classic the same way they did in vanilla.

Apparently spending 2 dungeon lockouts farming crowd pummelers and instantly getting threat better than warriors on every boss in a raid is "autism".

I actually enjoy playing on pirates so you know what they say about assumptions lol

Well hehe. I googled it and found that many but far from all celebrate 1 of may as Labor Day. In Norway we do. Social democracy. But one could say that Norway is pretty much capitalism. A filthy rich country. Communists party gets about 3-4 % during elections here. And the Norwegian communist party members would be shot as true capitalists in old Soviet Union.
---
It's optimal for spiky threat that allows your dps to go hard early. Of course you lose some of that time by having to drink vs having rage, but if it lines up with your healer and mage drinking, it's not so bad.
---
I can't say for sure for Classic beyond 40 because the Beta was capped at 40, but it was totally viable at 40 in Ulda/RFD/Cath, to the point where you can tank with Ravager and no shield (but have to know when to put shield on like when Scarlet Myrmidons enrage)
---
It can't be instant casts. Just imagine paladins and shamans with all of their instant spells. That would be ridiculous
---
TBC is where WoW died for me. I literally had a year played when I quit a few months into TBC  (yes, that's sad. Why am I going to play classic again?) I say they keep classic the way it is -- worst case scenario, everyone is in similar gear and PvP victory will be determined by Skill / teamwork. Raiding will probably get stale tho -- which is where they can improve.  More content for classic WoW would be good.
---
Leave the level cap at 60, throw in some difficult 5, 10, 15 man raids. Classic wow following a delayed path to where they are today is just plain stupid. Leave the level cap at 60. Add some new raids, world bosses, gear, pvp stuff, etc. That's where it's at, i'm telling ya.
---
Stealing devilsaur from a hunter (the point of this discussion) is clearly a pvp act. Sure hunters are better at farming, just like I can say rogues are better at pvp, does it really matter? Stop trying to turn this into a class vs class argument. I can easily tell you are one of those kids that rage.
---
I mained a DK in lich king and the server was FLOODED with DKs, bad DKs, so many bad DKs that a good DK and especially a good DK tank really stood out. I look forward to reliving the days of logging on and instantly getting tons of messages from peeps when I roll warrior this time around.
---
Fair, but I did get across all the important info within the first 40 seconds.
---
One of these posts every 10 mins ffs.

I hope that the spreadsheet is of some utility to blacksmiths, because it allows you to understand your customers better. If you know that an alliance warrior cannot get green quest shoulders until desolace, you might think "oh, I can spam "silvered bronze shoulders" in trade chat and possibly get some interested parties". 
---
Also, it is typical in wow classic for trade skills to have gaps. As in, an item you would expect to be there isn't. A good example is alchemy's +15 strength elixir of Mega-Ogres, which is noteworthy primarily because it does not exist. 
---
Similarly, there is no bronze belt as a blacksmith. In fact, I am not aware of an iron belt either. or a steel belt, or a mithril belt, unless you count the gnomish harm prevention belt, which is an engineering item. 
---
TLDR: trade skills have some nuance.
---
I tanked ubrs once as a shaman back in retail vanilla.  Our groups tank was so bad I took over for him and did most of my personal healing.
---

---
The only people that are complaining are the players that played on servers that removed or modified spell batching and leeway. Mages and Hunters did just fine in actual Vanilla and there was no large hate towards either system.
---
Leeway also doesn't just affect melee, it increases the range of your spells too.
---
I failed to mention this in the video, but Paladin Judgment spells and Shaman Shock spells don't interrupt the swing timer.
---
So wouldn't it be easy to figure out just by looking at the implementation of AutoLoot vs ManualLoot?
---
Lightning Serpent has a ranged attack making it gain threat faster as well. And since it's elemental, it usually deals. more damage. I use it while i charge up an aimed shot and it's hard to lose threat even on crits. :)
---
People complain about them because they aren't playing the game right now.
---
Come 8/26 in NA, nobody will give a fuck about leeway, batching, layering or streamer servers.
---
Block out the noise and just get ready to jump in the chaos in August :)
---
Let pet tank, druid can heal it. If druid is tanking, some elites will give them trouble. Pet tanking with heals behind it can outlast most world elites.
---
It's not batched, it's a clearly a queued database operation of some sort and frequently takes almost a full second to process. This is and always has been how World of Warcraft handles inventory processing. I wouldn't expect them to toss this design out the window because it has always worked remarkably well. I can think of no other game that's seen so much complex traffic without ever encountering any type of inventory exploit. The closest thing to an inventory exploit this game ever experienced derived from the initial implementation of transfers.
---
God damnit will you stop coming up with new reasons for me to roll another class? Now I HAVE to go mage right? The what-should-I-play agony never ends!
---
i haven't gotten an upgrade in over 10 years...
---
Why the hel' would hunter be a support class. And don't say tranq shot, it was added because devs didn't know how to fix their pve dps without breaking them in pvp.
---
Etsy has a ton of stuff.
---
eAsY tO pLaY, hArD tO mAsTer
---
Nawh they are pretty easy to master.. if you are actually good and can micromanage.
---
Pet control can almost entirely be done through macros.. 2/3rd's are tied into your other spells.
---
The only unique ones are follow/stay. Attack target + charge/dash then returns once dead or manually recalled. Also the stop attack ones to not break a sting/scatter.
---
The main hunter specific ones are just fd + trap variations.
---
Maybe a nobreak meld if nelf...
---
Yeah, not sure the best way to word that.  It’s not an absolute reset.  I guess a spell cast would otherwise extend your swing timer, but because these are instant casts it coincides perfectly with 1.5 speed weapons?

Give me all the info from your meetings and I will draft an 8-D Report so that we can fix the issues.

Did it as a Warlock in vanilla and am thinking of doing it again in classic.  At least I can tell myself the 40 mount is free, and the 60 mount is 40+% off once DM comes out.  I agree with /u/MeanderingWookie though, fishing was my source of income back in the day!
---
If true, this eliminates any possibility of looting being on the spell batch. At worse, only the default manual loot could be on spell batch.
---
For prot you have listed Scarlet Kris, Ardent Custodian, Julie's Dagger and Lifeforce Dirk. Whereas Mirah's Song is better than the last 3 and pretty much equal to the Scarlet Kris, except it's free.  
---
It is however mentioned for fury later on in the video.
---
Awesome!
---
I'm not looking for contributors right now, but I appreciate the interest!
---
Wotlk was such a disappointment and abandonment of the game's previous core principles that a lot of hardcore vanilla/BC players had already quit by the time the 5th anniversary rolled around.
---
What about Counterspell/Silence??
---
Great bindings btw!
---
It's not batched but it is thrown in a 0.5s queue. This is how it was in Vanilla and how it is in BfA. Log into it and try it out for yourself. The client and server has always had a bottleneck on looting - for the obvious reason of preventing a script/macro from looting a hundred mobs at once. Typical flood protection for anything tied to a database operation. Private servers handle that entire subject in a very unsophisticated manner. You're use to it being instantaneous, but that's not how it ever was or should be.
---
Winter squid . Autumn untill spring equinox.
---
If it’s a time thing: classic isn’t the best to play to casually pvp and nothing else, unless you do so not minding you’re at a big disadvantage.
---
If you have the time to play, you could consider a casual raiding environment or even pugging. Way less of a time commitment - hardly different than running a dungeon..
---
The spirit of classic though is that things are intertwined - that’s highly appealing to some, but not others. Retail offers players a way more segmented approach to only play certain parts
---
What?
---
You said when "the innervate button asks to come". I was just joking that they have a second button too.
---
Prostitution does not take holiday at all;)
---
There are some reallly really crappy epics in vanilla. Sometimes a new recruit would leave molten core with a full armor set! But these epics don't feel "epic". the truly "epic" epics drop on a very low drop rate. Items like talisman of ephemeral power, choker of the fire lord, onslaught girdle, etc. these highly contested items will only go to your guilds officers/top dps. Just seeing one of these items drop can take months, and if you're not first in line you could never miss a raid and go 8+ months without seeing a particular item you're after. So, if you're not the type to try hard and chase after those shiny bis items, then yes epics are easy to acquire in vanilla.
---
It's also just a lot more work to tank. The tank has to lead the party. Even if you're not leading, as tank you need to pay attention to the lead's instructions way more than the healer or DPS does.
---
But yeah, the blame thing is real. Even if you find a solid group to do dungeons regularly with, sometimes all it takes is one wipe for them to suddenly turn on you and stop inviting you.
---
I, like a lot of others, have no plans of using Discord except for my guild. Since Vent and TS are dead. Also gear score add ons have nothing to do with the forum experience.
---
Yeah he might have quit after wrath, but if you look at the armory archive:
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20151231071302/http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/blackrock/Savorx/advanced
---
And looking at the source:

Seems like sometime in 2017 armory broke and the neck slot seemed empty:
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20171227234554/https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/blackrock/savorx
---
And now if you browse his armory, seems to be missing, and he has seemed to have gained a single level since it was last seen in 2016. So he might be active on another character, just no longer sporting the neck.
---
Shit son! Bushwick in the house! Halsey stop off the J is poppin!
---
Horde!?
---
My deepest condolences, truly.
---
I am just multibox leveling to appease that side of me.  My major debate is whether or not to have a Druid or a Lock/Hunter.
---
A Druid tank is really easy to box.  A Warrior DPS is easy to box.  A warrior tank is hard to box.  If I shift Warrior to DPS while leveling, I can fit in a Bear tank, but that means I have to give up a ranged DPS slot that I was going to use.  
---
Decisions.  Tough, impactful, 192 hours of commitment decisions.
---
Its always been this way.  Logging out in the middle of the Barrens for awhile gives you a couple mobs of rested XP.  Even back in vanilla
---
Sure, but he key distinction is this: progression raids. Most guilds I remember playing WOW with wanted to do progression, and we did, but we enjoyed having people who were having fun. 
---
I remember we had a ret paladin in the guild. Great guy, put in his time healing and collecting ret pieces over time. People would pass stuff to him because he did so much for people. Eventually we had enough healers and he wanted to go ret. We supported that and we all enjoyed watching him do his best on the meters. We all cheered when he started reliably getting top 5-10 on the meters. 
---
The other thing that people often forget is: Same amount of loot every week. The more rogues, mages, Warriors, etc you bring? The more spread out the loot will be. I remember before pug raids were a thing we would have people pop over to certain characters or alts on certain bosses just so that loot didn’t get DEed. 
---
Again, this is a completely different social dynamic to what many people are talking about when they are thinking progression and min/max, the priorities are different. I prefer to think of the guild as a set of friends rather than 39 people who are simply a means to get me loot.
---
That’s false too. You probably closed the video after 5 seconds
---
Hakurai makes quality content... I was wishing he'd make a Horde one D:
---
Because you don't need to do any of that if you're same faction. You can just ninja-skin the devilsaur as soon as it's looted. And the first time around, the person who killed it would probably not be spamming the action button to skin, as soon as they loot.
---
And don’t forget, stress test on July 25th-26th!! If you have an active sub you can visit old Azeroth for 24 hours 👍🏻👍🏻
---
you keep saying things that make it feel even longer!  everybody knows the last 1% takes forever
---
Bro if you’re taking fucking 20 meme dps then sure. But you’re also misrepresenting the dps gap between hybrids in pre tier 1 and the dps requirements of all MC bosses if you think a standard raid with some subpar dps is gonna wipe because you didn’t class stack.
---
Hybrids get real bad later on because fights last longer and the tier sets are all healer oriented. The gear that is good for hybrids will of course go to pure dps first too, so BWL and on is heavily skewed towards pures. During Early MC you will do not good dps but not terrible and the requirement to kill any boss besides Rag is laughable with the right strat.
---
In Burning Crusade, Totems did reset the swing timer (they took it out in WotLK), so I assume it's the same in Vanilla.
---
This may get downvoted, but do we really need these posts? I know we are excited about the game coming out soon, I know we’ve been waiting a long time, but the last thing I want is to pull up this sub and just see a lot of countdown posts. It just feels like karma farming to me.
---
I didn't realize so many people hated resilience gear.  Was it just the concept of pvp gear or specifically the resilience stat?
---
If you don’t find it interesting please downvote it, i only spent 10 minutes writing it but I thought it was interesting - i like numbers.
---
I'd argue lot of what TBC adds feels like it cheapens the experience as well.
---
Let's go with your movie analogy for a second time. Imagine you've watched the original Star Wars movie, it's fantastic. Obviously there are some flaws, no movie is ever truly perfect, but the rest of it is absolutely amazing, especially for its time.
---
But then, instead of making Empire Strikes Back, he discontinues the original movie entirely and releases Star Wars: Special Edition. Since you liked the original movie, you go and watch this new version. And lo and behold, it fixes the parts you didnt like as much in the original, rewrites them into something much better. But it also rewrote many of the parts you liked and slipped up, making worse versions of the scenes you adored so much, and many new scenes that were added were not that good either. And unfortunately for you, the original version was discontinued and you have to go way out of your way to find it again.
---
Make no mistake, TBC was not an expansion to Vanilla WoW, but a replacement. The old world of Azeroth was replaced, made irrelevant entirely by the new continent of Outland. TBC added many new systems and removed many Vanilla mechanics that it deemed to be bad for the game (proper class balancing was done really well in TBC) but not all of the systems TBC added or removed were the right systems. Flying took away all the danger and charm of exploring this vast, dangerous world with tons of other players, both allies and enemies, and instead replaces it with a meaningless time sink that just takes you from point A to point B with no thinking required. Daily Quests turn the choice of logging in from something you *want* to do into something you *have* to do; it's extremely arbitrary, and it's obvious that they just tacked it on to keep players logging in, but for all the wrong reasons. 
---
Arenas completely replaced World PvP and Battlegrounds as the main PvP system, and now to get any PvP gear at all, you *have* to do these new arenas, even if they arent properly balanced at all and you liked the other PvP systems way more. Remember how every Arena duo out there had a Druid in it because they were overpowered in that kind of environment? So now if you want to get better PvP gear, instead of being able to queue up with your friends for battlegrounds, now you'll have to queue up with some random guy you dont know all that well (probably a druid, because not that many people played druid back then) just to make a competeny arena team that would actually get anywhere. Oh, and remember how PvE gear was worthless in PvP and vice versa for no good reason? It was a completely arbitrary mechanic that not only reduced the RPG aspect of WoW, but also reduced participation in both PvE and PvP, as raiders who wanted to try out PvP couldn't do so without being completely demolished and PvPers who wanted to raid would be laughed out of the group.
---
And yeah, I get that even if TBC is releases, the Classic servers will still be around. I hear so many people say that as a reason to make TBC servers. But the addition of TBC servers will hemmorage the population of the Classic servers as everyone is forced to move on to TBC, whether it's because they want to or because their friends or guild made the switch and they feel forced to go with them. I've seen the result of a population exodus firsthand in the Classic beta when everyone, including myself, reached level 40. People stopped playing because they felt there wasn't much to do anymore. Levelling an alt wasn't a great idea because there wasn't anyone else levelling a character, either. And when the friends that people leveled with in the beta leave and the server feels lonely, those who stuck around will slowly leave as well. I feel that the whole reason to leave 1.12 preserved as it was will be entirely meaningless, as without the players who make up the soul of the game, the reason to play WoW is removed. A singleplayer MMO isn't exactly a fun MMO. If Classic dies because TBC came out and essentially replaced Classic, I'll be absolutely livid.
---
Instant casts won't disrupt swings, it might just cancel the animation. With the exception of melee spells, I think. If you cast ms or something as your auto was supposed to come out the character will kinda just do the auto animation after the MS but the numbers should have processed simultaneously.
---
Yeah, definitely now that I think about it more because Seal of Command does precisely that every time it procs. I know there's not a spell being cast there but SoC causes the "melee ability" animation like ms does and the auto and proc damage completely simultaneously.
---
Talisman of ephemeral is stronger than it appears on paper. It's on par with the static trinket, but if a fight ends quicker than 2 minutes you got more value out of the on use trinket. Most fights in molten core are under 2 minutes.
---
Any word on if it'll be included in Classic?
---
I agree with much of that, though Kara was my fav raid.  I think there's room for 10-15mans.  I enjoyed flying quite a bit, perhaps there's a solution that will allow flying without ruining wpvp.
---
&gt; It's about what constitutes Classic WoW game design.
---
And since they banned automated situations such as Healbot and Decursive, removing Totemstomping is in-line with their balance decision.
---
&gt;How many changes are acceptable?
---
When the beta first launched you couldn't totemstomp because Classic is using the updated API and LUA system, which prevented macros from using Totem names in the /tar command-line. This was reverted because a couple people complained, but those same people didn't complain about all the OTHER changes the macro system has undergone going from 1.12 to 1.13.
---
We should not pick-and-choose which changes the macro system introduces. It should be all or none.
---
Linkin's Boomerang
---
The Unstoppable Force
---
Yeah actually that’s true but I don’t think it will, character creation is at like 99.6%
---
There’s also the Summer Bass, which will be available during the dates that the Winter Squid is not.
---
I tanked Deadmines as a hunter once. Did it for fun. Needed 2 healers but we finished it with no wipes.
---
Thanks so much for the content, seriously, but I think it bears updating to what is actually going to work in classic.
---
Hasn't the RAF rework been in development for quite some time now?
---
I dont see this as an issue. You'll want 2-3 proper tanks for all 4man raids and in some places you'll need as many as 8 tank-capable warriors.
---
Holy shit, did i really forget Counterspell? Muscle memory tells me it was at C and that would make sense as I didn't use Fireball/Scorch in the beta enough to remember exactly where they were. I'll have to double check at the next Stress Test.
---
I wouldn't bank on having much progress as an ele sham in AQ.
---
 Everywhere else you should be fine with downranking your spells to keep damage up for a bigger portion of the boss fight.
---
They do. It takes 6 seconds to put your whole set down.
---
Did Blizzard post that they fixed it somewhere? Or did people just notice it working in the beta client?
---
They could add a huge desert type zone only dedicated for PVP or something with objectives, that could be fun. Also building boats and naval PVP in WoW would be awesome if its feasible :D
---
Lmao you are right actually.  I would rather play on the real 1.12 client with the bad parts of the game actually fixed.
---
Sub 40 you can tank with almost anything.
---
I tried to find the OST cd at a reasonable price... But it's impossible :-/

---
So I recently became a member of the "go owl or go home" club (for soloing/leveling) when I finally really dug into what an owl (or carrion bird) can do for you. The screech ability not only does damage (while simultaneously lowering targets' damage), but also deals melee range AOE threat on a *very* short cooldown! 
---
Your pet may not hold aggro on a single mob your druid friend crits with his opener all of the time, but threat issues should usually be manageable if your druid pal lets your pet get a second growl off first. 
---
This is where it gets good though. On additional mobs you've pulled--so long as you've managed to have them in melee range with your pet--your pet will be dealing constant AOE threat to them without having to constantly switch its target to spread the threat around. Screech does a good amount of AOE threat, so by the time that first mob is down, the second will already have a pretty established threat threshold that your druid will be hard pressed to beat. If you coordinate which mobs you're burning down, this trend should continue indefinitely with each sequential mob having more established threat on your pet than the last.
---
Carrion birds, while not as... *aesthetically pleasing* as owls are more readily available throughout the leveling process as low level owls are really only available to alliance. Carrion birds, on the other hand, are all over the place. Compared to owls, they are a *little* more tanky at the *slight* cost of damage. They also have access to bite (which owls do not), but you shouldn't really need anything other than growl, dive, screech, and claw. 
---
Other pets *do* have merit, but nothing in my experience can compare to the utility and usefulness an owl or carrion bird brings to the table.
---
No worries about Hunters then..
---
You won't be queuing for anything, and there won't be assigned role markers on your portraits. If you'll use it, it's fine to need imo, especially while leveling! It's different entirely at level 60 if your ret paladin is taking the healers gear, or your healing priest is going for mage gear, those things should be mentioned up front
---
I'm relatively certain instant cast spells don't at all, regardless of class. As far as the game is concerned, Mortal Strike is a "spell" too, just it has a difference resource, 5yd range and scales with weapon damage.. and I'm pretty sure melee instants don't reset the auto timer.
---
Mouse buttons with modifiers
---
Mouse wheel Scroll up/down - Ctrl/alt/shift
---
That's 8 buttons right there. Follow the same with your side mouse buttons and that's a total of 24 keybinds from your mouse alone.
---
I always like having mobility assigned to my scroll wheels.
---
We are now closer to launch than launch is to you hitting level 60.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Yes you will mostly compete with people for cloth gear. And that gear will go to the mages/locks first so you might get it around the 4th-5th time it drops.
---
At least with imp reincarnation it's improving wipe protection and helpful while leveling.
---
Won't it be different for classic ?
---
Not much time left to build my new setup...
---
I also have played a shaman since vanilla and recently on p-servers. I think some people really underestimate how good totems are. 
---
I will say, the nature resist that mobs seem to have (at least on the pserver I was on) after level 55/58ish mobs in the world and beginning raids sucks until you get AQ gear.
---
I did try it in BFA.  Loot took between 98 and 230ms to appear in my chat log after mouse-up, and it did not show the same behavior classic does where you could predict when the chat message is printed based on the first piece of loot.  
---
I have never played on a private server, nor am I trying to assert it was ever instantaneous.
---
My lvl 1 herb bank always gets  at least 2 Satchel of Cenarius, just because she can :D
---
It'll probably be another 48 hour one.
---
WFH friday is going to consist of an occasional mouse move to keep the status green while leveling the frosty mage.
---
Thinking of a recurring weekly wednesday afternoon status checkpoint for an internal initiative to carve out some time as well.
---
People think WOTLK is good because it had most players but that only because it took a long time for WoW to get exposure. WOTLK was a HUUUUGE step in a wrong direction, wasnt an MMO anymore.
---
Well to be fair shamans were designed to be able to tank, it just wasn't properly fleshed out. The pure dps classes were not designed to tank at all.
---
Can a shaman if played decently well tank BRD?
---
Is a certain skinning level required for skinning certain mobs ?
---
If you have a pally judging wisdom you can melee between instant casts for more mana on raid bosses. Atleast that's mostly what I used it for.
---
Classic will still be there when you get back.  Booze and girls, 10/10.  
---
On the other hand, bring a laptop and sneak on when the party dies down and early AM before people are up.  Sleep is for the weak.
---
&gt; Its around 3-5% at level 60.
---
Predictions are it'll be around 15% at best.
---
It's mostly that innervate relies on your passive spirit based Mana Regen and pallies and shamans basically run 0 spirit on their gear so they get far less gem it than any given priest or even a druid
---
This is ridiculous.
---
*woosh*
---
Getting ganked and having your corpse camped is part of playing on a pvp server.  Warriors get hamstring and an aoe fear that could help  you get away but if it was someone who could beat your ass then anyway they would get around it.
---
Totally possible, someone would need to parse the packets involved in looting, but even then the server might consider it a spell even though it doesn't look like one to the client.
---
Or just put shit on reserve. A guy who spends 40 minute putting together a group deserves to get the item they're after if it drops. But they should be transparent about it and accept the consequences of having a harder time finding people to group with.
---
&gt;off-tanking.
---
that's still a raid role and druids are better at it.  Some fights like patchwerk druids are superior.
---
Hard disagree
---
People are super excited, and the sub is pretty dead outside of stuff like this.
---
One in a blue moon isn't terrible.
---
Sick!
---
I am a huge proponent of taking data from private servers and extrapolating. And I am active on private servers. In fact, I have far more total hours on private servers than retail... across all expansions (But I haven't played at all post cata other than just testing the new post cata experience with a trial account). 
---
I do feel that it's very important to not use private server data for specific classes of things, and number 1 with a bullet on that list is tiny mechanical interactions.... because classic is basically the post cataclysm game with the old database entries converted to the correct format, and then manual changes added.
---
For example, if you want to tell me about the relative scarcity of kinsgsblood and wild steelbloom? get right to it. Even if the drop rates of the herb nodes and recipes are off, it's unlikely they will by off by miles. Similarly, how rare is grave moss? I dunno, but if you wanted to do an analysis of private server data, I think it may be the best available info.
---
But if you want to tell me how easy it is for two people to polymorph each other simultaneously..... I will LISTEN if you talk about private servers, but I will find you far more credible if you look at beta footage.
---
situational really, you can only have 1 of each element though ... (2 for water? healing stream and mana tide?)
---
Well not really. With 6 shamans in the raid you can wipe once every 10 minutes and still have reincarnation available for every wipe. That's without improved reincarnation.
---
You'd be hard pressed to wipe more than once every 10 minutes because of how long it takes to revive the entire raid. Healers need to drink up every time they OOM from ressing people, then the entire raid needs to rebuff, then finally cycle through consumables and if that didn't take 10 minutes, it will definitely have taken more than 10 minutes before the raid actually wipes again.
---
6 shamans per raid is pretty much standard, if not a little low even.
---
Idk why people waste their time with that quest in the first place. Could grind the same amt of xp from mobs in the time it takes to walk across the desert.
---

Can't wait to wave my [Huge Brown Sack] in everyone's face
---
For the Horde baby!!
---
Free Action potions, rocket boots
---
I think it's fair to be upfront and state your reserves and then to tell the group ahead of time "I'm going to swap to ML for this boss to enforce the reserve on Ironfoe. Everything else will be free roll."
---
G2 keep her warm man, who else is gonna bring you hot food and mountain dew refills
---
Yes, at least on private servers (though geared decently well is also very important). Had a Shaman tank a couple of BRD runs I was on.
---
You and u/tetter might want to read [this post I made a month ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/)
---
Early on it's just hamstring and run. Hope you get out of combat to charge away to a mob.
---
At higher levels you'll fear then zerker stance to intercept away. Then mount out of combat. Warriors have crap for movement besides charges so use them creatively.
---
so... redbull is doing a race to 60 event @

---
Questing near other players of your faction will discourage people from messing with you. As a leveling warrior you will lose most 1v1 fights and there's not much you can do about that. 
---
They made some changes to layering (classics version of sharding) towards the end of beta making it much harder to switch layers so it's unlikely you'll be able to use that to get away from PvP.
---
You not been around this crowd that long, mate?
---
You have shamans legit being crybaby peepants about not being allowed to tank raids and not being allowed to tank the 55-60 instances where a warrior or even druid would be superior choices.
---
Any 3 of the chicken escorts I avoid.
---
And I'll be playing a damn gnome before I ever complete the barrens "free from the hold" escort quest.  That damn blood elf can rot in his "prison" for all I care. Ain't wasting 20 minutes on that escort.
---
I will however do Rin'Ji is trapped.  Gives a ton of UC rep and solid quest rewards.
---
That's not true, you still accrued it, just at 1/4 the rate, but the consensus seems to be that you did have to log in to the character at least once before it started accruing. However, I'm skeptical that many people ever tested that out 13 years ago and remember.
---
Personally I don't think it's likely, but I could see it happening depending on how Blizzard has things set up, and if it did happen, I don't think it would really matter as at the rate you'd accrue it you'd have maximum of just over 11 bubbles of rested xp before release, which is just over half a level, or like 6 kills.
---
Lets be honest... do you really want to do the content? Or do you just want a never eneding power difference between you and the people  who don't play as much as you.
---
This is one of the reasons WoW died. Content just for the sake of content. Not because its good but because neeeeeed content now!!!!
---
Druid tanks are viable, Highly recommend you check out taladril or skarm guides
---
Hey boss, i just remembered !
---
I am sick for about a week, starting 27th of August.
---
Thanks bye.
---
I just fully anticipate a shitload of “just one month! Just two weeks! Just one week! Three more days!”
---
Yea I guess it’s part of it. But I can still try to reduce it;)
---
Ahh yes both hamstring and aoe fear could work. I’ll keep those in mind and try not to use them needlessly for NPCs.
---
Im really happy Lupos will be nerfed for classic. Its good to have more pets be viable. Better than seeing every hunter with one of two cats and nothing else.
---
&gt; with tons of booze and girls and all I can think about is trying to hit lvl 40 and getting my first mount by the end of the weekend.
---
Bruh. Do I need to sit down and have a talk with your dick?
---
Maybe half those orcs are female
---
I’ve seen it done EXACTLY one time. And it was for RFC where pretty much anyone/anything can tank. Like. All it meant was he was a slightly bigger man an drain on the healer Han everyone else.
---
Some of the warrior quests were pretty cool in The Barrens with Fray Isle and going up the mountain to talk to the guy on top for the chest piece quest at level 14ish.  
---
Isha'Awak was a longer chain too.  I also liked the ones from the guy in TB which was a chain of 3 or 4 quests, but spread over almost 20 levels.  You had to kill Steelsnap and the yeti.
---
The shimmering flats quests are very vivid in my mind as well as the tanaris ones for pirates.  Then there's the quest in feralas to shrink the giants.  Obviously the Hemet Nessingwary quests are extremely memorable from the amount of PvP and his serene location on a river filled with crocodiles.  The stonetalon quests to go into the charred vale are also major ones that stand out to me.  The hillsbrad quests to kill the humans in the one town to the west are also super memorable.  Ashenvale has cool quests, but that entire zone blends together for me that none really stand out.  In dustwallow marsh there is the detective quest with the shield and the others at the creepy house surrounded by ghosts.
---
Abilities are different from spells. Sinister Strike is an ability not a spell so it doesn't incur the swing timer reset penalty.
---
Just finished reading it before you replied :) Great commitment to testing, thumbs up dude !
---
Watch the sun set on a grateful universe
---
Absolutely, it can devolve into that, and the mods can clean it up, we don't need a countdown thread every single day for sure.
---
You mean Silithus?
---
Rocket boots is a good tip. I will most likely be an engineer like I was in vanilla. Thanks! And free action potion not to get cc’ed I guess.
---
Super woosh
---
&gt;The fact is that they just aren't. It takes so much more time investment just to be comparable to a Warrior tank, as Feral. If you spent the same effort on a Warrior, instead, you'd be infinitely better than a Druid.
---
How?  explain
---
Loot lag in vanilla was an intermittent issue but you could sit there stuck in the looting animation for minutes while the game is trying to figure things out. Eventually the loot window would show, items would move, and you could continue. Sometimes you could slide around in that animation but you couldn't do anything else until it cleared up.
---
Good tips. Might be hard to work with but playing on a pvp server will most likely see me get a lot of practice lol.
---
i think it was in by the time aq40 rolled around .... seem to remember a story where some transfered to a low pop server to get the achievement and screwed the other people on the server as he did it at like 4 am
---
This is critical as without a&amp;d for turning you can't /dance and spin in a circle smoothly. You also can't bubble and then hearth while spinning to flaunt your powers. How the hell can anyone live without those things?
---
So you are *firmly* against pirating but participate in pirating because its not that same thing.
---
Got it, thanks.
---
Craftimg can be expanded without increasing its skill level, just add more recipes
---
just be enthusiastic about your character development and the game ... its like laughing at shit jokes, nothing new
---
If you are a fury and refuse to put on  tank kit in raid you won't be #1 anything
---
Yea I seem to recall being weak when I levelled. Ahh Oki. To bad about the layering changes but I guess the game is best without too much of it anyway
---
So?
---
I've been with a decent amount of girls over the past decade but I haven't had the thrill of lvling to 60 since like 2005
---
...I still like innervate tho....
---
I understand your point and agree with it, though I'm not sure as to why you would listen to a private server talk about two people attempting to polymorph one another compared to basic auto attacking, if anything such a thing is one of the most basic of things and regardless whether it be private or not it is universally known that auto attacks are not a part of the gcd,  so it would've worked either way.
---
It will be so closely split that it doesn't matter.
---
I actually don't participate in pirating. Conflating two separate things again. /sigh
---
Wow, I was just reading this for no real reason since ive PvPed on WoW for years, and have keybinds setup already. Since coming back to classic/pservers, I couldn't figure out what felt "good" to dismount. Honestly shift+space seems like it would feel perfect. Thanks.
---
Not many.
---
Probably none because of layering.  How many people will quit when layering ruins late game economy?
---
Yeah reserve is fine. The problem is always deception. Some people like to act like shit was implicitly understood beforehand though, that shit's annoying. Kind of specific to situation, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
---
You say "we made it", what happened ?
---
Ya I mean I think we will have too with some of the gear in the earlier dungeons that would help level staff of westfall comes to mind ring from vc and stockades will be must have pieces.  It is at later levels that balance is hard to have because you can't do enough dps without shadow.
---
Classic is dead confirmed. /s
---
The game isn’t even out and you are already crying.
---
Always duo level with friends. 
---
Fury can still tank dungeons so keep a decent shield on you.
---
Solo leveling will be slow and you won't be strong in pvp until your a geared lvl 60. You need those relationships early, and it will pay off with a raid slot later on.
---
People here genuinely talking about the class. I thought the hate was because of all the bugs and issues from the beta.
---
&gt;Some people just aren't capable of clearing anything above normal no matter what and some people just can't or don't want to commit the hours to a classic like design.
---
This is true, and the problem is that people can't grasp that that's okay. Like, no matter how oblivious you are to mechanics you will probably make it through at least half the raid if you choose to do so, I 100% believe that. Nothing wrong with that, really. You're still doing content and getting gear, and you might even get enough gear to just power through fights you messed up on. It's okay if you don't finish, and if you're not even raiding then why would you care anyways.
---
WoW players nowadays have just been conditioned to have their cake and eat it too; they get all the benefits of raiding without having to even work at it like before. And the raiding community (which is still the smaller community in modern WoW) is just dejected and a lot of them see no point in raiding other than prestige, and a lot still don't give a fuck about prestige and want to kill bosses, but again what's the point if you get the same gear everywhere else. It's fucking stupid lol. This and abysmal class design was what made me quit BfA early on.
---
 If all this were to change at all there'd probably be an outcry, which is dumb, because if you're not going to work at any of these fights or do anything challenging why the hell should you get equivalent gear? There's no point in someone having raid gear if all they do is like world quests and transmog runs of old raids. If they ever did change this philosophy and go back to like a semblance of how older expansions worked I would hope that Blizz would just tell people to suck it up and realize that the current state of WoW is killing WoW in general. 
---
TBH I want to play modern WoW, but I don't want to play it at all if they just continue down the same path: crap loot systems and shit class design. No amount of cool raids or cool zones makes me ignore the fact that the core game is busted lol. Thankfully Classic is coming out so I can get my WoW fix and not have to hate myself to do it. And hopefully they move on to TBC in the future for even more fun.
---
He didn’t list his standards, he simply said even if more people roll these classes it doesn’t necessarily mean they will be any good so don’t let the straw polls affect your class choice.
---
The reason I haven't gone into it, is there's no parses on non-private servers for that.
---
A support class is a class that helps others do their jobs better. Like pallys or shamans for example. Rogues aren't a support class because of suppression room; however it is the same story: at the time, the devs thought it would be nice to have a real reason why we should bring rogues in a raid. Tranq shot is literally "please bring hunters even though we know they suck", not "please bring hunters they have amazing support abilities."
---
I got 2 questions for you.  
---
1) Why are you lying?  
---
2) Why do you refuse to replicate the leeway test yourself?   
---
Ill give you $1.000 if you give me either   
---
1) Timestamp of Perplexity saying leeway in classic in bigger than private servers in that video  
---
2) Replicate the test that perplexity did yourself, but with another result.   
---
If you have no intention on doing any of those 2 things, but wanna keep lying or talking nonsense, dont even bother replying.
---
2-3k people per layer. Meaning with layering. Layering will be taken out by late game.
---
What's a big 4 guild?
---
&gt; a dumbshit MMO mouse because no one needs 12-24 buttons for their thumb
---
If you don't like it, that's fine. Why shit on other people's preferences when they don't affect you in any way? My left hand is in fucking agony, and WASD is hard enough with the rheumatism, so I love having 30 goddamn buttons on my right hand.
---
&gt;o shield (but have to know when to put shield on like when Scarlet Myrmidons enrage)
---
fuck these idiots that think they're special and they don't need a shield
---
2k population ÷  2 factions ÷  6 starting zones. That's actually not bad. Most pserver launches were like 10k-12k population on launch and they managed.
---
work work
---
No they aren't. People on the druid discord have done the math and gathered data from old vanilla videos coupled with the level 58 AV test. I was part of that effort - the predictions are 3-5%.
---
I remember Tanking in the early 40s on my shaman and it was very doable. It was easier than the impossible task of finding an actual tank
---
Guess I shouldn't play then since game is dead 2 months before.
---
I hear harlem ”breeds the smoothest n***as on the face of the earth” 
---
And that ”harlem peeps plays for keeps” 
---
Can you confirm?
---
Source: BIG L. 
---
Thanks in advance from Sweden.
---
I'm also going away for the weekend and will use it as a chance to build up a little rested xp after 4 days of hardcore grinding mon-fri. I'm not worried about being one of the absolute first to hit 60, a lot of those people you'd be grouping with will be tryhards. If anything I think it will help me stay off burning out because I'm already taking the week off work for launch and I'm sure I can only do so many 12-16 hour days of leveling before I start to get sick of it.
---
Yeah, it would be. I guess we'll see soon enough how it's all gonna play out, but I believe the same, their will be a place for dedicated bears (and cats, to an extent.)
---
Lol ain't no one in a big 4 job got no time for that
---
As a druid, cool.
---
Play with a friend, any friend.
---
40 players in the raid, 20-27 pieces of loot drop during the run, between the odd bonus roll for a weapon on a boss and the odd BOE on trash. Lets discount Onyxia for now.
---
Lets say the average week lets 25 epics from the run.  Thats .625 epics a week per person. 
---
Assume your guild probably has 60 or so people that run over the course of a given month.  So assuming you're an average player of an average role, thats 2.33 raids per month per person. 
---
.625 \* 2.33 = 1.45625 epics a month on average in a 60 player guild. 
---
That assumes loot is randomly and equally distributed. 
---
In reality, dependent on your class and role, MC may only have weapon and the odd off pieces for you (Plate belt/gloves, cloth belt, leather healing shoulders, for example)--if you're following strict adherence to BIS (prophecy and arcanist are proper shit).
---
This is false, and I've answered why ret paladins can actually be effective users of Nightfall, many times throughout the comments.
---
People have covered everything well, but I will throw in why I quit private servers. I had hit 60, and was starting to work on getting gold for my epic mount. I was getting pretty close, then one day I logged in and all of my money had vanished. Not even a single copper left. My password was very strong and the rest of my stuff seemed to be untouched, so it didn't seem to be a hacking issue. I contacted the folks who run the server, and they said there was nothing they could do. All that work and time was just gone. Never touched a private server again.
---
No private server has even lasted that long.
---
Wut? I played hunter in classic and this 100% happened to me while trying to grind devilsaur leather... idk why you’re trying to call bullshit when you clearly have no fucking clue what the fuck you’re talking about... even with flare a good rogue with good timing will fuck your day up and then disappear when your friends get there to help. It’s literally how their fucking class plays you dipshit.
---
By the way I haven't followed the recent development on this projections, at the early stage we thought it would converge, where do we stand exactly on that?
---
For the armor, rest to see if it will compensate the 10% more parry on bosses.
---
Honestly it’s a good point. I’m not sure how I’m gonna feel after doing it the first three days until it happens.
---
Some people may not play for the first couple weeks if it's really bad. 
---
My friend wouldn't even level during the stress test because of there being to many people. 
---
On the other hand I love seeing hundreds of people questing together even if it means it takes me longer to level. 
---
I love when the game feels alive.
---
People don't 'quit' immediately. They leave and try again later. If they arn't having fun later, then they go back to retail.
---
Better question is how low before the tourists get bored and leave.
---
Winter Squid and Summer Bass.
---
Because a lot of Holy Paladins not doing PvP take Imp Might because they go ret to farm on the side.
---
1000% confirmed
---
Invisibility potions is nice to have if you get camped.
---
You strongly overestimate how much work we do.

Don't rest. Get skinning up and hit the crater ofc
---
Warriors became more popular as dps not because of how well they scaled but because of the 1.12 talent rework. Scaling wouldnt have matter if fury was still shit.
---
Zug zug
---
Sub 40 you can 3 man most shit as long as you have a tank or healer or classes with good sustain and pots/bandages. Was pretty fun doing triple warriors with friends and took turns putting on sword and board to take some hits while the guy that was just tanking bandaged up, usually could do that indefinitely, sometimes you’d start to hit a wall with recently mended or whatever and kiting became necessary
---
Oh yeah I forgot that came from those. I always hated chicken and parrot pets in vanilla so just kinda wrote it off heh.
---
Sure, but we're talking about auto attacks here are we not ?
---
The auto-attack mechanic hasn't been changed since it was implemented, some tweaks were made to how attack speed affects it but the actual mechanic for auto attacks in BFA and vanilla (2004) is exactly the same, I'm talking about the way it functions not it's dps values and miss /dodge/parry potential.
---
So it's safe to say that it would function the same way universally, if you don't trust private servers for that you can even test it in BFA, it still functions the same way.
---
You've always been able to weave melee during gcd downtime, it's just that people didn't wanna bother with it because it was exhausting to maintain.
---
How are you so stupid, I read this whole thread and it REALLY exposes your inexperience with Vanilla. You thought a rogue was sapping HIS OWN FACTION?!?! literally are you retarded?? Because you seem retarded..
---
Actually it's not, because people who want to save their DKP for key items, can cause items that are actually upgrades to get sharded for no reason. &gt; . &gt;
---
I think most pservers have dynamic respawns, I don't think classic will.
---
So what's meme about former memes becoming very viable in Burning Crusade? It happened to all classes and specs.
---
I bet more people will quit because of faction imbalance and dying while leveling.
---
If only we could group up and get credit for kills and complete quests with other players at the same time...
---
Me: "Damn that sucks lucky I have no friends... Wait..."
---
True, but then again it's definitely quite hard to balance. World buffs were an afterthought during vanilla, it's true it could be a lever today.
---
But for the rest, how do you keep an aimshot from one shotting a clothie if their dps scales? (pet could work as well, but honestly no one wants to depend on a buggy pet IA, so I understand why it isn't pushed more.)
---
I stated the truth. Perplexity literally claims that Classic has way more leeway range than private servers. He's LITERALLY super butthurt about it and won't stop complaining about it, so wtf are you on about.
---
I'm in Flatbush and this sounds EXACTLY what I'm looking for. Would love to recreate some of my fond dorm room moments of late night raids... Which I'm terrible at haha.
---
Good point. And those only work outside combat probably. But get to corpse....turn alive and pop it and run away and hide. Mount up and ride like the wind.
---
Thanks !
---
I personally just use the mic on my webcam.
---
Well technically this is the second vanilla launch lol
---
Nice.  Been to NYC once. Would go again.
---
That was a good chuckle ty
---
If he isnt pants on fire excited to show and teach you everything about the game then I suppose Im not sure he has a personality. 
---
Don't ask us! Ask him!
---
These Shard bags are really expensive :(
---
1,000 hours /played to make it to 60? Must be a warrior.
---
I can get behind that sentiment.  All or none.
---
Have a great day, u/brodhi.  Been a pleasure chatting with you.
---
I played Druid tank on vanilla private servers for a while. Tanked all 5 man dungeons just fine and had a secure off tank spot in raiding. It’s fine, but at the end of the day it’s just not as good as a warrior no matter what way you spin it. Druids are one of my favourite classes but eventually I re specced due to the lack of cleanly defined gear sets. It made upgrading a very slow and painful process so bare that in mind if you want to play one. You can play it, just be prepared to upgrade slower than your buddies and be prepared to put more work in.
---
I'm sure this will fit the bill then! Send over your contact details such as discord ID or email. Will be blasting invites this evening
---
Depends on how much you play.
---
Is that a potion?;)
---
A group is a maximum of 5 players. There may very well be hundreds in each starting zone.
---
Armor from AGI is always a 2:1 ratio. Dire Bear Form does not increase this, only your armor from items.
---
It's not gonna be that bad.
---
Depends on the week. 
---
Are you looking at EU or US servers?
---

But there -are- rets who will do it and be happy to do it.

 **Discord Server:** uHbVxpA
---
Your absolutely right and I don't think layering will work quite how I played it out but just trying to paint a picture. It'll be crowded at launch but not bad enough for ppl to insta quit... I hope.
---
Probably not a feasible option for me but I understand the reasoning
---
I feel so bad for Thrall. To see all his hard work flushed down the drain my Garrosh. Then again with Sylvanas. He really should just dismantle the Dark Portal and stay in Nagrand. Fuck Azeroth.
---
The spreads were pretty ridiculous. IIRC uldaman was pretty cake with a group 35-40 but the last boss would wreck your shit if you had more than a couple people below like 45
---
Its really funny you dont wanna earn 1000 bucks for providing a timestamp for when he says that tho? xD
---
UBRS/LBRS, BRD, DM, Strat and Sholo
---
Dunno, 8-9 people maybe?
---
That's 333 people per starting zone...
---
Sakujo's point still stands, link the video of a Paladin tanking 4HM like you claimed it's the internet you have some time to dig it up.
---
I’m going to be doing most of my playing from 12am-6am so I’m hoping most people are sleeping when I’m out and about.
---
Skinning can be really rough if youre leveling in a group as everyone has to loot the creature before you can skin it. If you do alchemy along with herbalism you'll at least have self sustaining professions.
---
That's the thing. I didn't know that. At all. I had no reason to.
---
I certainly didn't try hitting stuff with a stick while spamming arcane explosion playing a mage in wrath. And I didn't HAVE any sub 1.5 speed weapons while leveling. As a mage, I always got the biggest slowest staff I could find, to frontload damage. (I didn't actually know if the swing timer was reset by casting, I was not that sophisticated during wrath). 
---
It now appears, on testing, that it does function the same way on pservers and the beta (presuambly, I haven't tested it on beta).. but I had no way to know that, and it was far more convincing to me to see footage of the game I intend to play (beta), than anything else.
---
Which faction do you expect to have more players?
---
I played Warrior from Vanilla to BFA as a Tank.
---
I was planning on doing the same for Classic, until I spent a few weeks on the forums/this sub.
---
Now everyone wants to be a Warrior Tank. I think I'll go Paladin or Druid and meme my way through Classic.
---
Better than being another drop in the sea of Warrior Tanks.
---
Because....reasons?
---
&gt; new topics

I wish I had my old c'thun kill shot, I made it into a p sick wallpaper too back in the day.

I suggested adding realms that has slower progression or even stops at phase 4. I'm little Jimmy now and have learned my downvote lesson.

Someone set up a timer for Illidan's sake!

I'd rather take 2 warriors and 1 bear instead of 3 warriors
---
Bonus question: (I'd google but I'm at work and results would be blacklisted) What recipes are these two used in?

I don't believe it is batched, I believe the delay is due to something different. Either way, my addon fixes the issue!

That would be the case if this sub in any way shape or form represented what you'll see in classic. This whole subreddit is a minority. There will be tank shortages in Classic.
---
The 2 bis weapons for Ret is actually flurry axe and manual crowd pummeler
---
IF I could pick I would bring 0, but hey, the comp is up to each and every guild, it's not like vanilla is hard.
---
you can only have max 8 melee on the boss without them being too close to each other and risking chaining eye beam
---
I dunno man, with knowledge of how the game actually works now, faster more reliable internet, the ease of an onboard graphics chip being able to handle 40 man raids on modern Wal-Mart PCs, I think you'll be amazed what people do with smaller numbers.
---
This is awesome stuff - I will lean heavily on it for my dungeon grind. A few things I would  add:
---
1. Warforged Chestplate is really good and avaliable at 40 (although I doubt you could do the quests at that level)
---
2. Southsea Head Bucket is a decent helm - especially if you want to start building a mitigation set
---
3. Nightscale Girdle is a good belt (and there aren't many for an alliance leveler)
---
Meanwhile in my financial services gig, im the youngest by a decade, and all the dudes here today struggle to text let alone understand persistent digital worlds.
---
Warlock has more mitigation, more stamina, and better pets in PvP for 5yds less range and arguably less Cc, but with hunters having scatter and trap on DR that's in the air as well.
---
I’ll give it a go:

Blackrock Depths, Lower Blackrock Spire, Dire Maul, Maraudon (princess runs for gold), Scholomance, Stratholme Undead, Stratholme Live, sunken temple, Zul’Farrak (for carrot)
---
[Best vid I could find](https://youtu.be/BpFkrGF0RDs)
---
Totally depends on the week, agreed. But if you're working hard you haven't discovered how to be a good consultant yet.
---
We would be US, East Coast, PvP, and Horde!
---
My experience with shaman tanks as a healer  in rfc sfk and wc have been lack luster. If I crit with my heal then they couldn’t get back the aggro. Also pulled 2 enemies ? then one of them is on him and one is on me or another dps
---
If I see a group without a warrior tank I leave it’s just a waste of time
---
nice idea! That might work
---
No melee mage, or bow rogue, or "melee hunter" (looking at you 'Nightfall' hunters) is going to buff the entire raid, allow you to bring one less Holy Paladin (allowing another Dwarf Priest and still get all paladin buffs), AND put a mana-regen (Judgement of Wisdom) debuff up on the boss that allows all your casters to go longer without stopping.
---
No. I want *only* talking about his own faction. Plus the mafia transcends factions. Something you didn't know?
---
I played Vanilla for its entirety. Sorry for your bad assumption.
---
Stop thinking Fury/Prot is going to be a thing just because Skarm does it in T3 with a Thunderfury.
---
Fury/Prot is a thing when you have BWL and AQ on farm and you're so geared to the teeth that you literally have to go Fury /Prot just to allow your DPS to let loose.
---
Even in full T3 and Thunderfury Skarm takes ALOT of damage for a Tank.
---
Stop thinking people are going to Fury Tanking in their pre BiS. They won't.
---
No it's part of the current plan, so they can tell investors that newer retail is the cause of the bump in player base.
---
How bad do you think they'd look if it was separate subs and classic got 2 million, and retail lost 1 million?
---
Grilled Squid: +10 agil
---
Hot Smoked Bass: +10 spirit
---
So would most people that followed the game's theorycrafting in the latest years. Especially seeing as threat will be even more important than before, considering the decreased armor for the dps, and the extra parry for the tanks.
---
No it really doesn't come down to that. If your going to raid naxx, then everyone in your guild can surely get revered and spend ~80-100 gold to get attuned. especially when they KNOW IT IS COMING 2 YEARS IN ADVANCE
---
Excuse me but are we talking tier 2 set or the actual class?
---
Back in TBC, after I just started playing, I was a terrible paladin who thought he was a big boy, and insisted on tanking dungeons with my 2 hander and full ret spec. It's definetly possible to pull this off, especially on lower level dungeons, but I was so incredibly terrible that most dungeons ended in wipes and severe frustration for everyone involved (except me, I was always having a blast). Anyways, I remember one time running Uldaman and the enhance shaman just getting fed up with my bs, equipping a shield and having a go at tanking. I recall getting pissed off and trying to hold aggro off of him, and failing miserably. He tanked the entire dungeon after that and we didn't wipe anymore.
---
In dungeons that aren't end-game, just roll on what you'll actually use. It's understood that tanks and healers need dps gear to solo. On the other hand, if you've already picked up some healing or tanking stuff, and the primo item drops for the dps person, it's polite to let them have it. Being a loot hog is not how you make friends. No single item will make or break your character early on, but having friends that want to dungeon with you can certainly make your experience better.
---
Agreed, but that's the point. You do not need to have any skills to be a consultant. Frame the conversation so that the client figures out what to do (unless you are implementing, and if you are FS prolly not your specific role).
---
If you are leveling with friends, one of the best things you can do is turn FFA on for loot.
---
Yup I've noticed this and commented on it on the Stress test.
---
Not only is it like that for looting, but also when you /say a message. There's a noticeable delay. And I also believe it's there for the MailBox?
---
"It's just like this for stress test bro" was the average response every time.
---
Agreed. Playing the stress test, even when Blizz was screwing with the layers and the lag was TREMENDOUS, I could basically loot and walk away. Even if everything was still in the loot window I'd get it eventually. This seems like a complete non-issue to me.
---
I never said anything about hunters. I'm well aware that Fengus' Ferocity and Rallying Cry will not affect ranged AP in Classic, and they didn't on private servers either. It's unfortunate but that's the hand hunters were dealt in vanilla. There will still be at least 3 hunters in most guilds so it's not like they will be completely underrepresented, and on the plus side when Classic finishes its run they will be gods in TBC pve.  
---
I was responding to the guy above me because he kept going off about "world buff exploit" when the world buffs will be as accessible to the guilds who try hard and therefore calling it an exploit is a stupid way to try and say that they won't be (mostly) as prevalent as they were on private servers.
---
Holy shit.
---
Hmm our Group is central Europe and Alliance. So a perfect match.
---
But glad to see that there are more of us.
---
Hmmm. Probably Frostmage Hunter and then Rogue/Warrior I would say. Most every class has peels. Druids can root and stun. Warlocks can fear and deathcoil. Shamans can frostshock and earthbind. Paladins probably have the worst peels with basically just 1 stun outside of trinkets or engineering
---
Then you... didn't have friends to help you? Sorry you had no friends :(
---
And reported for namecalling. Enjoy your warning.
---
I think its on par or a bit better than asscandy don't you?
---
Awesome, same deal, thanks.
---
Discord is...    Lemmiiwinks1#6827
---
I'm awake now, going to look into this ... who compiled this exactly? Is this private server stuff or -- what is this thing?
---
&gt; if the player in question is any good/geared
---
Key factors.  Some players don't give a flying F about their gear, some have no idea how to run a shaman tank and they don't care about wiping the group until everyone quits, and some are both.  Players who care about playing their class &amp; spec properly get mad respect from me.
---
Thanks that was my point we have banks for a reason.
---
indeed, people keep referring to bears as a memespec, but they  weren't really, and when AQ40 hits and they get some gear they are going to pull their weight. And they can go cat while not tanking.
---
Lmao you’re a literal moron if you thought he was sapping his own faction.. did you even read his first comment? Are you even literate? Because this entire comment thread makes you look like an illiterate moron... probably because you are.. go back to pservers kid. They need your xtra chromosomes... so pathetic.
---
Yup, a ton of people jump into instances where they are about the entrance mobs level, or as early as they get quests for it.
---
That will really depend on servers. Probably more alliance in general but servers will have their own specific imbalances.
---
But it's private server parses.
---
You mean other than the fact there was exactly *one* viable dps spec in the TBC prepatch?
---
Ya but it only takes about 10-20 minutes to get through the starting zones so ya right off the bat 333 ppl flooding the starting zones but an hour after launch it'll be more like 50-100 ppl. I'm also pulling these numbers out of my ass and have no way of proving any of this so don't quote me. All I'm trying to say is don't worry too much about it, it will be crowded but doable if layering works as intended.
---
Well, because it's a gnome /r/ATBGE
---
Yeah i feel you. I'm just saying the hunter is better for nightfalling specifically. One of the pserver guilds had this guy that would stream dressed in an anime onesie and nightfall huntered EVERY, SINGLE, RAID. It was really strange but I would love one of those people in my guild lol
---
Alternative: Make friends with a lock or a pally.
---
We'll have 50-100 gold to spare. If you're 30 gold shy, I'll happily lend you 30g.
---
If you'll repay 60g once you ding 60 (an amount you should easily have)
---
&gt; I want to try and have all my add-ons ready for Launch. Will I be able to install all the add-ons on the stress test on July 26? Are the classic Addons ready? I couldnt find them on curse. 
---
A good few are ready, and yes you can try them.  
---
The client between the stress test and the release may be different enough to break one or two addons, but this is unlikely, and even if it does I imagine they'd be quick fixes.
---
&gt; 2) at what level should i start disenchanting gear? During vanilla, i would just vendor greens and blues for money due to me being lazy. Should i start disenchanting greens asap even for money at low levels? 
---
If you aren't planning on levelling enchanting and just have it to make money off the materials, then the answer is it depends on the item. Some items vendor for far more than the mats they produce, two handed weapons *usually.* The short version if just get used to looking at the vendor price and making an educated guess.
---
Nothing really compares to the mace rogue warlock.
---
Thank you for making me check, I believe I am mistaken. I must have made that assumption due to the resource i am looking at not listing it under phase 1(pre-raid) best in slot. 
---
This must be because the plans drop off level 61+ mobs (and the number of arcanite bars needed) and will be extremely unlikely you can get them before phase 2.
---
WoW will still be there after the weekend, but that trip won't be available the following weekend.
---
Why would I bother looking through his Twitch VODs for that when you obviously are not going to pay, you've proven yourself to be a dishonest and mad person.
---
I was prepared to be underwhelmed, but that is such an amazing find. I still have my WOTLK box somewhere, and my Vanilla discs have been riding around in my truck since October, just been too lazy to get them framed. Awesome find dude, grats.
---
100%
---
Yes, IRL intelligence potion.
---
Then roughly 333 people per starting zone with competition decreasing as time goes on. Doesn’t seem too bad to me tbh.
---
Question is highest level dungeons a standard 60 could solo.
---
OP wasn't quite clear.
---
IF YOU GO TO DARN. AS PRIEST YOULL MISS YOUR DWARF LVL 10 QUEST. It is only available from Kharanos Inn. Just a component of your decision making.
---
Alliance as usual overall but more pvp players go horde so in bgs you'll have more horde.
---
I always do ZF while leveling, never thought of a 60 not having the carrot!
---
Love you longtime.
---
Why would it ruin late game? It’s supposed to be gone by p2. Idk man that’s first 25% of the game so hardly late game. The economy will works itself out (prob won’t need to tho cause why would it? Supply and demand will be there and is constantly changing due to different needs with different the current content)
---
Ok. Another solution would be wait a week or two, compete with other people who don't want to fight crowds (who will probably refuse to group), and argue with them when they tag "your mobs".
---
I actually hope the people who want to rush level 60 and clear content fast get burnt out and leave. I want to hang with chill people who just want to take in the experience and enjoy the ride.
---
if people didnt know who blood faith was, they never made it to level 60.
---
i was on unrivaled dominion, profro.  my buddy was in blood faith as frokusblakah
---
I didn't think he was sapping his own faction. Duh?
---
But guess what. The alliance and horde mafia protect each other against this. Sorry you didn't know that, that's what I was talking about. Pretty obvious because...duh, you can't fucking sap your own faction.
---
No, the average person only plays about 20 hours a week.
---
240 hours /played = 3 months = 2016 hours.
---
Even record speed of ~120 hours is 1008 hours.
---
No system is perfect. and holy shit I just realize I wrote up a novel on this.  Sorry for hitting you with a wall of text.
---
I was in a DKP guild and there was plenty of drama with it, more so if you're a person who buys a bunch of weapons to try out specs (rogue/warrior) and can get big time in the hole.  However, that was in vanilla and moving towards TBC, I got smarter on my DKP spending and made spreadsheets that had a DPS% gain / DKP per item.  I only bought items that were above a certain threshold.
---
As for penalizing people who don't take upgrades.  There's no sense in picking up an item that gives you a half of a % DPS upgrade when that item could be a 4% upgrade.  You shouldn't be penalized for that.  The only difference is when an item is going to get disenchanted, someone should pick it up, but again you probably shouldn't be charging people for it.  But at the same time, it becomes pretty obvious if someone is whoring points and bypassing on very good upgrades, it ends up hurting everybody.
---
Officer loot, there can be other drama on that.  How are you determining the upgrades?  Highest DPS gain it goes to?  In some cases you reward people who might have bad items (had that in a prior guild where a rogue buddy lost a shadowcraft belt because someone else had a dusky belt to his higher level blue belt).  Then it's a matter of how the officers are keeping track and distributing, some people might feel someone gets more items or more favorable (i.e. weapon, rings, trinkets) upgrades while other people get boots and gloves.
---
In the end, it's hard to really figure out a fair loot system.  Someone is going to be upset, but DKP is probably one of the more straight forward ones that people know how many people are in line in front of them for items.
---
If I was to do something that was an idea loot system?  Do a sort of a hybrid of DKP/officer distribution.  All class officers should be in discussion with all the players, they should have priority lists.  More or less, every class going in the raid should know if X drops Y is going to get it.  Any cross class items (rings/trinkets/weapons) should be discussed between officers and have class priority lists.  So stuff like bows/guns/xbows go to hunter first then melee and melee weapons go to warrior/rogue first.  Everyone in the guild knows that priority list and that is made public.  So again, going into the raid if a Brutality Blade drops, they know if it's going to a warrior/rogue or a hunter and then in the class they know what person is getting it.  You then keep track of loot with DKP behind the scenes.  Everyone gets tracked on items, side grades or "it was going to get disenchanted, I'll take it" items will be very marginal hits on gear or simply get /random rolled off to those interested.
---
In an ideal world, everyone is on the same page.  Everyone knows where loot is going and people are willing to pass on a 0.5% DPS upgrade to give a 5% upgrade to the guy who is actually at the bottom of the list to get an item.
---
But people are greedy and biased, so you need some sort of organization and smart people as officers to let everyone know why they reject an item request for someone.
---
Lmao reporting me for name calling ? How sad are you? You get overwhelmingly proven wrong so you report... for name calling... so fucking pathetic kid.. seriously sad, go back to pservers kid, they need your unearned hubris. I really can’t imagine how sad of a life that you live..
---
Classic is used on a very recent engine. So, those specified.
---
This is the best one yet!!
---
Decay works better than passing penalty, because you can't expect the raid lead to know what each class' best in slot is and whether you are passing because the gear actually sucks or because you are hoarding.
---
Okay real talk since this thread is pretty derailed with useless bashing.
---
I've always played a melee and have definitely loved playing a few casters over the years. But for one reason or another I always just found myself going back to the melee playstyle. Idk what it is but I just enjoy it more. 
---
With that being said, I'm torn as well b/t warrior and mage for classic. Recently played a hunter thru AQ40 on a pserver and loved the playstyle, but still just yearned for a melee class. If I go warrior, I think I'm ready to accept my fate that even the worst of mages will likely beat me simply due to the rock-paper-scissors balance of the vanilla pvp system. 
---
For me, it just boils down to which playstyle I've enjoyed the most over the years, and then it will be a fun change to warrior since I've played shaman most of those years.
---
I mean the first week you should expect chaos but there's so much you can do if you don't want to mob compete. You could work on professions. You could set up at your bank char.  You can avoid kill quest and keep doing other quest until the pack spreads out. You could do low level dungeons.  I probably plan on just picking a good area and just grind to out level people who are waiting to kill specific mobs. It's been proven grinding effectively is about the same as questing.
---
You just weren’t prepared for the people who count down in hours
---
To me one of the biggest is community. Simply the nature of private servers being at best a legal grey area axes out a huge segment of the population and has a bias for selecting towards toxic assholes. The amount of racism in large private server chats gets pretty bad.
---
I don't think this sub is remotely useful for gauging actual interest in basically any part of classic. Lots of selection bias based on the type of players who are still totally obsessing over WoW (us) vs. the vast majority of people who will actually play the game, who don't really care to engage too much in the silly speculation going on in here. 
---
Not talkin smack about the sub. i refresh at least 9 times a day. Just.. I'm not a normal WoW player, you aren't either, and everyone here is drawn for a reason.
---
Personally, if I wanted to roll on gear for an offspec I would tell the group at the beginning of the dungeon, just to be polite and give them a heads up. If they weren't chill about it I would probably find a different group.
---
I raided with Kalil.  She was the main tank for unrivaled dominion raid 2.  she was a redneck from the south that always screamed at her kids on microphone lol.   any wipe she would say for us to figure out shit out when she went on a smoke break.  was good shit.
---
Play with friends.  If that isn't an option, play a night elf so you have faster corpse runs.
---
If anything, the viability of moonkin DPS might be an interesting icebreaker topic
---
They changed The Nicker to 'Blackrock Slicer' -- even on the classic servers, I believe.
---
Don't break the rules? Pathetic you need to call people names to make your (ridiculous) argument. 
---
If you wouldn't say it to my face, don't say it online. And you wouldn't say it to my face.
---
skarm's guild does the world buff exploits.  Anything is viable when you break the game.
---
But also on the d/l damn you for getting me hyped to play shaman again. I had plans to be an ally priest. Ughhhh decisions decisions.
---
Np, it's not perfect-- and I gotta make some edits to it today.
---
Alchemy is a good gold maker, arcanite transmute is free significant money every 2 days or whatever the cooldown is.  Once you have some gold you can just buy your own mats as well and try and sell the Arc bars at a greater profit.
---
Absolutely what I was trying to convey... an improved version, more of the same good stuff, as opposed to more stuff for the sake of it / to make things easier.  Heroics were so much fun, still challenging and fun to pug even by the end of tbc.
---
Is it for US or EU?
---
Running a guild takes too much effort. This time around I certainly will not be starting a guild. However I would happily join a casual RAIDING guild. If the guild does raids and other group activities, I'm down.
---
Lmao his first comment was about sapping and you construed that as same faction. You’re pathetically stupid, delete this account and start a new one where you don’t pretend you played vanilla when it’s incredibly obvious you’re a full of shit retail player. Go back to retail and collect your free gear you goddamned scrub. Pathetic.
---
It depends how you look at it.  Half the raid should get something, depending on what drops.  But you can be unlucky and get all warlock set drops when they already have it.  Or you never see an item for months.
---
I'm sure this time around, everyone is going to be staring at a BiS sheet that tells them every piece that they SHOULD have.  But the reality is, there are still a bunch of side grades and non-optimal but still good for the raid to have items.  
---
But you very well can have it be months you get nothing but in the same raid you could get showered in items.
---
As for 4 months, I doubt that long.  You're bound to get something at that point in time.
---
No upstate love. Oh well, il be rolling alliance this time through anyway :(
---
I'm bothered by how all the orcs look. Why do they all look fat with REALLY wide calves? Also they all seem to be really short, if you compare to the wolves sizes.
---
I’l have my wife make up a brew:)
---
As many have said there are a variety of factors such as how many other people play your class/spec, how many bosses your guild downs in a week, type of loot rules your guild implements and the variety of the drops themselves. If you're in a meme spec guild that struggles to clear MC every week and you're 1 of 5 fury warriors in your guild then it may be a few weeks or more till you get an upgrade. Better guilds beat more bosses which means more loot. It's one of many reasons that slower progressing guilds become feeder guilds to progression guilds
---
Where they should be. In their kitchens.
---
I mean it is theory craftable based on the data we have from classic you can theorise details.
---
A 5 second Nightfall proc, will only give you time for one swing once you proc it, and actually, swapping it out gimps your ability to refresh the proc (which can happen because Nightfall is not procs-per-minute.) So even if it proced 50% of the time, you're gimping your raid by not leaving it on full time.
---
Someone who cares about their raid shouldn't do this if they're trusted with Nightfall. =/
---
Never played past the first couple weeks, but you make a lot of bad assumptions so not surprised you did it again.
---
Hybrid specs are average to amazing at PVP, they lack a little in PVE unless they are healing. Some of them can be just as beneficial as high damage mages/rogues when considering all you can potentially bring to the table (since you are support even in damage specs).
---
We've been playing WoW and WoW clones ever since 2004, with rare exception. When the game was new so were a lot of the standards it created or helped create. We're going back as experts, even those that never played Vanilla.
---
Don't you mean \[Small Blue Pouch\]?
---
who's actually wants a couch from 1984.
---
Ohhh so now its on some random twitch video huh? Lets take a few steps back:   
---
You:  You just linked a video of one of the guys that PROVES that privas have less melee range than Classic does. 
---
Me:  Except he doesnt provide private server footage for comparison? And actually never says the word: Its higher than private server, but just states that its very high? 
---
You:  Perplexity 100% ABSOLUTELY says that the leeway range is more than on private servers.   
---
So now 1) is out of the way, lets move to 2) Give me any proof that im wrong. Replicate what perplexity and come back with a different result.  
---
0.1 Btc for you if im wrong, better hurry up, its dropping fast atm.
---
Lmao oh you’re an internet badass now? Lol go back to retail you fucking neck beard baby bitch who has to cry to mods because you made an idiotic argument. Go cry to your Waifu pillow you sad sad sad little man. I actually feel so bad for you..
---
Yea I wish I could play a night elf. Hey have shadow melt don’t they? Unfortunately I kinda have a strong draw to play a human warrior.
---
I've duo-tanked as BM hunter/Voidwalker and we bounced aggro up through WC.
---
Thanks for you clear explanation! I think it will be quite interesting for people new to healing.
---
I basically entirely agree with you, with one exception: whilst its absolutely true that downranking becomes better at max level due to gear scaling, I disagree with the notion that this would mean it’s not really worth it prior to obtaining +healing gear. The benefit you’re ignoring, especially at lower levels, is that it allows for flexibility in healing, although you do allude to it; only using max rank whilst levelling will severely cripple your  healing abilities when healing group content due to the mana cost / over-healing proponent. In a raid, you can coordinate (something you suggested too), but casuals will mostly be solo healing RFK, SM, Mara, etc. and you absolutely will want to have flexibility in the mana cost of your spells so that you can properly manage the health levels of your tank/party, something you will be doing at max level too. This is what I want to advocate, as I think the benefits of max level downranking, intended or not, are already resounding.
---
I mean, I don't think it will drive people to quit, but I mean it wouldn't be a bad idea for some people to take a nap and then come back later at night. It'll get sorted pretty fast.
---
Late game resources like black lotus can be exploited farmed due to layering.  If you don't think Chinese gold farms are coming back and going to stalk up before layering calms down then you're mistaken.  Not to mention it's going to be super lame ganking someone and they just phase out or a gank squad phases in right on top of you.  I mean I more concerned of these issues than people quitting because there's to many players.
---
Lmao you don’t even know what you can and can’t do to your own faction yet wanna act like you’re a vanilla OG. Your waifu pillow would be so disappointed Sir Neckbeard.
---
No no no no. All the try hards will beat Naxx and then Bilzz gets pressured into releasing content for them (1% of classic population maybe?) while a bunch of us who are trying to finish the raids will be left in the dust.  
---
The only things I would want them to add would maybe be new raids or pvp, but if they dive straight into upping the level cap and taking us to where our grinded purps are crap compared to quest green will make me quit the game all over again.
---
That being said, I loved tbc and wotlk.  If they were to bring them back in, I would say wait like 2+years to let most of the community really get the most out of the classic world.
---
You're the one namecalling and starting a fight, yet you're calling me a badass? No, I just know people like you, and you'd **never** say that to someone's face. Lol
---
In retail PvE Alliance has the advantage **by far** and in PvE Horde has an advantage by not far. So it's not really correct to just outright say Horde has an advantage.
---
The guy creating these is basing them off Ed ed and eddy, almost scene for scene.
---
I'm literally counting the seconds...
---
I totally forgot about that, thats very helpful to know.
---
I have it on good authority that he'll be in Grand Rapids for Halloween/DOTD, so I'm skipping out until then.  Have fun at Bass Center! (and in Azeroth)
---
I don't think there's any argument to suggest that there will be realms with a 70/30 split. None of the surveys suggest that and you have to remember we're not getting ~250 realms like last time, we're getting ~25.
---
So they claim.  I won't believe it until I see it.
---
Help me land a good job in a big four and you can count me in... :)
---
Haha I feel like if Naxx launched and somehow people in your guild were not attuned (idk maybe because they're replacements from natural raider turnover who are relative newcomers to the server) then sparks would shoot out of your ears and you would just keep stuttering out "DOES NOT COMPUTE! DOES NOT COMPUTE!"
---
&gt;I guess a lot of People that want to tank will in the end be Fury because it is more fun anyway
---
I'll start as a tank as soon as I hit 60, and collect both set of BiS gear. Then I'll do what's required.
---
Shaman tanking is actually great for dungeons, especially with a priest
---
Just over 3.5M to go!
---
Lmao in what world do you think someone wouldn't know they couldn't attack their own faction? That's literally the stupidest thing anyone has said in this forum, all week. Congrats.
---
Truth
---
No, you can't say that for sure. Right now the split is 51% Alliance and 49% Horde with only slight variations when looking at PVP-only and PVE-only.
---
Are you trying to say that more players on one faction will quit the game?
---
But not using parses that have varried widely from private server to private server. In some parses BIS spell-a-dins have capped out at 600 DPS in the best gear available all through Naxx.
---
In some parses, it's gone over 1600. It's absolutely, ridiculously unreliable, even using the MCP.
---
Everyone wants to be a wRrior tank until they they see how gear dependent and difficult it is in classic. I think a lot of people that never played vanilla and only played current expansions are underestimating how long and difficult it will be. Most people saying theyre going to tank will prolly burn out quickly.
---
Do I get delta points for joining the guild?
---
Question: if classic+ becomes a thing it would be on separate servers than the classic ones, right? Or am I going to have to go back to playing private servers once they start ruining the game again?
---
I can play classic content forever, and I have since 2005. I have no interest in new content in that form of the game, if I wanted crappy new content I would play Bfa. As for the people that I see saying classic+ would be good because Blizzard would learn from their mistakes.. people are still complaining about the same stuff they were 8-9 years ago on retail, because Blizz keeps making the same mistakes over and over again. Why would you assume that Blizz is capable of recognizing these missteps with retail in its current form? Classic will only go downhill once they start adding new content, they should just keep classic servers up, make TBC servers and give the option to xfer to them. We didn't beg for vanilla all these years just so Blizz can go and screw it all up with their horrible new content.
---
With My guild I plan to start people of all specs will be welcome, We will try and limit the amount of memes into each raid ( no 5 Ret paladins for example) But its very much a play what you want situation.   
---
I do expect people to be using consumables, and what not, we may be casual, but these things will give us an edge and we are expected to use them.  We don't care about clearing content the fastest or  " being left behind"  cause the content doesn't become completely irrelevant like it does in live.  sure, after a while you start to out gear the content, but starting late or casual guild can work on it.
---
If our group isnt ready until most people have it on farm. that's ok  It's about the experience and the community for us.
---
Dark edge is incap isn't it?
---
poor people maybe?  Here that kind of furniture is often bought by student dorms  and drinking sheds for the local youth...
---
If you actually want to enjoy the game Id stay far away from streamer servers.

They are saying that with less servers there is less room people to spread out. With more populated servers the difference between the 2 factions will be less. He’s saying the 70/30 split isn’t supported by the maths.
---
It's global.
---
&gt; As for what’s next, the final stress test is now coming up on **July 25-26** (we’ve changed this date since we first announced it). During that global test, we will roll out our multi-region hardware in preparation for the worldwide release of WoW Classic. In addition to getting many more testers to play through the initial leveling experiences, it will be a test of the fixes and tweaks that we’ve made and are making to the game.

Alliance better for pve due to pallies.  Horde better for pvp due to orc/undead racials.
---
It’s me, I’m that Shaman
---
Ive done a box on a private server: warrior, 3 fire mages and a priest. 
---
The mages basicly one-shots elites. My main problem was the healer agro. Id recommend the same setup but with a shaman/paladin healer. :)
---
Bringing people that the group actually enjoys being around and interacting with? In a massively multiplayer game? Nah, screw that, just bring mouthbreathing fury warrior #486 who only cares about high DPS numbers and nothing else.
---
Right? It would be weird us knowing so far in advance that people wouldn't be attuned. Look, I can totally understand like the 3 new people in your guild come naxx that aren't attuned. But the idea that "yeah the gbank has to pay for 40 honored attunements or we wont be able to raid" is just insane to me. For 2 reasons. 1 Why wouldn't your players already be revered/exalted and have the mats for attuenement sitting in their banks for 8 months. and 2 if your guild is the type of guild that is really that poorly prepared are you also the type of guild that has 5-10k gold in their guild bank?
---
Okay I’ll pm my discord when I get home. Cheers!
---
The gameplay effect is very minor compare to the aesthetic one - this is easily seen by the faction race popularity. Alliance will definitely have overall more players, but it probably won't be much difference.
---
Ah! thank you.
---
Pally are very very slow, if you're not dedicated to leveling one you will likely get bored. They are boring basically. Incredibly boring.
---
Dorro's the most lovely...
---
Pretty much this. And first aid.
---
People learn from their mistakes you know? specially when the mistakes already happen, like flying mounts, obviously thats a no no, its not like they are gonna accidently add flying mounts again lol.
---
WoW Classic != Vanilla
---
Lol no way they will all be 60 in 3 days or less. Your saying that all these farmers have more skilled people than the fastest speed runners. I’m sure plenty of people going for a personal best will be right there with them.
---
Yeah you're calling people names on the internet, a totally mature and great thing to do if you have a happy life.  You're projecting bigtime, son.
---
I was on Hellscream US. Of course I know you can't attack same faction. What a silly thing to think, otherwise. You just aren't acknowledging that there may have been a minor misunderstanding early on. In that you can skin someone else's kill after they loot... SAME FACTION. I wasn't necessarily talking about only taking someone's skin by finishing off their mob after they are killed. But taking their skin after they loot.... Plus the fact that some mafias even helped protect against opposing factions. But anyways, more you didn't know I guess.
---
Anyways, enjoy whatever penalty the mods dish out. Not my rules.
---
I just eventually rebound my sit to shift-z since x and shift-x went to abilities.
---
Or you can have a fire spec mage in MC.  Back in my first raiding guild, we had a mage that refused to spec out of fire because "he was getting such big numbers"
---
wtf? hell no.
---
Teach another friend how to fish and cook and pay them 100$ to level them to 300 for you.
---
You think the content is gonna last forever???
---
I think it's super tedious. I'd rather face tank most of the time, use a band-aid and get back at it.
---
They shouldn't do anything since they didn't do anything 14 years ago.
---
You can easily gear any class in a raid guild that doesn't skip any weekly raids. This other guy says "Only a handful of epics drop from a bosses and it'll be split up between 40 people" but in reality each epic is only suitable for a few classes and often only for ONE class, because it's a class tier set piece - and for some of them it might not be an upgrade anymore, or maybe they don't want to bid on it - so the epics are rolled for by 1-4 players typically.
---
This sort of wishy washy answer doesn't help imo. The reality is if you're someone that likes contributing meaningfully to a raid and competing on meters, you shouldn't roll a hybrid in vanilla if you don't want to heal. They don't lack a little, it isn't pretty balanced, and they don't potentially bring things to the table. By and large they just suck. If you want to do your research and have a plan for making feral or spriest work and are aware of the limitations than fair enough, but the default answer is simple - heal or choose something else, hybrids suck at dps.
---
And now that we know the mistakes we can not make them again.
---
I like where these specs are going.  
---
I'd even say something like combat sub and not just coming in with a PvP sub rogue spec.  But I think there's a few of the "eh, I guess" specs like assassination/poison daggers, combat seal fate that you can throw in the hat as well.

Hunters ninja gear they will equip for stats but never need
---
I was playing on a private server a few weeks ago, got my druid to 60, thats why im asking, the animation speed looked the same to me. And wasnt here a thread about this topic but with rogues because in the beta it wasnt like in vanilla? Im pretty sure, not sure whoch one was which but one had the animation sped up while the other (and i believe this was the vanilla one) was like gliding faster but the animation was the same
---
Depends , is it a rogue ?
---
Then YES
---
You get HK's even if you don't get the killing blow.
---
They absolutly are.
---
Nothing gonna stay a hunter. It will be nice to see the hunter population drop a bit though
---
&gt;The tank *class* 
---
which one? Warrior or Druid?
---
Are you sure you can't have both? I know you can with lava deaths.
---
People advocating for no changes often don’t take special issue with every single idea or feature from retail. 
---
Like you said, it honestly wouldn’t be a big deal if it was just that one thing. But why stop with just the one? Why not do a dozen other things? A guild bank, a few more graveyards, etc. 
---
The #nochanges stance doesn’t want one change to lead to twelve to lead to something completely different from vanilla.
---
The druid talent in the balance tree is called Moonkin Form, that's why they're referred to as Moonkins.
---
Yea I plan on it. I need to figure out which server the most popular streamers will join so I can avoid those. I honestly hope they all join the same server so I can join a pvp server without all that bs lol... but I don’t know how many servers there will be on launch, if it’s not that many I think joining a server with at least one popular streamer will be inevitable. Unless of course, like I said, they all join one server.
---
Yes and no.  Bear armor is supposed to be higher, but block matters way more in 5man content since the fixed block reduces a far larger % of incoming hits.  Especially on trash.  So the difference is less than you would expect.  My healers told me I wasn't really easier to heal than the Vanilla raid tanks.
---
I think lower level mobs also reduce your dodge/block/parry less, so where a bear 'gains' X% dodge fighting level cap mobs instead of raid bosses a prot gains three times that X% between dodge/block/parry.  Didn't Vanilla have a mechanic where the attacker's weapon skill compared to the target's defense skill affected that?
---
Came here to say this
---
Then why did players demand flying be added to WoD after Blizzard said it wouldn't have flying?
---
The effect is cool for sure but don't think it applies to Wildkin...aren't they just something like 'ferocious' moonkin?
---
I'd sometimes poly them if I noticed they were pretty much oom as I was about to kill them. Give them free health back and false hope then wreck them a 2nd time. Rarely even a 3rd or 4th time just to extra put them in their place, but they'd usually just run off by then.
---
Was about to say this. This ain't the Mandela effect OP.
---
Adding more recipes doesn't really expand on crafting though in a broad game enhancing sense. 
---
Simply adding a new recipe does nothing if the pattern, whatever it is, is too weak, it will be forgotten immediately.  If it is too strong it is sought after and made for every player who can afford it, so again no real added depth to the game rather a new checkbox to fill out to say that you got a new crafted item.
---
As for the new recipe is it just taught by a trainer to everyone or is it a rare drop that will in reality only benefit the first player it drops for who will make a killing selling the items to everyone who wants one.
---
Adding more levels to an already existing system isn't nessicary for this system either it could simply be another level of specialization ontop of a players already chosen specialization.
---
You're a Tailor who has specialized in Mooncloth well now you can specialize further, when you specialize further you are given the choice at the end of the questline to decide how your specialization would work.  
---
Maybe your choices would be:
---
1. Add MP5 stat to all gear you craft
---
2. Add +10 Healing to all gear you craft
---
3. Add +7 Int to all gear you craft
---
Ultimately this gear would never be better than the best Raid gear or realistically wouldn't even compete well against say AQ40, but it would be on par with MC gear and certain items could easily be more than viable in BWL.
---
So you don't actually learn any new plan's with this system you just choose a way to augment gear you can already make.
---
It’s why I plan on leveling in dungeons. 
---
I doubt it will be as bad as people think. I was in the beta and while some zones on day one were bad by day two it leveled out. 
---
After I hit 18 tho I plan on living in dungeons till at least 40.
---
Hunters imo get a bad rap two ways. First hunters originally were pretty bad. They had a no it zone where they were to close to shoot but too far away to melee. A good player could exploit that and basically nullify the hunter. That with some other issues made hunters a laughable class. Next was the polar oppisite. Hunters beast spec got buffed to god mode and beasteal wrath would just face roll everyone. So they became the ezmode class everyone then hated. Depending on what part of vanilla you played you prolly laughed at or hated them which is prolly why people have a negative attitude towards them. Also pet pathing!
---
In PvP they all fare from mediocre to pretty good, but since gearing in classic relies of PvE content heavily (unless you're tryhard ranker) that's where the problems arise.
---
Semi-hardcore and better guilds are unlikely to take any of these (since they are mathematically inferior and there are better meta options), and the ones who will take (casual guilds) are going to have limited spots, for example, 1 shadow priest per raid. 
---
And oh boy, something really tells me that the supply of these specs will exceed the demand by a huge magnitude.
---
How come alliance is much stronger at PVE? I assume all top 15 world first kills will be alliance then.
---
TIL: I am that one friend.
---
Totally reasonable assessment. They really are a boring slog to 60.
---
Why?  There's only a few fights they shouldn't mt.
---
&gt;  since you put up your dots
---
Can you even fit your dots in those 16 debuff slots? I'm not going to count all useful debuff but I imagine something like warlock's Corruption is actually more beneficial to the raid than druid's Moonfire.
---
It’s really hard to remember how we oce folk managed to be competitive on US realms with 240&gt; ping. Hard to imagine otherwise now
---
Idk if this makes it feel closer or farther away, tbh.
---
Op is an idiot. Moonkin is the form that balance Druids turn into. Wildkin is a mob you can fight in darkshore and other places.
---
You are so wrong it is embarrassing.
---
Blessings, endless paladin heals, sword spec humans, and fear ward are the ones that jump out. Salvation is huge to allow your dps to push harder and raises the threat cap.
---
Lol my behavior is at least warranted when dealing with a delusional tattle tale neckbeard like you. Yours is straight up idiocy mixed with immaturity. It doesn’t even make sense and the way you want to tattle tale on people shows you’ve never stood up for yourself in your entire life. You rely on being protected because you can’t protect yourself after you make idiotic and nonsensical arguments. Ultimate mommas boy who doesn’t know how to grow up so he just tries to tattle on everyone. It’s REALLY sad.
---
Wow that's beautiful!
---
It's very easy to come up with ideas that *improve* the game from vanilla. But the point of Classic isn't to do that.
---
Why aren't you boomerang or grenade pulling?

---
Atleast my perceptions come from my other screen where im currently killing some thorn dudes in southern barrens fir a white shield. Its a big place.
---
No, you REALLY don't want to bind your movement keys with modifiers. That will fuck you so many times.
---
There is no reason for new level cap, it would just make all of the old content and area's useless, all the new content, the new raids the new gear and everthing can be added as level 60, there is no need for an arbitrary number increase imo
---
&gt; wtf? hell no.
---
wtf? hell yes.

They should implement a voting system for new content like Runescape, where it needs 75% approval to a feature to be added / modified
---
Yeah professions are fun, but I really don't like the idea of just dropping them immediately at 60. The thing is, they are an investment. If you want to just level to 60 for fun then get a bit of value out of using your deeprock salt cooldown, great. But I feel you are going to be disappointed if you drop it right at 60, when you could have leveled leatherworking on an alt.
---
Yeah it's pretty much as you described.
---
I honestly wish that a 40-man raid could realistically use Loot council without the typical drama that is brought into that system because of the large amount of people.
---
I have lived with a Loot council guild since late TBC and I found with the more limited raid size of 25 people and most importantly the less of each class in raid that it became a pretty easy system for guilds.
---
We are 50 ppl in Guild and 18 Warriors alone. Zugzug
---
Well yeah. But the idea that everyone wants the same *experience* is a huge misconception - a misconception that many people who criticize Classic WoW have. Obviously no one is going to have the exact same experience, but we just want (in our opinion) the vastly superior version of the game to just be *playable* again. I don't want the *same* experience I had 10 years ago, I just want a *better* one than I'm having now on retail, lol.
---
I dont get this, the seasonal approach imho is the worst, it gets old REALLY quick, going into TBC is a terrible option but still miles better than seasons.
---
shamans can tank okay in 60 dungeons, but only if they have really good gear, and with a pretty good group
---
Very dogmatic, cookie cutter answer that won't help OP very much imo. Rolling a hybrid you will have more opportunities as a healer of course, but you can still find a guild that will accept you as a dps and you'll still clear content/have a blast with PVP at a different pace. Like any other class, learn your limitations, know what you are strong at &amp; what to do. You can contribute very meaningfully to a raid as a hybrid with totem twisting or shadow weaving, boomkin crit and depending on your attendance/professions too, there's a lot to bring to help others. By large they are great when you know what you are doing. Understand the trade offs and you'll be happy you didn't force yourself to pick a different class which you might not feel as fulfilled playing.
---
Advice: buy a one hand gamepad like the Razer Nostromo. It'll make you handstrain-life easier
---
Tanking is just another box to check. In 2019, we know there's no complicated systems behind tanking mechanics or mystical tanking gear that bars "dps" warriors from getting enough mitigation and avoidance and generating enough threat. A warrior refusing to tank would be like a hunter refusing to pull or kite.
---
Popularity and how good a class is is generally related, as proven my multitudes of WoW expansions where people rerolled en masse because Blizzard broke a class. Warriors are the best class and the most popular, this is also why it's easy to find 2 warriors to tank a 40 man raid. Mages are the second most popular class because they are really fun and good at just about everything. Warlocks suck and that's why they aren't popular. Sucking isn't fun for a lot of people.
---
Well, if Rag actually has fucking mechanics and correct damage (in other words, not the retarded loot pinata it was on ...N and E) then I suspect it will actually take longer to clear MC, especially when Ony buff has a few hours cooldown so not every tryhard shitter guild can get it. 
---
The pserver vs retail pissfest is dumb as shit with retards on both sides.
---
Yeah for sure.  This guy was geared out the ass and had Savage Glad chest along w/ the engi shield.  Plus, we had been looking for a tank for 20-30 minutes, so I asked the group if they'd be cool with bringing this guy in.  We were all like "Fuck it, might as well" and he ended up being a total badass.
---
He was even the one trying to press the issue after I initially told him no, assuring me he knew what he was doing and had gear.  Granted, this was on a pserver so we're all pretty much tryhards by default, but that run totally changed my perspective.
---
I think it's coming, Blizzard just has no reason to announce it right now. Once we start having a heavy need for guild banks in ZG/AQ, the account sharing will skyrocket and Blizzard will introduce guild banks with limited features.
---
I still feel there should been ‘magic tank’ builds for enemies with high magic damage that couldn’t be mitigated by armour. Would have given ranged classes a tanking tree to mix it in a bit
---
Blizzard needs to take that book of what they wanted vanilla wow to be and then do it. This is the best time to fulfill their what-ifs.
---
No. You just need a subscription.
---
As a warrior, gimme a paladin all day
---
Druids can solo them at 54. Apparently you're supposed to roots kite them but no-one told me that so I bear tanked them.
---
You don’t need bfa, you just need a sub
---
I'm coming for you. I WILL tank your BRD group. I've been min-maxing this spec for like 2 weeks man. I swear I played lots of shaman in WoD this is gonna be ^***TIGHT***
---
Because people were complaining about layering being in the game in the first place.  I agree though.  If you are going to have layering, might as well make it so you can actually finish all the quests instead of grinding mobs because you can't get certain quests done.
---
Actually I quite like melted ice cream, with canned sliced peaches and syrup, but I'm all for \#nochanges.

Arena is not bad if they bring it the right way:  
---
\- No resilience  
---
\- Arena doesnt give the best gear, instead it gives cosmetics like mounts, titles, tabards etc.   
---
\- Arena shouldnt be considered an e-sport but just a fun thing to do, just like gurubashi arena.
---
I'm in the US and I plan on playing on EU servers with the people I met on private servers. The ping wasn't awful (from the Midwest) around 105-120ms. This was hardly ever noticeable except in very specific circumstances. In Naxx for Patchwerk, as a healer, you have to time your heals so perfectly that the ping was actually causing major problems. Unless you're doing high level PvP I wouldn't worry to much about it. What you will have to worry about is the time difference.
---
Druid can bear tank them at 54.
---
Just select wow and add a sub / gametime to it and you'll be able to play classic on that account.
---
LMAO AND YOU POST IN r/The_Donald?!?! You literally are such s neckbeard looking at your account!

Sorry you’re fat and stupid, but stop trying to take it out on people who are actually trying in life HAHAHAHAHAHA I can’t believe what a fucking pathetic sack of shit you clearly are, read your own comments. It’s so, SOOOOOO sad. And you try to tattle on people? What the fuck is honestly wrong with you? I’ve never witnessed a more pathetic human being. HAHHAHAHA. I’m done here. No point arguing with someone who is literally the least valuable human on the entire planet... just fucking so pathetic..
---
No just anti pirating. Just a pragmatist.
---
Before resilience a player could mainly pve for gear then hop into pvp and do fine or vise versa. Once there was pve and pvp gear you couldn't switch between the two activities and be as proficient as you then required a pvp or pve set.
---
This has been running for months https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com
---
I agree.  I don't know how many people there were in the layers during the stress test, but some quests were just impossible to do.  I was at least playing a ranged class, I can only imagine how fun it'd be as a warrior trying to tag mobs.  I don't want people to quit because of leveling and people are going to get very frustrated not being able to quest.

I suppose from a marketing perspective to implement something like this at launch could just lead to huge PR disaster and people boycotting the game. After 6 months of launch and people have invested lots of time in to the game, and are probably less sensitive to the issue of putting a limited guild bank feature in: that could be their implementation plan?
---
Part of me hope's that's not the case, because i do understand what the others in the thread are saying about where do you tow the line? What other things might they plan to implement at a later stage?
---
You guys are acting like Blizzard cant learn from their mistakes, you guys are acting like they'll add flying mounts to classic and be like "FUUUCK, we totally forgot flying mounts wasnt a good feature, but we accidently added them, what were we thinking"

---
I wish Blizz had made Enhance into an actual tank spec in BC. Mirrors Pallies better, and tanking with totems is bad ass. 
---
Maybe in Classic+
---
I didn't say they are better raid tanks than Warriors. I said they can tank anything  if he puts in the effort, which is absolutely true.
---
This idea that it had no hard mechanics is simply false. Of course it did, teamwork. It expects a lot more of teamwork and team coordination than most games, and in many ways a lot more than retail WoW. For example it is far, far harder for 40 players to co-operate well than it is for 25 people or however big raids are in BfA.
---
So it's not just time investment. It's also hard co-op. Playing solo you can also put yourself into hard situations, like fighting against elite mobs. PvP is always hard because players are the most intelligent enemies, and in many ways again, vanilla PvP is more complex and harder than BfA PvP, such as how to be great in PvP you have to use all kinds of outside of your class items, gadgets, trinket swapping etc. - not saying BfA PvP does not have some aspects that are harder to perform than some aspects in vanilla, but this isn't as black and white as you think.
---
Each versions are harder than each other in different ways, and easier and more casual than each other in some other ways.
---
Wow you're obsessed. Really, go talk to a counselor. I'm not even being snide at this point. I hope you get some help.
---
You're also Reddit, idiot.

I like the idea of "high risk" quests. Lines that lead in to enemy territory where you are likely to die in wpvp. That would be really fun.
---
Hunter is the best at kiting world bosses to capital cities.
---
Racism is arguably worse than loot drama. Not by much though.
---
Id love to see that.
---
They're all deciding because of seeing warrior pvp montages, warriors top dps, warriors being the best tank, all of them want thunderfury or hand of rag.
---
They'll quit after they find out about the warrior solo experience of levelling, not being able to dive in during pvp without a healer and lack of solo grinding ability.
---
Obviously armor and health are important, but I would argue dodge chance and agility are equally important stats for druid tanks.  Increased dodge chance and health pools over warrior tanks are the only things that keep them viable.

This artist pretty much used Ed, Edd, And Eddy as inspiration.

Then there likely will be no addon to manage totems if memory serves blizzard disabled the ability for addons to factor in gcd or any other wait time in vanilla

Yep I remember this! I used to have a half dps half tank set for dungeons once I was too overgeared
---
Soul link with felhunter warlock, Twin Emps...it exists
---
I also plan to do a Priest but more and more I’m coming to the conclusion that professions will only slow you down and it’s faster to just vendor everything while levelling then go back and level a profession at 60.
---
Man it is real quiet in here. Surely there is still at least one person out there confident enough to say classic is dead because of leeway.

When every person was new to UBRS then yes things were HARD, because there were not youtube walkthroughs and a breakdown of every mob ability available before you walked in the portal.

You can just add ctrl and/or alt to most of those keys and you have plenty of keybinds. You probably need 40+ since you want multiple ranks of multiple abilities.
---
Okay I removed the idiot part
---
Not like you need it. This game runs on a toaster.
---
I thought I was good. Looking back...I was not.
---
There is so much truth in this statement, so many classes evolved over 13 patches and the end result was nothing like the starting point.
---
Out of all that has come out of the Classic community. I think these Warcraft themed Ed, Edd n Eddy comics are the best thing out of the community, even better than the game WoW:Classic itself.
---
I was 11 when I started playing, got it for my 11th birthday, fast forward a few weeks and my moms boyfriend got it too, then when my mom saw there was jewelry and an auction house, she got it too, followed by my uncle and grandfather. me, my mom, her BF, and my uncle spent hundreds of hours in vanilla, my mom raided the whole way up to Naxx, had a Warlord, my moms BF did raiding up to BWL I believe, it was something we all enjoying playing together so much, I loved playing WoW as a child so much, I only ever got my frost mage to level 44 I believe I was when TBC came out, but had many alts in the 20-30 range, I think you and your child will definitely be able to play together, my son was just born 8 weeks ago I hope so much that Classic is still going strong when he is old enough to game, I would love to share that experience with him, I’m just hoping I have enough time to play the game right now when it comes out! He’s started sleeping for like 7 hours at a time through the night so I’m keeping my hopes up to be able to at least get an hour or two in a night!
---
&gt;A few more ding 60 in the next couple of days
---
More like next couple of hours. Don't underestimate turbo nerds.
---
Good job not actually explaining anything. What was the point in even making a video and not just posting the text of the macros?
---
Im in Hoboken does that count
---
Yeah when our first raids happened we had more Enhancement Shaman than DPS Warriors... and loads and loads of Mages. I remember we had this one ex-HWL Warrior who didn't even go Fury until BWL. All the other halfdozen Warriors were usually 2h Fury or Arms merely because of the Rogues taking the 1h Swords.
---
It's funny because by the end of Vanilla there were way more DPS Warriors, and then TBC dropped and melee was one of the least desired of all the DPS specs.

More engineering things
---
This is just from the top of my head I'm probably missing alot of them
---
Firestone really helps out with that build.
---
Healers and Tanks both.
---
Later patches finding tanks for 5 man's or LBRS/UBRS is pretty fucking impossible.
---
there are no classic wow npc's with wildkin in the name, but there are 4 npcs with the name moonkin, and the form is called moonkin form and similar numbers of object have wildkin and moonkin in their names.
---
really it sounds like both are valid names for the species, like puma and cougar
---
You or your VW?
---
At no point have I ever claimed Perp said it in that Youtube video specifically lmao, having trouble reading?
---
&gt;where do we draw the line?
---
The answer to that ridiculous question is always "Somewhere".   You can literally say that about ANYTHING...  Well, we let lil Timmy have some Candy, might as well let him try heroine too.
---
You question was basically "will a private server bug that never existed in vanilla be available in classic?" To which the only reasonable answer is "No, why would you even think it would be?".
---
Found my new homepage. 
---
Ty sir!
---
I'm not sure why a lot of druid wants to drop enchanting after the bear trinket. I for sure will keep ench, druid is very fun to solo/stealth run and DE makes it much more profitable. Also it's not like you can't make it a living selling enchants in the city.
---
In your spare time level a rogue in the opposing faction and gank his ass in the name of love. This will impress him without a doubt
---
Oooo that's a good idea. We will have to run the numbers on Firestone vs another mace in your offhand
---
The nerf was at release.. his video was posted towards the end of beta and between beta closing and launch (1 week) they gutted warrior, the class forum at the time was glorious. people think warrior is slow to level now.. back then it was torture!
---
Why would you say that it's objectively worse, when that just isn't true?
---
Strath Holy Water, good to save for Nef, or for AoE UD tanking threat
---
Just because it has more spell power than some epic does not make it better, because the epic has something else in addition to the spell power it gives, such as hit chance, crit chance and/or attributes.
---
You are wrong, I am right.
---
I started playing shaman just after BC launched so I never got to experience tanking after WC because it was just a race to 60 by then. Can’t wait to play vanilla shaman next month!
---
Hi, /u/jkcantu

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ce3x9n/i_havent_played_wow_in_years_and_i_dont_know/). 
---
LIP, swiftness potion, dark/demonic rune, magic dust, trinket swap, mount, detect magic.
---
I also have 4 outfitter binds and 3 trinket menu profile binds, but those don't need to be easily accessed.
---
Even then, that's really short for Blizzard standards. I would say 3-4 years minimum.
---
Where do you have his damage data that the private servers used? Raid logs? Github? 
---
When N first launched Rag was way undertuned but because it took them roughly a month to fix it (already giving guilds that cleared him a significant advantage) they just left him that way for the sake of server kill progression. He did significantly less fire damage than he should, particularly his Aoe raid damage was so low that raiders could get away with practically no fire resist gear.
---
I also wouldn't talked the Rag logs from the warrior discord to heart.
---
Theres no blue weap better than Shadowstrike?
---
Sure in case he has ever said that, it only proves him wrong.
---
Frankly, anyone thinking that Classic+ is a possibility is deluded as fuck.  We will be LUCKY as hell to see TBC classic.
---
Amplify and dampen magic, useful as misc debuffs, or if you're solo fighting a caster. Also mount.
---
I prefer alt for letter bindings.
---
Did Donald Trump type this for you? Capitalization is not your strong suit.
---
Because it is true 
---
With holding right click you can't look around 360 degrees while strafing
---
The polls i saw that had rolls and class choicr listed specifically showed a split between dps and tank warrior, so it does look liie you are right, but it also makes sense considering a bunch of retail tank players will be coming to classic and are forced into prot warrior to tank.
---
How very nice of you to prove yourself a liar. In the vide you made, you are closer to the target than Perplexity is in his video. Perp is horizontally behind the brazier when he looks towards it, you are in front of it.
---
You will have no problem finding a group between lvl 1-30ish and then you will spend 1 hour in trade chat looking for a tank until 60 :)
---
It was changed to base in WotLK when Tauren were running around with ridiculous amounts of health. 
---
Patch 8905 changes, 9/6/08
---
Dark/Demonic runes is in the Mana Gain macro, as is Trinket Swap in either of those macros. Does detect magic actually have enough uses that you would even use it in combat? And there's no way in hell I'm farming for magic dust. 
---
So that's 3 more.
---
Dude, an enhance shaman doesn't even want it.   Plus, it's not nearly as good as you think.  It's overtuned on private servers.
---
NEVER bind movement keys, you'll get fucked in so many ways.
---
25 is for PvE but 30 for PvP? Lmao.
---
In PvE you need like 10 max for your average player, doesn't take many buttons to spam frostbolt or whatever your rotation is.
---
30 is about enough for PvP, sure you can do way better, but it's enough.
---
Thank you for such a great response. Yeh he’s getting a computer for his 11th birthday I’m excited for all the adventures he will be able to have and join me on.
---
I don't think amplify and dampen magic need a keybind anymore than portals and arcane intellect or frost armor do.
---
They take more damage than warriors. If you want the optimal setup then there's no reason to have the druid MT when warriors are just better.
---
You are clearly closer to the target in the video you recorded yourself than Perplexity is in his video. Just compare.
---
When Perplexity looks towards the bonfire in the back, the bonfire is seen between Perplexity and the target.
---
When Cyatir looks that way, the bonfire is behind him. Cyatir is clearly standing a few yards closer.
---
Please do go ahead and make a better replication of the test :)
---
In this thread we learn that the "Mandela effect" is largely caused by misinformation rather than some collective amnesia phenomenon
---
The only right way of doing things is to release ***The Burning Crusade***(TBC:Classic or whatever to call it) again, then i can play that golden shit untill i die of old age.
---
[My Expansion Tierlist](https://i.imgur.com/qIg7O5p.png) Tbc is everything classic is, but does it better. The only fault in TBC is the fact that you were able to change server and change name.
---
But regarding post classic content. Having the unreleased stuff would be cool if it were created to the same standard and polish the rest of the game does.
---
I played a resto druid all through vanilla and I still never had money for an epic mount.  Sucks making money as a healer
---
I remember the video of that Tauren warrior that ran around with a big double edged axe hacking and one hitting players with mortal strike. He laid waste to the entire server it seemed.
---
Big disagree that Balance PvP is 'okay' and Feral is good. It's the reverse. Considering ferals lose 10% of their base damage compared to private servers they are further behind than they already were.  
---

---
Thrall would NEVER wear armor made from a Paladin's Divine Shield.
---
The only reason I’m not rolling shaman is because of this. I wanna tank in classic but I know it won’t happen as shaman especially not in raiding
---
The nice thing this time around is that in theory it will be Vanilla forever, so you CAN take a year or two to hit 60, then maybe a couple more to clear the raids because you wont be forced into a new expansion.
---
&gt; Does detect magic actually have enough uses that you would even use it in combat?
---
Mages have a fair bit of downtime while positioning, so you'll have a lot of situations where you have a free GCD. Detect magic is really cheap (35 mana I think) and reduces the chances your polymorph gets dispelled.
---
I mean you also don't need more than 2-3 tanks in a raiding guild for a lot of content.
---
Guild I joined has 7 people wanting to tank... Only maybe 3-4 max will get geared with 1-2 as the main tanks.
---
I've seen this bug with druids too.
---
Uh excuse me, it's working 110% as intended. Blizzard has the REFERENCE CLIENT, which is definitely not a pre-cata patch client, and is DEFINITELY the way it should be. Just be GLAD you even have Classic that the criminal private server players don't deserve.
---
We never had a boomkin or shadow priest in retail vanilla and we were like server second or something to down him.  In recent years on private servers I know having atleast one shadow is a thing to help with lock damage.  I don't see boomkin happening.  I was a fury warrior in retail vanilla though, which was even less of a thing people knew much about way back then.
---
Instant guild invite for me
---
You don't need a separate macro to cancel shields.
---
And you can just click buffs.
---
And why would anyone use rank 1 fireball?
---
So that's 2.
---
But it would be worth it.
---
Detect magic? Yes its useful to put that on your polymorph so that it gets dispelled first. Im not a mage expert but rank 1 frost nova? Some races have more than 1 racial that needs a keybind. Slow fall. Health gain and mana gain is not that simple, not sure if you can do it all with macros but i believe you cant, stuff like potions, runes, health stone, your mana gems, all 4 of them because although they share a cooldonw you can use them all during a fight (although maybe one keybind is enough with a macro).
---
Ya. Leveled a warrior on a pserver a while ago and was surprised at how many DPS warriors thought they would get a group for dungeons. On top of how few other tanks there were... Playing warrior in vanilla means tanking 5 mans at least through leveling / gearup!
---
There’s plenty of keybinds that you can never use while moving so as you think a bit they are perfectly fine to use. Things like eating/drinking and really anything you channel can be put on them. They are directly under your fingers and the more easy keybinds the better so it’s a bit silly avoiding them.
---
I mean, I wouldn't say it's a bad thing to get as many ranged shots in as you can before the mob inevitably catches up with you, since you can't slow them down from range. That's a good tactic, unless the mob is so easy you can facetank them all the way.
---
But to give an example, among warriors who speedlevel to 60, it's common to pull the next mob already before you have regained full health, in order to save time. You could be at 20% HP, so these warrior players may kite the mob with ranged attacks for as long as possible, which is a few shots with a warrior. Saves more time than eating to full health every time, but had they facetanked the mob the entire time they would have died.
---
I get your point was that you did it because you were not knowledged in the game and thought you could play some kind of ranged warrior. Just saying, it's not a bad strat to pull and shoot multiple times when done for the correct reasons.
---
But private servers are wrong, dont you understand that? If the range is "better" on private servers that doesnt matter either because this is not "classic pserver wow" this is classic wow.
---
And still this proves a private server had leeway wich is what this thread is about: People whining about leeway because its not needed still it was there on a pserver.
---
It would be a poor argument if that was the argument I was making, but it isn’t. 
---
The argument is that there are really two options: no changes, we get the game as it was; or some undecided number of quality of life changes which ultimately are left up to blizzard’s discretion. 
---
I’m not arguing that making that one change would lead to more. I’m suggesting that if that change was made it would be the result of a decision to make multiple changes. Personally it wouldn’t really make sense to me to only change that and nothing else if you’ve already decides to make some QoL updates.
---
Also, your car metaphor doesn’t really work because I’m in control of what additional work they do to my car. I could easily leave with just the oil change. This is would be more like I give them the car and the title and say “do whatever you want.”
---
&gt;Does detect magic actually have enough uses that you would even use it in combat?
---
Yes you put it on your polymorph so it gets dispelled first
---
You don't need hotkeys for any abilities you can just click them.  Rank 1 fireball for the dot in rare cases when you don't have time for the full cast.
---
I've seen some decent arguments for Druid tanks in classic with certain gear. You won't be able to main tank everything, but you can at least Off tank most things fine. So it's not all warrior or bust!
---
Even if LFR has harder mechanics than many vanilla fights, the actual raid on LFR is still way, way easier. Like you barely take any damage at all. In vanilla it's still 1 guy makes a mistake = 40 man raid wipes within seconds.
---

---
If your tank is dying because they don't know how to press shield block or they cant move out of the fire then there's no reason to worry about what class is optimal because your guild has other problems to worry about.
---
Why would more health mean more efficient heals? Are your healers waiting until the tank takes damage to start casting a heal? Again if that's the case then your guild shouldn't be worrying about optimal raid comp because there are other problems you need to worry about. 
---
Fury/prot with threat gear on still takes less damage then druids so there's still no reason to take the druid when the warrior can put on threat gear and take less damage anyway.
---
I have made no arguments that require data. Simply pointed out that your ideas have no basis in fact. I mean you have so many strong opinions about how things are, unfortunately you pulled it all out of your ass. 
---
Maybe you should just stop digging the hole until you can get some data, perhaps sometime in october after there is data to work with.
---
What about subtraction blocker? ;)
---
Get an MMO mouse with side buttons, life changing
---
3) No it's true because if the attacks of a Boss hits hard and you never parry or block it, you will face tank the dmg every time it hits. So even when the druid has high health and armor, the damage mitigation is not nearly high enough that it evens out the lack of parry or miss. 
---
4) You're right. I'm don't understand the intricacies of healing. What I *do* know from years of experience is that healers are always complaining about druid tanks. Druid tanks simply take too much dmg.
---
5) Not nonsense. They have almost no utility (in terms of tanking). Combat res as a tank? Pop out and Innervate? Gimme a break. If things are *that* clutch, then you shouldn't even have started to experiment with druid tanks in the first place (as a raid group).
---
6) That's not even the same thing. Some bosses are *impossible* to tank as a druid. *All* bosses can be tanked by Warriors. 
---
7) We are talking about recommending feral tank to ***first time*** *players*. You simply cannot brush the amount of farming time required off as nothing. 10 hrs pr. week - minimum on BWL release. For MCP only. The truth is that the druid will be spending more time waiting for Gnomeregan dungeon resets than he will be actually raiding. Every. Week. **ON TOP** of whatever else he has to farm on a weekly basis. That is not nothing.
---
8) Right if we just use MCP charges on every pull. Do you know that it's only a 35% drop chance and you can only kill the boss 5 times pr. hour? 12% of all the dungeon lock outs you wont even see it drop once.
---
9) First of all: All bosses are unadvised for druid tanks. Second of all, if the boss is enraged you have shitty hunters. Hunters need to use tranq shot.
---
Thats not a schedule a person can have while trying to play their role in society.
---
I have never played on a private server, I'm just not fucking retarded like you.
---
Oh for sure but the majority of retaul tanks. coming to classic don't know that, as only good raid leaders know a good feral offtank is a smart thing to have
---
Sorry to say but because of the 25y range and out-of-combat requirements for Charge, without intercept you're basically a free honor kill to many ranged classes who can just kite forever. You have to resort to a bit of trickery.
---
Case in point story- in Ashenvale, a night elf hunter who was grey to me essentially kited me with serpent sting all the way up the hill where the path towards Zoram'gar met the main path. This was about a level or two before hunters learned the Cheetah Aspect.
---
Even though she was doing almost negligible damage I couldn't do a damn thing about it. As a warrior in combat without dinging 30 for intercept, you are helpless. 
---
Eventually I realized that she was leading me towards Astranaar, hoping the guards would finish her handiwork.
---
So I let the distance between us slowly grow just a little greater at first, then after I felt like she got complacent, just outside the Astranaar bridge, I immediately did a 180 and started running in the opposite direction. Naturally she did not react as fast as she wanted, so this effectively put me just outside of the range for her bow. So now she was chasing me back in the direction of Zoram'gar, back down the hill. 
---
Now, because 90% of Night Elf Hunters are complete idiots, she didn't expect the same trick twice. So I again wait a few minutes of the pursuit go by, turn 180 to face her, and of course the stupid bitch autoruns right into an intimidating shout before she has time to react. Instant dead hunter.
---
Classic + content I would enjoy as long as it stayed in the spirit of classic. Level 60 kara would be interesting, as would the zones on EK and Kali that were added later. 
---
For classic TBC I'm 100% for it tbc and wotlk were my favourite times in an mmo. I don't know how you would launch them without killing some classic servers. I think for this to work, a new server needs to start as a TBC or  Wotlk  server or they need to inform us now if the intent is to travel through the expacs. As although I would love it I'm aware others want to stay in classic land.
---
If servers stay as classic only, I'll play until I've cleared everything and collected the sets, and the nostalgia wears thin.
---
Exploit? Do you consider applying int buff and stacking it with stamina buff from mages and priests also as an exploit because it gives you more dmg and makes content easier?
---
This is f***ing hilarious
---
That is a nerf for sure ! Alittle adjustment in playstyle and i think its going to be fine.
---
What? This is so stupid. So if you are out in the world with mage armor and a melee jumps on you you dont switch to frost armor???
---
It is astonishing that we finally have Classic after all this time, for the players who are disillusioned with the direction Retail WoW is heading, only to have people clamoring for the same company and developers to make changes to Classic as well.
---
Surely that is the definition of insanity. 
---
What's even the point of Classic if it just becomes an "alternative universe" WoW alongside Retail WoW.
---
You people need to look at what you are saying.
---
Yeah now you're just trolling. Something you use many times over your career is something worth being bound.
---
can't do that @ veins though.
---
That's just not true at all, even slightly.
---
Watch literally any video of anyone raiding in vanilla and a majority of the time people are just running around doing nothing.
---
Naxx and AQ were a brick wall because dead weight needed to be shed. Meaning, ZG, OL, MG, and BWL were pretty fucking easy.
---
Laddie... elixir's arn't on the potion CD. RIP Viper Sting.
---
Interesting, but also more or less useless.
---
Okay, I concede Detect Magic. And you only ever use Rank 1 Frost Nova.
---
There's only one race that can be a mage with 2 racial actives and I'm not sure binding Cannibalize is all that necessary, but okay.
---
So 40 is definitely possible, though necessary is debatable. 50 is out of the question though.
---
Plot twist: He will move to Ironforge and his new job will be the guilds main blacksmith
---
^This. Warlocks were definitely used as raid tanks for that ONE and only for that ONE boss, but the lock who got to do it was king for the day if they did it well.
---
FD can resist also. I remember dying to this all the time in BC (didn't play vanilla).
---
I've noticed money acts differently than items do, but I haven't been able to get enough data points on it since the video I am using as reference didn't have many humanoids being killed.
---
Or...you know...NO?
---
Imagine you're moving a lot, so you're alternating WAD, and then you need to use a spell bound to Shift 1. If you have binds to any of those 3, you're gonna use that instead of your Shift 1 spell, triggering a global cooldown (or WORSE, sitting down to drink, or wasting a bandage).
---
I'd say if you want to raid as a hybrid plan on healing, or being a consumable machine.
---
I apologize, but I will be doing this
---
Why are you taking part in an argument when you clearly do not understand what it is about?
---
No one has said private servers do not have melee leeway. It's known that they do, and that they have LESS of it. OP is trying to CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF MELEE LEEWAY. I proved him wrong, and all of you come and whine at me about some completely unrelated things that I have not talked about.
---
Like what in the flying fuck are you complaining at me for, about whether private servers have better range or not? My comment was clearly about calling out OP for dishonestly trying to make it seem like they have the SAME leeway than Classic, which is false. They really do have less leeway, and OP tried to fool people by not so subtly standing at a closer range, yet claiming he is standing at the same distance and that the leeway is the same.
---
Get it?
---
Here's a specific spreadsheet that explains exactly how wrong you are in EP values. Relevant SP/Healing gear is wildly overtuned for the classes that use it. 
---
Blizzard didn't understand how much those stats effect DPS relative to other stats.
---
sorry, again, like your enhancement talent thread, you clearly have no idea what you are doing.
---
this guy is not talented into frostbite, if you are pvping, you will be talented into frostbite.
---
every person who plays mage knows the rule, and the rule is, if you want to aoe grind/farm, DO NOT GET FROSTBITE.
---
What if I am using a Skilled Fighting Blade in OH as a fury warrior and Vendorstrike drops? This is just naming a decent green weap off the top of my head.
---
That is a ridiculous statement.  I cleared AQ in Vanilla and maybe 4 or 5 people had engineering.   Sounds like you've been brain washed by theorycrafting wrathbaby youtubers.
---
/u/gritsui just started using your site; are there plans to add equivalency for arms dps? I'm a meme...
---
A rogue could tank nefarian too, but that doesn't make it a good idea.
---
How long yd difference is there?
---
It’s almost like consumables pay for themselves - oh wait, they don’t.
---
On a side note, your almost correct in that I will be 3 manning strat live with TF to push max gold return.
---
So do you bind hearthstone then? And every teleport and every portal? What about conjure water and food? and conjure mana gem? and all raid consumables?
---
Aff lock with felguard.
---
Even if they would reaaally need to delay it, they absolutely would rather release the game broken ans then fix it, rather than push the date
---
I think that's what I dislike about enchanting to be honest. I don't like to park myself in the city shouting my services. I'd rather run out in the world, gather what I need, chill in the city and make the stuff and put it on the AH.
---
Yeah mage was a bad example. Lol
---
Damn you’re trying really hard here.
---
“Another fallacy” is attempting to make it sound like I’ve committed multiple fallacies, when in fact I have not.
---
Second, I never said there are “only two choices.” I said there are BASICALLY two choices, quantifying that later by saying that it wouldn’t really make sense to do only one quality of life change when there are easily a number of things they could pull over from retail without changing the base game (from their perspective).
---
You just REALLY want to seem intelligent and throw out some fallacy bullshit. Feel free to not respond to any more of my comments unless you want to continue to sound ignorant.
---
That’s the best part of the re launch. Everyone gets to play and ENJOY. I’m itching with excitement
---
That sounds like a Threat the raid leader made, only it turned out to work.
---
Its astonishing that people dont realize that you can learn from your mistakes and that Runescape is doing very well with new content to the original version of the game.
---
technically, focus addons do exist for vanilla, but as we have been discussing in another thread, there is a good chance that focus macros will be impossible for them to work due conditional macros not functioning.
---
meaning something that emulates or tries to do 
---
&gt; /cast [@focus] x
---
is likely not possible unless they specifically change there mind and allow it.
---
I took it to be poking fun at the extremists. I think that people who are passionate and truly love their "thing" are awesome, and often the best able to make fun of that thing.
---
No, this is not in the least bit true.
---
&gt; Not sure why everyone that has never played a private server thinks it's some fairy tale wonderland where pigs fly and fish sing.
---
&gt; 
---
Because of things like discovering feral scaling formulaes were off by a huge amount for levels 1-59, hearing about how mobs either lack abilities entirely or use them with different frequency, that spawn frequencies are different, pats are different, leeway is different, spell batching is different, that raid bosses have 280% parry in classic, etc. etc. etc.
---
Please show me anywhere where he said “exactly the same” or some variation of the sort.
---
Pwned
---
I think the vanilla class developer actually said they weren't designed to do that. I can't remember the reasoning he have for the confusing tool kit but it was discussed on the classic wow podcast.
---
The one that can actually parry, block and tank all bosses.
---
Then show me some that are better, go on I'll wait.
---
Hey Carebearz, i m streaming yea !
---
Again, just because it gives more DPS don't mean it's "better", those greens are completely lacking in other stats.
---
You've got a one track mind, sound like a retail DPS class player.
---
https://discord.gg/HvMGT7
---
You don't get weapon procs in forms.
---
This is the truth serum right here.
---
Pretty sure moonkin form does, which would be what i was talking about.
---
That was a pretty cool story. One that I shall remember and try to use when I get the chance. 
---
I also see that intercept might be a useful skill when I get it. I have played warrior a lot. But I have been mainly playing hunters since end of wrath. With some warrior alts here and there after. I can’t remember to ever have used intercept to any degree.
---
I don't need to fucking watch a video, I raided throughout all of vanilla. Your entire 40 man absolutely can fucking wipe from one persons mistake in every single boss fight.
---
This is not a thing in LFR because everything is so undertuned.
---
I was gonna post something like this earlier, but didn't have the heart.  The thought of me in an alternate universe being able to be playing Classic WoW today is too much to bear.  :)
---
Farming MCP is not a big deal. You only really need 1 charge for the pull to get a nice lead. As I said, Druid threat generation even without MCP is higher than a Warrior unless the Warrior has sacrificed tanking stats. Maul is higher TPS than anything a Warrior can do. Once a Druid gets ahead, no one will catch them unless there's some huge disparity in gear.
---
&gt;This isn't BfA
---
Just curious, would you dispute that Druids can MT in TBC? WotLK?
---
https://gyazo.com/f0c5d547c097dffc261f212fa1b1f85c
---
And Warlocks have Seduce or a Voidwalker off-tank. Every DPS class has CC for dungeons. That's why I tried to limit my post to raid content, since every class necessarily has a lot more utility in 5 mans. They have to, because you can't possibly bring every class to a single dungeon.
---
Well you're wrong.
---
Also binding the S key to a spell is good too. You shouldn't ever back pedal in any situation!
---
Its in the context of the post. That fact that he claimed the pserver players should had noticed something on pservers that wasnt existant means that he claims the leeway problem in classic exist in pservers, wich it doesnt.
---
When I prove OP is full of shit and you shitforbrains downvote me and make up some completely unrelated complaints that have NOTHING to do with what I said - why would I not be?
---
The average IQ of this subreddit must be somewhere around room temperature.
---
Damn, that’s weird way to spell “oh shit I’m wrong.”
---
I do a 4 day work week. So I took Wed-Thurs off, and have Fri-Sun off normally. Then Monday is a holiday. I am ready. Gotta prep my food and make sure I'm in tip top shape for the grind though.
---
Yeah clearly you are the intelligent one. You’re just wrong, move on.
---
Thats what i thought.
---
PepeLaugh
---
Tbh I wish there were more hour long videos on mundane WoW topics. Shit is like crack while waiting for 8-27.
---
I understand what you're saying but Battle.net integration is in, theyve added new graphics settings and engines from the modern client. Heck, even layering.
---
&gt; Farming MCP is not a big deal.
---
What a joke.
---
&gt; Just curious, would you dispute that Druids can MT in TBC? WotLK?
---
I have no idea. Never played those expansions.
---
Huh, i assumed that since you can see the form swinging the weapon and it isn't using a precalculated form dps for hits and skill but instead the weapons dps and skill, that you woyld get procs aswell, do you have any evidence to prove me wrong?
---
PVEasy
---
Hell yea you did took my request and made it happen!!! You’re seriously the man. Wish I could throw you gold.
---
It's really not complicated. Changes are ok when they're unavoidable and trying to replicate vanilla it was in 2004 would just become a ridiculous convoluted mess that alienates new players - such as with itemisation, talent and debuff slot revamps.     
---
    
---
Changes that directly change the gameplay that are not necessary at all shouldn't be changed.  
---
Again, the aim is to recreate WoW:Vanilla in a sensible way with the least amount of changes required. This is the guiding principal of Classic, and if you understand that all the changes/nochanges decisions make sense. Whether you think a change is a positive or negative one for gameplay does not matter.
---
Ok bud. You’ll be alright, you accuse me of not reading and then get it wrong. I know that stings, but you’ll be alright.
---
You tame a pet that already knows the spell (ex Bite 4) then make it use that spell until you yourself learn it. You can then use Beast Training (in the General tab of your spellbook) to teach that spell to any pet you want, provided they have the Skill Points needed to learn it.
---
Keep in mind that your pet doesn't need to know the previous ranks of the spell to learn it. You could teach your pet Dash 3 without ever grabbing Dash 1/2 or your pet having it.
---
You practically only need to feed it when it dies. It would take hours to go from green to yellow happiness, once you're at max loyalty.
---
Why do warlocks suck? I was considering it.
---
1 boomkin for the mages
---
Felheart shoulders of course, it gives a lot of INT, STAM, set bonuses.
---
DPS is not everything. The green is obviously shit in comparison and you would never wear that outside of a boss fight.
---
Downvoting my every comment is incredibly cringy :D You are clearly confident with your none sense argument :D :D
---
Sure you can. You can tank as a fury or arms warrior and get people on your friends list. People are going to be inviting dungeon tanks (you'll be dps in raids) to their guild pronto. So finding guildies to level along side won't be much of a problem at all.
---
 * Grinding gold as the first 60 is a waste. There won't be anything to spend the money on for days/weeks.
---
 * Herbing right at 60 is not advantageous either. There are no herbs that require level 60 to gather. You will still be competing with everyone 55+ for high level herbs.
---
 * Mining is in the same boat
---
 * Camping limited vendors is a waste at 60, as this is something you can do at almost any level, and it is better if you park an alt there instead of your main anyway.
---
There is literally nothing that being the first 60 is good for other than bragging about how you forwent normal life for 5 days and sat in front of the computer for 110 hours straight while pooping into socks.
---
Where does the urge to ever call someone a "private server noob" come from?
---
“None sense” lmaooo
---
You literally did get it wrong tho. He claims pserver players should had noticed something present in classic on the pservers when that thing wasnt present on the pserver, shown by his own video. I guess its rocket science for some
---
Are you actually fucking mentally retarded? I literally proved OP was wrong, where do you get the nerve to claim I am "just wrong". Mouthbreathing brainlet. I am 100% right, I literally proved OP is full of shit. Move on retard.
---
Cause it's all opinion so no reason to go into it.
---
Again, solid argument :D :D
---
&gt; just get used to looking at the vendor price and making an educated guess.
---
I havent played WoW I  a couple years but I do believe I had an addons that gives you the estimated disenchanting value and the vendor price in the tool tip. I would have to imagine this addons would make it's way into Classic and would be handy in this situation.
---
If you wait until 60 to start farming Devilsaurs then you're already too late to the party.
---
It does seem to work that way, yeah. But it still makes you question why looting is on the spell batching queue to begin with.
---
It pretty much sums up anyone who played on a private server that thinks it is identical to or better than vanilla.
---
What even is your point with this image? You seem confused.
---
The fault was all mine. I was in my bubble having lotta fun with it actually. I simply ignored any advice. So I can’t blame them. I can only blame myself for not listening if they tried to help. My main concern and what I talked about in guild chat was speed buffs for mounts and how far away I was from getting the epic one lol. Me being a warrior was not something I really chatted about. 
---
I can’t even remember I thought about raids at all back then. Wow was such a dramatically new dream and fantasy world for me. A place I could go and feel good. A place that revolutionised gaming for me. It made me a gamer basically. 
---
I think I was soo baffled by wow and the wonderful feeling of actually living inside a game that I ignored the game mechanics sort of.
---
Your welcome :)
---
I'd bet money any decent 5 could do it without a single raid drop. IT's really not that hard. BWL+ gear should completely trivialise it.
---
Pserver node respawn rates are going to be VASTLY faster than classic will be.
---
Hell I remember leveling mining in BC without much player competition and it still took forever.
---
I would say mining / herbing while leveling are 100% traps (mining likely more so) that WILL slow you down.
---
&gt; Simply pointed out that your ideas have no basis in fact.
---
This argument would require data.
---
and somehow this makes the point that pservers had leeway invalid?
---
And if you’re undead, a good sinister laugh too
---
Which ones, and by what metric are they trash? What's the break-point for being trash?
---
The ones that aren't good for raiding tend to be strong for PvP. I think it's okay to make that distinction if you support PvP with rewards and progression. 
---
I agree that they ironed out a lot of problems in TBC, but they also introduced a lot too.
---
I may be a terrible person... But I rarely ever had more than 4 shards on me at any given time between 1-70. 
---
:-D
---
(That said I never raided.)
---
Well, you'd be getting Omen of Clarity procs, but does sustain really matter?  Even the longer boss encounters only last 2-3 minutes for a competent guild, short enough that you could conceivably get there with buffs and consumables.
---
At first I was like there is no way this guy can hold my attention talking about bags and inventory space for an hour. And then ... he totally pulled it off. 
---
Agreed that this kind of long content is awesome!
---
How does that work? Do you have to be 'in combat' with the player? Back in vanilla and on private servers I'll have kills where I get the guy to low hp, he runs away and uses a speed increase, mob dazes him, he dies, no HK rewarded even though I did the majority of the damage.
---
Good luck, hard to find any data for such an underplayed spec, but i'm leaning towards it applying.
---
The video goes over some buffs that they suggest to use, like shadowoil. That doesn't apply for ferals and such in form i don't think, so maybe OP tested their dps so if they apply weapon procs should i reckon.
---
I never realized orcs were just rune thread.
---
My comment wasn't about the auctions, apologies for the confusion. It's about the estimated material produced from the disenchant.
---
consider yourself corrected
---
So, what's your excuse for Warriors?  You know the class that is the best at 2 of the 3 raid roles?
---
MAGE TANK WOOO
---
Hes about to change his argument, to it isnt the dps that matters on an item, its everything else....
---
Thats what ive been saying this whole time. OSRS is a separate team of people that make the game 10000 times better and let the community vote and interact with devs. If classic took this approach im sure things would be fine.
---
Actually you can do it with veins.... When you kneel down the looting batch has begun and you can move away and get the loot
---
You need to tame a pet that has the desired rank of the ability and once you tame it there is a chance every time the pet attacks there is a chance to learn it, eventually you will see "You have learned the ability Bite(rank X)"
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php#bite
---
for example, in order to get bite Rank 8 you must tame:
---
&gt; Bloodaxe Worg (Wolf, 56-57, Blackrock Spire)
---
as it is the only pet that has Rank 8.
---
Some ranks won't be available until specific stages like Lightning Breath Rank 6:
---
&gt; Son of Hakkar (Wind Serpent, 60, Zul'Gurub)
---
this is because the only pet who knows it is inside ZG.
---
Are we talking celsius or fahrenheit room temperature? Please state for accuracy.
---
Well I was planning on making my druid a chicken anyway.  Might as well find a weapon with a proc along the way and test it.
---
UWS reporting in. 
---
This sounds great, but I don’t even have time to meet up with my real life friends - I don’t think I can swing a meet up :/
---
Im down to coordinate servers though just in case.
---
Nah, the issue with boomies is even with consumes, they go oom in raids using wrath/starfire, and are forced to downrank i think, so using a spell with double the mana cost per second seems an issue.
---
- no hit % talent.
---
- no dmg reduction talent.
---
bad.
---
Players and devs focusing on raw DPS turned WoW from a D&amp;D-like RPG with enough diversity that each class felt special in certain situations into an action game where every class does the same thing with slightly different buttons to press.
---
Having different classes do different DPS is critical for WoW to continue being an RPG.
---
Yup, and I think we can feasibly get class design updates in Classic (even if it's just tweaking of mana regen or damage ratios, not adding full on talent tiers like TBC did) to make different specs viable.
---
You are not comprehending step 1-3. They take more dmg. Not just a little more. A LOT more. 
---
&gt; Where are these healers that say druids can't be healed? lol
---
Here's one for starters: 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cdw6cy/viability_of_druid_tank/etx1750/
---
&gt; You just moved the goal post to "raid tanking utility". They got more buttons to push while tanking I guess, sure.
---
I was actually thinking about Shield Wall when I wrote that and I *actually did* mean in terms of tanking utility. It's poor wording and I can see why it would come off as moving the goal post. It was just poor wording.
---
&gt; Who gives a shit? It's not even a valid argument. No one is saying "don't invite warriors".
---
It is a valid argument. There are bosses in the game that druids can't even tank. There's no boss that druids can tank that no Warrior can.
---
&gt;  I can, if you can't prove that it's more than the farming required for warriors, healers, or dps.
---
Druids have to farm the exact same consumes as Warrior tanks. MCP is *another* consume on top of that. And it takes a significant amount of time to get the Manual Crowd Pummelers you need every week.
---
The fact that you even *need* a meme weapon is quite noteworthy to mention to aspiring tanks deciding between Warrior and Druid. Don't you think?
---
&gt; That's how probability works.
---
No shit. Doesn't change the fact that the dropchance is 35%. If you're farming MCP every week you gotta deal with it in averages. You can't just say "oh sure this Druid was lucky and got 5 MCP pr. hour, every week, throughout his entire WoW career". Sure that's technically possible but it's just not probable at all.
---
&gt; Wrong, druids can tank 90% of content, even in progression.
---
That's 100%. Warriors can tank 100%. It doesn't matter though. Stop recommending first time players to roll druid for tanking. It's just a bad option for anyone who doesn't know what they're getting themselves wrapped up in.
---
Haha, we're only taking it seriously because the numbers haven't been run yet. I'm working on it, but I am missing big chunks (some of which you highlighted in the video) so I'm kinda doubting how accurate a simulator is going to be until we confirm some mechanics in Classic.
---
I completely agree.
---
Don't give up man, i hear ret pallies are doing some spellpower hybrid to push competitive dps now, so maybe it's possible to try to get something similiar for boomies.
---
If they wanna keep it vanilla they should invest in adding to their PvP system, perhaps go the esports route to keep people’s interest and attract content creators. Furthermore if it happens at all like osrs, at first everyone will want it the same but down the road we will come to ask for some of the positive QoL changes that add to the experience without making the game as streamlined as retail
---
&gt; That's why TBC is an objectively far superior game.
---
In terms of class design, sure. In terms of immersion classic was far superior.
---
Wow. I mean I knew you were dumb, but holy crap. Please, get help.
---
Why do these comics remind me of Ed Edd n Eddy?
---
It happened to me on a SFK pserver run.
---
I'm genuinely curious: in what way? In my mind they're functionally identical. Polymorph works on beasts, while Seduce doesn't, but Voidwalkers work on anything. The Voidwalker's expendable, and it's not like it's going to lose aggro to the healer.
---
Unless your chance to get laid from said girls is high, play WoW.
---
Meh. I agree it's a good intelligent reasonable thing to have in the game. The reality is it wasn't in vanilla though so it won't be in classic. I don't think you need to account share at all. You have a couple people in the guild known for enchants/potions/BS and they make themselves available to do free/cheap crafts for people and people send them spare mats.   
---
Sure that's a messy and somewhat annoying system for 40 man raiding but it's perfectly functioning. You absolutely don't *need* to account share to raid in vanilla with no guild banks. And you'd be an absolute moron to in 2019 with all the account security and ip tracking and automated bans/account locks they do.  
---
Honestly I thought they would put it in, but it's clear from the beta it won't be and it would be a bit out of place having such an obviously TBC feature in the game anyway, it would hurt the feel of vanilla for sure. It's similar to having spell damage/hit chance in character screen. To me that's a 100% logical and completely drawback free improvement to the game. But when I see that in the game I think TBC, i don't think vanilla. In vanilla you get a mod that displays it. Yes that's kinda stupid, but that's Classic.
---
We always lvl in the shadows\~\~
---
The community will be way too split for anything to actually ever happen after Naxx. The #nochanges dont add anything, the classic with new content, and the people who want TBC to just be released. They cant cater to everyone so this split will probably cause the game to die off unfortunately.
---
It’s actually immensely satisfying to stop an enemy from questing in an area due to your presence. Obviously talking same-level in contested areas.
---
Nah, it's about right: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17604450959
---
&gt; exploits
---
That word doesn't mean what you think it does.
---
Oh well ok thanks
---
If you roll on tank or healer gear they need its gonna be problem.
---
I am not sure I agree with that.  In Vanilla, I never knew why I was doing anything, so I felt disconnected from the story. 
---
 With TBC, and especially WOTLK, I felt like part of the story.
---
I briefly looked into it and moonkin can use top ranked moonfire once then down ranked moonfire to avoid the dot being over ridden (more mana efficient). + Omen of clarity can proc providing free cast. I don't think guilds will let moonkin take up debuff slots although idk if moonfire is considered low priority dot.
---
Being an old white republican, I will only play in my gated community (PvE), away from you filthy bandits bushwhacking each other in your Walmart parking lot of a server.        
---
        
---
YT,
---
C. Bear
---
It's not a thing in real wow.
---
In real wow, bosses have 15% parry, and each parry gives them 50% haste.  
---
So on real wow, furry prot tanks will take even MORE more damage 
---
Bosses also have ~3% more crit suppression in real wow.
---
So a class that depends on crit to produce threat, will have a much much harder time even catching up to baseline prot threat.
---
&gt; If Warriors had the option of farming 6 hours per week for their BIS weapon/some crazy amazing consumable, they would do it in droves.
---
We are talking about recommending noobs to play feral if they want to tank. 
---
It's a pretty significant detail that you have to spend more time waiting for Gnomeregan resets than actually raiding. On top of the other consumes you need to farm. 
---
On top of that: I wager that druids aren't even better at tanking. Sure they might hold decent aggro once in a blue moon but they take so much dmg all the time. If you're progressing that will be a hinderance.
---
&gt; Fucking casual. ;)
---
Says the mount collector
---
Hmm, that would give em more room for mana, insect swarm would be good too but yeah the other issue are the debuff slots.
---
Seems like a lot of unnecessary work and you miss the best profession, engineering, at the end. 
---
You can buy any leather gear you may need on the ah. Let someone else do the grunt work. 
---
Keep skinning and grab either mining or herb while leveling. Herb usually earns more gold which you can later use to level enchanting or go with mining and stockpile for engineering and sell the rest to buy mats to level enchanting. 
---
Pick whatever you want to keep with engineering at the end. Just imo.
---
every class has a viable pvp and pve spec. not every spec needs to be viable.
---
I'm assuming your a ret paladin who gets salty over having to heal raids or something, play for the guild not for yourself.
---
Op: 
---
&gt;Warriors, rogues, and mages are designed to deal significantly higher personal DPS than any other class.
---
Also OP:
---
&gt;These top DPS classes conspicuously lack group-wide combat buffs or utility skills, while every other class has plenty. 
---
Here is a list of buffs and combat / utility skills Mages and Warriors bring in classic: 
---
* Battle Shout. 185 attack power to your whole group
---
* Demoralizing Shout. Reduces enemy attack power
---
* Piercing Howl. Dazes and slows nearby enemies 
---
* Intimidating Shout. Stuns one enemy and fears the rest
---
* Thunderclas. Slows nearby enemies
---
* Being a tank
---
* Amplify Magic. Increases magic damage dealt (and taken)
---
* Dampen Magic. Decreases magic damage taken (and healing taken)
---
* Polymorph. Make someone a sheep
---
* Arcane Intellect/Brilliance. Make someone/everyone smarter (this is more mana and more spell crit and holy shit how can you not count this as a utility or a buff???)
---
* Remove Lesser Curse. Some raids just do not happen without a mage. For real.
---
* Food and Water. You dismissed it but its huge.
---
So l like how you just ignore the fact that these classes bring more to the table than just dps in order to justify them being the best dps.
---
Are these BIS or just stepping stones to the good stuff?
---
This is a really good use for a Moonkin. They heal for most of the raid, but then during Cthun vulnerbility they pull out Moonkin and give the ignite mages 3% crit. Pserver approved.
---
Edited my comment to mention you'd also be double dipping into judgement of wisdom potentially.
---
For raiding?  What doesn't work.
---
#Druid:  2/4
---
Balance
---
Feral Kitty dps only sort of works, because of some ridiculously overpowered items.  Namely the wolfshead helm, and MCP.    I am going to go ahead and include this as a broken spec, because it's only been forced to sort of work.
---
#Hunter: 2/3
---
BM
---
Surv:  Some people say surv can surpass MM late tier 3, but even if that's true, it's crap 99% of the time.
---
#Mage 1/3
---
Arcane:   Yes, you raid MC and BWL with an arcane spec, but you aren't playing as an arcane mage.  You are playing as a frost mage with an arcane spec.
---
#Paladin 2/3
---
Protection:  This is the worst spec in the game, as long as you aren't including Shaman tank.
---
Retribution:  Joke DPS
---
Priest: 1/3
---
Shadow:   As a dps spec, it doesn't work.  Even if you are allowed to be the ONE spriest in the raid, you will likely only be casting rank1 mindflay and healing.  Broken.
---
Rogue: 1/3
---
Subtlety:  Hemorrhage is mostly just a waste of a debuff slot.
---
Shaman: 2/3
---
Elemental:  OOM, and provides no buffs another shaman can't provide.  Just no pt in bringing over a Rshaman or mage.
---
Enhancement:  Joke dps, and again, a Rshaman can provide the same utility.  Some people mistakenly believe that Improved weapons totems is something worthwhile, but it's one of the worst talents in the game.   It adds 3 dps per melee, and doesn't scale at all.
---
Warlock:  1/3
---
Affliction:  You can't be wasting debuff slots on a bunch of dots.   The way the spec should work just isn't useable in raids.  
---
Warrior: 2/3
---
Arms:  Arms isn't a viable dps spec.   Yes, in early MC a Arms warrior can spam Hamstring to exploit WF mechanic, but that's a small % of the game, and it's not being played in the way it was meant to be played.
---
I mean it’s an exaggeration. Of course you still take damage. But rage starving is less of a thing esp when you run Prot/arms for tactical mastery, anger management and impale. Plus when your decked out you charge, shield block, revenge....the mob ain’t leaving you till it dies esp when your group is decked and the mob dies in 5 seconds anyways.
---
#WINDFURY INFUSED WHOOSH
---
It was Kevin Jordan, he said they were made to off tank but not be the MT
---
Sounds good to me.  I was thinking about the same set up barring the AoE pulls being tanked by the Druid and the Paladin flash healing whoever needed it.
---
Poly doesn’t break as easily as other CC. It’s one of the best CC in the game because it can be reapplied pretty much forever.  Seduction is hit or miss and that reduces dps for locks along with void. Imo is the best pet for 5 man groups.
---
I agree, you have no idea what is actually going on since you have no relevant data. You can "Theorycraft" all you like but without having actual numbers it gets you nowhere. 
---
Take a look at your whole argument, and the basis it stands on. You have nothing while screaming about how OP druid damage is compared to a thing that doesn't even exist in a final form yet. Perhaps the pirate servers got this wrong like so many other things, but you have no proof for as forceful a statement you make about it. 
---
If you had said "We think that they got it wrong and had druids doing too much damage" I wouldn't even have argued with you since in general I feel they are a terrible misrepresentation of what vanilla really was. Too many guesses and too much ego about how good a job they did when things were clearly wrong. You may even be right in the end, but we don't know anything yet and until we do acting like you know things for a fact is simply wrong.
---
seduce only lasts 15 seconds and costs 25% of the pets mana, it cannot regen while channeling so every 4-5 casts you need to re-summon the thing which can get pretty tedious.
---
I wouldn't say seduce is bad its just clunky more than anything.
---
mage poly is smooth, lasts like 45 seconds, has big slows and roots.
---
its night and day difference having a mage vs not.
---
&lt;fuhgetaboutit&gt;
---
Stance Dance Intercepts are your #1 skill against ranged! If you have fast reactions this shouldn't be much of an issue. Just some key bindings and macroing if need be.
---
There are very, very specific moments in 1v1 PvP you save it for too. Like after a death coil against locks or after a mage blinks. Or you can use it as an emergency spell interrupt. It is the difference between life and death.
---
I just play with a gaming mouse. 60 bindings all usable comfortably with my right thumb (and left digit for shift, alt, control).  Never played with one until about 2013 and can’t imagine ever going without one again.
---
Nah even with raid buffs, it does help if they can innervate themselves but let's be real, that's not yours.
---
Lmao keep these coming.  An Ed, Edd, n Eddy / WoW crossover is something I ever knew I needed.
---
Say that to my BONEREAVER'S EDGE!! Here's to dreaming...
---
Just so you know, it'a fun because of people like you
---
Fair enough, I agree with that overall. I think we are just arguing semantics at this point, or maybe I'm just not phrasing it well :P
---
Ctrl and alt plus numbers can be bound. That gives you a lot to work with
---
Because we're stealthed
---
\**urge to innervate self intensifies*\*
---
Out glow looks horrible. If you must use it use the pixelate filter
---
There is a tutorial system of sorts in Classic. The layout is probably not as robust as the one in retail but it helps you a little bit while still retaining some mystery.
---
I thought about that but I'm not sure how well a druid can hold AoE aggro with 5+ mobs.
---
I thought the most recent conclusions were that even assuming the worst-case scenario in all of the unknowns, Moonfire spam would still outpace anything else, right? Or am I misremembering?
---
I dont think ot will be that bad
---
 There might be a few quests that would be harder but remeber nack then quests werent a linear experience. You can dam near fill up the log in one zone
---
+1 for the imp, stamina is nice and honestly fire shield on the tank is so nice for sticky threat.
---
I want stability, moderation, customer support, and a community so I'll play Classic.
---
I doubt it's fun because of people like me since Im playing on PvE servers
---
And here I am the guy from DAoC who ran with an 8 man guild gank group to assist train down zergs

Well on LH nodes would often respawn instantly or in a very short period of time. That doesn't line up at all with what I've heard and seen watching streamers mine / level mining, etc. 
---
Mining is probably easier on alliance if you can be the only miner and run deadmines over and over. 
---
In general though any professions will slow you down, and I cannot see mining being too different.
---
I would say if you don't mind leveling a bit slower, you can probably make it work out and definitely get the nodes around you as you can, but sometimes the levels ramp quickly and you may have to spend a lot of time in certain skill ranges.
---
How are they screwing anyone over if you know they have the item on reserve ahead of time? It's your choice to join that group.
---
Priests, paladins, and shamans don't need 2nd and third gear sets.
---
and then walk back to it? you have to loot it ~5 times. this shit is fucked to no end.
---
Imo flying ruined the game when they extended it to Azeroth, I rather enjoyed it being Outland only in tbc.
---
i'd swap out the druid for a warrior, that way you don't have 3 healers at 60
---
By reserving in general. They should just make some friends, why should they get special loot privilege for spamming the LFG chat? It's not like it's hard
---
Honestly I like classic, but if we get tbc servers I will live there.
---
You learn growl and passive pet abilities from the pet trainer, but you have to learn all the other pet abilities (including higher ranks) by taming a new pet that innately has that ability and using it until you learn it. You then use the beast training ability to assign abilities to your pet.
---
IIRC at max loyalty a pet needs to die a few times before they lose a happiness level. I would usually just feed them after each res so I know they will stay happy.
---
Druids are Viable, arguably good even.
---
there are only a handful of bosses that a druid cannot tank(chromaggus for example because you cannot use the sands while in bear form).
---
the TPS of feral druids is actually REALLY strong, crit maul has insane threat modifier.
---
No it is, we do it to make you angry. Plenty of people like you on PvP servers that haven't ragequit to PvE yet
---
No, it's based on common sense. At least, that's what I've seen most of the community agree is the best course if Classic TBC is going to be a thing. There is also a statement made by Ion (I think) about how Classic servers will exist as long as Blizzard exists, which in that context would refer to Classic Vanilla.
---
As a young white conservative, I will only play on servers that allow me to spread FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY to every Horde player I meet on the road.
---
Free pocket Bibles to anyone who /waves for Jesus!
---
&gt; without having actual numbers
---
says you.
---
K have fun with that. I hear people talk about the difficulty of lvling a warrior as their main, but I guess your into it.
---
Id pay 20g for a stupid guild photo
---
Shift spacebar is the most under rated bind. So good for movement spells
