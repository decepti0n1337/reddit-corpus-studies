I bet you're actually this dumb irl
---
---
---
Probably not, it doesn't seem to work with Shaman clearcasting either, just Elemental Mastery.
---
This guy must be on a dead server. I’ll give you my anecdotal evidence and it is that mining is all luck based. You can farm for those 3 hours and get 0 arcane crystals and make 25 gold from it instead of the 400 this guy claims. They are a very low % drop rate (3%) so for most people it takes hours just to find 1.
---
OP, I don't know what server you're on, but on Whitemane there's always openings for guilds that are raiding or intend to be raiding very soon. Use weekly PUG raids to find guilds with people you like running with. Then message their leadership and ask to join. 
---

---
And everyone isn't settled because 15 years in and guild drama is still a thing so big guilds implode all the time. 
---
You literally have nothing to lose by shopping around.
---
Haha okay then. Good job
---
My first character was a warrior. I couldn’t figure out how to kill oakenscrawl (so?) and then gave up! Lol!
---
Went with mage next. :)
---
Friendly reminder to use the FPs in more protected territories and run over.  The time spent running from Reddrige to burning steppes is minimal compared to the 45 minutes trying to leave the FP there lol
---
If you have a toon trying to lvl in dungeons, just park it there.
---
Dirty dangles bud!
---
nice!
---
I am not entirely sure where you get these numbers, to be perfectly honest.
---
Opt in pvp is not the same thing though, it’s at best a pale comparison.  A neutered world where all risk vs reward has been forcibly removed.  A single player server completely devoid of player agency, where all enemy faction may as well be npcs.
---
Incendius.
---
Yeah I've gone that route too I just don't like the pathing if you do die, the graveyard is in a shitty spot
---
Do you SEE how miserable all the Alliance posters here on reddit are?!
---
This is absolute **peak** you think you do, but you don't.
---
Incendius
---
lol
---
Yes fosho luuul
---
Question: how do you get DPS to join? I'm guessing they need something from arena but just confirming
---
That's my point. There are 4 instances in BRM and it's ridiculous that it takes 45 minutes to get there. I shouldn't have to set aside 3 or 4 hours to do LBRS
---
You just hurt my brain
---
what if its not hard on him? Why are you so bitter and why does this subreddit have such shade on exceptionalism?
---
You think someone would do that, just go on the internet and tell lies?
---
The guys on AskReddit really are the most gullible people on the internet...
---
Yes. The ML can loot everything from the chest and then trade items or distribute from the chest. Only one person can open the chest at a time, but only the ML can took loot out of the chest.
---
”Now you probably wonder how I ended up here.”
---
Rip I'm level 40 at that playtime. Speed leveling seems nuts, I don't know how people manage it through questing
---
I can't see a server merger ending well. Not for Skeram, not for Heartseeker, and certainly not for Blizzard. They need to figure out a better way.
---
Should have been Private Dancer.
---
&gt;thats what many people loved
---
Vanilla was nothing like optimized death squads with optimal gear and engineering. Not even close. 
---
Also, people in vanilla also hated faction unbalance of population, wich is pretty much this problem.
---
I dont really have a choice, questing is just too much of a hellscape rn
---
You are entirely correct but rule of thumb is that loot winners equip their shit within 0.2 seconds because why not, as was the case this time.
---
wowclassicpopulation.com
---
Of course these are unofficial numbers, but it's the data we have. What isn't data are people's anecdotes about being outnumbered on their server 4:1 (note this is only true of one Horde dominated server, but true of two Alliance dominated servers).
---
Pretty useful for avoiding saps while mounted. And a fair few rogues farm kills that way in my experience.
---
Is the sergeants pvp cape any good? I have the black baron cape for rogue but not sure if I should give up all those attack stats for +17 stam
---
Are thorium brotherhood rep tailoring recipes in game yet or are they being added in next phases?
---
Mawm bachtroom
---
The guy who got it had already equipped it! And either way, as I said, we managed to solve it and the point of the addon is to avoid this happening at all.
---
I just want something besides quests since its way too slow with the increased wpvp
---
I am currently leveling a warlock at lvl 15. What should my rotation be when going in to dungeons soon? I feel like putting DoTs on all mobs and then focussing the main target would be the most efficient, but it might pull aggro too easily. In that case would just using corruption and shadow bolt on the main target be better?
---
Additionally should I allow my imp to attack in dungeons or just leave him passive for the blood pact buff without using his attacks?
---
i hope your 10 paragraph QQing made you happier
---
I follow them around stv, peaking through the trees. Always staying far enough. I like to pretend I'm being sneaky, only moving when their character is looking away, because it's hilarious to me. I want it to feel like they are being watched. You are being begrudgingly allowed passage thru a hostile territory and I am just praying for one misstep so I have a reason to slaughter you.
---
...I might be more at home on a rppvp but whatever lol
---
I wrote something pretty similar and I play on horde. What’s happening isn’t fun, it’s definitely not classic wow.
---
Lol.
---
Always the same with allience.
---
always bothered me, especially since you can plainly see the sword/shield on randy's character. i'm guessing it was a "old guy doesn't know what he's playing" joke but it didn't come off well if that was intentional.
---
Get time stamps on your chat.
---
Yes let's encourage breaking EULA conditions, that's responsible
---
My guild oes help me run through... but there are about 20 active people. I would go to a larger one, but they've been so nice and incredibly helpful vs when I was in my server's largest that I dont feel like leaving :/
---
Yea, top tier material
---
There's already addon for that  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pugloot](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pugloot) 
---
It also has a roll period where you can ask your raid to roll and it announces the winner after 15 seconds.

https://www.wowhead.com/making-a-macro-commands-modifiers-warcraft-guide#:~:targetText=Macro%20is%20a%20tool%20that,them%20from%20normal%20text%20actions.
---
Type /macro in game and it will bring up the macro menu.  Macros can be used for compound actions (targeting then casting a spell on a specific person) casting actions in a sequence with multiple presses of the same button, and many other things. 
---
An easy macro that a lot of hunters use will cast hunters mark, send the pet to attack, and initiate your auto shot.  On mobile so I don't know what formatting will look like, but the text will say something like 
---
#showtooltip Hunter's Mark
---
/Cast Hunter's Mark
---
/Petattack
---
/Cast !Auto Shot
---
You can add to this, but that's just a simple example. Theres a whole vernacular to learn when creating custom macros, but that's a bit more advanced.
---
Thanks for the advice! I think that's my only option. I usually run around with a warrior who's 55. But people are smart and usually gank me first or there's a pack of 3 or 4 people in a guild that just wreck me.
---
Free action potions do fuck all against warlocks. Learn the game before giving advice
---
Non-early access Subnautica was Jan. 2018, which won the same award last year.
---
I sort of figured that when Cartman got good gear, *he* would be the new griefer that forgot how much it sucked to be camped. And the whole crazy wheel goes round again.
---
Bad advice here.
---
I'm not a kid
---
Basically a Macro is something you can basically program to do something for you in a simpler fashion.
---
Ie; you can make a macro that does something like:
---
/y I Am A Macro
---
Or
---
/y get up loser, time to work
---
/cast Resurrection on xxx
---
And it’ll do just that.
---
You can use it for more advanced things, like weapon twisting or Bubléhearthing on a paladin or backstab weapon swapping on a rogue, or w.e you really want.
---
Some people even make 1 shot macros where you just keep pressing the button and it does a chain of skills to kill people.
---
I'm on Ashbringer horde and it's much worse for us I can guarantee that.
---
Horde are far more casual on our server that alliance - most the hard-core rank 14 grind groups are alliance.
---
Took me 1 hour today to get into UBRS. Alliance gank squads camping kargath, thorium point and also the chain. 7 corpse runs to get into the instance...
---
Yeah I'm prot right now.
---
Such is the price of curiosity.
---
Is there a reason why ppl move while meleeing why not just stay still and hit ur spells?
---
Limit PvP server sign up to maintain a certain ratio? Institute faction queues to maintain a certain ratio like private servers had?
---
I think the host Josh said there would be less episodes going forward, which is a shame because I love the show and listen every week!
---
&gt;  I'm not sure how anyone benefits from making me redo all the effort I put in over the last three months though - the end result in both cases would be I have a level 60 character and a level 48 character on the PVE server.
---
You would benefit from it by enjoying the environment you want, and we would benefit from it by seeing less of these threads. It's win-win. 
---
&gt;Except I'm clearly not going to do that because I've already played pretty much all the pre-60 content in the game twice at this point and other commitments in my life. Instead, I'll just quit the game. 
---
So why post here if you've already planned on quitting? 
---
&gt;Who wins in that situation?
---
One less complainer is a win for all PvPers.
---
&gt;All because I assumed that playing a Classic PVP server would somewhat resemble the experience of what playing WoW at the equivalent point when the game actually released. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess you didn't actually play the original WoW at that point in time?
---
I played a mage in Vanilla from the first week to the end of TBC, so you are wrong.
---
Woah dude, calm down!
---
You think horde outnumbers ally this bad om Flamelash?  Horde probably outnumbers bit Allys are so much more active. I have Been camped like crazy in Felwood, burning stepps. Every time i swing by Hillsbrand Ally outnumbers horde 2 or 3 to one.
---
Nice
---
😄👍
---
fuck the horde
---
Just lol. Yeah ok racial are totally balanced and there is nothing wrong with anything right now! Just gotta suffer through 6 months of bs until it finally, possibly gets better right?
---
I expected nothing and I'm still disappointed.
---
Looks great, fully featured compared to mine.
---
My problem IS getting a group. As a rogue I find it hard since lots of groups want locks or mages
---
Have you actually tried lashers? I’m doing them as a way to level from 55+ on my Priest and they definitely drop loot. I’m probably making 10-15G an hour with 2 resets.
---
If you’re able to do 5 resets an hour it will be pretty decent money.
---
Spell reflect came out with TBC. Easily my favorite ability ever. Though the engineering trinket "shadow reflector" makes you reflect sahdow spells
---
This id
---
It’s also part of the epic mount quest for warlocks. Need 25 ore per lock.
---
I still have ptsd from this place as a meelee
---
Very true :( I have it easy as priest heals.
---
They play on the lowest populated PvE realms at insane hours.
---
Underrated comment
---
yeah wich is normal for 136k honor , im at 130k and im gonna get rank 4
---
That point just proves him wrong.
---
You would wait 3-4 hours in queue on a 25/75 ratio server every day?
---
Honestly every dungeon is melee ptsd, think about how manu more mechanics we have to deal with just because we like to hit things with swords
---
it was actually wierd when i landed with all 3 chars there wasn't a big raid of ppl it was very silent today .. dnno why :D
---
Stans dad is a hunter with a shield
---
What's with all the: "horde are assholes" and "fix population imbalances".
---
It's not one side that are being dicks, people are being dicks on both sides. Sure, horde camp BRM, Alliance camp locations too. Sure, there might be a slightly larger percentage of assholes on one side or the other. 
---
When you give people the chance to be asshats, they will on both sides.
---
May you tie your next epic roll, and lose.
---
Is there a equip sequence macro available? For example I have a cast sequence macro where I can tap once to pop one ability and twice etc for the other ones. 
---
I wish to make a one button offhand equip macro for skull, medicine pouch and my normal off hand.
---
Cheers,
---
If they're sitting and don't have ice barrier up, use tigers fury into ravage to (hopefully) oneshot crit them
---
You cant do a ticket, when you go to support to do a ticket, it just tells you to do it in game. as in right click report instead of doing a ticket.
---
I think it depends on the server. The Ally heavy server with free xfers will become increasingly so as the horde opt to leave. The opposite for horde heavy servers
---
I don't think its really worth worrying about because there's little you or I can do to influence it.
---
It’s a challenge to avoid them.  Some people aren’t up to the challenge, so they come to reddit and whine.
---
I feel like pve servers are just full of people huddled up together circlejerking 24/7 over how much better they think pve servers are compared to pvp.
---
I was on my lvl 53 Shadow Priest and was charged by a gnome warrior with OEB. I got him to 50% HP and he panicked and popped Recklessness on me. So I died, but I am very much looking forward to meeting him again when I've levelled up a bit more.
---
Download atlas loot and look up some gear lists for fury warriors. You can plan your dungeons off of that.
---
I don't play fury, but I know that UBRS has a few drops (Dal'Rends and truestrike shoulders).
---
So maybe in 3 years I can get rank 14 with only 20 hours of work per week.  I'm more willing to wait than I am willing to spend 40+ hours per week on it.
---
Runspeed to boots.
---
A high-DPS wand like Jaina's Firestarter or Wand of Allistarj.
---
Otherwise I'd say conserve gold for 60. Check AH periodically for high-level frost damage greens at low prices, and save for leveling professions/epic mount at 60.
---
&gt;Charge has a 25 yard range, improved frost bolt is 36 yards. A r1 frost bolt should tag the warrior from a distance and prevent the charge.
---
Due to projectile flight time, at best this works when the warrior is already unmounted, and even then you may just cut it close. Counterspell is the big one for charge prevention, but also not what you'd want to do outside of a 1v1.
---
As you said though, mages should still win if they don't do anything stupid.
---
I am legit trying to farm Pirate Cove at lvl 47 (this is important- not worth anything atm for 60's) and still getting 4 man ganked every 2 minutes if I'm lucky and have a minute to try and farm. 
---
When I group for dungeons people ALWAYS (6 groups in a row) leave after a few bosses and then the thing collapses. 
---
I had a Priest the other day that went OOM on the FIRST PULL in ZF just healing me as a warrior, said "I can't heal this" and then quit. I ran ZF with a paladin healer and we got by fine ffs. 
---
So it's either get a massive headache grinding mobs or trying to run 1-2 bosses for mediocre exp when I should be able to level solo how I want to, but can't. So yeah, I really hope interest dies. 
---
Still 10+ ?? lvl rogues that patrol all of Tanaris, aka the 'quietest' farm spot on my server, so I don't see that changing until BG's come out. I tried to be patient but I have to take a break from this bs.
---
That's an older joke, but it still checks out.
---
i can feel it coming dude.. i just got a job.. which is good but now i have two jobs.. i also play guitar as a hobby which needs alot of practice, gotta keep my house in order.. get out of the house sometimes, spend time with the gf.. im enjoying wow so much but im starting to worry, i dont know if i can find time and energy to balance all this shit.. fuck..
---
Already seen two separate people complain that just because they took a  24 hr break they only got rank 3. It's only getting tastier.
---
“Pvp happened on a pvp server”
---
Well, sadly im on a 40/60 server where there are 14k lv60s according to this page, and im sure many people dont have the addon (I dont either). To be honest i can understand people complaining about 4:1 ratios, it does feel like that, honestly, when an entire raid of 30-40 people horde sits on your body because they got nothing else to do, but there just isnt enough alliance members to fight them. 
---
Some of my friends already cancelled their subscription sadly, so I guess it'll get even worse if this shitfest of a "wpvp" continues the way it is. 
---
Also:
---
&gt;I like that you used "many" instead of the actual number which is like... 2? 3?
---
I only had european servers in mind for some reaons, completely forgot USA exists.
---
"Meta" tag, why someone would upvote this shitpost is beyond me
---
Boars don't actually give you xp past lvl 10.
---
Turns out, if you kick people from the raid group mid-fight it can mess up the loot priority...
---
Bingo.
---
no hes still very active and humping all the orcs
---
I’m a 60 warrior and off tank in raids with a fury/prot build. So I’m 0/31/20 or something like that. 
---
It’s great because I can do a when I don’t need to tank but i can tank very well when I need to. I don’t see the need to go deep prot for any reason.
---
*you’re*
---
that sounds very accurate
---
Im totally donig a healer next, im 16.3ish days in on 55 rogue and &gt;1 of myriad of alts, I really need to hit 60 lmao
---
Because in the servers you need them, the ratio is 3 to 1, and it's not possible. A medium or large group will be seen as a nod to farm by the other faction, and therefore, useless because the other faction will gather players way faster.
---
I've met quite a few players who started playing wow after watching this episode.
---
The idea is that they would remove portions of the API the addon uses to stop it and any versions or alternatives from being used. But they can't stop these API calls because they're actually useful and necessary for tons of addons. If they broke Spy they'd also break every other addon. If they just banned Spy they'd be giving the ability for a savvy few to continue using it through alternatives giving the majority of people a disadvantage.
---
As a mage, I totally disagree. Every class has their strengths and weaknesses. I certainly don't feel OP.
---
Healers usually have no incentive for arena/anger, you normally have to throw Golem into the mix in order to entice them with Second Wind.
---
I would see if you have any healers in your guild willing to help you out, as adding Golem will put a significant amount of time onto each run.
---
What ui is that? Elvui?
---
&gt; If you're a Warlock or a Hunter, you can immediately command your pet to attack, and it runs straight at them and reveals where they are, even if you can't otherwise see them.
---
If you're a priest, you can just cast Mind Vision and see where they are as well.
---
I didn't want to get Spy, I think it's cheap. But I was getting found so easily by the gank squads while I'm trying to quest (lvl 53 currently), that I figured they must be using it. Last night was my first night playing with it on, and it helped avoid those roaming packs of 60s immensely. Hopefully this whole Purge thing calms down soon so I can turn the mod off; I still don't like it, but I kinda need it right now just to get anything done.
---
I'm just going to see how high I can go while being an adult and go from there.
---
I feel genuinely bad whenever I kill a mid-50 who just wants to level. Or even fresh 60's who just want to go to a dungeon or do some gathering, you know, enjoy the game. Feels like theyre just getting straight up bullied, it makes me sad.
---
But what choice is there if you want to keep up with the ranking.
---
If it’s unbearable then reroll.
---
Netherwind is dad server, not much happens after 11 server
---
- another Netherwind lateboi
---
i’ll be expecting your post when you hit 6969
---
The things I watch while urinating in a public restroom.
---
I might just be really bad at searching for things, but I couldn't find any concrete information about a particular aspect of battlegrounds. I'm trying to find out if Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley will be as they were in Vanilla, with no timer. I much prefer those game modes to have no timer, with WSG it would get really tense at 2/3 each, and I loved the AV matches that could go on for days. Can anyone of you lovely folks provide me with some info?
---
I think you think it can do more than it actually does. It doesn't tell you where every rogue is. It only tells you if they stealth while in combat log distance from you. It doesn't tell you where anyone is. Only that they're close by.
---
You won't be adding those 2000 people to a single zone. All it takes is forming some groups and answering back. You won't have the entire Horde force out at once either.
---
Then follow the dang instructions.
---
They're Horde, what do you expect?
---
You literally keep talking about a PvP aspect and bringing up three things: Fear Ward, Stoneform, Escape Artist. You aren’t realizing that I am speaking from more than just a PvP perspective or even a PvE perspective(hence Underwater Breathing, Treasure Find in my list). The Horde has generally more unique and expansive racials to encompass the entire game. The Horde exclusively gets increased Hunter/Warlock damage passively through Orc and Troll Racials.
---
You and I aren’t having the same argument, hence why no point to continue it. I don’t know why PvP was the only thing you pointed out.
---
Have you considered doing a rogue? You can make quite a bit doing BRD/LBRS stealth pickpocket/coffer farming. You can also solo just about anything that isn't stun immune. Currently also carries the advantage of being extremely good at blockade running, my 53 rogue can get into BRM in about half the time of my 60 prot warrior.
---
Keep dreaming bud.
---
No but I'd love to know your name and realm. I'd gank the shit out of you
---
Not at level two, you didn't.
---
Spy will never be removed because all it does is read the combat log and presents the info there.
---
Ehhhhhhhh 25-30 man unless you're going for speed times. Any more if just wasting loot.
---
They appeared in Vanilla and BC, so they are sticking to the #nochanges
---
I did lmao
---
Me too :) it’s just unplayable and I feel like I’m wasting my time anyways
---
So much this.  Warden staff offers about 45 more armor in bear form (10 armor before the 360%), and two more defense.  It actually has one LESS stamina than the unyielding maul. 
---
DMN maul is functionally equivalent to warden staff, and you want to be doing Trib runs anyways to build out your gear set.  The good part is NO ONE will roll against this mace if you are tanking the instance otherwise they're pretty much 100% ninja.
---
I feel like im talking to a wall here.
---
That's what i liked to do on gurubashi arena in late september to early october, while people tried to sneaky steal arena trinkets for their twinks
---
"No Im an Arcane Fire Mage"
---
"...Christ"
---
About what exactly? I think you are trying to fight with me when it seems we are in agreement.
---
maybe disable the part of the addon that lets  you tar, have to actually type /tar then name would be fair
---
Don't waste gold on the Warden Staff, the Maul can be enchanted with  with an Iron Countweight https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6043/iron-counterweight
---
It actually works in your animal forms, it equals about 32 Strength in terms of DPS, the Warden Staff's primary enchant (15 agil) isn't in game for 4 more phases, which is a year+ from now, so it's slightly worse than the maul
---
Spy affects combat though. Knowing a stealthed player is nearby when you haven’t come close enough to see them makes the point of their stealth well, pointless. 
---
Gathered is basically like drawing a map of a zone and marking points where herbs spawn, just that it is done for you in the game. 
---
One addon couldn’t be replicated by hand without a computer while the other can. 
---
Ban spy, gatherer is fine. Shitty comparison to say that oneor the other should or shouldn’t be “removed”
---
Also the “unfair advantage” can be refuted because any player with engineering it at an “unfair advantage”. But they could be on an even field if they simply chose to Obtain engineering. 
---
They simply download gatherer/spy.
---
Me and my mates fly to Thelsamar to take the tunnel due south. Hardly any horde look at the entrance there, so it tends to be nice until you're at the north road above the canyon in SG.
---
I haven't raided yet, and if I do I'll prolly respect to combat for a couple of weeks. For now hemo is fine in dungeons while I work on my pre-raid gear.
---
Whatever you say.
---
I think the alliance on my server gave up. Everywhere my guild goes now to farm honor is just always us.
---
A lot of people didn't realize phase 2 would make quests in the 48-59 range literally impossible to complete or that going into a dungeon requires dying on the way 5+ times. The people who say it's fine are already lvl60 and don't understand what they're talking about.
---
People complain about 40v40 on a large server, you are not going to roll in a zone as an Alliance raid and be met with 2000 Horde. 
---
The data says you are not grossly outnumbered (save a few outliers).
---
Lol, thanks. What a great episode
---
Might as well also get rid of hotkeys. it would be more fair if everyone had to mouse click all their abilities to reward true skill.
---
The PvP system went live last week. Things will be back to normal in another week or two.
---
I play on Fairbanks
---
No queues, gank squads are at a min. Never have much trouble finding dungeon groups as a dps. I dont have any complaints lol
---
[removed]
---
We can't entrust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a *noob!*
---
I mean if a server is 80/20 with a 10k populuation that means you just cut the server player base by 6k
---
Server size is irrelevant. People keep bringing this up as if it matters.
---
If you had 10000 horde vs 100 alliance, you would have a point, but that's not the case when the ratio of players remains the same.
---
The entrance to BRD/MC was a shitshow back then, just like it is today. You just have more people doing the same thing. Even if there were only 300 people on a server, you'd still run into the same skirmishes when most of the players are running the SAME dungeons over and over.
---
Arms til late game,I had no trouble tanking low level dungeons and didn’t feel the need to respec until scholomance. You will wanna check out icy veins for builds. Another thing is don’t be afraid to use a two hander if the mobs you are fighting only do magic damage or if the damage taken isn’t that bad in general. Make sure to become familiar with stance dancing and add your stances to your bars so that you can change to any of the 3 when need be. spam sunder for threat and battle shout for aoe threat ( demoralizing shout if battle shout won’t buff that many party members) also if you do plan on useing a two hander make macros to switch between 1h shied and 2h. Feel free to ask me if you have further questions.
---
You don't understand the situation that its problematic.
---
But because you are competing with other horde players people won’t let go. It doesn’t matter if you get 10k honour or 500k honour, just how you rank against other members of your faction.
---
So even if the alliance give up, the horde players will find and track down anyone who ventures out into the world.
---
Thank you! I guess I will stick to ZF then. Is it worth leveling herbalism from the very beggining? Coz I have Engineering and just have dropped tailoring after dropping Tailoring.
---
what about shamans and paladins though
---
Have good ratios on my server. 
---
And lowbie goonsquads roaming. It is actually fun avoiding or engaging in pvp.
---
Opposite, most people will realize how much they need to rank up they will stop caring. Once the top PvPers separate from the pack... because right now people think they can just AFK in Hillsbrad actually can compete with top PvP players. But eventually they wount care about it as much. It’s also a feedback loop right now where I’m more or less forced to PvP because everybody else is PvPing, especially if you’re playing under represented faction. I haven’t hit dungeons in like 3 days because even if I can easily get in I’m stuck waiting 5x longer than normal. On day 1 in took 1 player an hour of corpse running to get inside Blackrock... At that point I rather just go PvP... which probably makes other faction PvP because now they can’t do the same thing either.  
---
Once the hype dies down, once people realize how much time they need to sink into it, once people realize they aren’t fully equipped to compete with those that do even if they spend 8+ hours/day, and once everyone else stops caring about it... than we can stabilize it a bit where it’s not a bloodbath 24/7. Than again this is only cuz my server is like 25-75 split, I’m sure other faction is enjoying their AFKing.
---
Ya most my guild is rank 3 and 4 and some well over 100k honor. Our standings are below 100.
---
Wow! I thought this trick was unique to Flamelash, seems like word travels fast. Works on rogues too btw!
---
Most people will realize that they will never get to the high ranks and give up.
---
True but, I mean, I don't actually care.
---
Rogue without cooldowns is basically a warrior. Except you can still stunlock people to death :D
---
Weak
---
Sometimes I grunt when I 69.
---
If you're telling the truth..
---
Then you're not only Alliance (ew) but also a Gnome (double ew).
---
But good job on devoting an entire week of your life to being world first 60. I'm sure everyone at your job thinks you're hot shit
---
Oh, wait...
---
Phase 5
---
What nameplate addon is this?
---
You do know the information provided by spy is all on the combat log right? Banning spy doesnt stop people from knowing stealth characters are nearby I hope you know.... 
---
Gathering addons on the other hand literally give you crowdsourced information to give you a direct advantage over anyone who doesnt hand write a literal map of every zone's mats.
---
Spy gives you an advantage over people to lazy to ready combat logs.
---
This is so odd because this means that we should all be able to see enemy buffs on enemy unit frames at all times. But we can't; otherwise, why does detect magic exist? Why aren't there addons that show enemy buffs on unit frames just from their character being rendered?
---
I'm not even arguing, I'm just confused with some of blizzard's seemingly conflicting logic and design mentalities.
---
God help me, I watched this episode just last night on Hulu.
---
"Hey, anyone else remember when South Park wasn't the cartoon equivalent of a grumpy old boomer and could actually simultaneously embrace and satirize a pop culture trend? You know, like that World of Warcraft episode they did in 2006?"
---
Just getting a hang of the macros as we speak. This is awesome, thanks for the input. I'll definitely end up having more questions.
---
My point exactly.
---
Is that a good/ bad thing?
---
I’d love to see the combat log telling you that a player is nearby in stealth before they have come close enough to be targetable. 
---
You’d blow my mind mate, please do.
---
You act like getting ganked in front of MC/BRD is something new.
---
When you only have a handful of endgame things to run, it happens regardless of how big the population is.
---
Tales half a second to type "/tar xyz" (only need 1 character technically but 2 or 3 to guarantee the rights target is beneficial). Difference between that and clicking spy - which won't show/update if they're in combat FWIW - is negligable. Removing the ability to target people is pointless.
---
Yayaya iamhorde
---
40v40 would be a fair fight and yes, we will meet 2-300 horde in brm/thorium point alone, let alone all the other places. And its not like ally havent got big pvp guilds, we have APES here. Also its not like we havent tried. As soon as we win a battle, literally hundreds of horde arrive within 5 minutes. Im not sure you understand just how many 2000 people is in wow. The whole game, the whole world was designed for that many people.
---
Cant stunlock when Im not in stealth and no combo points because no opener :/
---
I guess you played alliance. I played since beta and this was never a thing.
---
I considered this as well. I’m sure that will happen as people approach higher ranks (there are a lot of people who think they are getting rank 14 who are in for some disappointed).
---
But while people are still progressing through the first few ranks I’m starting to think it will get worse until the drop off occurs.
---
I think a cool thing if anything!
---
Blizzard launched classic with 1 oceanic PVP server. 
---
This is 100% their fault.
---
I haven't done that yet, I've only done a few quests where I need to kill a bug type and leave, haven't been ganked once.
---
I prefer asking if you have CD’s because I don’t want to duel you if you have no CD’s haha
---
I hope I never have to experience this cancer ever again. :)
---
You making this post is literally initiating an argument with the community.
---
I quit instead. I'm not doing it again so that blizzard can fuck up my new server again.
---
We can’t trust the sword of a thousand truths to a noob.
---
200 IQ(at least he though himself) NE hunter confirmed.
---
Im sure we'll see a steady slow decline starting this week, but the majority of the decline will happen in week 3-5 with people getting bored and the stagnation really hitting
---
The exist, soo..
---
Incendius, man. Love this server.
---
We literally agreed and you told me to keep dreaming, man I'm so confused at this point at what your angle on this is? 
---
What other purpose did that comment have if it was not intended to gaslight me into an argument? I'm genuinely curious.
---
lol I hope the Devs realize their 15 year old version of the game is Game of the Year for a reason
---
Actually, it was.   I remember it vividly from the forum posts.    Blizz even stated at one point that they had lost this piece of code and had to recreate it.
---
That makes no sense
---
Youre proof of that.
---
Lol yea OP wants to win or not duel at all, pretty obvious. 
---
The one class that is broken as fuck and can kill someone while there ccd the whole time...  yea must be so fun dueling him. 
---
It’s toxic to go and duel someone once and use up all your cds and potions (as a rogue especially) one pump them and then decline requests and act like your good?
---
Reroll on Heartseeker. It’s the same but with Horde. Transferring from Herod was my worst mistake
---
You mean. Run to one quest and die 5 times on the way to gankers
---
Of course alliance have more top raid guilds, the faction is given a broken class in paladins for pve plus they get fear ward.  Alliance rely on a crutch to get pve done
---
Is this all need on expensive BOE rule some NA bullshit?
---
On my server it's VERY rare that happens and usually for items like TB or something you arnt going to sell that everyone could use.
---
North America server?
---
Yeah, this is my point. I'm re-rolling druid on a PVE server, I live PVP. I love ganking/counter ganking. we corpse walked for almost 30 minutes last night into BRD. I get to play for an hour a night and if most of that is spend dead then my time is spent doing something else.
---
Blizzcon just happent. Jetlag and con-sickness?
---
Because people can't accept that they're the common denominator between all PvP engagements and erroneously attributing their defeat to Spy.
---
[This is a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/9OSnRlW.png) from the Spy download page on curseforge. Far less than 1% of the entire playerbase uses Spy but judging by the countless shitposts on this board you could easily be tricked into thinking that every single player is using Spy which is just not the case.
---
This is confirmation bias at work. Random level 50 shitters with their 60% mounts are getting picked off by level 60s with epic mounts and immediately concluding that they died because the Spy addon exists when the overwhelming majority of the playerbase doesn't even know the addon exists.
---
they posted a bvlue post saying scheduled maintence tommarrow to fix the honor. wouldnt matter anyhow,people will still be assholes regardless of honor bug or not
---
hahahahaha well played
---
You sound like a massive douchebag
---
Had a guildie today be super disappointed that he only got rank 2 and has been pvp-ing non stop since Thursday and the rest of the guild all came to the conclusion that it's not worth it. 
---
I'm rank 2 - I just want to get exalted with cave furies by felwood, I gank anyone in my way, don't fuck with me over there and I leave you alone, if I catch you watching me, hoping to steal a free HK and kill the mobs I started on, I'm swinging on you first, I get my WF Crits very often when I swing first.
---
so OP is a horde char,explains a lot here.
---
Screenshot police inc
---
You won't replace that until the first boss of AQ40.
---
Yea if we were talking duels then a warlock would pick their pet appropriately, but in wpvp rogues have a huge advantage.
---
&gt; And at the end of the day, the fact remains that any good player does all those things regardless of the spec they play.
---
Certain specs don't scale as well with exterior ressources. For example, ret paladins benefit from consumables more than other classes because their auto-attack playstyle puts them in less GCDs than other classes allowing them more item usage, while also being able to combine physical melee consumables with spell power consumables, which warriors can't do. There are different upper limits as to what effort you can put into each spec.
---
Well the mage I dueled was arcane. I would get Pom sheep instantly. That’s all he has to do when I’m not in stealth.  
---
But ok I’ll follow.  He is casting sheep. I sapper him. He blinks and cast sheep.
---
Or he doesn’t even blink. All he has to do is frost nova because I don’t have sprint or vanish to break it and no blind to stop his cast.
---
so much backpedaling
---
Don’t see how not making it so other people can’t play the game is missing out on a huge part of the game. Seems like one is saying assholes take priority.
---
This post made my day!
---
"Bathroom! BATHROOM!"
---
pvpers like him dont care,they live to casue misery to other people,and they dont deny it. pvpers are human scum.
---
Sorry 
---
He attempted to use words in a manor that would provoke me into a response. 
---
Not technically the clinical definition of gas-lighting, but the idea behind what he was attempting to do is what gas-lighting is about. 
---
We are arguing semantics at this point.
---
I got World of Warcraft like you said!
---
'Guaranteed Opener' - biggest crybaby class right here.
---
I was leveling my fishing in Dustwallow the other day and came across 4 of these bots running together. I killed them on sight for about 2 hours while fishing. Do your part!
---
The blue post says its a "Display error"
---
It is not. 
---
Even for those whose ranks display correctly, there are days missing and around half the kills removed from the final tally. Also completely bugged honor sheets.
---
So good. 
---
Arugal right?
---
Yeah, no. I’m an alliance warlock on Grobbulus who was 55 when honor released.
---
Tbf, classic was supposed to be a ball buster for all the hardcore players (aka masochists).
---
If you want fair, balanced, and not annoying, there's always retail
---
/s
---
yet ive had HOJ drop 4 runs in a row 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All hail the RNG gods
---
This is the kind of person I’m talking about. 
---
I am a rogue. How is it toxic to not want to fight someone when I don’t have cds? 
---
Why is declining a duel such a big deal? I don’t want to nonstop duel people because I’m afraid I’ll get flaimed if I take a small break.
---
I dont understand the hate for levelling. I'm doing just fine, sure I have the occasional run in with the horde, but it hasn't been too bad really.  
---
Lighted I play on Deviate Delight which everyone on there is convinced it's a dead server (when in fact it's not).
---
There was faction based xfers in TBC for Oceanic realms. One of the realms had 13:1 horde alliance ratio and all alliance could xfer there from ANY other OCE server. I remember this well because I took the xfer myself, it also let me go from my PVE server to a PVP one.
---
Lv 60 Warrior on Alliance Grobbulus, having a grand time! Searing gorge can get chaotic, but I'm usually rolling with guildies. If I'm solo, I can wait a couple minutes for reinforcements to arrive if I'm way too outnumbered.
---
There was in TBC for OCE realms.
---
I play on Hydraxian Waterlords, EU RP-PvE server. There were some big raids the first few days, consistent Hillsbrad PvP over the weekend, but the last two days have been completely dead. It got to the point where there's a few people from both sides, having 1v1 duels to the death while others watch. AKA - kill trading.
---
It's lame a fuck. I just want rank 2 for my trinket and then I'll enter the grind properly when BGs are here. Hopefully sooner rather than later.
---
blizzard wont drive people away,the asshole gankers will. you said it best,they wont go to retail,they will just unsub

Cool story bro
---
We need a Classic version of this episode now!
---
Sounds like a lot of people have a misunderstanding of how any form of open world PvP works.
---
Is this English?
---
If I go from rank 2 to 3 I’m putting in a ticket for reimbursement for my epic mount...
---
I’m not sure you read my post....
---
How am I broken with no stealth, no vanish, no blind, no sprint, and no trinket?
---
Heart seeker if u want to play horde we are outnumbered by quite a bit
---
"Wow is too easy I miss old wow"
---
"Old wow is too hard wahhhh"
---
I grinded half a level today on the southern island in STV just to avoid PvP...current climate blows...
---
The honor tab has always been an estimate and I believe it doesn't account for diminishing returns.
---
This is especially useful to me coming from Deviate Delight, an RP-PVP server. I had a small hope they an RP server would be more engaged. Thanks
---
What was their response in supporting a totalitarian country who shoots on civilians and sells their organs?
---
Yeah fuck you all who still play this game
---
Funny, just watched a MadSeason vid with same name today.
---
Private Dancer? Like Dancer for money?
---
Was waiting for this response lol. If you're playing something else and think mages are OP, then perhaps you're playing wrong too then.
---
There is one flaw in your logic. 
---
ALL servers are horde imbalanced.  Them leaving your server isn't going to improve their position.  So why would they?
---
Hahahaha
---
But what about all the players who incessantly cry that it's "too hard"? Lol.
---
https://i.imgur.com/tRMerEA.png
---
It's not a quest, you just need the Security Access Card and then go up to the D machine and you can learn it.
---
You would know, being a member of Destiny and all.
---
Desperate is you losers actually creating a post on the forums to try and get credit for the kill. That was genuinely pathetic.
---
Lol. You people shouldn't be on a classic pvp server.  Your head would explode from the old days of pvp in EQ, daoc, shadowbane, etc.
---
   This is pvp light with no consequence in death short of your time.
---
Nobody cares about overall damage and you shouldn’t either. Especially caster v. Melee overall dmg.  Yes, casters get AoE pulls. But casters have downtime between pulls to drink, have to buff, and will be 1-2 seconds through a cast when a mob dies quite frequently (which adds up when you’re talking about 100+ trash mobs). Rogues and warrs literally have no downtime and have quite a few very helpful raid buffs that casters don’t get (Windfury, truestrike Aura, feral Druid buff, armor debuffs on boss) while mages/locks get the lock buff and maybe the Spriest/frost mage debuff. 
---
Boss fights are also meh. Yeah, Shazz and baron aren’t ideal for melee but Mages have to decurse on two bosses and sheep for another. Locks obviously are frequently on banish duty. 
---
I mean, you’ll notice if someone is REALLY lacking, but for the most part there’s a reason dps is a little more diverse between melee and casters
---
and still be way behind the proper classes
---
I would definitely grind during downtime’s in between groups. The only thing worse then not doing anything and waiting on a group is maybe joining a scuffed group... 
---
look at the comp,  player levels, and what type of run there doing all before you leave your grind spot.. 
---
This is all slightly irrelevant since, like you said, there’s just way to much wpvp to even play the game normally anymore. 
---
Current state of the game is awful and we’re stuck hiding in dungeons or making alts. Gl on your journeys tho!
---
But muh faction balances~ D: /s
---
Alliance alts with horde farming the mats.
---
When bgs come out the best bg groups will set honor caps, those that dont obey will get blacklisted and outfarmed anyway.
---
On PvE servers you actually get to play. Getting ganked repeatedly in unfair fights and corpse running isn't gameplay, and neither is circling zones on mounts with a large group obliterating anyone you come across. 
---
PvP servers clutter the game with a bunch of random encounters that suck 95% of the time for the promise of that 5% chance at a decent fight which is still inferior to a lot of other games that are entirely focused on PvP. The games focus on wpvp didn't even survive Vanilla and is only really returning as a significant part of the game for one phase of classic for this reason.
---
More people are playing now than they did in Vanilla. Blizz *should* have released more servers but... oh well.
---
You know, I was struck by lightning seven times
---
Get rekt dumb magehhahahahahahahah
---
All jokes aside that was a nice nova out of frost bolt.
---
You don't need to do that. I'm on a "High" population PvE server and even during primetime it's not too crowded in questing zones.
---
yikes
---
More players who are better... woe is me
---
Example
---
Level 18 mage Hits Level 20 Elite. Bring him To 98%
---
Level 60 Kills it. Get 9 exp for the mage.
---
After asmongold exploitet it with His Rogue with a 25 man RAID behind him.
---
And yes it does Not Work in instances To. (Group Leasing bombing and reinvite)
---
Not sure what I'm supposed to see here
---
The people defending it are scrubs that don't understand the value of situational awareness, since they lack it, they think addons that trivialize it are good.
---
Very exciting fight, I bet you felt awesome after :P
---
go to pve server then baby
---
made you post
---
Got 3/4 yesterday, wasnt upset at all :)
---
You are not understanding the situation that is problematic.
---
must be nice to be able to run around.
---
If it's not plate then it's not warrior gear
---
It is a mmorpg... 
---
People like you take the mmo part out.
---
Just don't do UBRS for experience. It's terrible.
---
Pretty sure PvE servers (being far less numerous) are already full to bursting as is - opening them up to character transfers right now will fucking kill them.  
---
Wish people would stop whining about this - you made a char on a pvp server, I'm assuming, for a reason??  You knew you'd face this?
---
Nice job! 
---
Honestly how much of a time advantage do Hunters have in leveling to 60? All of the speed runs are Hunter only it seems.
---
I know Warlock and Druid are not too far behind but it seems crazy how fast Hunters can level.
---
I'm a 55 Druid following Sage Guidelime and it's been great so far, but I have 8 days played so far. Although I have been taking my time, playing the AH, AFKing a lot, etc. I think I could do 60 in around 6-7 days played on druid if I didn't waste time and focused only on leveling. 
---
Do you have any advice for what's the fastest guide Alliance side? I want to level a warlock alt to 60 soon.
---
I've tried quite a few guides just looking at pathing, and Guidelime Sage, Zygor, and Classicwow.live all seem really solid. They also all pretty much use the same pathing with a few tweaks and exceptions it seems.
---
\-  im in danger \`chuckles\`
---
Where are you pulling these numbers from?
---
It doesnt even suck, it's the same as the vendor water
---
If you find a cheaper price on a stocked item, we’ll beat it by 10%
---
Really? Stun. Sacrifice. Vanish. Wait for shield to go down. Stun Lock and Kill Lock.
---
I usually consider Locks free kills at the moment.
---
I play horde so I guess going by that I'd expect them not to do that but I think the takeaway here isn't about this faction or that faction, is that toxic and shitty people are incentivised to play like this. I resent your implication that because someone plays horde, must make them also be a shitty person. Shame on you for even thinking that. 
---
You think that is the solution here? Castigate people like me who are speaking out against the bad actors?
---
Just FYI, I've had the same shit happen to me and that's part of the reason why I resent people who let the cycle continue. Land in winterspring get steamrolled by a raid of allies then corpse camped for 15 minutes while all I'm trying to do is help a friend with ony attunement? Must be because they play alliance, right? Come on dude. Get over yourself.
---
Considering its bugged for a lot of people, we are actively going to have to target questers as we've lost week 1 progress.
---
Either let them convert classes or don't let them transfer at all. Both solutions suck for different reasons.
---
I've been having trouble with the fight after the reset today, and I just put my t1 bracers on my bags to break the bonus and It went back to normal so idk
---
Thank you for your suggestion.
---
you do realize that the complaint people have is mostly that you literally cannot get away from wpvp no matter where you go, and that is largely because there are more people on the same size world than there were before.
---
if you make a square on the ground with chalk that is 40x40 feet, and tell 10 people to stay in that square, they will likely have a fair amount of personal space. take that same square and put 50 people in it (5x the amount, the same multiplier as 3k to 15k) these people will all be standing right next to each other. that is why doing anything in the open world other than pvp is pretty much impossible right now, because we are all shoulder to shoulder in the world that was initially designed for a smaller population.
---
Holy shit my eyes rolled so hard I almost went blind. You're telling me that if there were absolutely no changes, there would be a lot less crying from Alliance now?
---
its great 😁👍
---
What he was doing was shitty, but he would RP walk after doing it and say "I must protect this sacred land" the way he was doing it was funny. but what he was doing was super shitty.
---
You might not feel that way, but then again you don't use it so you can't even communicate with someone using it.
---
Why don't you try walking into an area sometime and having horde pop up on your screen, only to target them and see they're targeting you already. Hell, plenty of times I hear spy pop off and then one second after the ding I have a priest's mind vision on me.
---
You couldn't even perceive these things because you don't have the addon so sorry but like it or not you're ignorant to that fact.
---
You're going to get stomped in BGs. Many casual alliance will quit and it's just going to be hardcore ranker premades enjoying instant q pops
---
Tldr
---
Does killing your own faction in the guribashi arena give honor?
---
Thanks. That looks really clean.
---
Right? Imagine the dumpster your life must be in for this to be something you do constantly.
---
Fairbanks
---
My server (smolderweb) has fewer and fewer active groups in /lfg over the past few weeks. Like maybe 15 people in ZF which is where I'd want to be leveling, were there anymore. Its pretty rough. I end up just going out to solo farm ogres in tanaris, which is /insanely/ boring.
---
I don't expect to get full tier 1 in 2 or 3 weeks, but just getting one or two pieces would be nice. And to be honest I've never seen a mage in full tier 1. Just mages with a couple pieces.
---
literally the only back pedaling was when they were stunned and when they went to go eat
---
people who point out backpedaling whenever they see it are the biggest noobs in wow. i've seen people even call out tanks for back pedaling when they were trying to get positioned.
---
fyi : back pedaling is fine as long as it doesnt cost you anything. pointing it out means you don't know anything about the game. that concludes my ted talk.
---
Play week 2 first before judging.
---
Maybe about 50 tryhard players are left, everyone else is gonna return to their normal scheduled lives
---
DUDE. i Thought the SAME thing
---
The bigger issue in my experience is that Alliance are less interested in PvP.
---
I am in a fairly even server, but the Alliance are all hanging out in IF or raidlogging while the Horde constantly go out in the world to fight.
---
i see horde pvp groups everywhere i go while alliance sit inside ironforge and spam world with weird shit
---
Honestly, 2fort/turbine i think it was, those two maps were my fucking jam for some good stupid fun.
---
Make some friends and dont look back
---
You quite literally did in your original reply to me:
---
&gt;I'm with the other guy. i was on a horde heavy server in vanilla and loved the pvp. this is completely different than anything I saw in vanilla. and the "git gud or transfer" doesn't work when blizz just locked down faction specific transfers so the smaller faction is locked down.
---
When you clarified, though, that you were talking strictly about population, I agreed, but then expanded on my point that other people are conflating your point with issues dealing with PvP. 
---
I don't understand why you're attacking me here because I completely agreed with you on your position about population.
---
SpY bAd UpBoAtS tO tEh LfT pLs
---
Some people want to only duel people they can win.  Some people just like to duel as much as possible to practice.  You cant control what type of person challenges you.  But you can decide what type of person youre going to be.  
---
Sure, you can only accept duels when you have everything up and you have a maximum chance of winning.  But if youre on a pvp server, inevitably youre going to get into unfair situations against the opposite factions where youre outnumbered or caught out of stealth or dont have cooldowns or are camped.  
---
Why not use that downtime to practice some situations where youre at a disavantage and just have some friendly duels where you arent worried about winning?  Its up to you.
---
I play on faerlina ally. Can't be much worse than the asmonspergs.
---
Farming instances works too.
---
Scholo and Strat don't have many campers/
---
DPS warrior &gt; "Tank" DM:E with a healer + 1 dps to do jump runs and mine thorium.
---
more like downvotes by all the horde who love it.
---
Ooooh, I remember that guy from Elysium/Lightbringer while ranking: he was among the few guys who was able to cap my point at AB while ranking =)
---
What does the Helm do?
---
what addon is that dope frame style?
---
Lol gl as a war. You will still get shit on endlessly unless you have a group
---
This. IMO a lot of people want to do the run BUT don’t wanna go through the hassle of starting a group. I used to be like this too. Now if I spend more than 5mims lfg and can’t find any I just start my own. Usually within a minute at least 1 other dps answers. Finding a spare healer and tank... well that’s another post. Lol. Good luck man!
---
He meant **he** knows almost nothing about Shadowbringers
---
I mean, the severs are inherently way different because of classic's far higher population.
---
You're thinking of Shadowlands there, mate.
---
Funny think is I have Blackcrow cuz I didnt get +1 hit bow yet, turns out Blackcrow is hunter pre raid bis xD
---
...Cries with my two level 40 Alliance characters on Skeram....
---
its deff not a level.
---
either reroll as horde,or move on from wow,those are pretty much your only options. soon enough most alliance on classic are going to switch to horde,or quit. and the population will pretty much be 1 faction.
---
classic will become a self fulling prophecy, there is no stopping it.
---
Completely shocked
---
The pre-45 zones are, if anything, a bit safer than they were in Phase 1.
---
More like salt mine simulator. 
---
I'm definitely getting a kick out of seeing so many people who vastly underestimated the classic pvp experience.
---
Although the same happened with warmode in BFA, so not quite sure what people expected!
---
The game is 15 years old. Jesus Christ  why are so many people still complaining. The people who did their homework and spent the time are winning. Those who didn’t are losing. Just like with everything nowadays. There’s no surprises here — it just takes one small ounce of critical thinking. Those who wanted the classic experience are delusional. They wanted a time machine, not the remastering of an online video game. Go play PvE.

Sorry to hear your experience got ruined dude. I’m sticking it out on my server but I absolutely feel your pain man.
---
Such is the price of curiosity
---
Yikes
---
I hope **this** is sarcasm, mate.
---
There was a guy on youtube who's trying to get to level 60 just killing boars in classic, so it might be a reality. Don't know if he's done or not though
---
heartseeker is pretty much the only alliance dominate server. everywhere else is horde and since there is currently no way there fore alliance until paid transfers are active, pretty much reroll on there,or quit. because horde dominate everywhere else
---
It was in vanilla, i see no issue with it.
---
Dah ebil horde with their ebil add ons
---
Even blizzard is aware. It’s why they transitioned to the arena system in BC.
---
i mean you get all the healing spells.. your roll in dungeons will be heals. even though you are spec'd for shadow. shadow heals all dungeons quite nicely
---
I think they actually mean good, warlocks are gods in pvp
---
I don't want it to be as efficient. I want it to be harder to utilize so less people do it so people can hide behind trees etc.
---
Use your brain dude.
---
how? im level 54 and im at 7 days played, damn
---
Horde zeppelins and boats are in horde owned zones, so no pvp flag numbnuts
---
But isn't everyone entitled to the rank 14 gear /s
---
I assume you were very young when you started playing wow then.

 DAoC:. Dark Age Of Camelot.
---
  Both were massively popular pvp MMOs of their time.  I should also add the pvp of Star Wars Galaxies to this list 
---
   Did you find starting on a pvp server as non consequential and attractive because of it's red letters?  PvP was absolutely the same if not worse upon honor rank release in vanilla.  I was there, I remember.  The only thing different is the pace at which these trie-hard grinders have accumulated top tier endgame gear.
---
Is it confirmed that there will be paid transfers at some point? I would transfer now for sure if I knew I could change to any server I want in the near future
---
a load of shit as per usual
---
Your sarcasm hit the wall behind your head and smashed into your monitor. GG's
---
I made like 25K on Day1 with Solo Hillsbrad, but I couldn't bother to do more since you get 0 heal and die quite often.
---
i'm considering moving. Is it nice? I'm from stalagg horde. Is it a good server in general purpose ? i want to raid, dung and pvp moslty.
---
Nice, one whole paragraph and you didn't even address my question.
---
Bumps for justice
---
If you think it’s a shit ass broken add on, why are you telling many more people that don’t know yet another way to exploit it and make things worse?
---
Blizzard doesnt need content developers for 15 year old game.  Drops hundreds of customer support staff.  Classic wow releases with bugs and exploits and no GM's available.  Server populations run amok.  This is not the blizzard we knew, this is everyones favorite Activision
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Does she put out?
---
Im ready to see the reaction to AQ opening and people not getting a mount/title.
---
STAN!!
---
Lol fuckin retail kids who know nothing about classic rogues. Youre not going to do A THING as a rogue with no cooldowns vs a mage. Youre basically a level 60 mob.
---
Well, if someone didnt master the keyboard and mouse - its his own problem. As a mechwarrior and doom (and hexen and heretic) veteran i laugh at ppl who cant navigate without mouse (esp on those who bind skills to keys used for strafing).
---
Live!
---
They didnt say it wouldnt happen. They said it was a possibility and seemed likely.
---
Thats basically how most fights as Alliance are right now.
---
Well mages don't have to give away water. It takes time and disrupts whatever we're doing. Try asking nicely or buy from a vendor.
---
do you have a problem with people playing the game in a manner by which they enjoy?
---
I play from 8am til 4pm (at work) the game is MUCH more enjoyable til around noon-1pm when more people log in. I wish they didn’t jam so many fucking people into these servers.
---
30 second stun every 30 min
---
Yep
---
&gt;A lot? Is it really a lot or just every once in a while? 
---
Multiple times per day.  I'm assuming you're horde since you are skeptical about something so commonplace.
---
&gt;Maybe you should reroll if you’re only 42 in 3 months and can’t handle corpse running every now and then
---
Where did I say I couldn't handle it? All I said is that your bullshit statement is wrong. Also forgive me I didn't start 3 months ago I guess that means I dont deserve to play. Maybe you shouldn't comment on things you don't understand or witness. This is a legitimate criticism of the game and you not experiencing it because you rolled the PVE faction doesn't make the problem nonexistent.

To be fair, this is the vanilla private server experience.

&gt;Though I've never even heard of this site before so I'm not sure how much this award really counts for.

They go back quite a few years with roots to PC magazines that don't exist anymore.

The curiousity of spam is such.
---
Clearly outplayed. Gotta get good
---
As an alliance who gets molested constantly by ?? Horde on my alt I appreciate you
---
Fantastic news!
---
Always gotta drop that sentry totem on a warlock corpse.
---
The game isn't balanced for 1v1 stuff. Duels are always going to be frustrating. I wouldn't put too much thought into how they go, particularly when you roll a class like rogue. Your entire gimmick is to avoid an honorable fight aka a duel.
---
Upvote because of  Darth Sidious Quote.
---
The best leveling guide is probably Zygor Premium Guide. Its actually insane what that tool does so check that out its worth the money, especially if you only have 1 monitor.
---
Skeram is awful, you can’t go anywhere that is a 50+ zone without a 10 man raid at minimum or you’re getting ganked by 10-20 horde.
---
Agreed - depending on how deep you want to go, EVE can be _extremely_ safe, at least in some areas of gameplay (cough Nullsec blocs cough).  Territory control is huge in that - something that is nearly impossible in WoW by comparison.  Imagine being able to take a supercap fleet and just fling it into a null corp's HQ system (city comparison) with less than an hour's setup, or just jump a blob wherever and kill.  
---
Hmm, I think I derailed myself.  At least in EVE, you have to prep and work for your kills, in one way or another.
---
They didn't underestimate anything other than how toxic the Private Server ganking community has become over the years. Literally NO PART of Vanilla was like this.
---
Sure people do, but when all you do is farm for the purpose of farming I can not see no enjoyment in that. And that’s what most hardcore players do.
---
Arena is super fun... ^^when ^^classes ^^are ^^somewhat ^^balanced
---
Aye I had a blast doing it in the past and my "dream" was doing the priest version as well. I didn't get to raid on my priest back then, and never got around to doing it in expansions. I made the decision to play classic mostly because of this quest, and let me tell you, it's fucking underwhelming compared to the hunter version.
---
“How do you kill that which has no life”
---
Same. I’m sad as all hell that my sub just renewed on the 17th.
---
far too many complaints since phase 2 launched for them not to have taken notice, Thursday will be the start of the second week,if nothing is done the subs will start to tank and tank hard. so if blizzard wants to save their money you can almost bank on paid char transfers,or even BGs within the next 2 weeks.
---
because any later and pvp servers will more then likely be dead,and classic will lose at least half its player base before the 3rd phase.
---
This is devious lol
---
Im hoping I am not the first to say this; although its a crappy thing to do, a lot of the time “pvpers” in OW do this is to attract attention. You make the weak suffer, it will always attract bigger dish and attention.
---
I apologize if this is not the mechanic of the area (as in OWPvPvE, I don’t really play WoW, so please correct me if this is not a possibility). During my time on other OWPvP orientated games, this was the common trend that people would do to stir up OW action.
---
The 5 second rule is after you complete a spellcast.
---
You can get to 90% of a spellcast, cancel it and mana will still regen as long as the spell doesn't finish.
---
My reasons are literally explained in the OP. I played a PVP server in actual WOW all those years ago, and I didn't forsee how much the mentality of players and the massively increased server populations would change things. Or realise quite how dominant the horde would be when Phase 2 kicked off.
---
I doubt I'm alone in that, and whatever reason a player had for rolling on a PVP server I doubt anyone but the hardcore private server players knew they were going to face this.
---
There's a lot of players who want to check out of PVP entirely at this point, and if they're expected to start over on PVE servers a good portion of them will just unsubscribe instead. It doesn't really matter to people on a PVP server if people leave because they quit WoW or transfer server, so why not let people switch? Surely it's better for Classic in the long-term to retain more players, particularly from the outnumbered faction?
---
Sure, Blizzard might have to open new PVE servers to make it work if the existing ones are already full. I doubt that'd be a massive technical hurdle for them.
---
Bend over and I'll show you
---
My best time in a PUG is about 45~ minutes, on the other hand I've been stuck there for 2-3 hours on rougher runs.
---
I got like 400 honor at lvl 53 and have rank to but tabard
---
Now let’s hope they fix feign death&gt;trap
---
Pull Klinfran as close to BRM ramp as possible and bait horde to chase you there. Shame you get no honor this way, but it should still be hilarious af.
---
&gt; Combat log
---
Uninstall spy and use the combat log then. Simple as that. But we both know you don't have a reply to that. Don't we?
---
Caves. I can cave crawl on the most populated server and not encounter 1 single person for hours.
---
Why there?
---
I want to download yours, solely based off your answer here. Good dude
---
probably bugged out on him as it's still not 100% reliable, he feigns and nothing comes of it
---
I agree 99%.  Only issue is you should have said "bluer pastures" at the end.
---
Nope Horde all the way. Switched to Ally for Classic specifically because of that.
---
Find a friend that has cooking. Give them materials and a tip, and Bam - both of you are better off. There's little need for you to personally level cooking
---
Its just a totally different game with spy. Its basically PVE server lite.
---
Aw, babby's first pvp experience. All aboard the QQ train!
---
Uh, not for stealth classes. So many rogues and Druid’s hide below decks and gank any low level horde as soon as the zeppelin is cleared of the tower.
---
I'm on one of the worst servers for EU alliance according to the wowhead data and I'm having a blast. I purposely rolled rogue because I love the class and knew that wpvp would be like this, now I get to pick my fights and skulk around orgimmar trying to nuke someone before 25 horde bend me over and stick it in dry.
---
I think it’s worth 500g. Save it.
---
There are better ways of gatekeeping gear than giving it out to the biggest NEET out there.

Ah yes. Stan, kyle, cartman, and kenny

---
PUT IT DEFAULT IN THE CLIENT. 
---
Don't ban it. Put it in game. Then no one has an unfair advantage because they know about an addon. 
---
But you like your advantage don't you? That's the whole point with you guys, isn't it? Putting it in the game as default would just level the playing field again... and we cant have that, can we?
---
What kind of math are you using? Use the one that doesn't add up
---
They didn’t bother to add in the horde faction to the game in this version.
---
We have clothies here complaining about repair costs
---
But we don't have [\[The Sword of a Thousand Truths\]](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19019/thunderfury-blessed-blade-of-the-windseeker) *Whimsical chime music plays*
---
Let's say you have 2 hours to play. How much can you do on a main that is constantly corpse camped by roaming gank squads vs a low level alt ?
---
It's nowhere near as bad at lower levels, you can actually play the game unlike at max level. With limited time, it definitely is a solution to play a low level alt currently. 
---
By the time you get to lvl 45-48, battleground will most likely be release so it won't be as bad as right now.
---
Every time I fly to stv from 3 to 10 alliance emerge from the bottom of the zep to kill everyone on board. Take it like a man.
---
That's pretty impressive.
---
Paying somebody for a guide tho = no ty.
---
Rip to a legend who left an impact to many more lives than he could imagine
---
Haha. You'd see less of these threads and less complainers if people were allowed to move their characters off the PVP servers, so you'd get exactly what you apparently want. And I wouldn't have to quit playing, so it'd be a win-win for everyone. Hence me making the suggestion.
---
Doubt actually you want what you say you want, though, as you seem mostly interested in minimising the enjoyment other people might have from the game. God forbid other people might have fun, eh?
---
Yeah but it was only one ganker

---
I'm gonna just say outright that I used to play WoW as kid. 
---
Never played WoW classic because I'm not a fool who will pay money for the same thing twice....
---
World PVP in WoW was always camping lowbies for honour score.
---
Like what did you guys actually smoke that you;
---
1. Paid money for WoW classic 
---
2. Clearly never played classic WoW. 
---
3. You have seriously false expectations for a remade game that you had no business buying in the first place.
---
Like seriously.... I'm getting more enjoyment reading classic WoW posts than I did playing actual classic as a kid.
---
You guys paid for this. You paid to experience the most broken pvp system ever made and then you guys complain like your grizzled ever quest vets or something? So sad. 
---
You deserve every second of getting camped. It's the classic experience you begged for.
---
You hit the nail on the head right here. Spy is PVE server lite.
---
Beautiful.  Kinda reminds me of my experience duoing with my buddy, we'd go back and forth on the RNG.
---
"Alright, got all the livers yet?"  
---
"No, I'm at 3/8."
---
"Oh, okay.  Here, I have two extras."

---
Certainly not tradition
---
&gt;Or if it still will be I hope blizzard will do some balancing which is unlikely because “nO cHaNgEs”.
---
Bullshit. If we got an unchanged version of the game then we wouldn't be dealing with 10-40x the number of enemy PvPers out in the world. This is a massive, game-altering change. 
---
Your entire premise is incorrect because you do not understand the issue. The prime problem is player quantity and the second problem is balance. Either problem could be dealt with without the other but, when combined, it is unsustainable. 
---
This is a massive change and not at all what I wanted. It's why I was so adamantly opposed to layering after it was announced in May.
---
I will not.
---
No most of the people complaining are complaining because this is nothing like vanilla.  Vanilla had like a few thousand people per server, not 20k.
---
I was about 18 at the time. I wouldn't say it's absolutely the same. The mindset of players is different. How could it not be? I was also 'there', and it's not what I remember. Different experiences I guess.
---
So true hahah. Suck a great vid. Laughed my ass off. #Relatable.
---
I'm genuinely upset about this. It gave me a pit in my stomach.  This is sad for the entire world. I truly believe pantheon was the last shot at the oldschool MMO style reaching future generations of game developers moving forward.  Even if it comes out now I'm sure it won't be how it was originally envisioned, and how could it be?
---
how about Blood Guard Tampon?
---
It's not fun for horde either, the inability to find a decent fight before 50 horde come rolling over makes pvp about as fun as aoe farming ZF.
---
or just make a new char called Punishment.
---
i think you don't understand the honour system very well. it's EASIER for casual horde to rank and stay ranked on skeram because the pool of players is so large. just look at the server discord. the breakpoint for horde to get rank 4 was 35k honour, for alliance it was over 90k. for some reason you're assuming the entire pool of 2500-4000 horde in the pvp pool will be hardcore ranking no-life honour grinding 24/7 to see if they can hit the mythical rank 15. that's not happening at all, at least not without BG's, but the population of the individual server doesn't matter then.
---
you're also over-exaggerating the quality of the alliance on the server. i just spent hours camping brm and ony. there are plenty of alliance guilds who have no idea what they're doing. the alliance seem "better" because they're forced to organize and strategize. the horde know they can win any fight through attrition  so they just show up and faceroll. 
---
it will be easy as fuck for horde on the server to play casually and hit/maintain rank 10. it will be considerably harder for alliance to do the same thing.
---
If I read this right they didn't reviewed your case further but now you know the reason of the ban. At some point in your adventure your level/gear/gold productivity skyrocketed by playing regurlarly with specific people. 
---
Maybe one of those Aoe farm groups or gbid raids ?
---
a Fiery Avenger and Green Platemail, that a ranger could use, if I remember right
---
Our servers top player go 156k solo.
---
The first week of honor ranks came out today, I imagine a lot of people are checking their ranks.
---
What a good pet name
---
Alliance on Grobbulus are *extremely* active in PVP.
---
Damn man, that sucks to hear!
---
Honestly with how busy my work keeps me I don't have much time to play, so it would be a waste for me to hoard gold and loot others could put to good use.
---
I'm jet
---
65 kills and like 30 mins in hillsbrad one night and I ended up with corporal 😐
---
people who don't understand the pvp system spout things like this then get salty when they don't get their rank, it's not based off honor entirely. If there are people on your server pushing it into the 200k+ region you might only hit rank 3.
---
Yeah this actually doesnt count for the ony bag or BoP patterns. My guild had to learn this the hard way with an elemental sharpening stone pattern in MC
---
Honestly, it's worth it.  We can't break fear as rogue but we can reset the fight at least if we need to.  I just like orcs
---
grats dude when are you going pro?
---
People laugh at the notion of a balanced PVP server, but Grobbulus is the unicorn. It is **RP**-PVP to be totally accurate, though.

---
for a rogue any class is free kill, if you ever lose 1v1 battle you are clearly doing something wrong. Good rogues don't even need gear to kill, with proper gear rogues don't even need their cd to kill people. 
---
Bragging about being able to kill cloth wearer as a rogue is silly. 
---
with more gear available in the future, rogues gonna get even stronger while spellcasters like locks, mages or priest gonna get weaker, because they scale terribly with gear.

How do I rank up in the honor system? The honor tab shows I have over 600 lifetime kills yet I'm still rank 0. Is it bugged? Or is 600 kills too few to rank up?
---
Look at how mad you are. You should probably step away from the computer for a bit 🤣🤣
---
Raid reset night.
---
How fast can you get the full blue set with casual play? Three months? And how much do you have to play to not derank?
---
Be high enough level so your quests are mostly green for the zone. This will mean you are generally equal or higher level than the majority of people in the area. This makes you less of an easy target.
---
QFT, happened to me in about the same spot the other night
---
Our guild experienced a similar issue where were unable to loot the hunter leaf from majordomo chest. Similar response from GM, they are not gonna do anything about it. Top notch support!
---
Green items don't count, only epics I think.
---
Chasing arena balance is what fucking killed class identity. Arenas were one of the worst additions to the game.
---
&gt;but theres more horde on pvp realms

---
Not saying your comment is not true overall, just wanted to share.
---
Would it be “PvP Lite”, since it’s making it a lite version of pvp? PvE life would imply nerfed mobs or some mess.
---
Nah, I'm cool knowing that you'll get virtually no content in phase 5 because you'l never open AQ.
---
They abused a bugged mob that didn't stop giving exp once you out leveled it. Exploitation, ban incoming.
---
Probably one of the best items in game
---
Ya but you don’t wear it permanently. You swap mid fight via a macro when you need to activate it and swap it back if I am right.
---
Anyone know when it updates and ranks are given, for eu? The realm restarts are done now and i assumed it would be done during the restart. Feel like i even read that somewhere but probably just a dream of mine.
---
It's not tradeable anyway, whether equipped or not.
---
Some people's enjoyment comes from being competitive. Some people are only having fun when they have better gear than you, more gold than you, etc and it becomes a marathon to stay at the top of that mountain of having better etc. You don't ha e to agree or understand why people do this, but you have to accept it.
---
One of my friends ticked off one of the GMs by complaining about druids back in tbc. He got a ban which was lifted in a couple of hours and got an apology + €15 in his blizzard account as compensation lol. Your post made me think of this for some reason
---
Were you able to fly out when done or had Alliance griefed and locked down the FP?
---
Nah he's wrong. Green items can't be traded.
---
This guy won't let us finnish quests.
---
Not sufficient boars.
---
He's summoning scorpions again!
---
Yeah the rogue quests were sweet then they just stop...so much lost potential.
---
I like Joanas.  It's a little outdated, but the trick is to grind out sweet spots when you hit them in anticipation of falling short at times, otherwise you might run out of quests in a few spots.  Some of the quests in the guide I have seen don't exist (dustwallow marsh)
---
"We can't entrust The Sword of One Thousand Truths to a noob!"
---
It didn't "save your life" if  you attacked first dude...
---
It’s not automation. That’d imply it was playing the game for you, it’s not.
---
It's a strange system because when you hear the words PvP in a 2 faction game you figure you will be fighting the opposing faction when in fact the system is designed to have you fight your own faction and trying to out honour them. Thankfully players collude and set caps.
---
I suppose it is unfortunate that skill is not rewarded but rather no lifing a computer game. Given the average age of a gamer is well into adulthood and working life, having so many people excited for the no lifing journey ahead is both bemusing and alarming.
---
Seconding this. Shoulders and maybe helm are the parts that stand out the most lol.

You cant swap gears midfight, only weapon.

k
---
But they had Spy! How did horde players sneak up on them like that? Has Reddit lied to me?! /s
---
1. No.
---
2. I'd have to look at the source again, but I believe it does targets, mouseovers, and combat log stuff.  If you fly over while I have spy, and I mouse over you, it shares that I've seen you with everyone else running it, and I believe with my coordinates.
---
That hunter isn't one of them though
---
The game actually felt like this for a couple days. Impossible to quest due to the roaming Horde squads so I had to get creative finding questing spots. Silithus ended up being a safe zone, surprisingly. Felwood was mostly horde dominated, impossible to level up there.
---
Clearcasting no, shatter yes.
---
Nova ur target and then cast flamestrike/frostbolt into coc and both get the shatter crit chance
---
Alliance seem to really be holding their own on herod. I can't do shit in the open world without getting rolled by an alliance deathball. Seems like we'll be fine for now
---
Level?! I can't even pick up the FP to Searing Gorge =P
---
Title says it's an RP server. So yea, because not everyone plays an RPG to be perfectly efficient at every moment.
---
Why would I be mad? It's the most fun I've had in WoW in a long time. If you wanted to roll on a PvP server, get angry that Blizz rolled out phases as they said they would legitimately months ago, and proceed to get camped instead of taking an alternative route to leveling via dungeons, that's your problem.
---
has there been any word on why i dont have my rank yet? i have 4k honor and nothing has updated
---
I'd rather them not break a bunch of skills just because people don't like them.  Then we'd have to go down the slippery slope of "fix my skill too, just tweak this a bit!"
---
What add on for the enemy bars over the characters??
---
any paladin that bubbles immediately is a noob. If you deal damage equal to 40-50% of his health with first stunlock, paladin is dead anyways. He might just bubble+hs or just stand and die.
---
WAGIE RAGIE, BACK IN CAGIE

How does 10=60 when they're essentially halving your level and minusing 10?
---
No they'll just all jump over to heartseeker which is the only PVP server with an alliance supermajority , the server all the alliance ran to to avoid wpvp before p2 lol
---
It's blacklisted
---
Good
---
If you tell everyone, they'll all do it too, and you'll be back to long queue times.
---
Til the light dies in your eyes...
---
He could have probably used autoshot with anything instant and got the kill.
---
Lmao i like how you assumed i am subbed. It's pretty clear you are mad from the tone of your reply to a simple question you couldnt answer.
---
Sure they are. Every comment I've seen here seems to be from people who think they can handle rolling a character on a pvp server, then shocked pikachu face when they realize it ain't fuckin easy, lol.
---
Typical.
---
You should have /spit
---
Maggotmon digivolve to......Filthmon!
---
Being steamrolled by a group of level 60's while leveling isn't hard. It's just bad gameplay. Nobody is complaining that world pvp should be easier. They're complaining that it's not GOOD.
---
That's the name of my guild right now.
---
There’s just no point as an alliance to go to certain places, and that’s not fun.  You aren’t seeing the 20 other times the people had to fight before you showed up  Imagine replacing “sometimes we get stomped” with “I can’t land at a flight master, I can’t get inside many instances, I can’t quest, I can’t farm, I can’t initiate pvp without 5-10 more people showing up within 15 seconds, etc.  (And if you bring 15, they bring 40) I knew it would be like this so I personally I am not too affected by this but I can tell a lot of people are just giving up.
---
Maybe I’ll record a video of how bad it is on my rogue stealthed just to get around the death squads “having fun” each getting one hit on an alliance for 3 honor.  
---
I was really looking forward to world pvp but as of right now it is just impossible to do even a 1v2 without a dogpile of people coming 5 seconds later.
---
Should be spacing bar, not padding.
---
This looks like the best bet so far Ill check it out
---
I got to rank 13 back in the day going to school on the typical 8 hour school day, weekends off schedule. But that was on a pretty low pop server. It’s gonna be like 10x as hard to get rank 13/14 on these new mega pop servers. And honestly what’s the point anyway. It’s like T2 quality gear that’s gonna get outclassed as soon as people start getting aq / naxx shit anyway.
---
Is that even a question? I mean, Reddit never lies.
---
What I want to say 95% of the time a screenshot devolves into pointless nitpicking re: people's assumptions based on the UI is "Mind your own fucking business, sheep."
---
herb/mining or herb/alch. so many people under-rate herb as a rogue, i can get in and sap you take the herb and get out, or stealth to places you need to fight to etc plus the money is great
---
Yeah I suppose that's true. Good point.
---
Hi,
---
Im interested in some recommendations for an NA pvp server that has a vibrant leveling community for my new tauren warrior?
---
Thanks
---
tl;dr - Don't roll one a PVP server if you can't handle PVP.
---
Wow how convenient, everyone totally believes you and doesn't think you are a mouth-breathing piece of sub-human fucking shit! Thanks for the post!
---
It's not bad gameplay, it's just part of the game. 
---
This sense of entitlement was also in BFA when warmode came out. These people seriously turned it on, then proceeded to whine and cry about getting camped. Like you have to seriously tell them "Then turn WM off..." 
---
Except here, they're stuck with their decision and then realize halfway through leveling that they just can't handle it. 
---
Blizzard needs to have a warning like they do on Diablo hardcore characters: "You realize that by creating a character in this mode what you're getting into, right?"
---
Whether i play is irrelevant. I havent played in a decade, but that doesnt mean the game cannot be discussed. Good job with all these off topic replies though.
---
Language was designed for people to broadcast messages that others can understand. The understanding part is crucial here. I had to read your post several times to even grasp what you're getting at.
---
If Brad McQuaid had never made Everquest, my wife and I would have never met.
---
I know. And I'm not trying to be snarky, particularly not to you directly, but it's really frustrating that there's no consistency here
---
I want them to fix imbalance on every level, not just Battleground group level. Why make it better for everyone else but not for us?
---
Don't you stop getting exp from killing things once your so high over their level?
---
What should the Hunter have done to stop the Warrior here?
---
??
---
I don’t follow
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?
---
This guy is saying the point of your post "we didn’t know how to play the game 15 years ago" is just flat out wrong.
---
&gt;It's not bad gameplay, it's just part of the game.
---
It's both. And people who recognize it as such aren't asking for an easier game.
---
*ok boomkin*
---
Not surprising
---
I like how you used the iceberg analogy because there's a soon to be bigger exodus of players thatI'm expirencing now, that being the almost impossible resources aquirements.
---
I just hit 60, I have 200 gold I just got attuned for MC. There's no way I can afford to buy an epic mount and raid because fire resist pots and other useful thing are so expensive on the ah. For people that are just hitting level 40, by the time they hit 60 nothing will be obtainable. Prices keep going up and unless you're in a guild that has people farming consumables for the rest of the guild... those people that hit 60 next month will be shit out of luck.
---
Hello there! Panhu from Bloodsail Buccaneers here on Alliance side, I highly recommend picking up a Role Playing Profile addon, the most simple and easiest one to use is called "MyRolePlay" which I will link here ina sec, it allows you to set up a basic profile for your character, including a detailed description, personality traits, history, all sorts of things! And it also allows you to read other people's profiles as well, the community here is super nice and helpful and about 95% of people you come across will have this addon so I highly recommend getting it

@everyone Have lined up a big interview with Raph Koster of Ultima Online and SWG fame, so am looking for a fan of UO AND a fan of SWG to join in on that chat.  It's happening at 3pm PST on Friday November 22, so please be available then if you're keen, PST me if you want in, will be a fun one! New episode is coming very soon, I promise, was just waiting on some audio to be made available from Blizzcon which is now out there, big announcement coming in this ep, look for it in the next few days
---
Nonstop it alerts me of a nearby player and gives me a clickable list entry that targets them. I click it and realize it's a guy flying overhead (happens almost constantly if you're running on the road in felwood because of fp to winterspring mirroring the road in felwood).
---
I know for a fact that most of the time I haven't moused over or targeted them bc I'm holding down both mouse buttons to run or autorunning and scanning for herbs, tuber spawns and enemies. 
---
This seems like proof that its either pulling from info not available in the combat log, or the combat log reports info just because a person reaches the draw distance in the game.
---
Having a hard time figuring out a sensible progression of instances to run for gearing up a fresh 60 prot pally dungeon tank. Like, I just can't figure out, what instances should I start with clearing to get enough decent gear that I can start to do the next harder and more beneficial instances, based on the fact that right now most of my gear is crappy level 55-ish questing greens.
---
My goal with this character is foremost to get geared enough that I can start running other people in the guild through endgame five-mans and ten-mans to get them geared up enough to start doing anything actually hard. My problem is, I'm having a hard time finding instances that I can actually clear easily as a tank with literal shit gear, but still get decent upgrades from that will significantly boost my power. Everything I've tried either seems to give me nothing useful, or it has tons of juicy upgrades but I just get destroyed in seconds even by trash pulls.
---
I've managed to obtain a few decent blue tanking pieces from DM East and a couple random things I could buy very cheaply off the AH just to have some starter blues, like the Lightforge belt and gloves. But so far I am having a hard time now finding a logical path from there to getting fully out of lousy greens and into enough decent tanking gear that I can start to do any non-trivial instances.
---
I've done some guild runs through BRD, but so far the experience has been that the instance takes literal ages of clearing trash, and nobody including me is getting anything useful from it. And by the time we get to later bosses even trash pulls are getting hard to deal with based on the amount of damage I am taking. Two or three hours for a group to come away with literally zero upgrades feels like a massive waste of time. I guess the later bosses may be more beneficial, but I'm not sure I can handle them even if we stick around long enough to get there.
---
DM East went very well and we full cleared it with relative ease, and I got several nice drops. But I think I may now have actually gotten all of the good tanking parts that are in there on the first run and I'm not sure its worth clearing over and over if there aren't more upgrades to be had.
---
DM West and North have loads of great tanking pieces I would love to get my hands on, but I was getting wrecked on the first couple trash pulls when we took a peek into North, and it feels like everything hits about 5x harder than East. If East was easy, is West a better place to go next? Or is it going to be worse than North?
---
LBRS also looks like it has some nice upgrades available, but if I'm having trouble surviving in late BRD then I'm not sure if it's even doable at all.
---
I guess what I'm looking for is a sort of path through all this; start with A, run it until you have X,Y,Z, then go B, look for these upgrades there, by then you should be able to do C with ease and do that for as long as needed to get a set of blah blah. Maybe that's not how gearing in Classic works; I guess I am just looking for some actual direction to get from zero to . . . not zero, without feeling like I am just spinning my wheels night after night and either doing stuff that is easy but isn't helping me get farther, or trying to do things that would be very lucrative but are unpossible with my current gear.

The horde are winning this war foolish alliance scum.   Once every alliance member has been scoured from the servers we will finally have peace.
---
Welcome to PvP servers and enjoy your stay lads. The game director himself just came out and said y'all reap what you sow.
---
my lv16 alt was getting ganked by ?? horde in redridge.
---
which has shown this to be false
---
You signed up for this.
---
O I went pve I dodged this shit because I’m not an idiot.
---
For real even blizzard's intention for pvp servers is no-holds free game. You sign up for a pvp server get ready to die and die again.
---
spacing is my bars from the outer border
---
They were shitty for 5v5, but decent for 2s and 3s at their start. Lots of comps countered other comps. Then shit like DKs came, and then it seemed they lost their minds.
---
I just throw corruption for the shadow trance proc and then shadow bolt. If the target will run at low health I put reckless up to prevent the running.
---
I set the imp to passive and don't bother attacking with it. It's crap dps.
---
You where so ok with it you came here to make a cope post
---
Knight Captain Planet ftw
---
HOLY SHIT!
---
Ah, ok. And this would all be done behind the scenes, and not through actual chat logs etc? It's odd that I can be the only person in an immediate area, but spy alerts me of a person flying overhead without me even noticing them. And the alert is timed exactly when they come into draw distance. It's totally possible that 100% of the time that someone has flown over me, someone with spy was nearby and clicked or moused over them. With how crowded servers are, it really is.
---
God damn, good shit.  I feel a little bad for you now, you’re set your bar too damn high too early.  You’ve flown too close to the sun!
---
Die on dock within range of boat, ress on boat when it comes, die on boat, then do what this guy said.

i mean..even to respec i know its classic but its not a shit ton.. if your a dedicated priest play what ever you want and if your guild really wants you to play holy/disp just respec not a big deal

Don’t come to whitemane. No one come to whitemane. Plenty of servers need your love, but not us. Thank u :)
---
&gt; ganked in front of MC/BRD
---
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about getting ganked from at every step from Thorium Point to BRD, by different people every time.  
---
  
---
Not one person or group following you and corpse camping you, but dozens of completely separate groups stretched from the flight point to the instance portal. This is NOT something that occured in vanilla, and is a direct result of the overpopulation.
---
Yeah that's what I meant. It's only the most unbalanced by 0.3%
---
I was saying that they allowed a game outside of the rules win a category, so they don’t really stick to the rules much. So where they officially allow an expansion qualify for a category means nothing.
---
Untitled goose game got robbed.
---
Is it tho? Try catching a flight to a contested area as an unfavored faction. Gonna take you about 2 hours of recover your body. 
---
I’m not hating on the players, they just doing what they always did. Getting gear as fast as possible. 
---
What I’m saying is 15 years ago we didn’t know the most efficient way of farming, what a surprise in 15 years the mate changed just like in any video game as the players figure out new mechanics, who would have thought. 
---
So you are just ignorant or just don’t understand the basics of multiplayer games if you think things were the same back then as now!
---
Coming from r/all, my excuse is that I played Vanilla WoW and I have no interest in trying to recapture the lightning in a bottle.
---
I am lost. Is this 50th post on this today, or 51st? Should someone say something bad about the combat log ..wait I mean “spy”to really bring this home?
---
Can't swap item in combat, only weapons
---
I guess I'm confused as to why you feel it's bad gameplay. It's the whole point of that mode, by design.
---
Everyone knows the risks. We all have the same experiences getting camped. At the end of the day, it's really not that bad.
---
People certainly don't have the right to complain about it if they opt-in.
---
I'm level 43 and a group of skulls killed me for the fuck of it on Gadzetzan last night.
---
But even before phase 2 they were killing me. Horde shut down SM.   60s camped Nesingwary for no honor.
---
It's PvP: a predatory Hurricane.  Has been for months.
---
My bad, forgot that Reddit is the place people come to to get angry over things that literally don't affect them at all. I'll go ask my neighbor his thoughts on the Phase 3 rollout too. Have a good night.
---
Great! I'll get on setting ty up. There is still a decent raiding and dungeon scene though right? Not looking for cutting edge or anything as I don't have the free tone I used to but I don't want to wait hours upon hours for something.
---
Also how does PvP work?
---
If your missing my point, I don’t know what to tell you.
---
(The content is so easy that all people can do to be “special” is to rush through it, which 99% of the player base won’t be interested in).
---
It’d be like speed-running the game “Elmo’s Letter Find”. Ya you can do it ridiculously fast but that doesn’t make the content challenging in any way.
---
EQ?
---
It would be interesting to see if one time faction changes from majority to minority would fix some of the server balance, i imagine certain rank 14 hopefuls would jump at the opportunity for less competition
---
What problem?
---
There is no problem?
---
Everything is working at intended.
---
YOU are the problem, your mind set is the problem, and the solution is you quitting and going back to retail.
---
Bwahahahaha
---
&gt; I disagree. Honour farming wasn’t as cancerous because people didn’t know how to do it the most efficient way (since we were all new to the game).
---
This is just wrong.  People picked up right away how to get the best honor per hour.  There were huge battles, raids of people fighting, before BGs came out.
---
&gt;  They would rather stand at one spot for 10-18 hours using the same rotation every minute or so. Then run around trying to win 1v2 fights or 2v1 or 10v10. It’s just more efficient to not to do that.
---
That happened.  There is a reason they mentioned TMvSS, because people formed huge groups and had huge clashes.
---
You're acting like this is something new and it's just not.
---
The fact that you can get rewarded for PVP ruined WPVP fifteen years ago too.  BGs will do even more damage to WPVP, and everyone will cry about them ruining WPVP, but all the little crying kids now will secretly be glad ( oh and I bet we'll get at least 20 "unpopular opinion: I'm glad BGs ruined WPVP" ).
---
Copy your interface folder somewhere else, reinstall wow, move your copied interface folder back into the WoW directory.
---
What should have won? I'd imagine any game that's on PC AND console isn't eligible for the award.
---
Take an upvote. We need more biting sarcasm on these posts. People are posting this crap over and over when posts with the same topics are on the same screen.
---
Lmao that solution sounds fucking ridiculous as a horde player, fuck all that noise!
---
Perhaps I'll transfer off!
---
Dreamweave pieces are a great start for healing. Cheap if you buy the mats then get someone to craft. The BiS leatherworking shoulders aren't expensive either.
---
As the other commenter said, the Dire Maul book is cheap and the quest is soloable as druid.
---
Your stupid bastard! Dare you meet me, a wheelchair user, in a ring with TV coverage - no rules - two men enters one man leaves ... with LIVE TV coverage, because you're sick in the melon! How the HELL do you sleep at night while stepping on us who are already down???????
---
They had us in the first half.
---
On another note, couldn't you nova faster, in order to make pyro crit? Or you'd rather the nova stays intact?
---
I check /who, the top honor gainers are playing 12~ hours a day.
---
You can always drop skinning for engi at 60.  Skinning isn't very profitable other than helping to get a mount by 40.
---
I'd like to continue making guides, but I also want to pursue a few personal projects I have in mind, and see if people are interested.
---
It's a mode that promises organic interactions that fails to deliver experiences worth having a vast majority of the time. The fact that it's that way by design doesn't change the problem. For some people the benifits outweigh the cost and that's fine but I think it's pretty obvious from both the original development path of vanilla, the lack of prolific wpvp in most other online games, and the negative response from this community that wpvp is far too niche to be a main focus of the game. This is clearly why Blizzard moved away from it.
---
Normally I would agree about the opt-in thing but the people complaining were sold on a completely different promise delivered by the community. Many realities of classic wow have turned out to be completely different than what was predicted and wpvp is just the next thing in that list. Players expected something different because this community TOLD them it would be different than it is.
---
And again, nobody wants the game to be easier. Wanting to play the game instead of constantly dealing with wpvp isn't asking for a less difficult game and embracing wpvp certainly isn't more challenging than other stuff.
---
The only macro we need...
---
I was pretty disappointed the first 2 days, because the Horde really showed up in droves, but I took a 3 day break and the PVP is pretty satisfying now. People are starting to branch off in smaller groups and find their own corners of the world to PVP in.
---
I don't play retail lol.
---
My TLDR, because obviously you didn't:  you shouldn't Gouge before Kidney
---
Servers arnt dead, they're over filled, if anything all the complainers quitting would be a boon.
---
What is phase 2?
---
How are you able to equip three of those shoulders?
---
Zandlaar EU its letting me log in but I dcd on the loading screen of entering an instance and when I log back in its stuck on the loading screen hmmm.
---
Yeah lakeshire too.
---
FFS why does this happen so frequent? This is sooo annoying. Now my essence of water spawns are resetted yet again. Until they spawn the mass of ally log onto our server like a swarm of bugs making farming impossible again.
---
Why the fuck am i paying for this monthly? I NEVER had issues on private servers.
---
You can roll on a pve server and flag yourself if you want pvp. If you roll on a pvp server, you should expect to be attacked by players.
---
Nothing about this is mysterious.
---
Humans can’t be hunters.
---
Is this a DDOS attack?
---
No shit dude more kills=more honour! There you go! I calculated it for you! The more kills you get in an hour the more honour you get in an hour. 
---
But not knowing each classes’ full potential, the perfect rotation etc reduces the kill per hour which reduces your honour gained per hour. 
---
Some classes has as much as 43 abilities, then count in the talent tries how many variations there are. 
---
As I said if you think people have figured out the most optimal rotation with the most optimal talents in the first year of WoW you are just ignorant. And I’m seriously starting to doubt that you know how meta works in multiplayer games at all.
---
No, horde camp all flight plans in neutral zones and all boats going to the other continent. This has been explained 1000 times in the past week. In fact, it’s typically followed with “we can’t leave cities without dying”- iron forge is a city -many of these players will likely die within a couple minutes of landing if they’re going to a neutral zone-including red ridge. 
---
But you knew this.
---
Seems like the obvious eluded you.
---
If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.
---
lol die
---
There's always PvE or retail if you're too soft.
---
World server down on EU-Auberdine, seems like we share the same troubles
---
Extremely standard placement.. player down centred so you can always see it. Target can go wherever because he's using neatplates for target info.
---
Same on Netherwing
---
A level 32 npc broke my vanish in TM today with an autoattack after I vanished.
---
That's fine. As long as there are people to play with I'm fine goofing off haha
---
He probably does play a lot. She’s just exaggerating as part of her justification for regularly cheating on him (which she admits to in her post history).
---
That was fast. Pause... NOT.
---
My wife had not even bothered logging in until yesterday. She saw the alliance boat bedazzled with Horde while I was playing on Friday, and she preemptively noped the hell out of that. Ironically... she got to 56 last night in Sithilus and only died once to a level 58 priest. She actually died more to the NPCs than the horde. I am on Benediction though. I think the sever is pretty balanced, but by zone it’s a coin toss.
---
You can earn honor.
---
&gt; Only extreme server lag is going to place you behind the other player
---
Rogue here.. I get behind players all the time. Kind of a big deal for the class.
---
Pro tip: you can right through other players. Everybody knows this yet when fighting almost nobody just runs right though.
---
Look at the chat window
---
I mean you could gank people getting off the boat to theramore isle so you’d have that going for you which is cool. But I mean, this server broke me lol. I started on Kirotonos loving the ridiculous 75% horde pvp and then it became impossible to do anything so I transferred out to heartseeker because it seemed more balanced and I wanted to be able to pvp everyday but not deal with stupid shit.—now I run through winter spring and see a 60 ally 2 shot the first lil horde guy I’ve seen in a minute and I just feel bad for the lil guy and being so outnumbered. 
---
I feel like I’m griefing people sometimes because the ratio is just so gross here.
---
They haven't announced any decrease in server cap, therefore it stands. Also my server(and many others) still has a queue so obviously it's still full to the brim with their new cap.
---
dad confirmed
---
Disney+ is their new paid streaming service, like Netflix.  As for this particular pic, look at the chat window, they’re using WoW items names.
---
 /console UnitNamePlayerPVPTitle 0 - turns off  
---
 /console UnitNamePlayerPVPTitle 1 - turns on  
---
enjoy
---
I did it from faerlina and I love it. Lvl 45. Still some ganking but I can just in tenaris and don't get corpse camped in gadget or at zf. I find groups easily. AH has treated me well. I stated about a month ago so I was behind on bigger server. This reminds me of the size of my vanilla server. And there are people in IF with nice gear so content is being cleared.
---
Firefox?
---
Warriors and mages are the top 2 played classes on most servers
---
Is there a guide that levels in mostly night elf zones?
---
That's because the target is still frozen. You can put 10 spells into them across the entire duration if they stay frozen the whole time you'll get shatter chance every cast.
---
Gray mobs should give like 10 xp or something. Just so that it CAN be done.
---
Ha! This was funny! Not the screenshot, but all the comments! GREAT JOB!
---
I'm surprised blizz let that hunter keep that name. Don't google it if you're at work.
---
Lol play a pvp ge and get mad it has too much pvp ? 
---
Entire raid groups have camped entire guilds before. People are crying because the game is how it was and always has been lol.
---
Look Zerg meta up in Starcraft 2 (maybe 1). Protoss was always favoured, as you said they crunched the numbers and it came out with better stats. 
---
But then some dude started running zergs and with some unique mechanics and game strategy I think he won majors with Zerg in a Protoss heavy time. 
---
I don’t recall what he was exactly doing, as I never was a big Starcraft fan but that tells you exactly how meta changes even when people think they know what’s the strongest. (I think he broke something like a 5 year only Protoss win streak, at the major). 
---
So yeah, don’t worry replying, now I know you got no fucking clue what meta is and how it changes.
---
No improved bash talent 🤔
---
It stops being beautiful when you fall off a ledge and spend the next 30 minutes trying to find a way back up.
---
&gt; Now they camp flight masters and that’s how they farm honour. 
---
That happened back in Vanilla too.
---
Yeah don't get me wrong, I'm not saying everyone here in bad, but it's 110% a casual community driven server, you'll find a lot of people who don't know what's going on, but they're nice, I don't regret rolling here, I've met a ton of great friends and good players who are willing to help others out as well, you'll love it!
---
From my point of view, it is the alliance who are in deathballs.
---
See how easy it is to make anecdotal claims? Unless you're literally Blizzard Entertainment, there's no evidence you could present to show that horde are more likely to form deathballs than alliance. And the notion that pvp philosophy regarding deathballs is tied to faction identity, as opposed to much more relevant variables like population distribution and individual opportunism, is laughable.
---
I'm not even ON a PVP server, and I just canceled my subscription this evening after trying to quest in Un'Goro Crater.  I will say leveling from 1 to 40 was a pleasure, but the zones from 40 to 60, the quests, the LOW number of creatures you have to kill, the RIDICULOUSLY LOW drop rates for many quests, and *the fact there are so many freaking people now that the layer is off* makes it that much more frustrating.  It didn't matter *where* I was in the world - there was SOMEONE or several SOMEONES trying to do the same quest as me.  "Just group up lol" Not when it's a drop quest, which is a majority.  In Blasted Lands, there's a quest for basilisk brains and vulture parts, but there are only about 3-4 basilisks that spawn *period.*   I was there with a guild mate for 2 consecutive evenings trying to get the 10 brains with him.  It took that long.

Not to mention for me the zones just aren't visually impressive as the zones from 1-40.  There are more zones that just don't have anything in them.  Blasted Lands.  Searing Gorge, Tanaris, Desolace to name a few, are just huge open areas with mobs and little to look at.
---
Not to mention we're all older and almost all of my guild have different lives now.  We rounded up 5 or 6, one dropped because he just couldn't find enjoyment as a tank without being a Death Knight, and the others are logging in at different schedules because life.  It is how it is.
---
Anyway, I enjoyed the last 3 1/2 months going down memory lane.  It was neat to see the old zones again.  I regret that I never in my life went to Molten Core, downed Onyxia, or entered Blackwing Lair or Naxx (I don't even know where BWL is).  I like the elements of the game to an extent, but unfortunately there are things from retail I liked and things from Classic I liked but not enough of both to make it worth while.
---
Ya'll have fun, I'll be at least interested to see if they come up with Classic + with new expansions or what.
---
And then there's me wandering around menethil for the 1000th time waiting for that rogue to open up so I can get my last 199 honor for the week.
---
I don't use spy but at least I don't have my head so far up my own ass that I try to dictate unto others what addons they're allowed to use like some douchebag.
---
The only path is to do the lowest level dungeons that have upgrades in them, and work your way up. That would be BRD and LBRS. Since you're a paladin, you should be able to do decently in the undead dungeons. There isn't a progression after BRD/LBRS, really.
---
You just have to stack your groups for cc, eat some food buffs, maybe grab an elixir and a stack of potions, and take your time.
---
If you don’t know a 50 mage, yes. Even if you do, its nice to have the flight paths and depending on how camped the boat is, you can do it in 2 or 3 deaths.
---
Looks like ElvUI
---
Sounds like a nobody to me!
---
Depends on the mob. In ubrs I saw one get 2/3 shot by one of the orc guards.
---
Son, you come from a long line of adoptions (?) We may not be related in anyway, but chain fear your old man again and i'll disown you
---
Queen of fashion
---
You’re defending spy with blatant lies because you’re scared to death of losing your hack addon since you know you can’t possibly play without it.
---
Crusader is the only enchant to consider for a warrior.
---
I think my favorite part is one of them (Kenny?) picked a girl character, and they didn't give him any grief over it.
---
Where the hell did I say I had a problem with that?
---
If anything, I wish I could be playing Phase 2 PvE right now. That's the best of both worlds imo. But the foundation of why PvE servers exist ensure that the best of both worlds just cannot exist after BGs release. That's why I'm not playing on a PvE server and that's why I'm willing to tough it out through this one crappy phase on my RP-PvP server: at least when BGs come out, World PvP should stabilize to the level that Phase 2 PvE is at now.
---
I think that was the Summon Servants trinket he used
---
Upvote for a positive post with no regards to world pvp. Grats on your loot
---
make an alt.
---
And Hillsbrad is "mini STV"
---
It’s really not that packed.
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [pet=felhunter, target=mouseover,harm,exists] Spell Lock; [pet=succubus, target=mouseover,exists] Seduction
---
#showtooltip is dynamic if you don’t follow it with a specific ability name, so it will show whatever is valid (or a ? Box if no pet is summon).
---
You can change the pet condition, target conditions, spells, etc to fit your needs.
---
&gt;blatant lies
---
When the fuck did I lie about anything?
---
I have an 18 mage and I can't outdps an 18 Black Dragon Whelp. I don't have an interrupt yet and need tips on how to beat them.
---
Yikes, a hashtag does something bad in reddit haha. The massive bolds should be (hashtag)showtooltip
---
The blizzard announcement post clearly says within 10 levels.
---
You must be slow.
---
Being competitive doesn't make someone addicted.
---
That's a creative way to bypass the filter, but that's also exactly what the daily questions megathread is for.
---
If you hadn't included this quote your post probably wouldn't have been upvoted high enough to actually get an answer, but I guess it worked out in the end huh.
---
Don't get me wrong, I did too! Very much so, and then the first wave of transfers killed my server (Skeram), and now whatever was left over has been trampled over by raids.
---
you cant. You can /s or /y some strange characters which do translate
---
Also taking a break from the game till the ganking dies down or faction imbalance is addressed. I'm a huge fan of world PvP but fighting 5v1 everywhere you go isnt for me. 
---
Have fun fighting yourselves horde lol.
---
Those purple pixels man... They looked so good
---
Thanks! I haven't had many issues with world PvP.  Been ganked a couple times trying to get around but that's okay.  I mean, I did sign up for a pvp realm, alliance have the right to take me out on sight if thats their choice of fun
---
That's how me and a few of my guildies became. Horde turned us into monsters. Now, it's been payback time all day, every day.
---
You're a real POS you know that
---
You can death skip from the coast outside menethil to kharanos lol
---
At least with most other MMOs you have something to look forward to, and not knowing what that is adds excitement for the future. Granted, I didn't play vanilla past level 40 back in the day, so I had never experienced end game. It was fun while it lasted!
---
The truth stings.
---
I think you can turn off player names and keep NPCs in options? Either way, all you need is to know the NPC name to /target it.
---
This thread has literally nothing to do with PvP. Go troll elsewher.
---
&gt; If that's your mentality why even play video games at all? It's all about having fun or not.
---
You're not wrong, and this recent experience has just highlighted that for me even more. The fact that I immediately want to replace the WoW grind with something else has woken me up a lot more this time around.
---
Just know in your heart.  Those who whine on the forums are the real life personification of [this!](https://i.imgur.com/fxCOiP4.png) and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.
---
Amazing that people don't understand this. It's a pretty small world... of Warcraft
---
Does she let you eat her hot pocket?
---
ok boomer
---
Frankly doesn't matter now as you read they'll be introducing BGs 'very near future'. So either have fun while this lasts or if dying on a pvp servers triggers you that badly make an alt or take a break in the meantime.
---
Had this happen to me on the BB boat. Got warped to two different locations after reloading twice. Finally ended up in Stonetalon Mountains.
---
As a rogue you would prob fit right in. There is 5 man rogue gank squads all over the place.
---
Rip. I got the pleasure of being slain by him at the end of EQ beta where he spawned as a giant human with flaming sword and killed people while beta testers swarmed him.
---
Nub hunter, if pet is attacking FD wont take you out of combat
---
Fortnite is still technically not released. It's still early access alpha/beta technically
---
Lets assume thise quote is actually in the context people want to frame it in.
---
They still are going to do something. Blizzard likes money. This many people being unable to play the game will cost them money. Whether its paid transfers or early BGs, people thinking this means nothing will happen are insane.
---
So you're a cunt. Also it wasn't obvious to me. I'm new to the game, and didn't know what I was getting into in terms of pvp. I played for days to get up to 52 and what I was doing stopped working and being fun. So many of you guys really are pieces of shit.
---
Lmao I knew this post was written by a horde, you wouldn’t be having fun if you rolled alliance.
---
With the dps out put in that phase you'll want fury prot for end boss anyway.
---
Sure but not every flight master. That's the point that is missed. Sure flying into hillsbrad was a death sentence but not every single lvl 20+ zone. How and why would people say that is just how it is. This is how you drive players away.
---
Sure they will play and sure the wpvp will start to dwindle but for the next while what are the lowbies to do? Play alts or just subscribe and wait it out. Seems like wpvp could have been tweaked a bit.
---
They can just fill PvE
---
Multiple ways to work around it. Grenades, nets, scatter, FAP
---
I'm only lvl 50 atm been farming since I was 46
---
What’s happening in this pic someone explain
---
It's probably not worth it. At level 20 you get Fire Ward which makes it much easier. Do other quests for now.
---
Why, as a horde on shazzrah eu I agree, no fun to pvp with such an imbalance. Give horde a queue
---
Not everyone that is competitive plays for 10+ hours. 
---
And I'm pretty sure a key part of being an addict is being compelled to do something even though you shouldn't be for one reason or another. That may apply to plenty of players, but to act like this is the case for most competitive people is nonsense.
---
And even then, my understanding is that if you need more crit than hit it is bis until naxx.
---
That sucks. Like as a lock that thing is bearly an upgrade over my pre raid bis. Just one more spell power, 3 more stamina, and  the full 17 intellect
---
This thread and the kromcrush thread turned against you guys despite you guys being the ones getting screwed by a bug almost entirely because of how abrasive your personality is. But please don't change this is incredibly entertaining.
---
Want a cookie?
---
I cried and died 20+ times trying to get to BRD at level 50, 100's of level 60's crushing ANYTHING that moves. Seriously moved 5 ft then died. Once I got into BRD we were absolutely CRUSHED by several 40 man raids just sitting there. 0/10 experience. The alliance on fairbanks and on over servers are being absolutely locked out of everything. idk if I can continue wasting 3 hours trying to get simple tasks done because we're severely outnumbered. "But you joined a pvp server" is just what people that aren't being shit on by the situation can say so easily and its frustrating. I was having so much fun before p2.
---
Something sinister is brewing, I can smell it.
---
Hahahaha Ha Ha Ha Ha hahahaha
---
Thats our policy
---
Ahh, smart
---
Nice man 100% original content! What a great meme also! I’m sure it will last forever.....
---
Is there anywhere I could find the internal cooldown on the The Chief's Enforcer?
---
Guess it depends on the server?  From what I’ve seen the alliance are camping fp’s and killing people as they jump off the zep at uc. I just keep running
---
Go try it, both mobs and players are green at lv 48 to level 60 players, rewarding soul shards(if soul drained) and honor. 
---
If you have seen the multiple posts in the last week referencing level 47, that's actually where the cutoff is. 
---
It's been this way for the last 15 years across vanilla and vanilla private servers. Unless something has been changed from the last time I killed a lv. 48 a couple hours ago, I think it's still the same.
---
I’ve played wow on and off for the past 12 years. Didn’t play vanilla. Imo the people on classic are less toxic than the people on retail. I think it’s a great time to jump in
---
People keep saying this to justify their anger, yet servers Qs were even higher tonight. I get there is a vocal minority who are truly angry, but you are the minority being loud.
---
Then start some raids and bust some Horde skulls.
---
24 hours.
---
yeah this is very sad news. I played EverQuest for years originally in Jr. High / High School, went to WOW sometime in classic. Still went back to play EverQuest every now and again for the Time-locked progression servers. He definitely made an impact in the gaming industry.
---
Tried this the other day with a Hunter friend who was killing the Silithus demon for Rhok'delar. As soon as the duel ended, CoR was removed. We had to stay dueling to keep CoR up on him.
---
I have a guy in my guild like that.  I flat out told him no that I won't carry him through stuff.  He was like 52 when I said that to him.  The entire conversation rubbed me the wrong way and he just came across as entitled to be brought along.  He then proceeded to complain in guild chat all week about not being brought along on pug groups he was trying to join, even an mc at 55.   Mind you I had carried plenty of my other guildies through stuff from 55/56 with no problems.  At the time I was the only guild tank at 60 actively running stuff.  Just burned me out and after a few weeks.
---
By patch 1.12 the players behaved the same way back then as they do now .
---
But upon release of the honor system. There was chaos! Even more so then now. The crossroads were unplayable. Overrun with alliance all npc's dead and lag so bad it looked like still pictures. Head to tarren mill where the flight master is dead all the npc's are dead and theres a 24/7 war front fighting back and forth between the main road. Think your safe in the orgrimar auction house? Nope theres a rogue terrain exploiting and ganking you from the auctioneers side.  Blizzard had to make "battlegrounds" because hundreds of thousands of players could not complete a single quest in some zones.
---
It took a while for people to min max but by 1.12 pvpers new all the eng tricks.
---
As a horde, I agree.  It seems fairly balanced, .  But I’m only 40, so I haven’t made it to the real world yet.  
---
P.s.-plz don’t gank me yet
---
fuck that, i'm not paying more money for them to keep me paying money. but i get the desperation.
---
Nope, definitely. The last three hours, 3am to 6am, not a single 60 passed my 50 alt without killing me, sometimes several times. Not. A. Single. One. Never happened to me in Vanilla. Gankers were actually known and had their reputation, sometimes actually feeling the consequences as the opposing faction would kill them on sight. Now, hidden behind numbers and lopsided faction balances, open PVP has turned into a sociopathic gankfest. Welcome to the internet in 2019, I guess.
---
Is Kurrinax that bad? I only go in groups or level my level 20 or focus on twinking.. I'm glad I have a 60 at this point if what is being said is our server
---
So glad I rolled on Grobbulus. The fighting is intense and neither side dominates.
---
Raid grouping is not the meta at all lol
---
YOU WILL DROWN IN SEAS OF YOUR OWN BLOOD! ARGLEGARGLEGARGL!
---
... they did my boy Kale dirty. At least they realized they fucked up with Illidan and brought him back.
---
I'm hoping to get to General Management personally
---
What if. And stay with me. What if he drinks the cake?
---
The press F to pay respects is a joke based on another video game.
---
Should have rolled PvE, GG.
---
&gt; I love PvP servers
---
It sounds a little like you don't though...
---
Feels like a fix for the symptom.
---
There some spots that are basically like dumping places for players the server has for some reason lost track of.
---
Basically if the server loses track of where you logged out, it defaults in to one of these spots.  Like if you were on a gryphon or a boat that was moving, there is chance you find yourself in of these spots possibly nearby to where you were
---
I remember having logged in places like this few times back in the days.
---
Now, we need this now!
---
Just wait until they all start raging about getting graveyard camped in wsg.
---
Who gives a fuck, it's a game and the opposite faction doesn't feel remorseful. Be more sad at the fact this has happened
---
on the real tho, reading that comment chain made me real sad
---
that is a *toxic* fucking marriage right there. on the one hand, the guy plays videogames *way* too much to be healthy, let alone the part where he does it to the detriment of his marriage. but on the other hand, the girl has apparently made zero effort to understand why he does it or try to get him help. she just bitches about it, probably constantly, to the point where *he suggested* she go find somebody on the side for sex
---
if you're playing classic wow, reading this, and in a serious relationship, go hug your SO and talk to them. don't be like this mess
---
And from my point of view the jedi are evil!
---
This answer is so stupid, it's ridiculous.  Being two shot by raid geared 60's isn't PvP, it's just being obliterated.  PvP servers are about danger and fighting, not roaming bands of raids EVERYWHERE.
---
I think if you are not enjoying it, roll an alt on a pve server. 
---
Try a new faction, try a class you havent played much, try some new profs. The game is as interesting as you make it. 
---
I am just not getting the current mindset here on reddit. You want to play on a pvp server and pvp but you only want some types of pvp? It sounds to me like you want a pve server you can pick and choose then.
---
No, in P1 there just wasn´t a HK counter for "bragging" rights, that´s all.
---
So the only answer to having a playable or healthy PvP server is not playing on one, am I reading this correctly?
---
Maybe I am.
---
I also play on a pvp server, to avoid this I just stopped playing, I'll play again once battlegrounds are out. Because unless you just sit in major faction hubs, you aren't safe. You could be King shit lvl 60 and still get steamrolled just because they have a few more friends.
---
The other people are going to ask for duels no matter of your cd state. Your the one only wanting to duel with the majority of your cooldowns ready so your beeing a bit**.
---
Rogue is cd reliant yes. That also means you have an advantage vs others in 1v1 when you have all cds up. Do people ask you to blow some cds so it’s more fair? Didn’t think so.
---
Get rid of your double standard. If you want to be a 5 Minute rogue in classic people will know you as such and rightfully make fun of you.
---
It's like windows but upside down
---
As a lvl 50 I can’t try it so I’ll have to take your word but it’s inconsistent with the blizzard post.
---
He's one tough bad-ass.
---
Doesn't change anything.
---
I have friends that have also done the same and I'm leaning towards it as well, but I don't want to at all.  No one has been able to give any answers as to how you're able to actually play the game currently.
---
As UD, soak the fear then WotF and save trinket for later. Also frees up kick/gouge for interrupting more DoTs.
---
Dampen magic. It'll reduce their damage output a ton. Just chain frostbolts until they're nearly dead, and use Fireblast to finish them off.
---
What I gather is the guy was having a bad day and this just made it worse. Sounds like he’s somewhat lacking in social skills and has been bullied in real life. I’d cut him slack, but that’s just me.
---
The risk being make it to 60 before 2005 or phase 2 or quit the game because you can’t level anymore. 
---
And the reward being if you get to 60 before 2005 or phase 2 you get to gank and corpse camp players until they quit.
---
Where did you get that number from? Feels 55/45 but prob 60/40
---
Grobbulus is amazingly balanced. I think number wise their are - slightly - more Alliance, but the Horde makes up for it in aggression. Neither side feels like they are dominating, and BRM changes hands so much it's astonishing.
---
Grind dungeons.
---
So you ARE a cunt. You said a shitty thing, got upset when I mocked you, and continue to try to make someone feel like an idiot because they didn't know PvP meant "get your skull kicked in by bored max level players every 5 minutes," opposed to, "get ganked occasionally and compete with similarly skilled/leveled enemies for resources." So yes, I'm using slurs and calling you names, because you're a cunt.
---
Same, though it feels more balanced than other realms.
---
Meta changes in Starcraft are also heavily influenced by map design, and the competitive map pool is constantly changing.
---
Must be nice to get a rank. Me and 2 other guys in my guild have rank 3 and 4 honor and no rank yet. Really rubs salt in the wound when you get tinketed on.
---

currently using Barbarous blade, but i'm trying to farm demonshear from strat living
---
that spawned scorpions.
---
Or they could just introduce realm transfers.
---
I go to college :(
---
raid grouping is the meta for people who literally haven't tried solo or small group pvp and think raid grouping is the meta
---
which you'd think, "nobody's that stupid"
---
but those are the bozos rolling around in raids in places like the boat between menethil and theramore, and blackrock mountain
---
Can't imagine how you would enter AQ in this catch up gear.
---
If anything, it's designed to make MC trivial and ease up the gearing process for BWL.
---
No it's not. Everyone do it on EU too.
---
i don't have a parent to bring me a bedpan to shit in so I can dedicate more time to playing the game.
---
PVP doesn't mean a fair or an even fight. If you roll on a pvp server none of that is guaranteed. PVP means players can and will attack you, nothing more. Accept that or move on to something more enjoyable.
---
That's the only answer.
---
I mean after they removed layering some servers are Alli vs Alli or horde vs horde just to lvl :/. Blizz really fucked this entire deployment up.  Bad.
---
There’s no way a majority of your deaths are from stuff like that. Stop dying in the dungeon.
---
Did you steal this from the Firemaw Discord?
---
You wont really be bothered till lvl 50s+ by which point you can put money on Blizzard having released (or are about to; 2-3 weeks imo) WSG early (as in pre-P3) imo and you can farm dungeons anyway from that point onwards.
---
yea this guys is dense af. he took someone elses point of overpopulated servers and decided that meant they were talking about a lopsided faction population which just wasnt even the conversation they were having.
---
he also has continued to complain and badmouth anyone who is speaking of the wpvp in other threads without responding to me because he knows he cant logically respond to my comment without saying that yea, the current wpvp system is a shitty system, especially under the circumstances of the new playerbase. the guy clearly just wants to say hes more badass or something than anyone who doesnt like having their time wasted. pretty sad if you ask me.
---
So you don't think calling someone a moron is cunty? Sounds like you're a moron too.
---
Your son playing a lock means you 've failed a s a parrent /s
---
I don’t want to argue about Starcraft meta as I said I was never a big fan. But the fact is none of the big names won constantly with Zerg for 5 years then one guy did. There was no other player even coming close to the level he was playing on with Zerg might have to do something other then map changes.
---
I'm one of 3 in our 40 man raid. I dont think it's a lot, but definitely some.
---
You're clearly missing the point and cannot think critically at all because this isn't something affecting you directly.  You also clearly don't want the game to continue this strong train it's been rolling on as this will be the first major hurdle to overcome if they don't release battlegrounds ASAP.
---
Hope it's fun for you stomping people in raids when there's no one else left to kill.
---
I thought it was was already in, after 4-6 kills on the same target no honor
---
nice
---
Gg Yojamba!
---
Might it be so, that they're so short on staff, that they have to hire new GM's, but to make sure they don't abuse any power of giving away items to friends, they just removed the power to interfere with loot?
---
That's like the only logical explanation I could find in this case.
---
You really think ALL the methods for determining populations are wrong? AH listings, /who scans, raid parses, etc?
---
Reroll UD Warrior
---
It 's just not showing. The honor is there. It will show for everyone at some point. Your honor/rank isnt lost dw.
---
This is also a Yojamba alliance guild tho..
---
I mined 2 rich veins as alliance on Firemaw, AMA.
---
Nevermind, seeing your history, you're a giant troll.  Or the biggest neckbeard I've ever seen in my life, wow.
---
Guess what's happening on my server right now? 15 alliance camping the flight path in ungoro and corpse camping anyone who dares to fly in. Crazy huh? It's almost like shitty people play both sides.
---
Most videos i watched about the subject spoke about roaming raids killing everything in sight, camping flightmasters and most of the stuff that is happening now.
---
They did this on a private server and people acted the same as they are now. 
---
I feel the community has put too much clout on pvp servers and this is driving players want to play on those servers.
---
PvE has always been seen as easier and pvp as harder. You know what it is true pvp servers are harder to level on. They are harder to get to raids on  and they are harder to do normal things on them.
---
Play a lot, remember when you picked the last one. 
---
If you dont play a minimum of 8 hours a day dont even bother farming lotus's
---
Lol I've hit a double with arcane crystal and essences of water, never a quad though lol
---
I agree. They taste very good. Their meat is like some Gordon Ramsey type of level.
---
Pretty sure LMGD is above 200k. Someone on honorspy on firemaw showed as 180+k. I wish i was a millionaire and didn't have to work or had no life outside the game and I d be doing it too.
---
Are shadow priests supposed to roll on int only items?
---
Long queues in your server? Not a problem just gank them till they quit
---
Better yet, try a different game. Blizzard obviously aren't interested in working on this anymore. They've already put exactly as much time and money into this game as they're ever going to. Not having fun? Then *stop giving them your money*.
---
If taking longer is all that's required to equate to difficulty, then sure. Actually that sums up all of classic pretty well.
---
2xp as per the episode

If people are paying for your presumably finished, polished product and you fall short of that, maybe it's your responsibility to help everyone.

Oh man this has been said countless times for 15 years. Game still ain’t dead chief.
---
I dont understand.
---
You haven't posted a video but are you talking about milkBattleScrollingText or something like that? The initials are mbst
---
I'd do this in a heartbeat. OC's only got 1 PVE server and it's sitting at "medium" population. Canned my subscription today cause of how unplayable my server has gotten, but will keep an eye out for this kind of opportunity
---
So i rolled SL/Nightfall last night and smashed! will probably roll Shadowburn next week to test it out.
---
Wow I thought there was no wpvp in pve servers...I would have rolled pve had I known.
---
the salt is strong with this one
---
I remember guy from my realm that had this name and title in WOTLK, blizz renamed him
---
Literally fucking raging right now dude more than ever. What a waste of time
---
Sidebar: What add on is that? (The one that shows you extra character stats)
---
Is there a website with all population information?
---
lol, you do realise that huge coordinated raids make up an extremely small portion of the Honor farming that is causing everyone issues at the moment?
---
Or just do some DM:T runs... What the fuck happened to this game, why are people buying runs and boosts now like its the most normal thing. OP even said he's a tank.
---
Glad I didn't marry the girl who was like this and glad I get to spend 10 hours a day playing wow, she ruined me... Dumped her 1 year ago

Except for you know, the fact that no one was complaining about the pvp for the last 2 months but then it feels like something drastic must have changed in the last week....
---
I love them, I get a couple easy kills solo when they break out from the pack
---
You don’t receive experience for killing those pigs after some level.
---
I know, but somehow the profanity filter makes cursing seem more fun to me.
---
u r very smart
---
The last census that was posted had blamo at 51/49 and being in that server it really is close to that from what I've experienced.
---
Enjoy your bg queue times in phase 3!
---
Got the Empyrean Demolisher from it. Really excited to try it out!

If they insist on this, then no ice block/cold snap/Pom for them. How strict do they want to be?

2 weeks before release they said this, and naturally there's been quite a bit of player decay and layer squishing. They never said that any one layer's worth of people was somehow larger than original Vanilla-era servers, nor did they say they would permit 4x as many players online concurrently than they did in Vanilla.
---
Yeah that's why I figured I'd ask, since I just read the story about the guy that got temp banned for playing at his parents house after leaving his dorm . Thanks for the response, I'll probably just not do it because it seems too risky
---
"The Hangover"
---
It's okay.  Everybody relax.  I'm here.
---
Just do it
---
Maybe go play those games you have more time for. Or, and not being snarky, but Retail is much quicker and you might have more fun there. Classic isn't meant for... "zoomers"? Is that what the kids say nowdays?
---
wait what the fuck. why??? what the fuck.
---
That info actually was available before launch though.
---
Yeah my first guild tried to tell me I had to follow those BiS list to get a raid spot, promptly left that guild. Anyone who follows that list is braindead or doesn't understand how number work.
---
I think I ^$*#ing will
---
I had this almost exact same fight and abilities done in the same order today.  I never had any buddies show up though and promptly died.
---
GMs actually were pretty responsive to loot issues in Vanilla in my experience.  I'm sure everyones experience varied though depending on the Server and GM you dealt with.
---
K. You're right, we were too rude when we called out destiny, after they deliberately posted a lie in claiming the kill.
---

---
If you have any mods altering your looting interface, inventory interface, they can cause bugs like this
---
The best part is that it’s actually the complete opposite, alliance used to dominate the horde and that’s why they added guards on the zeppelins and elite guards etc. 
---
Now that there’s more horde this is no longer a problem for them, it’s a problem for the alliance though because they don’t get any of those changes.
---
Problem here is the 4 times amount of players per server compared to original Vanilla.  It was never THIS bad.
---
Yeah this isn't a bug actually. When you're facing Lothos Riftwalker there is a window on his left. There is an area outside that window, approx. 10yd wide by 20yd high where players will instantly teleport into MC.
---
It has been this way since basically launch back in '04.
---
Old Blanchy!!
---
You're clearly not playing Horde on Sulfuras.  Alliance are ridiculous there.
---
Why did you choose the most populated server? Glad layering is gone!
---
Lemme guess you play on zt
---
The same should go for all the posts and comments complaining about people who complain, like this one. Don’t add to the noise if you want it to stop being noisy.
---
&gt;there's often a delay between casting it and the combat drop
---
Uhm yeah that's part of the bug and also sometimes it just 100% fails without resisting. 
---
It's super fucking broken, blizzard acknowledged it like 2 months ago and haven't done shit about it
---
Damn Prot taking on two enemies? Fucking nice dude
---
I still see more complains about p2 complaining than actual complaints. :/
---
Sure dude. Your casual vernacular has proven just how smart you are. Once again, a new player not knowing that as soon as the honor system was implemented (and not even knowing the patch was coming, for that matter) would result in them getting killed every 5 minutes to me, is understandable. Clearly we disagree. You're a cunt for "pointing out the obvious" like an asshole and frankly, being quite hateful yourself.
---
Absolutely not a bug. The window is a portal into the raid. It's a big area under the windows that lets you in too.
---
What a quick teleportation device you filthy gnome engi
---
Mate, it fucking wouldn’t happen if the server was 50:50. My server is 35:65, if horde didn’t have twice the alliance they wouldn’t be able to hold every fucking zone captive for 24 hours a day. 
---
The issue here is the amount of people in the world server and the terrible horde:ally ratios, not pvp skill or anything like that.
---
Logging in every day instead of spacing out days logged in to capitalize on rested experience is the point. 
---
Rested experience plays a decent role in everyones leveling.  But he didn't cater his play to take advantage of rested xp.
---
It would help immensely.  You would eliminate all the hardcore people trying to grind honor for rankings, which FAR outweighs the neckbearded dickbags that just want to gank lower level people.
---
Thanks! I’ll google it
---
I think a Mage on Skeram had 240k
---
Yes, all the time. I don't tend to flag up myself, but I see wpvp between consentual players regularly every zone after about 30ish. This is on Bloodsail.
---
Horde be like: gO bAcK tO rEtAiL.
---
Alliance, being vastly outnumbered on all pvp servers making the game literally unplayable because horde apes 20v1: ok 
---
Horde: pUsSiEs
---
The funny part is that it seems like they only want pvp when *they* want it. But they roll on a pvp server and get all butthurt that other players attack them -- in groups even! -- when that is literally the definition of the term "pvp".
---
I played Eve Online for years. That shit is fucking beyond merciless. Your own supposed friends, as in people who you have had stay at your house, will fuck you over. It's very meta-game for a lot of people. In-game it's beyond brutal. You lose real money and time effort and get ganked all the goddamn time. But THAT is what you signed up for! You knew it going in! It's part of the fun.
---
But yeah, roll on a pvp server and boo-fucking-hoo, there are Horde camping an FP. Oh, my poor gaming life choices, what cold I ever do? Someone should change things, because I didn't know what "pvp" meant. My life is over and Blizz sucks.
---
msbt
---
It will balance itself out over time. For now, either suck it up or reroll PvE.
---
If your team can't all be on and logged in for raid then they need to consider the free faction specific transfers.
---
I don’t think the faction balance being skewed the other way refutes the point.
---
There are so many changes; 
---
300-500% extra player from Vanilla
---
You are my spirit animal
---
I love you
---
Account sharing is bannable as said before, but nothing prevents you to play on 2 machine's next to each other. With your friend "next to" you. Like a lan party but online.
---
Decided to unsub after this post and some much further thought.  Not the original game how I wanted it, but it was a nice ride.
---
on Heartseeker?
---
As a horde player it's exactly the opposite for me so stop crying. Also the easy mod mage class complaining about anything lol
---
No shit queues were high. Its raid reset day. 
---
Do you think people are gonna raidlog forever? People are being patient. In a month if the world is still inaccessible, people will just unsub.
---
Also Alliance could all quit right now and most servers are so Horde heavy there'd probably still be a queue.

---
All of the top posts right now are complaints about WPvP. None that I have seen are complaining about that.
---
If you sort by best, anyways.
---
It's not for everyone that's for sure.
---
bgs are crossrealm tho
---
Lol my guilds mages have been doing this for weeks. Funny it finally gets posted after I mention it on this subreddit yesterday
---
Marshall Mathers
---
Recently? How?
---
It will not improve so long as people of a higher level can attack people of a lower level. That's player versus player. That's the nature of the game on a pvp server. That is what I've been saying.
---
The new game now is to find ways to get around the server's dynamics and come out on top. The other choice is non-pvp.
---
Just a stark reminder to not put off doing what you love.
---
Huh.  I guess I made that up.  Must have gotten the gold and not realized it.
---
They could have essentially done a few things and this is off the top of my head. Publish the horde/ally ratios in real time on server selection so people know what balance to expect. implement faction queues once the balance gets truly bad, lets say once its over 2:1 so at 66% 33%. OFFER MORE THAN 3 FREAKING EAST COAST USA PVP SERVERS DURING NAME RESERVATION! Actually react to seeing an insane amount of name reservations and downloads of the classic client. Offer more than 1 east coast expansion server when your first 3 fill up in under a day (stalagg). Offer more than 1 expansion server after that server fills up in 3 days (skeram). 
---
That was all before the game was even available, absolutely absurd blunder by Activision.
---
I’m a healing priest. A guildie offered to sell cassandras grace for 75g, it goes for 125g at the ah. Bis head, +22 healing. Is it worth buying for the discount or grinding for another head?
---
&gt;Enjoy your ghost servers 
---
You're not gonna stop playing. Just log back in so we can get some more honor already.
---
I noticed that, haha.
---
Some people just need a void to scream into. The problem is that this sub was full of quality content before P2 and now it has just gone to hell.
---
Like pvp giving honor like it should, therefore a reason to do it? Huh
---
Seven leaves/Tactics - proper speedrunners.  
---
Tactics has the 1-10 WR I believe.  
---
I took my sweet time (mining, fishing, cooking, skinning) and was impressed with how efficient it is.  
---
People who know the game better than me have reported sub 5 days played.
---
It's the same on balanced servers
---
Aiance can't get into Blackrock and the World boss spots on mograin
---
But guess what they are doing
---
They own the rest of the world
---
They are mad because they are missing out if the new and most important content
---
We are mad because we can't walk 10 meters in the open world without being ganked by alliance
---
&gt; You are not even a WoW player unless you don’t play 6-8 hours a day.
---
Maybe you are just bad at managing your time? There are plenty of people that are competitive players and don't play nearly that long.
---
&gt; you either an addict or you don’t play at all. 
---
Pretty sure there are more options than that. 
---
&gt; And yes it is the case for most competitive players
---
Do you have actual evidence of that, or are you just basing that on anecdotes, your limited personal experience, and assumptions?
---
&gt; they feel compelled to rank up to gain more honour otherwise they don’t get the “reward high” feeling from the game. That’s exactly what’s being addicted is.
---
No, being addicted is being compelled to do something despite it being harmful. Chasing a "high" simply because it is fun is not addicting on its own. By your vague definition, something as basic as sleeping is addicting because you do it a long time and your body physically compels to do it, which is just stupid.
---
&gt; And since they have no skill in other games WoW is exactly for them because it rewards time invested in the game more then skill.
---
Lol, ok.
---
I get it, I do, but that was the risk people take when rolling on pvp. I know that's an overused argument but the risk of being outnumbered was there.
---
There and Back again
---
Why is there a toggle for PvP mode in cities and low level areas?
---
Right? I rolled on PvP because I thought it would be more interesting. I want the unique challenges that are associated with it.
---
If you rolled on a PvP server for the "genuine classic experience", you did it for the wrong reason.
---
At that point it's faster to just make a new warrior lol
---
Ive always felt the same way about that joke. Ironic that you can suspend your disbelief your every other thing that happens in that episode but an (at the time) impossible race/class combination is the thing that bothers me the most.
---
You are the rival guild on our server, Jims Mowing - Yoj Horde
---
Ok. Thank you.
---
yes
---
&gt;Lets assume thise quote is actually in the context people want to frame it in.
---
I mean, you could read the article yourself to find out for sure..
---
&gt;For those who wanting a more structured form of PvP content that will be a greater source of Honor, we do have an update introducing instanced battlegrounds on the horizon.
---
I woke up early at 5:30 and went to farm some herbs in ungoro. After one pass without seeing ANYONE (and tons of devilsaurs), I was promptly greeted by +15 alliance...at 5:40...in the morning...on a workday... Who then proceeded to camp my corpse...because uhh..?
---
Tell that to grobbulus alliance. They have a wierd fixation with LHC, and constantly corpse camping horde there.
---
Spoiler
---
They don't van bots
---
Coming from someone that used honorbuddy for mining for years
---
&gt; What’s happening isn’t fun, it’s definitely not classic wow.
---
It is EXACTLY Classic WoW, just turned up to 11 because of more players per realm. Conceptually, wPvP has always been an unstructured, sensless mess of ganking, lowbie-slaughter and corpse/gy camping.
---
People will abuse it, spamm too much or leave it open when they stopped looking. Otherwise it sounds nice
---
Get the ones from the beast or better yet get devilsaur set. I main tank all of Mc as a Druid and I’m in full cat gear with two fury war ots
---
https://discord.gg/ekur8H
---
Its not harm that is the issue. People just wanted to experience the game without bgs.
---
I agree. It is not even safe to log in. In major cities there are horde rogues everywhere, they kill everyone they saw. I don't know how's going in the horde cities.
---
&gt;tl;dr - Don't roll on a PVP server if you can't handle PVP.
---
You an undead rogue?
---
Faerlina.
---
good, we should go back to 2005 with no women in internet. Every1 would be happier
---
Lol at "meta". Priest main. I've easily four manned every dungeon in the game  with my brothers and wife. Our bear tank was under geared and under leveled for most of it. I also pug as a smite priest when heals is taken. I have no trouble keeping up with DPS, plus can off heal, buff, dispel and rez. People need to lighten up and open their minds.
---
Same reason it exists on pve servers, to allow those who chose to opt out of forced pvp to still take part in it if they wish.
---
People ITT are acting like this is Ion directly saying they aren't going to do shit about entire servers being effectively shut down for the minority faction when it has absolutely nothing to do with that.
---
BGs are not the panacea people think they will be.
---
raiding pvp is not the meta lol, everyone doing that will quickly realise they won't rank up. it's week 1. take a seat.
---
You obviously can’t read
---
I know what a pvp server is, I’m not an idiot. I was obviously talking about signing up to play without my friends
---
anyone elses guild have a dumb amount of leafs?
---
my guild just got our 9th leaf.
---
People see what happened in hillsbrad on release of p2 and think this is the way it's going to be forever now.
---
This is a living breathing world, there will be shifts in the meta many, many times more and this extreme ganking\zerg pvp will fall off immensely very soon.
---
I don't see how this is so hard to understand for some.
---
I mean, the first day I was miserable but then I made it part of my challenge. I have a 39 on a pve server and sometimes I’ll visit and try to level have like pvp pstd. I can’t convince myself that it’s safe.
---
Don't ever interrupt fire wtf
---
#?&amp;* Yeah!
---
I did this exact same thing lmfao
---
! I'm not alone! :)
---
Yup, playing with rested exp means you don't play a character for nearly two weeks (think 15 days for 1.5 levels rested), then take advantage of the rested exp and park him for another 15 days.
---
Playing like OP did is not considered playing with rested exp, it's just regular play. He simply got rested exp because he plays around 3 hours per day.
---
There is an add-on that mutes Looking For Group while in a dungeon but I don't remember the name of it, does anyone recall what it's called?
---
Ditto. :) /salute
---
Were you there when they accidentally patched in Vox's scream to the cobalt drakes in Cobalt Scar? People died for days and days until they patched it. 
---
Remember beta neutral faction? For the longest time, so long as I didn't kill an animal, they would come to my aid in duels (first character: druid). 
---
Day 1 launch, people running around Kelethin screaming for "Barkskin" because "Skin Like Bark" was NOT what that was called in D&amp;D.
---
Level 50s returning to the home town to buff the noobs and run player-driven RP quests. I used to leave a red flower on an Orc Pawn, sit at the PoD lift, and cry in /zone about losing the flower my OTL gave me.... oh, for an adventurer who might be intrepid enough to FIND and return it! (Handing out hand made 10 slotters with stack o drink, food, bandaids, splitpaw armor set (5) and a weapon - one slot open just in case. 
---
Man, I miss that feeling. 
---
Maybe that's the best homage we can give... just sharing the great experiences that were possible because this fellow lived.
---
They were. Nostalgia is the only fuel for Classic, almost everything else is broken, not finished or bad-designed.
---
I think the winning side is having fun killing you and watching people rage NGL
---
Just use questie addon. It is free, and you can pick and choose quests for your area and level. Drop huge breadcrumbs if you don’t want em
---
Damn straight
---
It's actually super relevant because we are all, after years or decades, dropped back into that original world that his fingerprints are all over.
---
EQ definitely led me to wow. Havent played an MMO in 15 years but it's good to be back in this world.
---
No duh, I didn't know there were other games. Cough* fighting games
---
We'll see how that looks when people stop playing and their quarterly subs go down.
---
I guess that's one way to look at it
---
Faerlina looks way out of balance looking at ironforge.pro
---
I like how people are arguing about how people are ruining it by being lame and it's unfair.
---
Bruh this game was never fair
---
OK, so had had expectations that were not even remotely grounded in reality. That's your problem.
---
Classic plus .... give us high elves ...
---
6th on alliance atiesh, ended week one with 39k, rank 4.
---
Being a PvP head on Atiesh (PvE) is rough man.
---
ITT: A bunch of horde on uneven pop servers not understanding what then problem is, and offering shit advice such as *GiT gUd*, *rEroLL PvE* or *tHeN sToP pLAyiNg*.
---
&gt;It doesn't have a cash store, loot boxes, or pay2win features.
---
Sad fact about modern game industry, Even if Classic has more players than game with loot boxes, it won't be as profitable. It's just fact that people tend to use for microtransactions. And in the end company is there to make share holders happy.
---
Mind to se 't me a pm
---
Thats not true, its 70% horde 30% ally..
---
"Alliance always honours 1v1". I did not felt that while leveling without honour system, always 5v1, and you gank. It's no different now.
---
It's less of a risk than a guarantee. Horde outnumber Alliance on virtually every single PvP server. Alliance outnumber Horde on almost all PvE servers. Pretty easy to do the math and figure out where all the Alliance are at. I knew this when I rolled Alliance and wouldn't have it any other way.
---
He has alts parked at most of the spawn points in the zone, most likely. Takes a couple minutes to check them all.
---
How many goals do you reckon would be scored in a game of soccer with 110 people on the field instead of 22?  
---
How fun would it be to watch?
---
If u have no buffs u wont show up
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
I believe those guys only die if you use a specific quest item. Because of this, they never die, and are extremely useful in levelling your weapon skill at max level.
---
I think Warframe is too, technically. They stopped marketing it as such, but they never had a "release" either. It just kinda morphed into a full game after a time.
---
Not on classic, bud. :P
---
 No problem
---
Do you not join arena/anger runs? This got me a lot of xp from 52-60 as a rogue. And you're going to want to grind that anyway for HoJ, there are some good rogue items in arena too.
---
Also, RIP journalism, you almost always want to report age when death is announced, that's the first thing people look for outside of cause of death.
---
It's only worth down ranking when you have a lot of +healing. I use rank 4,8 and 10 of healing touch at around 470 healing power. Max rank of everything else.
---
I actually went back to Eve about two years ago to have another look. No way, not at all. I just don't have the 8 hour-long stretches to devote to it. Because when you lose a ship, all the time and money and effort that went into that ship are *gone*. I don't have that time to commit anymore. And without it... yeah, no. You're dead.
---
I found another source of causal amusement.
---
GMs won't message him. The in-game right-click reports are based on volume. It's virtually guaranteed no human will ever read anything you write in there; some algorithm might sift through the text for keywords, but even that is a stretch. Once enough people report the guy he'll get an automatic suspension.
---
Go Old Blanchy! I kept that buff till it timed out in MC.
---
It's 10 days to reach full rested. But yes, your point remains valid.
---
What is your reasoning not queuing on your phone before getting home?
---
Porn is more fun. At least I'm not the one getting fucked.
---
smh, the nephew above you.
---
Pally is good for pvp, it have everything that needed for it as a melee. But in pve I dont recommend ret dps, just make a holy/prot hybrid and enjoy the instant invites.
---
spider bite
---
I'm 52 now
---
no pvp for you anymore, until you rank down :D 
---
lock yourself in an inn and play alts
---
If im a hunter and the warrior rolls need on the Gladiator chains, I would probably roll need on HoJ if it dropped later.
---
Why is there this guy in every thread lol? "I love the horrible thing, i get two kills off of it ;)"
---
What if I was level 25 and now I'm 50 and halfway through Rank 1?
---
Raids next!
---
r/WaterNiggas
---
How did he know you two were dating and that you were a girl? Seems pretty odd that he would have that information unless you gave it up.
---
Proceeds to immediately and obsessively mention world pvp.
---
Solo kills, meanwhile they get 3 or 4 kills split across 10-15 players, I'm wondering who wins out here?
---
Uhh, why didn’t you use disarm on either one of them
---
I agree. For mage (as an example) flasks are totally meh at this point in time. 
---
Supreme power and wisdom are great, but fights aren't lasting long enough to make them needed. 
---
If you wanted to tryhard and go after speed runs they wouldn't even really be that beneficial because other classes are absolutely knockering you in short term DPS.
---
I dont either,  but my sub 60 friends are in hell. There is literally nowhere they can play at any time of the day that isn't an instance. So no short sessions. And also, good luck getting to the instance to begin with.
---
Thanks, but is 54 your level or age? Also, are you talking about character sex or irl sex. I need both and I need to know which is which.
---
Yes
---
If your expectations had been realistic, they would have played out. Anyway, have fun with your PvP shitshow. You deserve it.
---
Still, my alliance guild has killed him twice (Thursday and Sunday) already and I am sure someone else was even faster.
---
Theres spots in the roof where the other faction can't retaliate to attacks.
---
Lol, bud.
---
How is that even possible
---
&gt; complains about pvp.  
---
&gt; uses a method that uses raid parses.  
---
Wowclassicpopulation.com meanwhile shows that there are several Alliance dominated PVP servers (when looking at 60s only), and that only one server gets close to 4:1 H:A ratio this sub has implied exists everywhere. In fact, there are TWO drastically Alliance heavy PVP servers to Horde's 1. If you think 60/40 means you'll just get rolled all the time...lol
---
Right. My little gnome looks like she is on cocaine when I PvP because I'm running and jumping and spinning through people to hit back stabs lol.
---
It’s not that hard to get caught.  Let’s say the OP is logged in at his house.  Then the friend  comes home and logs in and wants to play.  Op is kicked out, and the account will show logged on from a different location.  Account sharing.
---
Not with me, I pop a trap and locks and shaman the hide out of sight. When you feel safe and res into my frozen trap, the aimed shot is coming 3 seconds later ;)
---
Thanks, hope yours get fixed soon aswell
---
Oh, so its not just regrowth and forget anymore?
---
From my knowledge Whitemane and Blaumeux were once pretty well balanced, just being horde favored somewhat. But all PvP realms apart from like one or two are that way. My realm Heartseeker is alliance dominated, by far.
---
Take it from a horde player - no it absolutely hasn't lol.
---
Can hardly move anywhere now that phase 2 is out, your boys are out camping flight masters and killing level 51s on sight
---
It seems like you think I'm disagreeing with/mocking you.
---
My pun was that *Ion* already sort of sounds like *I don't*, so the crossed out part is redundant in my case.
---
I just don't see a point to whine about a player breaking his contracts rules and then getting punished for it. Opression and injustice has nothing to do with this stupid player breaking his own contract which he signed himself. Simple, really.
---
As noted in a different comment, pretty sure my bf told him we're a couple. He's super excited that we get to play together and more social in-game than I am--I usually don't chat much.
---
Answer seems clear
---
Wow is a social game, when there are no other nolifers around you are less likely to play as a nolifer
---
bigger servers will have more nolifers, total numbers and % because of that simple fact
---
r/warcraftdadjokes
---
Then you might have other priorities than grinding honor atm =)
---
General Lee will be a win for me
---
done.
---
I started only yesterday and i'm having a ton of fun with the game, the atmosphere is amazing  albeit the combat truly is just standing and hitting
---
Because you rolled on a pvp server
---
Mhm, even more than that was the trivialising of the content. Retail feels like a mobile game in its tasks n rewards
---
Because we can. No need for a reason, it's war.
---
#nochanges
---
Because you give honor
---
Maybe if I trade him 100g he'll notice me? He might even say my name on stream!
---
Anyone know when EU boys will be able to see their rank?
---
Seems like a stretch.
---
Dude how ever you wanna defend it it aren’t gonna work, it’s wow we talking about here. And yes the game does reward time spent more then skill. Example; all raids are easy as fuck (what we have now at least) that means the person who has better gear just runs them more often aka spends more time in the game. 
---
You need sleep otherwise you would die, you don’t need video games, to live. People still spend hundreds of hours on them. Aka they are addicted. 
---
And about competitive players playing less then 6-8 hours bitch please. They are competitive players because they consider this game their job. They play at least 12 hours. And it has nothing to do with my personal experience. Pretty much every competitive player streams nowadays (even if for 10 viewers) and they are up on twitch 12+ hours a day. 
---
Yeah maybe you could compete in FPS games because they aren’t gear dependent but skill. If you good you good. You can clean house. If you good in WoW but your enemy has maxed out their engineering have all the useful potions and bis gear you can’t do shit. Simple because he has spent more time in the game then you have. 
---
Just because you say “no that’s not addiction, and people can manage their time” does not change facts. I know you never gonna admit it because you are arrogant and spent too much effort defending your opinion. But it is a addict’s game. 
---
Ever wander why no life fat neckbeard neets are usually associated with wow? That’s because that’s what the game makes out of you if you wanna become the best (it takes all your time) and if you don’t think becoming one of those does not damage your relationships your physical  and mental health you are just plain stupid. 
---
And I think you have defined addicting as something that you feel compelled to do but it harms you. There you go; you feel compelled to keep on playing so you can get the high from gaining new/better gear and it damages your social and private life as well as your health. 
---
Even heroin doesn’t fit better for the descriptions of an addiction. That was a joke before you start arguing that heroin is so much more addictive then video games.
---
We must be on different servers because this has not been my experience on earthfury. I’m bad at pvp, I’ll readily admit that but I’m not getting ganked constantly as a lvl40 alliance mage. At most a fight every 30 to 60 min, depending of corse on location.
---
Thats what I say!
---
My server aint tooo big, but you cant play normaly in searing, tarrens, brm etc. because of all the raids.
---
So Me (quite good pvp geared Warrior) and a Rogue (same gear) hit burning steppes and had a blast.
---
I totaled around 7h of PvP this week and got 330HK's and because most of these where either solo/duo or max with 3 other people (when another group ran by our fight), I got some decent 13k Honor + the Thorium Ores and 3 Arcane crystals for farming the ores there.
---
But most importantly I had a complete blast doing so.
---
Some fights were 2v1, but most were 2v2, 2v3, 3v2 etc. 
---
We sometimes got rushed by a group of 10people but that was mostly the exception. (on the other side sometimes some hordler came to our help while we were losing a fight)
---
So all in all we won some we lost some, but after all we got a decent Honor/hour while having a lot of fun.
---
Because they are very bad at PvP against other level 60s
---
You know that killing honorless targets from fps rewards no honor right? And enjoy your ranking. Gonna take you 16h a day of playtime just to reach r10.
---
Hahahaha!
---
Ganked by ?? Rogue in Stonetalon. Repeatedly.  
---
Killed multiple times by a higher level Mage after abandoning PVP with him.  
---
Killed in the Gadgetzan Inn by a Rogue (who somehow vanished the guards).  
---
Followed (while in stealth) by a group of ?? players (clearly as intimidation/preparation) to be killed when the boat to Booty Bay zoned.  
---
Alliance arent honorable at all.
---
I am a warrior
---
I don’t do it - but somehow I saw a level 49 being “green” levelled for me the other day. Being a 60, which is weird. I did kill the person once to see if it rewarded honour and to my surprise it did. Was very very odd.
---
My bad. 90 % of all pvp servers**
---
God i wish gladiator spec existed in retail or something.
---
I guess. I just have a really hard time to understand the usage of totalt irrelevant replies.
---
I literally referenced population differences as a more likely cause. Do you lack reading comprehension? The post I replied to made the claim that only a **few** alliance deathballs have existed, and **most** horde players are in deathballs. That means either only a few alliance players exist (such that they can only form a few deathballs), or something in the horde psychology biases them towards forming deathballs. Considering that most servers are 40/60% population, and that at least a couple alliance dominated servers exist, the former statement is bullshit. As for the latter, if you really believe that the players on the opposite faction are inherently different from you, you're either really good at roleplaying, or really shit at critical reasoning.
---
Lol you definitely do not understand itemization
---
The ep is full of weird little inaccuracies like that. How the ganker is a human that is only wearing a plate helm and dagger but spawns scorpions and uses arcane blast. Or how Randy "defeats the bloodfish at jerods landing" or how they say to meet up in elwynn but meet up in Arathi.
---
47+ gives a 60 honor:)
---
Because you make reddit posts about it
---
The gaslighting is unbelievable. This mirrors *nothing* when Blizzard chose not to recreate the server population, items, and talent trees from "back in 2005." They dramatically changed many core gameplay elements, and are now pretending nothing was changed.
---
This statement reflects failure on so many levels. Failure to anticipate and manage player experience, failure of honesty, and failure to take responsibility for the unintended consequences of their actions. Very typical lawyer speak from Ion the former lawyer, and this entire situation exemplifies how Blizzard has burned so much goodwill.
---
It's not a problem in the games that were designed with RvR in mind. WoW isn't one of those games.
---
That's natural. It's double the chance of the priest item, and you'll likely have fewer hunters.
---
Your guild can just sell them to non-raiders. Price depends on your server.
---
Grey bring Dire? Yo thanks fam
---
It’s 50x worse for alliance on sulfuras so keep whining

Didn't recognize the logo really, looks like some trash news site either way, that said, google literally can't find that quote anywhere but here and there. So hard to know if it's even relevant to 'today' vs when the patch was coming out for honor. Garbage article update either way.

---
Most PVP servers approach 40/60 Horde favor. Many are more like 45/55. 2 are grossly Alliance dominated. 6 are Alliance favored. 1 is grossly Horde dominated. 
---
But yea 20v1 my guy. Skeram, the worst horde server, is 3v1. And these are the numbers when looking at just level 60s.
---
Maybe next patch Blizzard can give Alliance the "invite to group" racial. Right now its Horde only.
---
No people wouldnt be steamrolled by raids whilst leveling on a 50/50 server, because there would be just as many allies stopping them.
---
My server is 78/22 Horde dominated. How is that PvP? If CS:Go decided to start matching people 5Vs15 there would be outrage, there would be global boycotts.
---
I DONT get how you cant fucking realise that. Ooh wait, you're playing the dominant faction, ofc everyone is "whining" to you, you're playing with a handicap.
---
Because u give honor?
---
48+ FTFY
---
Poor kids 😂 try to get laid son.
---
&gt; WPvP.  
---
&gt; 2v2
---
Retail has Arena.
---
That's unfortunately not what I'm looking for because I'd have to type to leave and rejoin every time
---
Because it creates posts like this. Because it ruins the victim's day.
---
Cause I can 1 shot you and gain honor why would I not kill you is a better question
---
You act like news outlets are extra reliable?
---
Element of surprise, Only works when everyone isn't using the spy addon. At the moment I get mages, priests AoEing, hunters flaring and Consecration before I even have the view of them.
---
I saved:
---
Knight-captain Obvious
---
Private Detective
---
Seargent Major Tom
---
Commander Keen
---
&gt; 300-500% extra players from Vanilla server caps
---
You people keep saying this, but you got no source to actually back it up. Can we stop lying to try and justify your error in playing on a PvP server?
---
I wont
---
Everything except control of its damage and a gap closer.
---
I’ve done 7 raids with my guild and haven’t got a single piece yet.  Round robin loot style too.  Mages may be OP but the competition surrounding gear is frustrating
---
Have seen tons of posts on here where people have no fucking clue how this works. They think HK = honor = level. This isn't retail.
---
How’d you calculate this?
---
Got it my server.. Maybe pick a better server ?
---
Crusader and Thorium Shield Spikes.
---
But if you're struggling with threat that much, you might want to look into some threat pieces (hit% gear is super good for that).
---
Keep in mind that DPS have to watch out as well. Regardless of how good you are, they still have to watch out for their threat.
---
Oh my day was fine friend
---
Looks like someone made a mistake rolling PvP when they are a PvE carebear. That's on you buddy.
---
How the hell are you pronouncing Ion?
---
Most Fury warriors don’t mind tanking a dungeon. Only the entitled once refuse.
---
God I wish Horde players would just lose their posting privileges so we didn't have to read them shitting on Alliance players who can't play the game because their server was mismanaged. I hope so much that your server falls into 95-5 oblivion.
---
Parses, wowpop and wowclassicpopulation show conflicting data for my server at least.
---
Yes you skin the beast (requires 310 skin, so the dagger he drops), then a gnome spawns to give u the quest. The hide has a low skinning droprate tho
---
You couldn’t hide ranks in Vanilla.
---
Ok well heres the problem my guy. If you get PVPd on, you have to push back. Alliance keeps SAYING they want PVP...do it then!
---
&gt;I agree with you 100%, but CoD doesn’t put you in 5v20 games.
---
Only because it forces you to use lobbies that decide almost everything about the match for you, which is a pretty extreme way of balancing.
---
9:15am and this little post of yours got me square in the grin. Well played, bud.
---
I'm on a full server that is 60/40 and I seem to find many alliance being left alone by high level hordes, simply because they get more honor from 60 targets and want to get those.
---
You people must be playing on the streamer servers for having this menace play out - I don't recall it at all and we're a server with queues in the evenings.
---
I wrote this in good spirit due to a weed brownie.  So you think alliance has it worse in Sulfurus eh, interesting.
---
Yep, her whole comment is exactly that, a justification to her cheating. She is most definitely in a really fucked up situation, but is also not making it easier on herself...
---
Imagine getting married to someone who plays video games for 10-15 hours a day and being oblivious of the fact. That's some crazy shit, 'innit?
---
&gt; I love world PvP because it's dynamic content. 
---
&gt; Your players should be your primary source of content.
---
&gt; It's these interesting interactions that can really make the game fun that scripted content will NEVER be able to mimic. 
---
WoW has never been that kind of game and never will be. There has been exactly one long-term successful (somewhat) game that achieved this and that's EVE Online. World PvP in WoW is just aimless killing of other players and that's it. There is little pupose and structure and, IMO, little of interest to it.
---
Everyone's still rank 0 though
---
&gt; Enjoy your ghost servers you fotm shitstains.
---
Imagine crying so much about a 15 year old game...pathetic! Play a PvE server or stop skipping kindegarten.
---
qué?
---
God, what a fucking joke the gaming industry is these days. I love classic wow, but I wish there were new games to love as well.
---
Is this a meme? I don't get it
---
Ah damn, thought we were server first for alliance
---
It sure doesn’t, partly because there is no point to begin with. Homo sapien humanoids play both factions, and both engage in this - it being in the game and all.
---
Icy Veins has a good prot pally gear list. Setting the path requires your own personal taste or preference. I'd always start with Undead dungeons.
---
What can you do? Retail players who started around Cata or later are going to whine and whine until they get what they want, just like how they ruined retail.....it's inevitable that the community will destroy something good, because Blizzard always caves in.
---
What? Not everyone are WoW Geniuses. I'm not allowed to ask for assistance? :O
---
Join a guild.
---
Ok boomer
---
What if I'm 95% into rank 3?
---
The game that WoW quite literally took most of its succesful formulas from aside from PvP during WoWs beta and launch and well into its launch. Basically what youre playing right now. If you look at some of the WoW alpha screenshots it looks extremely similar to how everquest was at the time until they eventually put their own spin on it.
---
There are too many bad design choices made to answer you simply.
---
I think it's pretty weird to suggest that any horde players above level 50 trying to level have it any better than Alliance players do. The game is just as unplayable on my undead warlock as it is for the same Alliance players. I rage quit about 30 minutes ago because I couldn't get in to BRD and our group fell apart. I took the rez sickness and hearthed and I'm about to roll an alt on a normal server because I'd rather at least have some semblance of progress being made. Anyway, I'm horde, and I feel your pain.
---
Ahh yes, because eveone is at thorium point and not in the mountain ofc, I knew there was a way to get around it....
---
Go back to your no lifing in he basement and let the rest of us adults talk. We can't all have neck beards and 15 hours a day for pvp.
---
Is the hide tradeable tho? I have herb/enchanting so I can't skin it myself
---
Respect to the crushed adderal
---
He just explained to you why that is usually not a feasible option. Do you have a learning disability? Seriously, it's like talking to a wall with some of you.
---
If you roll alliance spy is 3 seconds delayed, it's balancing
---
Neutral faction? What races did it contain?
---
I think he’s referring to you calling the other guy “bud”
---
It's not a title. It's a rank. You can only be the rank at which you are.
---
I think in TBC or WotLK the titles were introduced and you could choose.
---
If you will put in same effort, after like 10 weeks you will be rank 10.
---
Hahaha that was always my favourite bit, the deflation in his voice.
---
I can’t believe you are this stupid. I bet your broke your damn keyboard over this. Unreal that you honestly think this is a faction specific strategy. Holy fuck you are a waste of time.
---
I mean, to be fair, I did that first in my comment for comedic effect despite knowing that bio sex =/= gender, so that might be on me. Didn't mean to exclude trans folks.
---
Absolutely, I just wanted to also include how long it'll take, since many people will think "oh, I'm only gonna get Rank 7, but I'll smash that out in two weeks and be done with it".
---
You sound mad, go roll PvE.
---
&gt; not ruin another person's game experience
---
DON'T PLAY ON A PVP SERVER YOU DINGUS! How hard is this to understand? PVP = KILL ALL ENEMY PLAYERS, REGARDLESS OF LEVEL.
---
It's always been like this. That won't change. Get a fucking grip you lunatics! You got entire servers catering to your carebear needs! Take advantage of that. ADMIT YOUR MISTAKES. You rolled on the wrong server and are not FIT or CAPABLE of accepting PVP.
---
You can tell a game did something right when it makes people unhappy?
---
Huh. Weird metric. Probably not very profitable?
---
In dragon tongue they call him BOVAKIN
---
Speak for yourself. Im enjoying classic far more than I enjoyed legion. The problem with wpvp is due to sheer numbers which is something blizzard forced upon the playerbase. Nobody was asking for these 12k player cap megaservers, the only reason they exist is because Blizz still thinks they know better than the consumer.
---
It's how statistic works. You get the best data you can, and keep the source in mind when you read it.
---
These 2 data points can imply that Alliance have a larger active population, but horde have more serious groups who go to the trouble of optimizing with logs.
---
True, its basically constant effort for 10 weeks non stop.
---
It's really refreshing to see pvp videos without the old fashioned butt metal, and ESPECIALLY the new age meme vomit dogshit
---
Why can you opt out of pvp at all on a pvp server?
---
That hunter was trash and that was a warrior trying to DW before he could get hit gear  
---
you SHOULD of won that. helmet or no helmet
---
No, the entitled ones expect every Warrior to wanna tank your dungeons
---
**Eris Havenfire: Be healed, $gpriest:priestess;**
---
I got kidnapped on the Zeppelin the other day, I just chatted in guild for 10 minutes till they got bored.
---
You playin on a controller bruh?
---
Charstone for sure. The hand doesn't contribute anything to an elemental shaman.
---
Your damage numbers will always be lower using a dagger, because it's a faster weapon. But it's a lot more beneficial.
---
Inquisitor is better. It has slightly lower intellect but much higher Spell power.
---
That is what will separate top bracket from people going "just" for rank 10 or so, while on alliance side it will be who wins all those instant queues.
---
They manage to lvl until elvynn forest...
---
If you read his post carefully, you can see that he really doesn't care who won.
---
Yeah those kind of players are not worth your time. It doesn't take long to spot them.
---
 They are the ones who whisper "hey, what are you up to?" and if you don't preemptively make up an excuse they think GOTCHA and very unsubtly ask "tank for me? (since you're not doing anything)"
---
I've even had a guy accuse me of being selfish because I was leveling my alt instead of relogging and carrying HIS alt.
---
I've had a couple issues with glitches/bugs and the GM straight told me that the devs told them not to help.  
---
"This is a directive from our Developers to be hands off because this is what the community asked for which is why you've received the previous responses."
---
Sorry, but what is wrong with that?
---
&gt;  but you got no source to actually back it up 
---
except census data, Warcraft logs etc.    
---
Also the feel from just playing classic wow compared to Pservers (where population was actually reported).   
---
It very easy to see that the caps on these servers are significantly higher than they were in Vanilla. If blizzard want to correct us all then by all means tell us and set the record straight. But they don't, because they're not. 
---
So run along now.
---
I love world pvp as it is but its definitely not the same as back then with these amounts of people on the servers. 
---
You're the idiot here, toxic spastic.
---
Why am I being downvoted for asking a question?
---
No I love PvP. I always engage in battle. I DONT however enjoy getting corpsecamped by a 20man ganksquad. And seeing as the server is 78/22 horde there isnt much I can do
---
Lol, I'm glad I'm living rent free in your mind still.
---
Horde- already have 3-5x the numbers on most servers.
---
Still need to cheat in pvp.
---
On my server it is, not for honor farming necessarily but ALWAYS raid groups of 25+ roaming around badlands searing gorge brm area from both factions wiping everyone for their 5 honor.
---
Honestly, don't allow your guilt to weigh you down and stop you from finding another guild. I am sure many guilds are looking for more people for their second (or even third) raid group, no reason why you can't be one in that crew - you're almost pre-raid BiS, by the sound of it. 
---
Find a guild, find people for Jed/rends - or befriend some tanks/healers to facilitate group creation for said runs. The thing is, you're going to have to compete against the healer for Reed, since the only reason for a healer to join Jed/tend is that Trinket. Been doing my fair share of 5-6 man runs as sole healer, and the bastard just keeps dropping that shitty hat and wand lol.
---
But yea, look for a guild. Check your server discord, run dungeons, talk to people, scan /2. Raiding is fun. What's even more fun is running said raids with great guildies.
---
Did you steal the title from a stupid bullshit ad?
---
guides are stored in google cache, no need to pay
---
Gotta stop their growing advantage by corpsecamping the low levels.

#layeringconspiracymustend

You're not a person. You're a bunch of free honor.
---
I’m collecting sweet sweet rest xp
---
Cause they have really thin skin? This isn't anything worth getting all worked up over. I've known chicks in older mmorpgs that laughed at this shit and turned into better players.
---
A minuscule amount of honor for them though
---
Some rested xp 2 I’m guessing
---
yeah, that was pretty brutal
---
Dang u been pretty toxic in this thread lol
---
He could add arcane bomb to the equation.
---
I think nowadays more than 80% of the MC runs do full runs where back in the bay not everyone was able to defeat rag.
---
Read between the lines, dude. When people make a statement like he did about the state of affairs, they generally speak of their own experience. Its obvious he cant speak for other servers, so it doesnt have to be stated.
---
The issue here is that women will usually say they dont want to be treated differently then guys but then at the same time will announce or let it be known that they are a woman, typically to be treated differently. You cant have it both ways. If it was your bf who announced it then tell him to stop doing that as it draws unwanted attention.  
---
The reason these guys gave their type of response is probably because its not the first time theyve played with a girl and she wasnt up to par, ive pretty much had similar experience, yes not every girl is the same but *majority* of the time youll have a similar experience. Girls seem to get really pissed if you give any criticism typically even if you frame it the nicest way possible for example. Another reason why guys dislike playing with a guy and his gf is that the bf will place higher importance/priority on giving her a good time as opposed to whats good for the group.  
---
Again, it isnt always the case, but has happened often enough to be a pretty true steretype.
---
Crying about PvP on a PvP server is illogical.
---
Lol why do you think I'm posting it here under Humor flair?
---
Hands of freedom, bubble, and the stun is more than enough for gap closing.
---
How is the above toxic?
---
I don't believe they will introduce micro transactions into Classic. This is their PR-trick to assure players that they do care about our opinions. Same thing happens with EA now that a lot of people are praising SW Jedi: Fallen Order. It doesn't have micro transactions or any other commercial stuff. But will it effect on how their other games work? Will Classic effect on how retail and other Blizzard games work? I don't think so as it would be pretty big financial loss.
---
As long as it gives honot its fine. Also you can get honor 12 levels below you ( if you are 60).  Everything else i leave alone.
---
They split the honor among them, so they would get 12 honor each if they got 60 for you.
---
I don't think they get that much though.
---
We're 60/40, alliance has increased for the past three weeks actually, not sure what you retail players are on about? I guess you're trying to whine so much you can ruin WoW for a second time?
---
Was this the lowest res image you could find?
---
Still more than 0
---
I rarley fail my feign death. . .
---
Do they use a macro to put their pet on passive?
---
When using my macro with that it only seems to fail when I'm feigned in an aoe, and when it's resisted.
---
Okay, so post a single one, retail player.
---
Can you find 6 Black Lotus in the same node? SHOW ME A BLIZZ STATEMENT
---
They don't comment on every little thing. If there is no OFFICIAL RESPONSE to this non-issue, then disregarding absolutely everything people try to provide means you're just uninterested in having the conversation. In which case, bye.
---
We have every reason to believe it's instant and works the same way that it always has, and no reason to think that's untrue. Do you disagree? Fine, then show me an OFFICIAL COMMENT saying as much.
---
Is it difficult sourcing a widely known truth? (not saying I don't think it's true)
---
On incendius at least alliance and horde just pvp differently, horde usually are 20-40 man deathballs while most of the time I group with guys on alliance we stick to smaller groups and roam.
---
I'd suggest you only let people rate each other who have been in a group for longer than x minutes and only one rating per guild and group. May look a bit much but otherwise your work and all its good intentions is nothing more than a bullying addon.
---
It's a bunch of naive players trying to farm honor. They'll stop once they figure out all they can get is 2 blue items that may be good for their class without at least some dedication.
---
Rolls on the most popular and full server, a fact known from the very start.
---
Complains about queues
---
Lol
---
Probably because you can check your own settings and find it faster than waiting for people to tell you exactly what to do
---
I can tell you everybody that has a little clue about pvp and wants to do pvp has spy. Not because they like it but because you are just at a way to big disadvantage if you dont use it.
---
Of course there are some people straight up refusing to use it, but they are still at a disadvantage.
---
(not saying that they are bad because of this!, but just at a disadvantage)
---
If the server cap is 5000 (which its not) that is easily over 200%-300% more than most vanilla wow servers. Pserver were 8000-+10,000 concurrently and this feels like that if not more. 
---
Anytime **you wanna prove** that classic wow server caps are 2500 off ya go.
---
you get the Honor Kill, but the amount of honor for that kill is severely diminished compared to killing a level 60
---
I regurarly report anyone i spot shooting at people from roofs in town. Dont worry what others say, just do what you think is right.
---
it's bugged, hotfix inc. https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1110079-honour-not-updating/
---
Thanks for clearing that up for me!
---
I certainly hope all the people who made a mistake rolling PvP when they are PvE carebears are going to leave. Blizzard will commit to a full rollout of Classic anyways, so I'm not one bit concerned. Go enjoy retail (that's what you're paying for anyways).
---
Or for people who, you know, think it's fun.
---
Thanks for sharing this, you’ve been through a lot and it’s good to see some positivity and perspective on this subreddit. Keep being you, you are a kind soul.
---
you serious? the guy you replied to is dumb but your response is even dumber. you pretty much use all your abilities in pvp.
---
Always keep HOJ, switch Breath as soons as your Insignia is on CD.

Jame's leveling guide, always been pretty good, they got an addon and stuff.
---
im genuinely curious, can someone explain to me how everyone seems to play on a server with 0 alliance? Every post i hear is like this 80/20 ratio. did i just luck out with grobbulus being super healthy, and a nice even 50/50 ratio? is horde really this dominant overall?
---
&gt;  horde apes will respond with double
---
waaah is really all I'm hearing here
---
I picked pve, and I leave people alone, I'm also on a low Horde pop server. So I get what you're getting at but it doesn't really apply.
---
Ur comment says the 8th of november, might confuse some people :-)
---
Hah - damn straight!
---
This was super helpful. Most explanations of the ranking system i've read so far only included timestamps for the top 3 brackets, so basically only for those who're probably not gonna need a guide anyways^^
---
Thanks!
---
The concept of wpvp isn’t the issue here. It’s the extreme “intensity”, “turned up to 11” as you put it that is the issue. You have major faction imbalances multiplied by larger server populations and the result is what we’re seeing now.
---
I played vanilla wow on a medium/high pvp server during the release of honour - Roaming raids and camped flight paths in every 50+ zone and daisy chained corpse camping to instances did not happen back then and should not be defended now.
---
Well there a lot of "hardcore" players that have more than 1 Char per Class, it has its benefits, but not for casuals.
---
But if this is whats fun for you, you know yourself the best, so have fun!
---
On herod it's 100% this even at 4am
---
thanks for not lying
---
It's funny because even if it did go 95-5 it wouldn't bother me at FPs and while doing my own thing because I'm not on a pvp server :)
---
Nope.
---
So now you admit to lying and that you actually have zero sources? I thought so. Retail players making themselves look like fools, once again.
---
You said 300-500% more players. That would be a concurrent player cap at 10000-15000. You have absolutely zero sources to back up this claim.
---
Try again, retailer.
---
I remember lvl 31 being fun and being grouped with like minded positive folks. Then I hit 50 and went to brd for the first time.

Go play retail.
---
meh, I've seen  better
---
Just make yourself an LFG channel.
---
Why are you so aggressive with this comment lol?
---
I'm not playing the dominant faction, actually, I just thought for more than 4 seconds and chose a server that wouldn't give me problems.
---
So, let's imagine that you're right (which you obviously aren't), it's a single server where this happens and somehow you want actions being taken to accommodate the INSANE minority that whines about this?
---
You're so delusional it's almost sad! Seek help.
---
I rerolled to another pvp server where I started off as a horde shaman now. Fuck that lvl 55 warrior I got.
---
Logitech G29 but why does it matters for God's sake, he asks for add-on not keyboard Hocus pocus
---
Considering how utterly limited it is compared to EVE Online, no, it can't be a lot of things.
---
Why are you so whiny with this comment lol?
---
+ 0.5% increase is wrong. It is easy to let healers drop you to 40% in most fights. 30% AS for 10 sec is a huge dps increase. Period.
---
Don't stream...... seems pretty obvious

---
This.
---
wtf was the point of you rolling in a PVP server if you're going whine?
---
It's the 'no-changes' crowd that fucked it up tbh. Classic WoW in it's core design philosophy is great, but there is things to change and things not to change. So far Blizzard has made changes where they shouldn't have (server pop cap, which of core importance since the vanilla world was designed with those limitations in mind, releasing 1.12 honor rewards without BGs...) and didn't change things they should have  (gimmicky boat camping by giving free full health/mana revives after loading screen)
---
This isn't the PvP we had back in Vanilla. It was never like this. Not even close.
---
Warriors can't charge on any ranged class unless they catch them off guard, since it can't be used in combat and has a shorter range than any ranged classes abilities. You can also intercept only once per fight, and it can be countered by frost nova, teleport, scatter shot, frost trap... Basically any class should be able to beat warriors 99% of the time on equal settings unless FAPs and pvp trinkets are used. Anyone would agree that they are without a doubt the worst 1v1 class.
---
However with a pocket healer and dispeller, warriors are the kings of BGs :)
---
Until there are multiple enemies on screen and your target is kinda lost in them.
---
So weird they wouldn't add it along with the resets. Anyways, they stated the servers will be down for an hour today, they never did go down at suggested time.
---
I have 315 skinning and 300 egin right now. Should I drop skinning and go for mining to help with egin supplies and higher chance of making gold? Skinning doesn’t really make any gold anymore and there’s already a couple skinners in my guild
---
Fairbanks Alliance is unplayable
---
That's normal, you want attention, you get it.
---
I was thinking about this before and the solution is literally to just let the player be able to play both factions. Like give free faction changes and if you have a shaman you can make it into a paladin or let it stay but just give them the ability to roll on both sides. Only reason I didnt want to start new is because I had already grinded my epic mount but if I couldve just gave myself money on the alliance side for my alt, i wouldve done it.
---
I'm playing on 3 year old budget laptop on low settings. Got lag only if like a big group of people casting spells at the same time. I upgraded hdd to ssd and have no issues
---
WHAAA I ROLLED ON A PVP SERVER WHAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
You mean like joining a PVE server?
---
It was never like this. Ever.
---
At no point in time were there roaming raids of 60s locking down all quest hubs.
---
There were raids on cities and towns, there were large scale battles in Hillsbrad, there were skirmishes and gankings all over... but you could still play the game.
---
That's not the point I'm making.
---
&gt; I just thought for more than 4 seconds and chose a server that wouldn't give me problems.
---
Meaning I bypassed any risk of being so bothered by the opposite faction by choosing pve. Pvp servers aren't for pvp *you're* way, it's literally players able to kill players however, wherever, whenever, unless they're using exploits, which camping in raid groups or whatever is not one.
---
100g not enough. Try harder.
---
damn, warrio looks fun. im about to start playing and was torn between shaman, hunter and warr, still gonna try shaman first but yea.
---
Yeah.  Gotta go with the first response.
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes.  Sounds like your friend wants all the glory and popularity of streaming without attracting any of the negatives.
---
Shitty for you ! 
---
Awesome for other people.
---
And judging by Ion response that came after looking at the player count, awesome for the majority of players.
---
Bfa is a game that try to appeal to everyone and we can see what a shitshow that is.
---
Does it have to be a laptop? Otherwise visit r/pcmasterrace. They have some nice builds for pocket money!
---
Ahh. It's not referring to changes with classic. The reason #nochanges stuck was the changes that exist in retail WoW that lead many of the vocal supporters of classic to be against changes in classic. They wanted as little changed as possible under the concern that any real changes were a step towards the changes they were hoping to escape.
---
I'm also all for dual specs or reduced respec costs but I'm okay with wanting to see that the developers aren't going to ruin the game.
---
I think Blizz has to add faction transfers (pref free) to fucking sort out the fuking mess they made when they saw how skewed the facton imbalance got on some servers and refused to do nothing about it.
---
I cried about this months ago, and nobody gave a shit. At least I cut my losses early and restarted one of the few well balanced servers.
---
Don’t stream or deal with it. A downside of broadcasting your position and action is that people can know them ... it’s not fairplay by the streamsniper but p2 is not really about that.
---
You could use the same tactic as them, build bigger raid to counter this or other in game tactic. You can also add 1mn delay so they don’t have exact infos
---
Who knows? His and my perspectives are clearly different. But if I knew where he was from, for example, would it be alright for me to use his nationality/race as an excuse for the bad run? Or any other demographic he might be a part of?
---
Tbh the whole question is making this sound a lot more serious than it was, he raged after he pulled aggro and it was funny.
---
No you are not.
---
I plan on dropping spirit tap once I hit 60, its just so nice for questing and playing solo, plus sometimes I manage to snipe a mob thats running away in a dungeon to proc it.
---
Chaning to the CC resistance one might help with being ganked and such.
---
I saw an Alliance with Corporal, not sure how high that is. Most of us Horde are still at Sergeant lol.
---
Ah, so that's what collusion looks like- ask an Alliance raid to stand together so they can be easily aoe farmed for rank.
---
Nobody clusters like that on a pvp server- maybe a few months ago when people didn't know what sappers were, but not anymore.
---
Still- thanks for proving what I've always suspected, that colluding guilds will be kill trading by clumping and aoeing for honour. Expect to see the 'top' guilds on your servers doing this and hitting rank 14 uncontested as fast as possible.
---
&gt;Our guild experienced a similar issue where were unable to loot the hunter leaf from majordomo chest.
---
Thanks for giving me nightmares.
---
Sunday was my seventh MC, I have both sinews in my inventory, seven eyes thus far. 
---
If the leaf drops and I don't get it due to a bug, I might just quit the game.
---
That is my only complaint with the server tbh, and that's mostly because I'm mst
---
While I agree with your point, this is not the thread to make it.
---
No one cares lmfao.
---
Same happened to us. Blizzard is so cheap they dont release a keyring because its a patch, do you expect them to have staff that helps you and not just sends macro answers?
---
That the current pvp server, it’s not going to change when 60, these day you can either pvp or pvp, all solo content is shut down due to pvp (questing/exploring/garhering/farming), you can do them but expect +50% of time being dead
---
get out of here with that retail garbage. 
---
u ppl are the ones who need support for ur mental health, logging into a shit game like that.
---
I just hope THIS TIME you whiners just quit instead of trying to change the game into how you want it by months of whining. Because, I hope you understand, THIS TIME game ISN'T going to change. So save yourselves and us time, and just gtfo back to retail or wherever you came here from.
---
Dire maul bool for the royal seal (44 healing and some fire resist),living shoulders, maybe some +healing greens depending on your gear level

 ˙ʎʇᴉsoᴉɹnɔ ɟo ǝɔᴉɹd ǝɥʇ sᴉ ɥɔnS
---
I beg to differ. If there is another ally nearby when I fight 1vs1, I'm getting ganked for sure.
---
&gt; How did i sign up for THAT?
---
By not rolling on a PvE server. 
---
Seriously, the fact that most PvP server are horde dominated is old news. It has been like this for a long time. So when you clicked on the PvP Server and picked Alliance, you should have known that you took a gamble with the odds heavily against you.
---
So if I understand correctly, the cost of respec goes down 5gold every month (to a minimum of 5 gold). Is it one month from when you first respecced? One month from your last respec? A set date? Anyone knows how this works?
---
Stfu and go spam ok boomer in some chat. That’s the limit of your competence, you stupid kid, clueless of human nature, thinking faction specific behavior is a thing.  Real life never hit you the way it should have, it seems.
---
&gt; PVP = KILL ALL ENEMY PLAYERS, REGARDLESS OF LEVEL.
---
Yeah, that's why blizzard implemented dishonorable kills and factioned controlled zones. To incentivise you killing all and everyone, regardless of level.
---
No pic, no reply
---
Are you associated with the bunnings warehouse boys who kidnapped a wizard on Arugal and took him home? Because ive heard whispers...
---
stupid wallhugging in arena killed wow pvp
---
Massive pops worked perfectly fine on private servers, the only difference was that most private servers actually tried to make the servers faction balance, and always having that data available so people could see what faction to pick.
---
Blizz hides that information, so now a lot of people are stuck on shit servers with horrible ratios and has to suffer for it.
---
I discovered my initial server was dogshit 2 months ago, so I just said fuck it, cut my losses and found a very well balanced server, and I having a blast with wpvp where no faction has complete supremacy.
---
Follow a leveling guide, know when to skip quests and just grind. Avoid professions until LVL 60 (except for maybe skinning). Spend time efficient, like level first aid while waiting for boat/zep or quest NPCs. Don't AFK, that will screw your /played.
---
Most people played pvp servers in vanilla as well, and picked them again expecting a similar experience. Because of the much larger servers and faction imbalance on certain servers, however, the experience is completely different and actually prohibits them from playing the game at all. At this point most people in this situation would love to switch to PvE servers, but they cannot without giving up their characters they have invested the past few months in.
---
2g for rexxar location
---
..
---
Inside SM GY
---
&gt; You have been shown proof. You have been shown direct quotes from blizzard themselves. 
---
No I haven't. You send a post where they talk about realm capacity when servers were **layered**.
---
&gt; Show me proof that realm capacity is the same in classic as it was in vanilla! Your turn now.
---
I never said it was the same as in vanilla. I only argued your statement that the capacity (after layers were removed) are 300-500% higher than in Vanilla.
---
Stop lying. It's sad to see you go to these lengths to justify you being bad at PvP.
---
I usually roll into a 5 man with 120 or so lvl 55 waters and just hand them out.
---
In Org i can make 20g a night selling it tho
---
Make charaters on the realm and speak to them directly.
---
The one on the right.... Devilsaur legs?
---
There are deathballs on both sides.
---
But statistically, more horde equals more horde deathballs.  
---
Also everybody, Alliance and Horde, complaining about not being able to quest or level in anything lvl 40+ might suggest that it is just a shitty time to level.
---
My guess is that most people will stop this crap as soon as they realise that they, no matter how much they pvp, they will need weeks to get any significant rank. And that you always have to stay at the same level to actually get progress. And that 20% of your points get lost each week and that only a certain, very small percentage of players is able to achieve anything above rank 10. There will be deathballs, but not 10 in any given area.
---
Violence breeds violence
---
Um....what? The OP made a comment that I said I didn't believe and asked him to prove that? Then why the fuck should I start out with proof of something I don't believe is happening?
---
In what world does that make sense?
---
Get one with an i5 8th gen cpu minimum and a 1050 ti with that budget. May be overkill but may as well get her something decent. Next thing to look at will be aesthetics such as plastic/metal chassis, comfortable keyboard, and most of all a good display.
---
Reminded me of getting my "chef" title on Boyardee. Good tknes.
---
Should have listened..
---
I agree the cap is most likely lower due to no layering but I'd imagine it's much higher than the old vanilla caps still. Census is the best way but I havent done any scans since the addon was fixed. If I get chance I'll do some scans and see what numbers pop up
---
Can you get a green dress/robe in game?
---
It can be seen in the Combat log, it makes no difference whether the addon exists or not (not like it can be removed without breaking evey other addon either). I have a combat log window with just things done by or done to enemy players, and that works better than spy when you're already in combat because spy doesn't update in combat. Quick example from last night, I was killing a turtle in Hinterlands, I saw something in the corner of my screen but wasn't sure, I was in combat spy did nothing - was it someone in the area before who's harmless or someone new coming to fight? Combat log showed a rogue use sprint and stealth. Ding ding ding, challenger approaches. This super amazing broken addon was... Not needed or used, the in game combat log showed what I needed. 
---
So your argument for this addon being bad is just because the message is shown at the top of the screen instead of the &lt;wherever you have your chat box&gt;? Could make a WeakAura every time that happens too. Want to get rid of WeakAuras next? Stupid argument, really. 
---
Assuming you think literally everyone has it (from my experience most don't, even if the number is increasing), all you have to do is think about if they can perception or flare - which honestly you'd have to do anyway because you don't know if they saw you coming or not. If not it makes no difference, you can still open immediately if you want to, or just wait until they get bored of AoE-ing. You can also simply stealth from out of the view distance at like 80y if you really want to be unseen.
---
True, but that doesn't make it broken, not finished, or bad designed.
---
Hey man! I don't know your time zone (I'm in Germany,  its 9:40 am here) but if it fits im down to play with you semi regularly (3-4 times a week for a couple hours) if that interest you let me know! Im currently at work and usually don't get done until 1630 but I have weekends free.  If it doesn't fit don't worry about it and happy leveling!
---
Yeah, those « player total » doesn’t seem fucked up at all. « 3000 player total » on a full server, while there were 4-5k serv back on Vanilla already?
---
That changes as you get higher level. Classic pve rotations are simple but pvp is highly complex.
---
Census wasn't correct in Vanilla, nor has it ever been in retail. It's not possible to scan concurrent players, because that possibility isn't available. Census doing /who scans over and over means people could log off and new ones log in while its doing its scans. It's inaccurate as hell.
---
Got ganked on the street from Morgans Vigil to BRM by 3 alliance rogues.
---
And the amount of people defending bugs because the game is old is so baffling. I was expecting a more polished version of Vanilla 15 years after release, fuck me rite?
---
How do I view my total +healing to determine when ready to downrank?
---
And we're paying a premium fee for this experience.
---
Yeah, it's pretty bad. But I enjoyed seeing all of those posts of people talking about their interactions with other players, good and bad.
---
But it's when it devolves into whining that it becomes the issue. Why make a new post to complain about WPvP when there are already plenty of threads dedicated to just that.
---
Unless your experience was genuinely unique, why post about it? I don't get it.
---
This is my wife. No point reasoning. Laptop it is...
---
Because they can't fight other lvl 60s and take the easy route.  Sorry you're against cowards man
---
LOL
---
RIP. Passed at 51 too. That’s too short.
---
The fact that the hunter did everything wrong might add to your victory.
---
Since you have OmniCC, install ClassicAuraDurations aswell. They work together and gives you what you want.
---
it worked for the asshats over at archeage unchained, threatened to refund and got their will
---
Ok. So you’re saying racials aren’t flavorful enough on the alliance side? Humans having increased rep is neat and flavorful. Gnomes being naturally more intelligent with higher engineering is cool. Night elves got fucked. I like the flavors of dwarf treasure finding and stone form. 
---
However I see what you’re saying now and I apologize. I do agree horde have more colorful and expansive racials; I like the idea of a tauren hunter being melee oriented while orc hunters rely on their pets, trolls make better marksmen; etc. Shadowguard is by far the coolest priest racial in the game which is why I rolled it; synergies with talents make it cool even though it is basically just a reskinned lightning shield.
---
I'd say that's an exaggeration. It scans very specific sub groups one time each scan. So people logging off wont do anything to it if they were already scanned. It would only add people to the pool if they logged on before their appropriate subgroup which isnt a bad thing.
---
Its why it needs multiple scans to be fully accurate. It's the best option available to players and no where near as inaccurate as you are claiming.
---
Feels like 7-1 imo
---
They won't go away though. People have realized that they can make posts here just to whine about PvP and they will get upvoted not due to the quality of their post, but sympathy from other people experiencing the same thing.
---
Which would be fine. If it wasn't nearly 10 percent of all posts.
---
&gt;Is it just a matter of keeping spice and dice up while spamming backstab? 
---
Pretty much. Backstab is expensive for generating combo points so you don't generally have room to mix in Eviscerate. Try to only use 5p SnD if you're not already doing that, you want to spend as little energy as possible on it. Exception is the start of a fight, get it up asap.
---
&gt;I have a non-standard dagger spec
---
That may be the problem. The usual combat daggers spec doesn't leave much room to move points around, everything is neccessary to boost your damage.
---
&gt; I believe it has to do more with my lack of +hit gear 
---
Hit gear isn't as critically important for rogues as it is for other classes. You get +5 weapon skill from the combat tree, bringing your yellow hit miss chance to 6%, and another 5% hit from precision. Meaning with just one piece of hit gear your yellow attacks are hit capped. More hit further improves your white damage, but so do other stats.
---
Won't the fact that in 2-3 weeks a lot of people will stop grinding honor make it easier for people who will continue?
---
Same. I started raiding with the sole mindset of acquiring a Bonereaver's Edge. That was my goal for phase 1. Nothing else mattered. I donated 50g a week to the guild bank for extra DKP, I farmed consumables to not be benched. I did not do that for warcraftlogs parsings or a good reputation in the guild (which happened naturally).
---
I only did the raids and everything that entailed to get a raggi weapon before p2 hit.
---
What I am doing daily:
---
option 1:  log in, fly to quest zone fp, run to quest zone + kill quest mobs for 5 mins, dead and killed by opposite fraction, run back to corpse, rise and 5 mins questing, dead and killed by opposite fraction, run back to corpse ,and all over again.
---
Option 2: log in, fly to nearest fp near a dungeon of my level. Dead upon reaching fp, run back to corpse , rise and run towards dungeon for 1 mins, dead and killed by opposite fraction, run back to corpse, rise and run towards dungeon for 1 mins,
---
 dead and killed by opposite fraction, rinse and repeat again hopefully I can reach the dungeon entrance in 1 hour time. 
---
Option 3: level on pve server. 
---
Option 4: level on a pvp and server with extreme low population 
---
Or I just log out and go to sleep or watch netflix. Watching netflix and sleeping seems like a better choice nowadays. Hah.
---
I’ve used it and it’s not worth the money.
---
This is correct. Also the most logical option of the above. 
---
I've heard mixed answers for the minimum cap, though, 5 or 10 g depending on the source it seems. 
---
Max cap is 50.
---
Ganking always happened but nothing like this. I played on pvp servers in the US and EU for years.
---
Wait. Gaming? I thought the internet was only for porn.
---
I'm not really sure what this is about
---
So this doesn't work at all because maybe the next week I have 8 hours time every day and get way more hp ?
---
Your "main focus" is as much of a joke as PvE. Only even more time consuming. So quit your pseudo elitist pvp bullshit. A monkey can get rank 14 by literally sitting in game 24/7 leeching honor kills.
---
Thanks m8 i will give it a try later today
---

SHAY-MINS
---
That specific subgroup cannot be scanned faster though? They'll scan 50 players at a time and if we say more than 3000 people are online, you don't think quite a few are logging off and new ones logging in? Then we have the whole issue with multiple characters. Let's say Census scans my main and I log off before it finishes and log on my alt, suddenly it scans two characters and you think they are "unique". Sorry, you're explanation doesn't cut it. You're giving way too much credit to an addon that never worked properly.
---
Oh man, 50% upvoted and a decent amount of comments in thread. Apparently people just don't like it when they're called out for complaining about something they have total control over.
---
I mean... Most foods are either A) water soluble or B) alcohol soluble.
---
Ought to be able to stuff blender eth cake and fill the empty spaces with 100proof. Boom, drinkable cake.
---
Yes I know 😊
---
On first kill, that sounds about right. Less after that.
---
This is the people who are saying they dinged 60 within 1 - 2 months with kids and a wife. Online they are pretending everything is fine but in real life they are neglecting their family.
---
ok great, that doesn't mean the servers aren't bloating and characteristically different than vanilla.  People can complain all they want about anything.  Enjoy it just like you enjoy camping 50s.
---
I love wpvp in wow so I guess we’re just going to disagree on this, it’s my favourite part of the game and vanilla was its purest. 
---
Again I think we just disagree that what we’re seeing is different now to what it was.
---
Nothing ensures I corpse camp more than some punk about to die who uses a potion
---
Congratulations, though!
---
People wanted #nochanges, they spammed it to oblivion. So every bug in classic they attempted to replicate, and told the players “this is what you wanted”
---
Although I would’ve reopened the ticket with the GM, asked to be escalated, and explained to them that in the REAL vanilla experience, the GMs would help you regarding loot issues. The PERFECT classic would be one in which the game plays as it was intended to be played - bug free
---
Nice. Not sure all 4 guys in your group really needed it though :D
---
everyone should have speech.  grats on rolling on a pve server and then giving your 2 cents in tho bud.  It truly is worthless.
---
Yea because people honor trade on the main road in hillsbrad....
---
Thankyou 😊
---
this
---
Thanks :)
---
i see hunter already have stampede
---
IF all they need to do is restart the server then why the fuck do they have to wait 18 hours to do so, this is so fucking stupid.
---
Haha, I didn't even need to yell for it!
---
Thankyou 👍
---
It can't be a lot of things for most players.
---
However there is this subset of players who just enjoy the PvP in itself. Like people still enjoy CoD2 without any rank ups. Just joing a game to shoot some germans or russians. Nothing more to it.
---
I have a thousand hours in Day of Infamy.
---
It keeps me entertained without any meaningful carrot on a stick.
---
It also serves as bragging rights. Every monkey can raid in vanilla WoW as shown in the latest survey.
---
Being a top guild on a horde dominated server shows true prowess. Even more so, because there is no incentive. Some people play a game simply to have fun.
---
Probably has some super girly name, "oh my god how do they know I am a girl tee hee! :3 "
---
This shit is solid gold, and these are likely the very people that are on this sub lately complaining about how "PvP is broken" or "12 vs 1 isn't PvP!!!" 🤣🤣🤣
---
Because you're nothing but honor to them.
---
He is probably tired of endless rogues ganking ;D
---
I have two on my mage and it saved my butt so many times. 5 second freeze into shatter combo flipped the coin of battle quite literally.
---
Didnt know that it shares dr with stuns though. So at least some kudos for that wierdo
---
WTF spell is that?  I always play locks.  Maybe I should switch.
---
50x worse? There's 200 Horde on epic mounts chasing every level 48+ solo player? 
---
Seeing 200 players of the enemy faction running to catch you would be quite the sight, in all seriousness.
---
Yes let's sit on the dock getting ganked over periods of the day and take screenshots just to satisfy someone who refuses to believe horde would ever camp the boat. Horde have a 100% easier time camping boats than Alliance can camp a zeppelin and that's a fact. But since you haven't seen it these people saying it must be lying.
---
If u play solo pvp the scaling goes 1st kill 200 honor , 2nd 150 ,3rd 100, 4th 50 and after that its 0 honor till next day.
---
O K B O O M K I N
---
fucking lost it when i saw the crushed adderall
---
If you run out of (a certain) range, you get nothing. Most likely this.
---
A good chunk of the moderate tryhards will stop in week 2 when they realize their 5hours/day grind got them Rank 3, and not Rank 8 as they were expecting.
---
But yeah I understand the sentiment, which why I specifically avoided PvP servers this time around. Faction imbalance was rampant back in vanilla, so I didn't expect anything different now.
---
Fatigue
---
Then take any Battlefield game with its server browers in which you can land in horribly unbalanced games.
---
You can quit, winning team join or you stick it out and carry your team to victory.  
---
In BF3 Bazaar 64men rush I once got a tank with a altogethr 3men crew, one repair man, one gunner, one tank driver.
---
I as a driver went 120-9 whereas the 2nd had 45-40 K/D. 
---
This applies to a WoW as well. Be geared, be in a well organized guild and you can hold off the waves of shitty horde players.
---
Imps do be smart like dat
---
They're all clumped up on mounts, the mages aoed them down and died within 5-6 seconds. Their mistake was all standing ontop of one another, especially when everyone's relaxed and not expecting that - not that their reaction time was slow
---
&gt;If u play solo pvp the scaling goes 1st kill 200 honor , 2nd 150 ,3rd 100, 4th 50 and after that its 0 honor till next day.
---
This is for same Level and same PvP rank
---
You get a lot less when you kill someone lower level. (In this case level 49)
---
This week we are also going to start seeing the effect of different rank.
---
Your rank is calculated after every weekly reset, depending on how much PvP you've participated in.
---
Geared 60s shouldn't have any real problem with pvp since they don't actually have to go out in the open unless getting to MC and Ony couple of days weekly.
---
Rest well, Aradune the Ranger.
---
To fight the horde, and sing and cry
---
Valhalla, I am coming!
---
Yeah it's now 9am in the UK here and I have 5k honor points, nothing's updated. Just says rank 0 'None' - although others have clearly achieved a rank and title. I am level 57 though, maybe you need to be 60?
---
They said it would be fixed after the restart, not that the restart itself was the fix.
---
You can wait a day for your “grunt” title, entitled little neck beard.
---
...wat
---
At least, you'll have more easily the Hammerfall/Tarren Mill flypaths  :)
---
Has anyone ever told you that even if you might be correct (which in this case I don’t believe you are anyway), it never helps to be a massive asshole about it for one reason?
---
Are you okay lad?
---
"unless you're blizzard, you can't say anything about anything"
---
I bet you're also one of those people that says not to talk about game balance until you've made a game, huh?
---
I have a life
---
I'm sure they'll add an NPC in retail, though not sure about Classic considering the whiny #nochanges gang.
---
Wait til you hit 48
---
Incoreect usage of meme retart
---
Blast wave it looks like
---
*gives thumbs up*
---
No he's the kind of guy who knows that the only people who have real statistics on who plays what faction are Blizzard.
---
You know, the truth
---
I pretty much quit the 2nd day of Phase 2. I didn't regret rolling on a pvp server until then, I can't even do anything. I played in Vanilla, with the honor system being implemented before BGs. It was -never- this bad, Hillsbrad was basically our battleground on Kel'Thuzad (alliance), if you wanted to pvp you went there. Huge battles etc but the rest of the zones were mainly left alone and no one camped flight paths etc. People trying to level were generally left alone as well. I think it's because no one really knew what pvp gave at the time, we just did it for the fun of it. By the time we learned about the OP pvp sets battlegrounds were already out so the battles at hillsbrad stopped and no one was really ganking anymore since all the pvpers were just spamming BGs. I'll come back to the game once BGs are released and I can farm and level my alts with just skirmishes here and there with people my level.
---
Jk people use spy, so you cant even stealth.
---
Dont stand in the fire!
---
Dinged 57 just now. Am undead warrior. What dungeons should I run at 57 or should i just quest in the plaguelands?
---
Did someone ask you about your opinion
---
Ok
---
What's this linked aggro problem he's talking about? I haven't experienced it.
---
Its a 50:50 chance to get the leaf or the eye.
---
The server is good, i moved from gehennas used to be in apes and i was very hesitant to move, but its good honestly.
---
Its like 55-45 or 60-40 at worst wich is fine tbh.
---
If you've killed 15 players you should have rank 1, maybe it's not done yet.
---
He’s making a joke, not a point
---
Bye then
---
So like a rolling reset or an individual reset on each person killed for 24 hours?
---
Anyone of those shows very suspicious data once you look more closely.
---
Some "medium" servers show triple population than some "Full" servers, doesn't make any sense.
---
That is why I don‘t understand why ppl are accusing honor trading... Who would let trade an entire raid for 2hk. Also if it was a trade they would let them kill more than 6
---
Whats the name of the energy tick addon ?
---
Umm, hearth??
---
I was right on top of them or really near them for all the kills that I didn't get credited though, I was CC'd and then someone else got the killing blow after I did a good chunk of their hp but no honor pts. One time I also did the killing blow(friendly warlock had dots on him) and no honor pts were given out. Not sure if this is bug or idk
---
Yeah, I did start about a month ago and still going up for fun :D was first on EU PVE RP server (Hydrian), but changed to Pyrewood Village, and seems much better.
---
oh found one of those blind blizzard worshipper sheeps.
---
Ranks are based on percentages of the total population that the game considers pvpers(15 HKs a week). More nerds pvping makes the brackets larger
---
I think anyone who's willing to play mostly PvP can get rank 11. It's rank 12-14 that you won't be able to get if you have a life.
---
Yeah I also remember doing like +/- 100 UBRS runs during vanilla on my warrior to get Draconian Deflector. :P
---
 
---
Also same here; only got 3/5 deathbone, but havent really focused on getting them (got those 3 the same run I believe).
---
I still like doing scholo though, but it’s getting a bit tiring when not getting a single lightforge head drop from over 60+ runs. :p
---
Yeah, but won't everything be more expensive on the alliance compared to the horde, which gives them a tougher time lvling professions etc, as they have less resource available.
---
and when they want to farm resources it will be much more of a pain in the ass.
---
&gt;Rep farm is something you kiss goodbye
---
Yes, especally in Silithus when AQ comes close. Most 60s will be in that zone during the dragon release to farm windstone bosses and those texts etc, but that will be a shit experience if the ratio is too skewed, for the less populated faction that is.
---
Ret pally is great at pvp.  I think youre assuming the pvp interaction is 1v1 or something, and thats not where they shine.  Its about group play, supporting and dispelling and offhealing, but also being able to contribute more burst dps than a holy prot pally.  No reason to add negativity but just sounds like thats part of your persona
---
I feel bad for him, but that was funny shit
---
I'm sure, my mana regens while I cast revive pet.
---
Blizz keep trying to gloss over this fact. Nothing about classic that is influenced by players mirrors vanilla because Blizz put 10 times more players per server to influence everything, they're essentially doubling down on their "You think you do but you don't" mindset by giving us a pseudo vanilla that's aggravated countless issues, probably so they can feel vindicated and say "See! We told you so!"
---
Ideally you want a fast off hand because it will proc more poisons, but damage is all that matters for main hand simply because your SS/backstab/hemo damage is based off of it
---
multiply your play time by \~5 and you will have my play time on just my main. I am not saying your opinion doesn't matter, just giving some perspective. And yes, I don't have much of a life. But good post.
---
I am blaming the women for thinking she could change the man's behavior. She knew full well what she got into. There is no hiding playing games 15 hours a day. 
---
I am not saying playing games 15 hours a day is good for him. But that's a whole different discussion.
---
&gt;retail player.
---
Is that supposed to be some lambasting insult? lmfao.
---
Where npc?
---
5 seconds before your GPU explodes
---
I completely agree. The way to deal with this issue should be an restart to roll back ranks of those who received it until the issue has been solved. 
---
The advantage is massive for a player with a PvP trinket, not only in combat but in the means of grinding honor more effectively. Everyone who achieved an rank this week should receive it at the same time.
---
If the current statement holds on how to solve this issue I will be disappointed.
---
Probs that their way is not how the game works.
---
Maybe read an introduction of wl and priest guides. This is easier and faster than asking reddit ffs
---
"I make poor decisions and complain about it to strangers."
---
If you play highly irregular I that will be a lot worse for you in the long run though. As in if you can only play every second week due to working off-shore or w/e but you play a lot the week you're off you will get 2x decay for every week you're able to gain example if you either gain 5k ranking points every week or 10k every 2nd week the 5k is better over time: 
---
    ((5*0.8)+5)*0.8 = 7.2  
---
    10*0.8*0.8=6.4
---
The mega servers exist because it saved them money.
---
sorry but wtf xD I never heard about a Warlock doing too much dmg....   
---
Most time I cant even see locks on details in my raidgrps

---
Ty!
---
Most dont doesnt mean you cant have them. Engineery caps at level 35
---
That's BS. PVP currently is just a clusterfuck of stupidity. Ever since P2 hit it has been extremely rare the time I have seen an alliance player alone in the world. Either I'm solo farming something and get swept by a group of 5+ alliance or I'm going to some other place and see a solo alliance player getting massacred by a group of 5+ hordes.
---
It's shit on both sides, the only pvp that exists is getting gang raped by a raid of alliance or watching an ally get gang raped themselves. Soon the game will be left to only the players that opt to play that way.
---
So if you're going for the "They have to do it" argument, the same could be said for horde.
---
Play a priest to heal and a warlock to DPS
---
Surely more people from the minority faction will turn to the other one than vice versa.
---
What does a Pristine Hide of the Beast go for on your server? I'm thinking about dropping skinning because it takes 3 damn inventory slots.
---
Locks are great in both PvP and important in PvE. Theyre easy to level thanks to pet and not many locks around. 
---
Priests are essential for PvE as heals but if you wanna go PvP i would recommend shadow priest who is absolute beast but.... it also locks you out of PvE as shadow priest are not usually taken into raids. 
---
If you wanna go only PvP or only PvE i would recommend priest
---
If you wanna do both on more competitive level then go warlock.
---
If you wanna play casually then play both for a while and decide what class you like more. I also recommend watching MadSeasonShow and his class videos
---
No they are not.
---
I only got 3 good world drops with a grp and we always did need before greed. And the winner equipped instantly every time.
---
Some Europeans who’s on Reddit too much get corrupted into the US mentality. But as a community we are for sure less greedy. Just look how different societies we have in the real world.
---
If you're looking to play Horde then Mankrik has the highest Horde pop for PVE. It's EST though
---
There is a reason symmetrical team PvP games (of which WoW is one) always balance the player numbers. It's because doing otherwise is universally regarded as shit design and would be expected to be fixed.
---
Apart from this one basic design rule they've broken, WoW's WPvP is great and I want to be able to engage with it all the time. Not sure why this makes me a bad candidate for a PvP server.
---
&gt;Doesn't blizzard keep any logs of this stuff?
---
If you do any IT work, you realise quickly that you do this once and you will be overwhelmed by users hitting you up for help over something that was your own fault.
---
Do you have the Blizzard authenticator app setup? WoW support multifactor auth before my bank did. Their security options seriously impressed me. And people took it upon themselves to not use, then expect GMs to help.
---
I think people just generally don't want to be steamrolled by characters that are 10 to 20 levels higher than them and also want to get to max level to actually enjoy the PVP more. 
---
That being sad, on Tuesday we had a skirmish going in thousand needles basin. It as 5 ally and 5 horde from levels 31-34. There as 60s watching us but not doing anything and it was so fun.
---
Umm, it's a joke???
---
What times. I'm always open to leveling on my spare time.
---
Where is Sekiro ?
---
If threat is an absolute issue for you, you can spec into MD/Ruin. You'll lose damage compared to SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin, and you'll lose instant corruption &amp; improved life tap. However, if you focus exclusively on dungeons &amp; raids with you guild, this might be a solution to your issues.
---

---
How do you marry someone and NOT know they play for 10-15 hours a day? If he has a full time job, how does he even have time for you if he plays that much, let alone have kids?
---
Fk. lol. Im at like 12 days, and still not 60. Pretty sure im mostly farming afk atm. though.
---
Mine has queue almost every single day with an pretty much 50/50 faction balance. Im pretty sure, its near cap. Yesterday, there was two 40man horde raids and an alliance raid wiped both in quick succession just in searing gorge.
---
Hope so - the advantage of the players who have the update (and PvP trinket) vs. people who are yet to receive it would be huge if it would last a day, both in combat and considering the effectiveness of the honor grind in general
---
At any time I guarantee you have more than 5 players of the same faction on your server wanting to PvP. If you spend time to form a real group you can compete.
---
Yo read it again. I didn't say you do AQ in dungeon blues.
---
Yea thats insanity :D  "YOU ARE LYING ABOUT WHAT YOU LIKE" yikes
---
Kk thanks!
---
&gt; Blizzard has made far more modifications to the game than private servers did.
---
Oh bullshit. We now know that basically all private servers didn't even get basic stuff like loot drop rates right.
---
Will do this!
---
Interesting havent heard of this spec
---
Lmao no, I just don’t come to reddit and bitch about “having to wait 18 hours” for a meaningless title. Tell me, how different is your gaming experience not having the Grunt title? Are you expecting to inspire fear? “I farmed lowbies for hours, where MY REWARD, BLIZZ?!?!”
---
You’re entitled. You’re only calling me a sheep because you can’t admit that video game accomplishments are the only thing that you have going for you in life.
---
Oh, I'm an idiot, of course I meant earthbind. The kiting method is nevertheless extremely good even on Classic, I wouldn't call avoiding about 35% of the mob hits 'near zero reward'. You usually exchange 1-2 mob hits for every hit.
---
How useful are mp5 and spirit for resto druids?
---
This personally lead me to quit FFXIV around level 57. 
---
Every dungeon was made the same and every boss was the same with different ground effects in the same arena. 
---
At the same time I played WoW WoD and our guild was fighting a boss in an arena that looked like Pacman and he would roll around it.
---
The use of the territorry is what made WoW so much better. Also FFXIV had so fucking long GCD
---
You should go 8/8 Beaststalker's.
---
ITT: A bunch of retail players who now suffer the consequences of rolling on a PvP server when they should have rolled on a PvE server.
---
That's rough, lol. I always fight Alliance attacking Horde, no matter what. Not because I feel morally obliged, of course, but rather because I want to see how long I'll survive.
---
I was so close to killing a 60 dwarf paladin with my 48 shaman yesterday. Probably the most intense fight yet. 
---
He was following around random Horde in Gadgetzan, killing a couple level 50s who weren't paying attention. I was about to go offline anyway, but wanted to try the Gnomish Death Ray first, so when I saw him walking towards his next unsuspecting target at the forge I ran up to him, blasted the Death Ray into the back of his head and tried to finish him off in melee. Both hits I was able to land were windfury procs and he was sitting at like 200 hp left, but then the guards killed me. What he didn't expect was me instantly using ankh and taking another swing... that turned out to be a miss.
---
Anyway, was a fun fight. Until next time, Castorius.
---
Jo WTF thats my name
---
I honestly don't know :0 I don't think so after we pulled this off. I've also been surprised with how many people obviously don't use the addon so it could have been extremely lucky or people just didn't expect two people to gank a 40 man raid.
---
My story: I played WoW from vanilla to Lich King back in the day on a pve server. I can only fire up Classic once or twice on weekday evenings for about 3-5 hours, on weekends sometimes a bit more.  
---
My journey in classic started 2-3 weeks after the release. All my friends already were on a pvp server, so I joined them there (Had to(?) if i wanted to play with them). At first I was very, very afraid, because I feared to be ganked all day long. This was not the case. Questing was possible in quite a normal fashion and most of the enemy factions players were ignoring me. I even started to enjoy the tension that unfolded, whenever I encountered a player of the other faction. There were fights, there were battles, I died quite a few times, but it was all in an enjoyable manner and scale and I still was able to go about my own business.  
---
I had reached Level 54 when Phase 2 dropped and since then questing wasn't an option anymore.  
---
But since it takes you about an hour to reach the entrance of BRD, dungeon farming isn't an option either at the moment, if you just have 3-5 hours to spare. Even if you have more time at hand, it just isn't very enjoyable to corpse run over and over again until you can continue "playing the game".  
---
I enjoyed re-living the classic levelling-experience and was looking forward to reaching 60 but at the moment I am stuck wondering what to do.  
---
In this reddit I often read "You should've expected this, when you rolled PVP" but I honestly didn't expect an escalation of this scale.  
---
Disclaimer: I don't want to whine, I don't want to complain, I'm just sitting here, wondering what to do. And I wanted to share my experience with P2. Maybe fire up Elite: Dangerous again? Also I'm a bit sad, that I can't play the game I enjoyed so much in the past months. \^\^'  
---
Plx don't shitstorm me.
---
Do spell hit chance affect "enslave demon"?
---
Maybe I was doing it wrong but I didn't go to BRD at 50 even in P1. You should be "enjoying" Sunken Temple for a level or two yet, my friend!
---
Nice wall hack add on
---
Reminds me of those askreddit posts, "What is your favorite video game (with or without saying the title)?" 
---
And WoW is rarely mentioned on there.
---
it will be fixed in their first patch, just like the key chain will be introduced in the first patch.
---
Just gotta wait a year for that patch.
---
What’s wrong with hating a warmongering nation that takes every chance they get  to celebrate that fact?
---
Scout Master
---
Plus it once and for all proves that there is value in a level of chaos. These overly designed games are missing something that's important for a lot of people. It also proves that people yearn for the bar to be set high. People don't care if it takes weeks of playtime to even reach 60, if it takes a million gold to even get your first mount, or in general a ton of work to achieve anything. It shows that they don't care that they are significantly behind the ones at the top, as long as what they did achieve means something. They don't care the they are still ages removed from 60 as long as their lvl 40 is an achievement of itself. We don't need these easy participation trophy games that hold back the dedicated so the lazy can keep up. It removes the meaning for everyone.
---
I hope this is gonna resonate with the industry.
---
I didn't mention anything I wanted change. I like Classic of how it is but I do understand there are flaws. It's far from perfect game but it is still enjoyable experience. No one could honestly say that Classic is perfect in all aspects. And we know nothing about future. What if they will end up doing "Classic+" and adding new things? No one knows yet but that can be one path forward as many people do like the idea.
---
Cool story, bro. This is thread #2035 about the exact same topic.
---
Your tank should be able to hold aggro assuming he tanks her in defensive and you don't crit several times consecutively.
---
What level is your alt? I’m 55 now because I’m semi casual and was overseas for the first month classic was out. I cannot land at a flight path in Felwood, Winterspring, Ungoro, WPL/EPL without being killed and corpse camped by 20+ players. It takes me
---
5+ deaths to get far enough out of the towns that I don’t die instantly on resawn. The further from town I try to level, I survive maybe 5 minutes before a roaming group of 5-10 players roll through and my corpse run takes ages. 
---
I played vanilla and leveled on numerous pvp servers, having 4x 60s on 4x different realms, and never had anything close to this experience. The only time I had a bad experience in vanilla was when I was 25-30ish trying to level in hillsbrad.
---
Clearly not alliance first... maybe alliance first on your server...
---
I see tons of people with titles on Mograine-EU. I still don't have mine. After relogging and restarting the game.
---
Blue plz.
---
Yeah. Also your own skillcap makes a huge difference lol. But hey, lets ask Reddit!
---
SWOTR is great if you pay the monthly fee &amp; treat it as a single player RPG
---
Extremely useful. The most important stats for sure in long fights.

Just dropping back by to say thanks again for for the rec.  That was a solid, fun, profitable little area.

The trash drops sell for a lot, and I got some greens that sold for almost a gold - which is a lot for my level lol

Guess that mean you can totally do it 😕
---
Well I'm on holidays rn so I'm pretty much down to play whenever from like 10am-10pm AEDT
---
Reread the title, I said whitemane server first alliance kill :P
---
A lot of resources will be roughly on the same basis since farmable in dungeons. 
---
This was obvious and expected from the very beginning for the alliance to be overwhelmed: free server transfer only worsened the situation. People strongly set on Alliance but not ready to be steamrolled on overall basis rolled on pve servers from the beginning.
---
Nug Energy and some weakauras most likely.
---
I'm sorry I wasn't fully accurate with that statement. Get down voted. You guys xD
---
Can anyone confirm that HoJ drops from Emperor and not Angerforge now, or that it still drops from Angerforge? Heard it would change who it drops from in p2, but atlasloot hasn’t changed the loot table
---
I regret to not go on a pve server.
---
copious amounts of drugs
---
Yeah Paladins have great synergy in group combat by being a healer that can spam their fastest heal ( which should be your most inefficient heal ) almost infinitely with no mana issues, and if they get focused being able to go completely invulnerable to all attacks and CC for 12 full seconds, and then applying a 6 second stun to a target.  Meanwhile your resto shaman bud gets focused and insta gibbed with no CC or ability to protect themselves.
---
Level 19 rotation.... jeez

Itd be cool if they either gave some sort of incentive to Raid cities or at least removed the DK from killing NPCs in major cities in some fasion

Horde bad
---
Oh no, I rolled PvP server to gank lowbies and now the horde are ganking me!!! Blizzard how could you do this to me?!?! I was supposed to be the one griefing, now I have to report all these griefers that are camping me :(((
---
The shield spikes,  can you please elaborate more as I am not sure how it works. 
---
Once a BS applies the the shield spikes, how long does it last? I know it will replace any enhance i put on the existing shield, so is this shield spikes permanent or it wears off after a certain threshold.
---
Leveling, I think Warlock might be very slightly better, but Priest is also easier to level.
---
PvP, they are both very good, Warlock is more intuitive and you have more buttons you have to press, Priests can more reliably heal up/assist enemies if needed (even as Shadowpriest)
---
In a 1v1 I would put Warlock and Spriest on pretty much the same level
---
For 1v2s I would say Warlocks are better
---
You will have a tough time to get raid-gear as a Shadowpriest, since the pieces you do need are shared between Warlocks/mages aswell.
---
People also won't prioritize a raidslot to shadowpriests, whereas Warlocks are very sought after
---
Link?
---
And that's game-breaking ? That's anti vanilla ? We're just gonna have to disagree there I think. Our points of view are just too different. As someone who doesn't take part in those ranking groups and mostly just corpse runs to dungeons while getting farmed 1v5 on the way, I couldn't care less about some people being able to know exactly how many kills they're going to get in front of BRD. That's, what, going to speed up their ranking a bit ? Does anyone care that much ? Is it really that important ?
---
You're wrong, stop trying. Meta has changed since vanilla. Not to mention 10x the amount of lvl60s around right now compared to 2005.
---
&lt;3

"Bud" is an abbreviation of "buddy", an informal term for "friend." "Bud" is also a slang term for marijuana

---
Fuck you. 
---
Have an upvote.
---
What loot system does your guild use?
---
Judging by the 100 similar posts, you are not alone. I think it will be fine if people keep posting and just wait.
---
I think they explained these spots to be 0,0 coordinates or something along these lines.
---
get over my dick bruh
---
Absolutely you should use every tool you can to win, if that is your goal. This is like using a certain spell that's deemed unfair in PvP and getting banned for it cause they'd rather take your money and slip some words into an agreement you have to consent to to use your purchase than take the time to fix the issue in the first place.
---
So when do we get a GOTY edition?
---
Not really...make love, not Warcraft came out Oct 2006, where BC can out Jan 2007
---
Because not everyone is a crybaby and most ppl knew what awaits them joining PvP
---
Which faction is the dominant one?
---
Hunter's Mark never states that it prevents the target stealthing, it just tracks stealthed targets.
---
Faerie Fire explicitly says it prevents targets from stealthing or turning invisible.
---
You can however vanish with Faerie Fire up, you just won't get into stealth (but useful for breaking roots/slows)
---
Your warlocks must be numbskulls then, warlocks are top tier dps’ers I have no problem topping the meters as warlock
---
true, I remember on my realm we had only wpvp on TM/SS, and even that was maybe 50vs50?. Very little outside of that. Leveling was not compromised. People just didn't know what they do now.
---
yes. use frost nova too cc them aswell.
---
EPGP
---
Omg that is my server I play on
---
We were behind the trees for the most part but alright... They most likely saw us but felt safe in their big raid group :)
---
You have two options now. Grab a pair of Edgemaster's to use with your Deathbringer or go for Vis'kag / Brutality Blade (both or either as mainhand with Mirah's offhand).
---
There are 1000 places to line of sight casters in BB, you can always escape.
---
But thanks for the teleporter tip! I Did not know.
---
thats Mr . Tigole Bitties actually
---
I assume it's on the GCD. Haven't actually checked (I'm at work). I'll give this a go then and see how viable it is.
---
I didn't argue the "meta" hasn't changed since Vanilla? In several comments here I even say that players have changed how they interact with the honor system, which results in far more PvP - but it doens't change the fact that we did honor raids in Vanilla too... we camped flight masters in Vanilla too...some of my fondest memories is Gadgetztan PvP trying to kill each other without attracting too many guards.
---
Around Brm for sure haha 😂 but every time I go through the bulwark a squad of stealth druids and rouges are ready to pounce :( 
---
Tbh it's super hard to find a 1v1 either way unless you go to farming locations like Legash camps, find some good fights there!

Just a side note - as a low level you will see him as ??, but you can still grant honor to him.     
---
48's are seeing 60's as ??, while 60's get honor for 48's.
---
Diminishing returns has always been here. As well as the "You're currently worth no honor" buff.
---
People dont care, they dont do it for the honor.
---
I leveled as Ele and could DPS just fine, as well as heal well, all the way to 60, as the gear needed is int/stam. 
---
If you are leveling together and are planning only instances, then go resto. if you plan on doing quests too, and are only going to play with the warrior, then I'd suggest going Ele/resto. 
---
If you'll play solo at times, the enhance is prob faster to level.
---
If you use Edgemasters, Deathbringer is insane, then you can pair it with corehound tooth, which overlay works our about as good as flamegaurd gauntlets, viskag and brutality (slightly lower dps overall than that, but you only need 1 more item if you just buy the Edgies).
---
I had a LOT of dungeon runs and most feel the same they felt in vanilla. Ppl are locking a bit more and do more specific runs, but that happened back then too.
---
If you avoid some grps it's still played with cc, every boss pulled even if the loot isn't worth it, and if you want that special boss for a flair loot they will help you 9 out of 10.
---
Edge masters are out for now, spent all my money on Lionheart helm so it will take some time for me to farm the gold (especially as Alliance on a Horde dominant server)...
---
There is a guy with 42 level 120 warriors and is now working on 8 max level warriors in classic.
---
You are fine :)
---
Horde are super sensitive right now. Say anything about PVP and they all freak out trying to defend themselves. Spergs.
---
50, spent the past two weeks going through STV, Feralas, Tanaris and the past week alone haven't really been bad? I just started Un'goro and the majority of enemy players seem to be wanting Devilsaur more than they bother with killing me.
---
I played in Vanilla and leveled on numerous pvp servers, having 4x 60s on 4x different realms and this was excatly my experience. The only time I didn't have this experience was when I played on a PvE server.
---
Yea, I cant even farm World drops since wpvp. F to my benediction
---
Friends mostly on if you want to pve or PvP really. Weapon skill is only really a big thing for pve.
---
Get Edgemasters asap. Combine with that axe it’s a very strong combo. And get whatever offhand you can. Brutality or Viskag it’s all good.
---
I was trying to kill an elite mob in the barrens when a high level night elf Druid wandered up. I had waited forever for this mob and said to myself “no... why... damn it.” Then he moonfired it, waved and ran off. Maybe not *all* alliance are scum...
---
Noice gonna try that I use zygor atm
---
Mk kid. Keep being a little shit that no one takes seriously.
---
I am definitely a 54 year old female cosplaying as a skeleton in a 10 year old game /s
---
That's true but like I said above, money is tight at the moment, also daggers would go to rogues for now as we had no luck with many weapon drops so far...
---
When you wanna impress the people on reddit with your binds but you have no idea what you are doing
---
Was able to get my hands on the recipe: Red mageweave gloves, yesterday. It has a low droprate. 
---
Will i be able to make gold out of this? 
---
The 10 int and 10+ to heal and magical spells seems interesting
---
On Noggenfogger all boats are camped. Menethil to theramore? Camped. Menethil to auberdine? Camped. Booty bay to ratchet? Camped.
---
There's always atleast 5 hordes. And they always fear/mc you off the boat and then kill you.
---
Sometimes they just MC you and jump off, just to prevent you from getting across.
---
Yeah, seems like I will have to grind for edgemasters now, thanks mate
---
Just because every little crybaby creates a thread about how bad the wpvp is doesnt mean it affects thousands in this kind of way. I think most people just literally deal with it since its part of the game. And one aspect is the guy who told you that with your solution, he wouldnt be able to play with his friends. So why is his issue less of a problem than being camped by the other faction. Oh wait, one is simply the result of a normal game mechanic and the other would be the result of blizzard restricting stuff.
---
That's funny, all the PvP realms I played on during Vanilla was Horde favored. Total characters created was indeed favoring Alliance in general, but there was no point where Alliance was hugely outnumbering Horde players across most realms.
---
You don't know how big the server populations are. You're lying right now and having nothing to show for your false claims. You don't know if the server populations are double of Vanilla, thrice of Vanilla or the same.
---
Retart
---
Never been so happy seeing hordes fuck ally like that
---
Far more interest in pvp and FAR more high level players, what could go wrong. lol
---
it already is in the game, the combat log has all the information/data you need to know.
---
So some people are able to buy the PvP trinket today but others arn't?
---
Seems fair
---
They were clearly mostly mounted, and felt safe in their cute little penguin huddle. I doubt many of them were ready for action. Silly conspiracy theories.
---
On my server its a common thing to look for "big dick healer". Maybe they looked for that too.
---
see thats why just go afk and waste 6 minutes, saving other possible victims
---
Herod's Shoulder - check  
---
Sword &amp; Board - check  
---
Orc master race - check  
---
Owning Alliance with style - check
---
This guy is a turbo chad IRL.
---
A rogue was camping the ZF entrance to cold blood ambush mages coming out to reset after their farm. I asked him what was the point since they have the no honor debuff for 30secs from the portal. He didnt really have a reason. He just wanted to ruin mages days lol
---
True. To die faster, lifetap as low as possible then hellfire.
---
You think it's fun to run around and not find alliance, only to run into one of the  five 10-15 man death squads? I get it, you guys are dying alot, but you can find a duo and go Merc solo rankers out in the open very easily
---
Just don't die 4Head
---
Issues with onyxia threat as a warlock. I know how this fight works i believe, and i'm aware she can't be taunted. In p1 i just wand with the occasional cast, to not waste my mana (or the healers, with life tap) and avoid building threat. When she start moving and p2, i go full dps on her. I stop using corruption at ~50% and slow down on shadow bolts. When she goes down, i don't damage her at all (i bandage and kill whelps if needed) to let the tanks get her in position and build threat. In this minute, it happens that i still pull aggro and die (worst case she kills multiple people too). I'm under the impression that other classes are using their abilities to lower aggro (feign death etc) pushing me up the threat list, blaming me for pulling aggro... Am i wrong? Is there something i can do to avoid this situation?
---
I'd assume people have blinked through it but maybe not. Enjoy it while you can :)
---
It's almost 100% using some form of assistance, whether it be exclusive rested levelling or mob tagging. Cool thread though
---
totally true, never take anything at face value. But then again, by now 9 times out of 10 when somebody does get named, I know one of the people doing the naming good enough to trust them on their word.
---
 **Zoomer** is a character spread on [4chan](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/4chan) mocking Gen Z adolescents and young adults, similar to how [30-Year-Old Boomer](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/30-year-old-boomer) is used to mock older [millennials](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/millennials).
---
I made a character on an RP server to check it out for a bit, I have noticed a lot of immersion breaking character and guild names. Do RP servers have their own naming ruleset in Classic like they did in vanilla, or is that not the case this time?
---
no problem! still check the AH cause i could be wrong, but from my experience there’s hardly any money in tailoring so only very coveted patterns (BiS gear, 16/18 slot bags) sell for anything worthwhile.
---
You were playing that 1v1 horribly anyways so
---
Why aren't you going with your group in the first place with the way phase 2 is ? And why is it huge ? It's huge because it stops you from dying once ? It saves 2 minutes ? And without it you couldn't just have walked to BRD, seen the 20 hordes, and backed away ?
---
I just seriously do not understand why anybody would care about that. It's a nice piece of info that changes a few things, but to say that it ruins world pvp ?
---
It could but it basically depends on how much your faction is farming honor. It's seem unlikely for now to hit r10 with 5hours a day.
---
Maybe when BGs are out and you join a good pre-made.

I dont like the spy addon one bit myself. But it is so far above and beyond any other addon I've encountered so far in its OPnes that you simply cant PvP without.
---
Ah. I'm 1998, not sure if that's gen z or millennial lol.
---
This is very helpful, thank you for typing it out.
---
I suppose I could indeed use some green BOE for extra spell dmg.
---
From last raid I ended up with sash of whispered secrets and nemesis skullcap, so I'm fine using those I think.

I think this chaos is sort of all alright, but I can't see how they can keep it going without releasing bg's early. Didn't only 6 weeks pass from the honour system was originally introduced untill BG's were released? There was a good reason for that. I'm assuming phase3 isn't coming in 6 weeks.
---
You're reading it wrong then. He specifically said "the game isn't fun, so play something else". That's not an advice, that's directly trying to state his own opinion as someone elses. That's why it's pathetic.
---
I don't agree with **your** comment that if something stops being fun, stop doing it.
---
I found BFA to be quite dull. Trust me, I tried. It felt empty and i certainly did not enjoy that azurite (nor the free legendaries for everyone concept). Game felt dumbed down to what I played in legion and MoP (wod healing was pretty much equal to classic).
---
&gt; It was never like this. Ever.
---
&gt; At no point in time were there roaming raids of 60s locking down all quest hubs.

This is what I replied to that he was lying. Please learn to read.

---
&gt; Killed the game of players above the age of 15.
---
That's why it's consistently one of Steam's most played games, right? Even had it's player peak sometime recently, IIRC.
---
Eh, warlocks arent that bad, they got ss and summons
---
I'm sorry, but if you're making this post you honestly have no idea how bad it is. 
---
10+ corpse runs just to do a dire maul is not what a PvP server isnot what the game is about. 
---
"You knew this was going to happen, should have rolled horde" - every horde player
---
This game is doomed to do in the next few weeks, and all you fkn horde fan bois just want to say this is exactly what was going to happen. Thank you for contributing to the demise of classic wow
---
Yeah incoming new wave of rogues camping gadgetzan.
---
its the trinket not title you spastic
---
these people that put in double the effort will rank much faster. it was more important to go hard this week than others b4 bgs. Now yoy know on your faction the serious grinders ie. the ones you want in your premade. they now also have the pool of players they need to msg and say hey stop at 145k honor this week so we can all get top bracket. You're a fool if you think these people wasted their time.
---
dont think it matters at this point as ppl just try and "insult" you no matter what gen you are from
---
Blizzard GMs are worse than Private Servers
---
It hasn't been even 3 months from the start of classic which life span is expected to be around 2 years or more. I doubt that's huge.
---
For 800 you could build a pretty good desktop that could easily run wow if you have a tv or monitor already.
---
Thank you for the clarification! Will put that asap on my shield.
---
What OP is saying is: when you've killed a warlock or shaman, go out of sight and then return to kill em again.
---
Im alrdy doing this if i feel like it. But some ppl might need a reminder that this is possible.
---
While playing and making decisions I very often find myself on the exact same spot making the exact same decisions like I did back then. I played the same char with the same professions and run to the exact same spots farming the exact same things, even though I didn't remember before doing it again, I clearly remember while doing it :)
---
For me, I play it mostly the same as back then, which is already how a lot of people play the game today.
---
The main difference is: While I managed to somehow stand out back then, doing the same now isn't standing out any more. More of the other players are also minmaxing with me being just one of them and not ahead the curve any more. The tactics I discovered and thought through in Vanilla are now common knowledge. I remember having huge fights with other healers telling them when I discovered for myself that downranking is a thing, showing them the math and they just kinda yelled at me being dumb and refusing to try it themselves. 
---
Now everyone does it. You have guides for everything but they don't cover the learning curve.
---
Please enlighten us how you hide playing games 15 out of 24 hours in a day. Or how you hide doing anything really for 15 hours a day because that means you're doing it for example from 7am to 10pm or every waking hour.
---
Do spell hit affect pickpocketing? If so, can one make a spell hit set to do pickpocketing runs in brd more consistent?
---
You sure there was any point in time  during vanilla where every single quest hub was locked down by raids of 60? :^)
---
Accurate lmao. I don't relate to any group of people anyway. 
---
2010s have been all about blanket generalizations though I guess...
---
i've been grinding since like 37 ... mostly find mobs that can lvl my leatherworking and go at them for 8 hours on a weekend
---
Next time you're raiding pay attention to your threat meter and make a mental note of how much threat a shadow bolt cast generates. You see the numerical threat value update each cast so just memorize it.
---
Here's what you need to know about threat: in order to take aggro away from the tank as a ranged class you need to be at 130% of the tank's threat. This means that you won't actually take aggro away from the tank simply by surpassing him on threat for just a moment. You need to actually exceed the tank's total threat by 30% before you aggro the boss.
---
It means that as long as you stay below the tank on threat you'll be safe. It's really that simple. Knowing how much threat you generate and knowing what the actual limits are. At worst you just stop casting for a few seconds.
---
It’s worth noting that guidelime is just the hi, you still need to load a guide into it. The default one is pretty good but there are definitely more efficient ones. It’s worth searching guidelime compatible guides and checking out a few. I rotated between a couple of different ones as I levelled.
---
From my experience ZT feels pretty even. Sometimes Horde controls FPs, sometimes Alliance.
---
BRM basically changes posession every 20minutes or so. Atleast that's my experience so far.
---
oH nO I hAvE tO wAiT a SiNgLe DaY tHiS iS uNaCcEpTaBlE
---
I'd rather not find that many ennemies instead of getting ganked by 5 different groups of horde players backpeddling like newbies meanwhile I'm trying to reach DMnorth.
---
You gotta experience these miserable situations to truely understand it.
---
Why did you roll...on a PvP server...if you weren't prepared to get ganked.
---
I played a PvP server for a while in retail back in MoP and it was still pretty bad. I remember having to do that exact corpse run stuff to get into BFD.
---
Side note, I have never played horde in 13 years of playing, you TOTALLY missed the mark on that one, friend. Better luck next time!
---
Oh wait I think I had a level 30 alt orc shaman...you got me, big ol horde fanboy!
---
Absolutely right and horde can then not complain about slow AQ gate openings on servers like Skeram.
---
Dont roll on a PvP server if you cant handle what comes with it :)))
---
I have no problems with aggro in raids, and in onyxia we find not applying corruption at 55% helps a lot when it comes to aggro as she lands for P3.
---
Instances... Just accept you're a tank bruh, I just like to watch my tanks and healers suffer, it's actually more fun to have banter about threat control in dungeons than getting upset about threat. But raids, you should have zero issues on nearly every boss, that's a tank issue if you're taking aggro.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Plenty of people love to help newbies out, on all servers.
---
Just make sure you roll PvE. For sanity's sake.
---
It's like the popped collar fad
---
Edgemasters or you Can trash the axe. + Wep skill is mandatory for a Fury warrior
---
Thats nice to see someone else doing those  kind of tactics ;) , the other day i took 2 mages with me , gave each a pair of goblin rocket boots and invy pot and we screwed away a pack of ally like you did ( around 9-10 ). I power infusion 1 mage and both was doing arcane explosion while i was spamming holy nova , one of the best laugh i had for a lonnng time ahaha Well played sir !
---
You may need some datas to back up your bullshit. Wow is a 16 years old game. 
---
Most of the people playing Classic have learnt to use binds.
---
But keep thinking you're part of these 10% elite players using binds lmfao.
---
Id say 8 Spirit 27 Healing
---
Before logging off I had done scholomance and then portaled to stormwind. After I died I wrote /pvp and it said "you are NOW flagged for pvp" meaning i shouldnt have been flagged from before
---
You clearly not married, trying to reason will get you nowhere
---
&gt; Before logging off I had done scholomance and then portaled to stormwind. After I died I wrote /pvp and it said "you are NOW flagged for pvp" meaning i shouldnt have been flagged from before. Idk its happened more times than just once
---
U have same sub for retail and classic?
---
Not really worth AoE-farming with blizzard until lvl 23 as you kinda need 3/3 improved blizzard for the slow.
---
Im sorry facts about the game mechanics upset you :(
---
PLUS ULTRAAAAAA!!!
---
It's pretty obvious when they invis pot ofc, and I've never seen people stand still in one spot in hillsbrad.
---
The real play is dying in a correct spot and reviving on top of them. Pretty expensive though since ideally you want a bunch of people with sappers or you risk dying too early and getting no honor.
---
This was about more than the punishment this guy got though. Others doing similar (some would say the same) things where not punished as harshly, not to mention the fact blizzard fired the casters and posted a statement claiming they would not let the pride of the Chinese nation be tarnished. That's a political statement and has EVERYTHING to do with supporting oppression and injustice, just because of moneyyyyy. I can absolutely respect you not seeing it that way, but it was enough for me to cancel my account and claim my data. Let's agree to disagree though.
---
The naming conventions still apply, you can report players for their name but I don't think Blizzard has been very rigorous with it. I see people level 60 with very obvious non-rp names and seen the same people not having to change their name over the course of playing.
---
TL;DR: The ruleset is still in place but Blizzard doesn't seem to put much work into enforcing it
---
Wow is great the way that you can play whenever you want and just let it go(except dungoens and raids) people are often friendly and there is a lot of ways to play it. Try it out!
---
Yeah, gear is ok, will try to go down that route, cheers
---
I think cast bars are more impactful when it comes to actually fighting.
---
What lol? Adding dual specs isn't going to suddenly homogenize everything like it is in retail lol. It just gives you more playstyle options, it doesn't actually change anything about the classes or do anything you can't already do, just without a ridiculous price attached.
---
I appreciate that, Christmas :)
---
Go stand where the tank stands in start of p3, also DL threat meter and set options to see "target's target" that way even if you die you won't kill anyone else
---
A thousand times this.
---
I know many people on ZT who are around lv40-45 and who just enjoy to RP now. They don't like to go questing or do dungeons or something. They just enjoy hanging out, making up small adventures with their friends. Like, getting a mount can be more than just clicking trainer, buy any horse and be done. It can be a rank up in status because horses are reserved for the higher-ups, it can be something personal like you grew up on a farm and return to see your favorite pony fully grown (Like Epona is Legend of Zelda)
---
WoW is versatile af. And i love it because of that.
---
there are some nice weakauras that do it, this is one i use [https://wago.io/c8AqTuJae](https://wago.io/c8AqTuJae)
---
Thought so as well, most likely the axe will be a placeholder until I get the swords, might just stack hit until I get them...
---
Yeah it will slow down soon, people get tired of it. Give it a few weeks and theres gonna be 50% less people wpvping.
---
Personally I will grind honor in a few months when BGs are out and many of the people who grind are done with their honor grind.
---
Now its just for fun.
---
What are you saying, you think they managed to convince that entire raid group to die to help them make a video? That is even more ridiculous than them just stacking.
---
What if it sends you to another PvP hot spot?
---
There's not many people leveling anymore, the experience is a lot more watered down now it seems to me. 
---
There's other things one could be doing with their life than play wow. If you don't want to essentially level an alt it might not be worth it for someone. I have a lvl 54 char and a 60 and if I had to abandon the 60 I'd just quit tbh.
---
Anyone else notice there's no source for that quote?
---
More like 1k
---
I have had similar experience on my alts with similar level goon squads and squading up to take them out. 
---
I get it you dont want to be steamrolled but it is apart of the system. That no honor, slimy killing for the sake of it all.
---
Rice
---
Unyielding Maul is better than staff, you can counterweight and ele sharpening stone it and they are functionally equivalent otherwise
---
Depending on costs of Stoneshield Cloak look into crafting Cloak of Warding. It's better, and you can farm the giant stones if they are too expensive. On my server it runs around 80g for all the mats
---
Your mount is the most important thing. I crafted Breastplate of Bloodthirst over epic mount, and I dont regret it, but it was certainly a suboptimal decision. You simply make more gold with an epic mount
---
Always expect a rogue ANYWHERE now. It's simply how the class is supposed to be, sneaky little fuckers.
---
Onyxia can often be a bit of a mess sometimes and it's all about transitioning aggro to a tank in phase 3, which determines whether you will wipe or not. Our guild has been able to one shot her fairly consistently now. Your best bet without any ways to drop threat is to either try to get aggro in phase 2 so that she fireballs you and wipes your aggro before phase 3 or at least be in the tanking position so that transferring her over will go easier. There will be dps that die in phase 3, it's not a big deal. Better to go north by the tanking position and die than to wipe the whole raid
---
I feel you may be a perfect candidate for my suggestion. 
---
Maybe even try a low pop server.
---
Minesweeper has Co-op mode
---
In BGs cast bars will be more impactful. However currently pre fight conditions are a lot more important to stick around or to bail.
---
If you see 10 people riding up in your spy and you are around in your 3men PvP squad you bail immediately. 
---
Getting found out of position with your elemental shaman in the front line is a 100% loss against a good 5men alli ganksquad.
---
Numbers &gt; skill in 90% of wPvP encounters.
---
He said, in a whiny comment.
---
In hillsbrad? There are way to many random players there to stage something like that. They would want to stay out of sight.
---
I actually thinks it kinda was like that, at least for me.
---
omgawwwd, that's literally me! I just love the sound of their scream, it just brings me so much joy. I can sleep tighter at night just knowing that these Lowbies' gaming hours been ruined. Can't wait to do it again for the entire day tomorrow again!
---
Exactly, this isnt retail. The PvP system in classic is pure dogshit, but we asked for it and we got it. now deal witht it. Its no wonder people dont get it, cuz the system is yeah.. dogshit.
---
In regards to tanking, we're playing on 1.12.
---
Pre-1.12 paladins had the super-weird Seal/Judgement of Fury system, which was very unreliable in 5-mans.
---
1.12 got rid of Seal of Fury, and introduced the much simpler Righteous Fury - a selfbuff that increases threat dealt by all holy damage by 60% (90% when specced).
---
This means, that with 11 points in holy for Consecration, you pretty much only need to press one button to generate more than enough multi target threat to keep the healer safe. You then autoswing the main target with SoR, and judge it when you need threat spikes.
---
Add retri aura for extra multi target threat, and eventually Holy Shield (if prot specced).
---
All in all, *as long as you get a clean pull*, multi target threat is awesome and single target threat is allright.
---
So if your group is ok with letting the tank pull, and if they're ok with allowing you to use LOS pulls to group up mobs - then honestly 95% of fights should be super clean. The other 5% are mobs with aggro resets (no taunt) and pulls with multiple casters and no good LOS-option. Oh an obviously you're low on panic buttons, but again - this is the 1.12 easy mode patch, so lacking those isn't that much of an issue pre-raid.
---
Given the tank-shortable, you honestly shouldn't have issues getting groups.
---
All of the above is for 5-mans. For raiding, 99% of paladins are healing.
---
Luckily, you can do a really solid heal/tank hybrid. There's a healing focused 31/20 build with some tanking on the side. There's a tanking focused 20/31 build with pretty good healing on the side - and finally the \~24/27ish PvP healing spec that honestly still does a pretty good job as a PvE tank/healer, while being absolutely top notch as PvP support.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Must have been unlucky on rolls, i made maybe around 150g getting FULL pre-raid bis on my priest
---
Well considering Spy doesn't work in BGs at all (assuming they make combat log BG-wide like it is in retail), yeah other addons will be more impactful for sure.
---
True, it's very instrumental in picking the right fights, though in most zones with max camera zoom you can already seem enemies reasonably far enough.
---
Could be that he bound his naga/mmo mouse keys like that. That f6 resonates with button 6 etc
---
So does does the racial of +5% intellect apply to your total int unbuffed and naked? Or unbuffed + armor?
---
The clickbaty nature of the video name and the picture stopped me from even clicking "Play".
---
You are damn right sir
---
&gt; Don't like it?
---
Roll horde or git gud. Same principel.
---
Basically DKP
---
This is also an option. For some people classic is just not for them and that is fine stop investing time into something you are not enjoying.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
I sometimes feel bad for alliance combat swords rogues cause they have to share viskag drops with warriors
---
Sometimes strength is the only choice we have. Life doesn't always turn out the way we imagined, but it's truly beautiful when there are people to enjoy it with, regardless how bad it gets. Tonight is one of those sleepless nights where it's quiet and I've already logged off. Instead of turning inward, I'm trying to reach out. You'll make it through. :)
---
Was probably too hard for the judges.
---
60 geared Mage arcane missile : crap
---
Lvl60mobs arcane missiles : destruction
---
The addon also tracks buffs already applied 20mins ago. The combat log can be dead silent and spy will still flip out. That's why people flying overhead which you then click and have a blue health bar and still shown.
---
ZT is such a nice experience. The horde pvp is kinda disorganized but everyone is nice. On horde sides there's sometime a bonefire going on at crossroads in the evening, sometimes I go and attend it, a nice calm RP telling stories and what everyone has been up to.
---
Death squads of 40 ppl spawn killing solo players everywhere isnt "pvp". It's mob farming. Gets old really quick.
---
you mean, no nochanges. :)
---
I checked every box in combat log options and these old buffs definitely show up.
---
As mentioned, depends on the class and whether you're doing pve/pvp content. If you decide to pvp you'll be making use of a large amount of your skills. Generally pve is 1 or 2 buttons for most classes. Hunters are considered to have a more involved rotation and that's still just weaving aimed shot and multishot between autoshots
---
Yeah, being slightly less effective for a few hours on a 10+ week grind is clearly gonna ruin the ppl getting it laters chance to gain higher ranks... It's a marathon not a sprint :P
---
I thought so /u/typed-talleane
---
Awesome stuff :)
---
Your impatience to play on a server with no queue is now your downfall. Reroll
---
That’s great news! I would much rather farm angerforge than emperor for obvious reasons
---
"Usually that person gets shamed and ignored" So childish. I bet they flame peoples for res item too ? Everyone do their group like they want. Need on epic BoE prevent ninja and everyone has a fair roll.
---
At 6 Am on a Wednesday.
---
Who do pvpers go hord tho? Is it like related to the agressive look of undeads / players mindset or just for better racials?
---
Shocking people aren't playing on a Wednesday at 6 AM.
---
He's not entirely wrong, but back then they pushed the BGs out fast because of the complaints...so they should do the same here.
---
So you're saying #nochanges fucked things up...because it inspired Blizzard to make changes that fucked things up.
---
Got it.
---
So stupid these people who were calling out others for rolling PvE at launch cause its not authentic Classic and so on now want transfers lmao , just re-roll and stop whining its sad , i don’t believe that was possible back then and shouldn’t be now .
---
its also nice that blizz and clueless people can blame any shortcomings on \#nochanges no matter what it is even when they dont even follow nochanges anymore.
---
My what? I chose this server because my irl friends chose this one
---
This sounds 100% like your dots are causing your aggro in the phase 2 -&gt; phase 3.
---
From my knowledge, her aggro is wiped when she lands at the beginning of phase 3. If you have any lingering dots on her, you'll definitely be on the top of her list. 
---
Make sure your dots (and raids) are off when she lands!
---
Good luck!!
---
Yeah that 80/20 balance is just gonna magically vanish?
---
In ancient China, they halted technology advances around glass because they were so content with their China pottery. It's one of the reasons the Europeans and Middle easterners overtook them in areas like optics. 
---
I feel this is the same situation, but for MMO's. 
---
Imagine making a game so good, that you ruin an entire genre for what will probably be 20+ years.
---
No game to my knowledge has ever done this. The closest was probably Witcher 3, but that made RPG's unplayable for me personally, it had no impact on the genre as a whole. 
---
I for one cannot wait for the breakout hit that usurps WoW. If the criteria is that it has to be better, this theoretical game is going to be mind blowing.
---
Dreadmist is 40/60 hord, as ally you cant move in open world lol, theramore and menethil are hord now etc. We live in a cruel world
---
Did I write scatter&gt;FD&gt;&gt;trap&gt; aimed?
---
No I wrote a kiting tactic. Scatter&gt;trap will give you a DR down to 7 seconds. I scatter instantly only to make sure warrior can’t apply hamstring.
---
I don’t need more then 7 seconds to get out of charge distance.
---
You do not need the other cards as well? The blue or red ones?
---
private servers didn't usually have honor system without BGs.
---
Compared to other servers that I have characters on this one is exceptionally dead tho. Which is a shame as it has my main on it
---
Do you like making unsubstantiated claims or something?
---
Unplayable!
---
Fuck up once and get in range of intercept and ded
---
I think by that point, especially for someone who is new and casual, it'll have died out by the time they reach those levels and BGs will either already be out or soon be out
---
I dont pvp. So that doesnt bother me.
---
Unrelated but I can't help but ask why is your boyfriend called Second?
---
how would I know what is balanced though?
---
Very nice hord place tbh.. i prefer theramire island but yes
---
How do you fuck up holding down your movement key?
---
You don't understand what I am saying. "Lol".
---
not in germany
---
If you dont stack hit your dps won't be the best, but it'll still be fine. If your not a min-maxer just go for it, if you want to raid with some urber min/maxer guild group though you might have some problems.
---
Do you play on a PvE server? Lol. I play on Arugal and see the dock camped all the time. I've walked into 5-6 stealthed rogues on the dock more than once, let alone groups that exclusively sit on the boat.
---
fuck sake i want my pvp trinket why did i farm this 120k honor aaaaaaaa
---
Totally agree, too many snowflakes that get upset that someone killed them for honour rewards in an "unfair" way.  Like dude it's always unfair, doesn't mean it isn't often fun too.
---
The actual hall is instanced. He's just behind the portal in Orgrimmar.
---
HoJ will be added to Emperor's loot table in phase 5, with a high dropchance. Until then it only drops from Angerforge with a 4% chance. 
---
It will still drop from Angerforge in phase 5, as well as from emperor.
---
We know that realms that are "medium" now are the size of "full" realms in vanilla.
---
We also know approximately how many lvl 60 players that are raiding(valuable info for the lvl 60 pvp pool) and have a pretty good overview of how the servers looked a month or so ago.
---
Non world buffs that do the same thing shouldn't stack, melee gets a huge advantage over casters/hunters because firewater/juju does nothing for them.
---
But mongoose not stacking with world buffs? That seems very strange.
---
You don't get shaman prio as a warlock
---
Big F to the guy that rolled greed
---
Honestly didnt know that. 
---
Then again I'm a scriptkiddie asking guildies for weakauras and copying stance dance macros from forums without really understanding them.
---
Noy whining or anything but have one question. Why do guards are useless lvl40 squishies in cities ? Put some elites to guard the boat lol !
---
NPCs are relying too much on players...
---
I tried Horde RP before on Hydraxian Waterlords but i just didn't get into it. Rerolled Human Mage on ZT and have a stable and large RP group of new friends now. It's been a blast. Weekly taverns in Stormwind, getting drunk and hanging out with friends.
---
Glad to hear there's Horde RP aswell. never had an image what it would look like. Guess it's all a bit more rustic due to lack of furniture in Inns and Taverns.
---
/wave when you see a female human mage around BRM :)
---
Dude I'm having it bad out there and I'm in 5/8 nightslayer with gutgore. There's just sooo many more horde due to faction imbalance. I can bring a 40 man to somewhere, anywhere and within 10 min 80 horde will show up. If I'm solo there's 10 different 50 man squads roaming each zone. 
---
It takes 45 minutes to get into MC! Getting to BRD no matter the day or time is a long, long chain of corpse runs. It's not like ally control it sometimes we don't.
---
Oh okay, thank you for clearing that up
---
giv pls
---
Warlocks will always have a threat problem in vanilla, and its probably the sole reason as to why mages are considered superior in vanilla due to better threat reduction talents.
---
However, in certain raids it shouldn't really matter like MC in perticular.
---
It will be a problem on Ony and BWL tho, so just be careful as your crits can wipe the raid instantly.
---
Spy at it again. Am I the only person without it simply on principle?
---
Is your MT by any chance a fury tank? I seen a few forgetting HS so their threat is lacking to deal with spikes.
---
Whitemane also had two in a row
---
&gt; The game is literally unplayable right now
---
Works fine here.
---
&gt; unbalanced servers will not be able to survive with the current population
---
Not an issue, rerolling is free.
---
&gt; I have played PvP servers since vanilla
---
Then you should know better.
---
&gt; the current state of the game is beyond anything I have ever seen. 
---
Welcome to classic in 2019, it was what we all predicted would happend.
---
&gt; The retail community that has flocked to classic and has essentially ruined what was so great about this game
---
Im gonna stop reading here, youre obviously wasting everybodys time.
---
i dont think you can see the buffs , except the enemy casts something like FAP (Free Action Potion) and it appears in your combatlog. Then an Addon probably can track these.
---
the banana clown set
---
The elite dwarves in brd have better loot than ZF. But the Nonelites you find in e.g. The arena or grim guzzler have the same loot as ZF
---
I saw it coming still picked alliance...  I don't follow the crowd of betas just because the internet says horde has better racials for PvP.  Every poll showed horde imbalance before they even released the game.
---
Thank you will check it out!
---
I think first transfers factionbased (e.g. High Horde to Low Horde Pop Servers )  will be available soon(tm).
---
Least he didn't target you while you were behind the tree using spy.
---
Bye bye have a nice time
---
I don't think you understand what dual spec is.
---
u both suck, none of u used demo shout.
---
Start an alt on a PvE or RP server until the fuss dies down
---
That's what people who feel like this should do.
---
It's not any type of statement other than obvious.
---
😁
---
If it's getting you down, change the environment
---
Again that shows those awards are 100% meaningless lol
---
Or your post is just useless and just adds to the wpvp spam.
---
Yeah, but shamans have windfury totems.
---
So unless you have an abundance of shamans, its better to put them in the melee groups.
---
You can do 1 sham + 4 warlocks or whatever, but it depends on the set up.
---
EIther way, warlocks will have threat issues. But it shouldn't be a problem with a proper tank
---
Does anyone know what the max pvp ranks are by level?  
---
For example: lvl 19 is capped at rank 3. Can't find a good source for later levels. Curious about 39,49,59 specifically
---
So this seems like an adaption from a commentary for rick and morty I guess? Can someone link the original one pls?
---
I'm levelling a warrior alongside a friend playing a priest. We're looking to tank 5mans as well as quest together. 
---
What spec should I be? Currently going down arms using a 2h.
---
these people have never played a hunter
---
Flashback!
---
Yes, the first raids were long - until we found the shortcuts :)
---
Rest in Peace Aradune.
---
Damn looks like I’ll be passing on it :(
---
However, i think it's impossible to instantly see all the enemy buffs. It's only buffs that were applied during the time you were around them.
---
It's up to the player to reroll or not. It's perfectly possible to play the game as it is on any server, any inconveniences are something people were warned long ago.
---
Dynamic spawn lul.
---
Don't worry already have. 
---
I'm sure you'll be one of the first to complain when you're on a dead server.
---
it's a realistic explanation.
---
But also, GM's used to be recruited from MMO players, they cared. Now it's just outsourced people from all over the world, who have 3 helpdesk jobs a week.
---
Reroll, transfer, (if available) accept the fact classic isn't for you and go back to retail, quit wow altogether or adapt to the situation and play classic: there are plenty of options.
---
This is not an unpopular opinion. if it was, this post would've been taken down or downvoted to hell or even both lol
---
Hasn't revenue gone up and up with every expansion?
---
Keep going arms. It's the best spec for tanking and dps until raids.
---
You're*.
---
the hunter didn't use scatter shot, freeze trap or his pet stun, absolute waste of a feign death. warriors are like paper in rock paper scissors, hunter being scissors, this guy is a total noob
---
Except current retail wpvp is a laggy ass mess.
---
The guy in the clip literally backpeddled as well as opened his bag to click/eat food.
---
C-C-C-COMBOBREAKER
---
How can he see
---
ya trying to figure out lowest level for rank 11
---
Well, there’s only two of them.  And they have more obligations than I do, they don’t get a lot of time to play much anymore, so I’ve out leveled them and reached max level.
---
I play on Pagle. 
---
A few folks set up 40v40 in different areas of the world or 10v10. 
---
Lots of folks on both sides seem to get into the fun then turn off pvp and go back to farming herbs or mobs for gold and cloth. 
---
If you want wpvp you can find it.  Its not as bad as getting camped for days on end. Or getting jumped while at a FP, though some areas were targeted for picking fights (southshore).
---
No, you are just pathetic assholes who kick people mid-fight, because "they're noobs". Fuck you and your guild, loser.
---
I should easily be able to tank her as a warlock? You mean by using a LIP?
---
It never was a sport in this case. It was also very easy to predict with layering. Why do you think some people were against layering in the first place, and wanted more servers instead that eventually could merge? If you rolled on a high pop pvp server - and didn't forsee this, they you are simply dumb. Blizzard also thought this would happen, the eventuall decline in players, and that's what were seeing now.
---
This subreddit cracks me up. Dozens of duplicate posts with [valid] complaints? Thousands of upvotes and comments. An actual acknowledgement of the complaints by Ion? NYEHH
---
As an alliance git gud, go to retail, or roll pve! Faction imbalance was always going to be a thing and this is what it was like in vanilla, I was there so I was ready for this. As soon as bgs are released it will die down trust me.
---
Rofl get Spy’d.
---
Rang 4. No regrets
---
I logged in to r4 and i had alot of fun... alot. Opinion is nothing more then opinion. Guess what buddy you arnt gonna quit and they know it
---
So much this, EQ was such an amazing experience.   So many memories, including Brad and the SOE brass losing their minds because their favorite pet the sleeper was being slain!...   Good read if you've never heard of it.... RIP Brad, thanks for the good times!

Once you hit T2+ the R14 gains (dream world gains, because almost nobody will actually manage it) become smaller and smaller too and non existent quickl. So they'll feel less need to try and get that gear. Ass candy for e.g is a higher DPS weapon than R14 equivalent.
---
I use elvui classic and find that I dont need much else. 
---
Not sure if you have checked it out.
---
If you want to do more damage than wanding but less damage than spamming shadow bolts, you could always downrank your shadowbolt.
---
If you want WPVP on PvE, you go to Hillsbrad, where there are plenty, because thats the designated area to do it. You rarely, if ever see it besides that. And I only saw one or two leveling 1-60, prior to phase 2.
---
TL:DR  - im playing on a pvp server and i am regretting it .
---
I'm still wondering. Do the +100HP enchants show up, because they are considered buffs by the game? Afaik blizz confirmed they count towards an apparent 32 buffcap.
---
Lmao get Spy’d
---
Another diary must from a self important prick who thinks we care.
---
this seems to be the best reply so far. I do have a threat meter, and it does really weird things on onyxia (as in my OP).
---
I have checked that out, but I don't like the looks of it. I want modui, like in the video, because I like how clean it is.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. I'm just saying that's why it's not game of the year material.
---
Well you can take solace in the fact that any sort of group greater than 5 is getting trash honor and won't keep zerging around (haven't seen many at all in the last 3 days). If you're going to BRM or any of the obvious spots as a small group, you're fucking up and will get brutalized
---
Hunters who do solo diremaul tributes, how possible do you think it would be to do 2/dual hunter tribute runs?
---
Your husband Primeiro should be so proud...
---
I'm level 54 and play time 8 days and 4 hours. Haven't played in a week because kids have been ill. And now that I've spent some time in this subreddit  I'm too afraid to log in and grind the last levels. :| Such is the solo warrior's life..
---
No, enchants and all other passive auras do not appear in the combat log.
---
But you guys told me we think we do but actually do???
---
Yeah seriously. They're already top DPS, but then in a raid you often have a shadow priest which gives all the warlocks an additional 15% damage on top of that. Not uncommon at all for all of our warlocks to finish in all of the top spots after a fight in MC.
---
Excuse: not on PvP realm
---
I've been talking about how much the imbalance would fuck up P2 but people just told me to stop bitching.
---
Because her husband is called Primeiro...
---
7 days /played is no joke. I'd quit.
---
What were they supposed to do? Let it despawn? Why the fuck would they? Why the fuck would you want them to do this?
---
They didn't ninja anything, they were the lucky benefactors of a bug. Which you caused by being assholes. They couldn't have given you the loot if they wanted to, so why bitch about it?
---
U award honor. Theres ur answer
---
Tanking shamans are a thing. With proper gear and group setup can even raid tank. But if you're there as melee dps you should not roll for your off spec.
---
But your missing the point, the game is not sustainable in some servers in its current state.
---
Yes I am the minority, but this is a game of 2 factions. Without the other faction, servers will die.
---
Yeah, you hit the nail right on the head.
---
Just makes 4 assholes then I suppose
---
This is clearly a conspiracy by Blizzard because they hate Alliance players. Wake up, sheeple!
---
Most people started after launch and at various points so everyone will have had a different experience. There were times in vanilla when it was like this and times when it wasn’t.
---
Calculations please.  
---
Also consider the brackets you are in and competing against.
---
Without showing your formula, or linking to the source , this is useless
---
His twitch is in the video description. Try going to his stream and asking him, assuming no one here can tell you.
---
Even better, the bottom of the great sea.  Azeroth would be rank 14 in a day.
---
Scientists agree it is spelled "WEEWOOWEEWOOWEEWOO" although it can vary by country.
---
Alliance are the stronger faction in terms of balance for pvp, paladins are FAR better than shaman for group play. Horde facials are a noob filter.
---
You know, I'm not sure. I guess the best way to find out is to ask, right? :)
---
Man, Wildstar really could have been amazing. I enjoyed the ever-living hell out of it for two months, but as you say: management drove it into the ground. At least I met my best friend in that game!
---
Mostly just tarren mill and south shore at the moment but yeah there were at least 3 raids from both sides going back and forth. It was pretty damn fun.
---
&gt;Horde, outnumbering alliance on all pvp servers at least 65-35
---
Where do people take these stats from?
---
I wasn't, i got up to rank 10 back in vanilla and got frustrated because the honor system rewards time investment and calculated battleground dodging more than skill. I missed a lot of the raids and instances because I didn't know some even existed while I leveled and add I got higher all I did was PVP. Now I get another honest chance to try everything out. I actually never ran Deadmines until classic.
---
I think it will calm down as well. The imbalance will ofc remain but now huge percentage of the population at lvl 60 are out hunting for WPvP. In a week or two many of them will settle down with and go back to farming and whatever. But since there is still incentive to kill the player of the opposite faction there will be more WPvP than before p2 and you will still have those people going for r14 that won't slow down at all.
---
You cast Detect Magic ofcourse.
---
How can i get my map to pop out like this? Addon?
---
If you can find some of the aquatic mobs to grind and the price of golden pearls is high on your server, that can be good. Like the murlocs or Naga or something, there are millions of them in azshara.
---
Tried that also, he hasn't streamed for one month and he doesn't have addon command in his chat :(
---
Thanks though for the input!
---
use realm transfer, or stop complaining.
---
k thx bye !
---
If he PoM firestuck then cone nova arcane exploded then I bet you they all would have died.
---
Because the same nochanges people we arsking for 10k servers
---
What would be the point?
---
fake, real gamers dont waste time in the outside world
---
Does he still have my wallet?
---
No
---
50% or more of the leveling process is just grinding disguised as quests anyway. You can definitely level this way. Maybe look up quest rewards for your class to see if there are any that are worth doing a quest or 2 to get along the way though.
---
Except they won't die at all? One-faction servers existed since the introduction of transfers and people there were fine. By the point every single alliance player unsubs or transfers out, Blizzard will release BGs which are cross-server since they expected this outcome.
---
No. I personally think no MMORPG is GOTY material simply due to the nature of the genre.
---
But Shadowbringers certainly deserves a reward for its narrative. It's the most Final Fantasy of the Final Fantasy games released in the last decade. I rarely felt this interested in a storyline/lore of a game (last one being the Soulsborne games. Thanks youtube!) and the last one before that being God of War). Not to mention the only MMORPG whose lore I was interested in was WoW and that mainly because I played it for years on a daily basis for hours.
---
You really think those players who died "suck at pvp"? Looks like most of them were AFK. I don't even know what to say to you if you think this mage could 1v12 any of them in an even slightly more serious setting. It's not like this mage had a grand display of skill either.
---
You're using a clip of a perfect storm situation to say that people shouldn't complain about faction imbalance.
---
I thought so, but couldn't remember for sure. Thanks!
---
This was a great read and reminded me why I've always loved online gaming. I have some friends that live a thousand miles away that I've gamed with since I was 15. We're all grown up now, they're all married with kids, full time jobs, but we still run an active discord and try to put aside time every month to get some gaming in together. I talk to them more than I talk to any of my "real life" friends. 
---
As I've gotten older I have cut a lot of toxic people out of my life, including online people. I don't enjoy being toxic and putting people down, I don't enjoy being around toxic people that are putting others down, even if its not me. I try to be positive because you never know what others are going through, and being kind and lifting people up is free. Thanks for reminding me what this is really about. If you happen to be Kromcrush horde shoot me a message, i'm always looking for friendly people to dungeon/pvp with.
---
&gt;dynamic content
---
Yeah, you can get instakilled with no recourse by a pack of rogues when dismounting a flight path, exiting an instance or just walking to town. Dynamic!
---
The situation you describe in the last paragraph is basically fiction, it never happens.
---
Yeah, cool ? I mean, glad that you choosed your game experiencr according to your likings but are you actually trying to make yourself look smart for that  ?
---
You have no facts regarding the server capacity. Liar.
---
Ok zoomkin
---
&gt; Gnomes have a bit more intellect to base, which is nice fore sure. And they can once a minute break movement, which can be reapplied immediately
---
How do u end up mentioning the most broken racial in the game in a like "oh yeah also they can break roots". Like bruv. That shit broken on melee's.
---
only mindflay afaik
---
It’s melee crit. Spell crit is separate, and will say so.
---
Turns out most people, in fact, never played vanilla. Their "vanilla" experience probably comes from one of those pservers.
---
I mean it’s a job. It’s not like they are giving them admin privileges on a minecraft server.
---
They can’t just make them sign a contract, like most industries do when you handle sensitive information / have admin privileges.
---
I could theoretically disable every user account the public healthcare system uses for their EMR-system in my current work role. It would track back to me and I would be sued for a hefty amount of money.
---
Sorry, I couldn't be more obviously sarcastic even if I tried.
---
Roll on a PvE server. You can then decide when and where to PvP.
---
Seems like there are some users living rent free in your head
---
Winterspring? Felwood? Feralas? Tanaris???? 😂😂😂 Gl questing there without getting farmed by horde death squads
---
Jesus dude it was a random food drop
---
&gt; Tauren get 5% HP and gnome get 5% intellect which are about equal. 
---
? what lol. How's 5% hp in anyway equal to 5% intellect. You're not even picking tauren for tanking. Troll will be better for aggro.
---
We got a rank 2 grunt in here fellas
---
I don't know your class but I hope you can heal. Healers are always necessary in Classic raids and I am sure guild at server scarced for population will always be happy for another one joining the roster.
---
Phew
---
The difference is back in Vanilla players actually took pride in these things. You are seemingly at a disadvantage now, it's obvious your faction community sucks because`````````````````````````````` they aren't protecting you. 
---
Classic isn't Vanilla. But it could be depending on the community.
---
In case you can't find a working version, you can achieve a similar and clean setup with Bartender (set these up, change alpha-&gt; 0 to make them invisible), Shadowed Unitframes (SUF) for clean player/target / party bars, can add class portraits if you want, Quartz, ClassicCastbar, your favourite scrolling combat text addon + whichever addon does the debuffs over enemies' heads. Add in Grid2 if you need minimalistic raid frames. 
---
I tried ElvUI too, but hated how it revamped everything and wasn't to my liking even after I spent a few hours disabling half of the stuff and configuring the rest to be less intrusive and clogging.
---
I wouldn't say it is *toxic*, but it's definitely not healthy
---
We don't know the guy's mental health state.
---
I am in a ridiculously similar position and gaming is my escape from my depression - it's not ideal and it will likely end my relationship of 5/6 years - I'm in counselling for the cause, and gaming is a symptom
---
Lol as gnome mage i know i have like 5secs to kill before the clones army of UD rogues pops from behind trees lol.
---
Probably because the only spell they ever used leveling to 60 was blizzard lmao
---
would guess they havent dubbed them whales themselves, just stolen the term from poker.
---
guess he's gotta wait then.
---

If only there were transfer to PvE servers. I don't want to start all over again.
---
You are not on Flamelash. All fps are camped by hordes, we cannot even take the boat are there is always a horde squad on it. Every medium city like menethil, darkshire, southshore are invaded by hordes. Every ally that wants to reach brm has to die 10 times on the road. The population on this server must be something like 60:40 for horde minimum.
---
Burning steppes is full of hordes parties of 3 - 5 players ganking every ally that tries to go to brm.

Elitist about classic community is the firsthand reason it happened, of course they would be the majority here. They accept every part of classic as it was without ever trying to change it, because attempts to change it lead to retail in the state it is now.
---
There has been a 24/7 battle raging in hillsbrad on my PvE server since Thursday when honor was released. I got there a lot, join in for a while, then when I get bored I remove my flag and go about my business.
---
dude, that's wonderful!  
---
comes in at €712 here locally but that also means locally honoured guarantee so I have no problems with that.  
---
by far the best config I have seen, not only in this price bracket but couple of hundreds up as well.  
---
we have a winner - thanks a lot!
---
What value is the rogue providing here?
---
As noted by the previous poster, grinding works just fine - but don't get too caught up in the wilds and make sure you try out some dungeons, since you can get quite nice gear rewards from those and get some player interaction as well.
---
Where did the paladin touch you?
---
&gt; Well certainly not in classic. Does anyone around here ever wonder why things turn out the way they do? Why pvp servers are usually horde dominated and pve servers, alliance dominated?
---
The best classic guild in the world is literally alliance on a pvp server.
---
I am not sure, but is this it?
---

---
There it is boys!
---
Blizzard must have known this would happen and took no steps to stop it.
---
But things will get better but how much better is unknown.
---
Things like all the terrible PvP players who chose horde knowing that would horde would be the larger faction will learn once battlegrounds hit that world PvP only gives a tiny mount of honor compared to battlegrounds and with long queues, possible 1hr queues, they're going to have a tough time ranking up. Especially if they solo queue. Imagine solo queuing and running into an alliance premade, get smashed 3-0 in WSG and get virtually no honor. At least with solo queuing on alliance you're going to have very short queues. 
---
Once battlegrounds hit a lot of horde players are going to be in a bad situation.
---
You're taking this way too seriously.
---
The clip is hilarious, and these are the very types of people who have been coming here complaining about pvp.
---
“Very nice to see people honor trading”
---
We'd probably get in trouble for safespotting. I made sure not to attack anyone for this reason.
---
Yeah the helmet’s pretty weak. But at least I have T2 to look forward to 😈
---
&gt;if they're flagged, they're looking for action
---
I healed someone yesterday and got flagged for PVP and then instaganked - I was definitely not looking for action
---
All these people telling you are missing one key component. Whats your other gear like?
---
If you are seriously lacking mana then the int option might be best, are you lacking in +heal the highest heal option might be best, and id you need a combination of both + extra spirit for 5 second rule then middle option is best.
---
There is no correct answer without knowing in what area you are lacking.
---
ah stinkypete, rogue gnome right? remember i did some ZF with you in the lvling phase.
---
I still solo dont get me wrong, but I'm a rogue. Problem is for me that stupid ass spy addon. But my lower level friends are completely f'ed right now without backup
---
There's an EU server called Mirage Raceway? That's... amazing!!!
---
Is it true that respec price decreases every month you don't respecc?
---
brilliant, this is great tips. thank you
---
ghost mushrooms are helluva drug
---
If onyxia is being brought down quickly and your group has good dps, you should start doing earlier so you are higher on the threat table while she is in the air and you get hit by a fireball. After you get hit, judge how long it will be before she lands and plan accordingly. If she is 10% off or something, you can shadowbolt a few times. If it will be a while, you will want to be much more careful and decide whether you will be able to be fireballed again or if you will just be high on the threat table when she lands. The problem you are having is that it doesn't matter how much threat you have in p1, and how much your tank has, since his threat will get wiped and yours won't if you are at the bottom. When you start dpsing, you start moving up and you aren't getting your threat cleared before she lands. 
---
As others have said, as a warlock I stand where the MT normally stands during the p3 transition and get ready to use a LIP. If she goes for me, I judge my positioning and my HP and see if I can take a bit or not. I usually allow her to hit me once to give the tanks as much time as possible to grab her. After LIPing, I run diagonally a bit to move away from melee and fire breath and hope the tanks can pick her up and I won't get aggro again.
---
Did the "created Flask of Distilled Wisdom x1" appear in your log? Do you use a bag/inventory management addon of some sort that might not be displaying correctly?
---
Sucks to lose a flask like that. Can't say I've heard of that happening before.
---
I'm a level 51 undead rogue, and got fully ganked by a group of 22 level 60 allies. WHY!?
---
Fun for 22 people and not fun for 1 I'd say.
---
Do fury warriors still use "Overpower" when possible?
---
STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING! NO ONE CARES YOU DIED!
---
lol exactly my thought. Seems like a pretty good ratio of fun:not fun
---
Unfortunately yes, really hard to survive on any zone as an alliance now. Burning steppes is the worst, full of horde squads farming the allies trying to reach BRM.
---
Why? I play Rogue and haven't done this (yet), but what's the issue with it?
---
u ok hun?
---
Dont play on a pvp Server then?
---
I was never ganked by a 10 man roaming party. I was only ganked by players passing through or players wanting to grind/quest in the same area as me. The gank trains were in stv.
---
The reason why is probably because you're questing right by the entrance to MC. They were probably on the way to the dungeon already. You're worth honor so they killed you.
---
It's perfectly fine but only as long as you have a suitable class for it (mage is the best). Also please consider playing on PVE server, you definitely won't have a pleasant grinding experience on PVP servers now.
---
Laughs in balanced pvp on a pve server
---
"You should have predicted this" 
---
I actually did and quit playing a month ago. Cancel the subscription, and go do something else with your time. If Blizzard doesn't address the problem, well then classic will become a game for a small group of hardcore players.
---
It's fun to pick on people and make them inferior. It's human nature.
---
What, attacking people out of nowhere then karma kicking in?
---
According to sixyupgrades for level 60 priest stat have next weights:  
---
+ 1 healing = 1  
---
+ 1 int = 1.16  
---
+ 1 spirit = 0.86  
---
+ 1 mp5 = 3.5  
---
+1 mana = 0.07
---
mindflay one way, spirit the other
---
Fuck blizzard
---
And they kept getting exp after outleveling the boars.
---
Not saying you're wrong, but I had my eyes glued to this sub for at least 3 months before release and never saw a post about the period of time between honor and bgs
---
Yeah the only race with a mele pvp racial lol
---
I don't see it being terribly useful for practice, unless one of the hunters keeps messing up and can't figure out what they're doing wrong. Once you've done the run enough times, it should be short enough that bringing a second hunter would just be a waste of gold (it would only speed up boss kill time, and you don't need runs below 15 minutes anyway or you'll get capped).
---
Lol!
---
Nice job feeding the opposite faction and crying about it on Reddit
---
+5% int have minor effect.  
---
Much more important is another passives - Escape Artist vs Perception.
---
Warlock is considered one of the fastest levelers. Maybe get you warlock maxed, and then funnel down some gold to your warrior. Have you thought about dungeon grinding on your warrior?
---
You use gear meant for others because it's not meant to be.
---
&gt;!There are deathballs on both sides. **But statistically, more horde equals more horde deathballs.**!&lt;
---
That's the thing, isn't it? Nobody knows for sure if there is faction imbalance, and how big it is.
---
People can make *somewhat* educated guesses, I suppose, but that still doesn't prove anything.
---
Point is, it seems everyone is experiencing the same thing.
---
Imo you need to get your +heal up so you can start downranking your heals so both the highest +heal and the highest spirit option are your best bets
---
Bumming Warehouse! Where lowest prices are just the beginning.
---
I miss the footy season :(
---
I have a number of alts, and see this a lot
---
"LF1M X needed, Y dungeon"
---
"I'll come I'm X"
---
"We already have an X, sorry"
---
WHY NOT SAY SO IN THE AD THEN!
---
What are juju?
---
Already have unsubbed mate, and I fear to think what will happen to my 30:70 server when more players like myself quit.
---
you're gotta go somewhere less obvious. blackrock mountain and light's hope aren't gonna be excellent places for a handful of guys. you want somewhere with low but consistent traffic flow, where you're unlikely to see 10 people show up at once
---
consider flame crest, stonard, and camp mojache
---
You need to exit the game and relog one more time. It will appear.
---
It wont die down. Too many alliance will be gone. Unless Blizzard adresses the problem, be sure to keep your anus lubed and spreaded.
---
this isnt proof, just a bunch of shitty journalism with a bad screenshot, unconfirmed by primary sources
---
also this was supposedly in 2014, not 2019
---
fact check your shit?
---
It's very possible, just not as efficient. A lot of the time spent is running.
---
You get 31 points in fury for Bloodthirst and flurry, and 20 points in Prot for Defiance and improved sunder.
---
You can go for 1 hand + shield, where you drop dual wield spec and pick up sword spec. Or you can go for dual wield tanking where you get dual wield spec and anticipation.
---
I don't see how swapping dead folks out who can't fight for ones who can is being a dick, but whatever. Either way dropping people from a raid shouldn't mess with the loot table and the real issue is that dynasty is claiming first kill when they didn't put a single bit of damage on it. We downed it and we want credit.
---
Looks like we've found ourselves a trump voter here.
---
He's agreeing with the guy he's responding to.
---
If they expect this grind to get them epic gear? Yeah they will and do.
---
That's the current meta. A boring grind for honor rewards. There's no challenge or danger. Even if your group gets wiped, you just get up and start again. After all you don't loose honor points by dying. You only miss out a bit.
---
I was questing with 3 of my friends in STV. We killed every horde who we've encountered who gave honor. It wasn't fun or anything. But well it is "honor" after all. We've never been in any position where we were in danger of getting killed. On my priest I think I've used ONE healing spell in maybe 3 hours.
---
you see, the difference between a warrior and the hunter is that the hunter rolls on everything, while the warrior reserves everything.
---
What micro transactions are there besides level boosts, mounts &amp; pets? None of these things are really necessary for a player. Just a time saver if you want it &amp; random collection bullshit that means nothing. It’s not like micro transactions are forced down your throat.
---
I was naive in thinking Blizzard would actually wanted to keep ally players. Do horde players shit gold or something?
---
[Okay that- *hahaha* that seems really dark, though...](https://youtu.be/-yUafzOXHPE)
---
They won't introduce micro-transactions into classic... unless they actually plan on developing it more than just rolling out the currently planned phases.  If they ever actually decided to go the Classic+ route you can bet that they will start sliding in micro transaction pets or mounts or other items.  
---
The only reason I think they supported Classic in the first place was to get people to try out retail (and check out all of retails wonderful micro-transactions.)  Diablo 4 has already confirmed to have micro-transactions, there is no way classic+ wouldn't.
---
As far as fallen order, I wouldn't be surprised if loot boxes are severely reduced in future EA games due to the blow-back from consumers as well as several governments... I also wouldn't be surprised if cosmetic micro-transactions (just not random loot boxes) are added as downloadable options for Fallen order in the next few months.  Plenty of developers have started rolling out games with minimal micro-transactions and then added them later in the games cycle.
---
Hell yea get on board dude.
---
Raid control to Major Tom
---
Take your Titan Flask and put your sunders on
---
Check position and may Light's love be with you.
---
I wont use it either. I dont have any issues with people who do but for me it takes the fun out of it. If you set a trap and bait me into it I deserve to die not get away because an addon tells me there's a bunch of people around the corner.
---
Respect you took action instead of just whining. Sadly we all know.. you never quit wow, you only take breaks. Some ppl enjoy the raids and 5men squads this some dont
---
I'm a hybrid class too so I feel you. God forbid I want to have a tank spec AND a PvP spec, or an aoe farming spec and a pvp spec. How dare I?! Truly such a gigantic change would ruin the game and destroy any semblence of class and spec identity.
---
It sounds like you're going to gank those lowbies..
---
Well, subs have decreased, but they're making a lot of money from the shop, which didn't exist in WotLK.
---
Dammit I was just typing that xD +1
---
I'm sorry?
---
Sorry, how is this a "map hack"? Do you even know what the addon does lol?
---
\&gt;  and then Blizzard will fact check for correctness 
---
You mean they will as usual refer to their arbitrary reference client as "proof", which coincidentally represents 100% accurate original vanilla (at an unknown patch state), even though they stated for \~10+ years that they couldnt bring vanilla back because they had none of the original source anymore.
---
Fantastic comment
---
that and warmonger
---
Because if you couldn't then westfall would be the new orc starting area
---
True
---
TL;DR?
---
There is a guild called The Mercenaries on Zandalar Tribe EU, sounds like a job for them!
---
=)
---
Bfa gear bad classic gear good
---
*Tries to insta someone as a mage*
---
*gets instad*
---
No fair.  &gt;:(
---
I miss this
---
Haha what, you want changes? 
---
No changes, no changes... Whaaaa we can't cope... Please Blizzard save us, wrote rolled PVP servers but we can't handle the truth
---
That's kind of what I was thinking too, it just seemed so counter intuitive to be using the Hand of Righteousness and either the Orb of Lorica (6 int, 19 spi, 15 healing) or Orb of the Forgotten Seer (8 spi, 27 healing) over Zum'rah's Vexing Cane with a +3 Int enchant (13 int, 21 healing).
---
Rolltracker Classic can do it.
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rolltracker-classic](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/rolltracker-classic)  
---
(Developer commented on a question about it)
---
"/rt raidroll" &amp; "/rt raidroll list"
---
Raidroll makes a roll according to number of players in raid.
---
Sorry for your loss. That kind of loss isn't something that anyone can survive. I haven't gone through something like that, but it is one of my biggest fears. I am so glad that you did and even though I don't know you this story made an impact in my day.  
---
Keep your spirit up, keep playing with your e-friends and most importantly, I think you should say something to your guildies. Just a few of them who are the most important to you. Say that you really appreciate them. You never know if they are going through something heavy and that could really help them. And if they aren't going through anything, that would make them happy for sure.
---
Alliance players feel themselves just fine on PVE server (or pvp-ally-dominated) ones. Balanced servers are just fine as well.
---
Guild vent from 100+ players online everyday, to a small groupbof people, IF is also kinda empty :/
---
Horde is for sure more pvp oriented on this realm, UD mages and rogues everywhere.
---
Do you work at blizzard to make such claims?
---
After 10 days or 1.5 levels.
---
Question:
---
Malistar's Defender says it gives the following:
---
    2822 Armor
---
    52 Block
---
    9 Stamina
---
    ...
---
I remember learning this on private servers in 2015 but I forgot -- what exactly does that `52 Block` mean? Does that mean literally `52 Block Value`? When I put on a shield, my WowClassicStats addon says my Block% and Block Value didn't increase whatsoever which is confusing to me. Further more, I've been looking at a ton of different Classic WoW prot warrior best in slot spreadsheets and the more in-depth/recent ones actually show Malistar's Defender as being superior to Drillborer Disk (2539 Armor, 46 Block, 10 STam, 2% Block, 23 Block Value, 3 Thorns). I get that it has ~300 more armor and 8 more block. But if `Block` on shields is block value, wouldn't drillborer be **far* superior?
---
Sure, it's human nature if you're a dick
---
You can't go on pvv from pve since the experience is easier on a pve server, people would complain. You should be able to pvp on a pve server in Tarren Mill, or just create a group and start killing guards, it should quickly attract attention.
---
Otherwise you can reroll on a pvp server to have the full experience (I would advis to create a warrior for full enjoyment)
---
if that is your argument, i hope you kill every npc as well
---
you do realise this is just a video of all the crits?
---
I really really wish Wildstar would've made it. Played the shit out of it for the first few months and enjoyed a lot.
---
Raids were nice and finally getting into Datascape was the shit but shortly we just began losing too much people to keep going and I lost my interest as well due to the raiding being a struggle and issues with PVP etc.
---
There are some servers with balanced population, you can always roll your character there, or at least at pve server.
---
For me any person rolling alliance on pvp was someone either enjoying guerilla-playstyle or getting ready to raidlog while playing AH. It was completely obvious things will end this way.
---
I am currently trying to do my Hunter Epic Bow quest. I tried doing it at an unholy hour (3 AM) but still horde managed to find me at the edge of the map of Un goro and Silithus. It's a sad state of affairs but I guess I just gotta GIT GUD.
---
Yeah it has something to do with first Warcraft 3 expansion I heard
---
There is, but you would need the blood of 100 virgin gnomes.
---
Hahaha thank you for the positivity! 💕
---
It's a public vote.
---
Really? Took my group 40 mins last night to get to the LBRS portal. Couldn't summon as portal was camped. Our healer was mind controlled into the lava. I wanna level engineering/mining but that's basically impossible. I have a 51 alt and same story. Can't quest, and face a 30+ min slog to get into brd. 
---
On a good night I have 2h to play, more at weekends. Spending almost half of that getting instagibbed is not fun.
---
Stop PVP so you lose your rank.
---
I don't think it's fair to pin this on the retail community for flooding in and ruining your experience. I this sub is anything to go by, it's an all too common case of hardcore neckbeards killing what they professed to love.
---
So no honor for healers? :&lt;
---
Spell power is not what makes MC trivial LMAO. Casters are trash compared to melee even with 1.12 itemization. And you want to make them worse?
---
yes you can just grind mobs to level, but it'd be damn boring.  Nothing to stop you doing this at all.
---
? what is even the problem? ppl killing other players??? im so fucking lost
---
And still is the market leader and genre defining game since 2004/2005... Look what happened to all the games that not went the same way to the F2P and P2P type of payment... all dead
---
Wow, I'm the actual idiot and need to learn to read properly.
---
A dead horde is fun for me if it’s 1 on 1 or 1 on 40. But yes your complaint existed in vanilla it’s why they made arenas in TBC. You can also get 1 on 1s if you go to dead zones or areas. It’s just really bad honor and takes a while.
---
Will these calculations be thrown off when BGs hit? Since RP and honor will be waaay easier to grind
---
I solo gank players who give honour and have finished looting their mob. I want honour but I want to cause the least amount of inconvenience.
---
You should consider tho, that the axe has the highest DPS and damage range of all 1H weapons. You get a nice boost from aoeing with it. Also, edgemasters are bis until p4-p5 iirc
---
he appears to be rubbing something .. . maybe his mounts head??
---
Decided to edit another video after the positive feedback I got last time, hope you enjoy it :)
---
LOL what ganker doesn't wait until a warlock releases spirit? Bad ganker.
---
You don't wish that.
---
It should slow down on all ranks tbh. Everyone involved in the race feels like shit atm, and people will try to self regulate to limit the grind to reasonable levels.
---
Yeah they’re gonna release Wod after Classic.
---
Your mindset seems to be that people have an inseverable relationship with this game and that if they're disappointed in the way Blizzard has managed it, well, we should double down on our time investment in order to find a way to enjoy it.
---
Imagine being a game dev, pouring your heart and soul into your game, finally releasing it and some 15 year old game which the devs reluctantly release gets GOTY. :^)
---
And I cannot comment on that cause I am not on Whitemane. But it’s not the world first alliance kill :)
---
RIP
---
I got a slick rank 3 by just over 57 honour. I got super lucky.
---
I would love to see the marketing morons scratching their heads wondering why a 15 year old game won instead of their flashy-arcade-instant-gratification-good graphics-modern disaster
---
Keep in mind that classic today is a lot heavier on PCs than it was originally. I was surprised to find that my Alienware laptop from the Cataclysm era isn't holding up too well.
---
You don't consider 4 times the population on a given server a change?
---
lol, you cant read the tag ?  FYI its tagged as humor, which you apperently lack.  
---
He/she got ran over by 22 people. now i find that fun.
---
&gt;lower aggro (feign death etc) pushing me up the threat list
---
The fact that a hunter is reseting its aggro has nothing to do with you and your agro, if you're above the tank, you'll stil be above the tank no matter what they do
---
except for the part where the server transfers allowed most of one faction to Xfer out early
---
and the part where super nerds abused layering to get massive advantages.
---
i got upset and did 51 to 52 in half a day , cant log in today since im most likely gonna get harrassed in multiple ways by instruction so i need to study n all
---
I'd 100% recommend at least changing A and D from turning to strafing - turn with the right mouse and mouse moving
---
And how do you know this? There was literally another comment where you were telling someone that census /faction data he had was false so sounds like BS to me
---
Yeah. Wait until you're worth honor to the bank squads. Every neutral quest hub is farmed at FP and GY.
---
It's text. Add /s.
---
There truly is a PvP solution for everything.
---
Yeah tagged as humor like few minutes ago. The flair was not there at first, so zip it boy
---
Really struggling and it's making me want to stop playing so I really would like some help.
---
At the moment I have:-
---
60 Druid Alliance - Gehennas
---
60 Hunter Horde- Shazzrah
---
I started out on Gehennas but after hitting 60, rerolled as my friends were playing there on horde. Now, they have basically stopped playing and I am left with two 60 characters,  both near pre raid BIS with both low professions and no epic mount on either.
---
I really dont want to keep switching to and fro and would love to settle on one class and find a decent raiding guild.
---
On Gehennas,  I struggle to find groups that need a druid healer for some reason and so may switch to tank but the server feels so much more hardcore than Shazzrah due to the high number of pserver guilds.
---
However, on Shazzrah it feels somewhat more relaxed.
---
Thinking into phase 3/4... which do you think is a more viable option in terms of pvp and raiding. Going Feral druid and sticking on Gehennas or staying as hunter .
---
I got jumped by 10 horde when I should log off to go out to a commitment. I hope you enjoyed your 2 honour. I used my soulstone. It'll be off CD when I log back in.
---
But bloody hell, the fact you were so faraway from anywhere meant it's been a boring morning. You guys should get a better hobby and log in when it's peak time.
---
Did you just throw on a shield and go defense stance I take it? I need to try that will prob get me in groups fast. Just don’t have much tanking experience
---
Damn didnt know that. Then you could cast the Firestrike then do a POM firestrike tho :D But I dont know if the fire on the ground stacks, if it does it would tick for around 80-90 each tick per player, per firestrike. So if they both did 2x firestrikes each, it could tick each player for 320-360 dmg. Then they just use all their normal instants after that. I think 3 mages all doing this could easily wipe every single one of them in a matter of seconds
---
What Nameplate add-on are you using?
---
crossrealm wasnt tested afaik.
---
I'm 58.9
---
The original one is available on his website for free. It does include some quests which aren't available in classic, but aside from a wasted journey to Silithus I found it fine. 
---
About 7 days to 60, though I didn't fully focus on leveling.
---
&gt; I wouldn’t say having an open relationship is per se bad or a worse role mode than a monogamous one 
---
I may be too vanilla(get it?) when it comes to relationships, so this sounds like a completely degenerate concept for me.
---
Die Alliance piss!!! We don't stop camping until they are all fucking ash baby!!!!
---
How much do you pay with r3 discount?
---
there are some servers currently already have free transfers,but horde only. alliance players are stuck until paid transfers become a thing,so u can either wait for that,BGS,or outright quit.
---
the faction que is pretty much a pipe dream at this point,with so many servers horde dominated, too many people will be left out.
---
They have never use their reference client for server stability. They have also admitted that they didn’t officially have a copy and that it was found randomly on someone’s backup drive or something. So yeah, they actually couldn’t bring it back for 10 years, they weren’t lying.
---
It was like this in early vanilla. The constant raid spergs during peak times weren’t but that’s just because it’s a novelty and will end. But yes, you were constantly killed in plague lands, constantly killed at flight point, constantly course hopping into BRM. Wtf do you think max levels did all day when there was one full raid and a handful of max dungeons. They wpvped.
---
lol who are you calling a boy, when you cant act like an adult
---
well i did play vanilla, and it was just like this. i remember first high warlord on our server camped the crossing between tirisfal and EPL 24/7 on a rogue until bgs came out, which was about 2 months after the release of the honor system.
---
you know what changed? the amount of people doing this kind of stunts. in vanilla there were places where you could "hide" from pvp. instances being the main choice ofc, but you could go to silithus to farm in peace, or felwood. not anymore. players farming honor naturally spread accross the map to avoid competition...
---
I been leveling a KT in retail.
---
:D
---
Thought the pinnacle of retarded ideas was reached, but you just *had* to swoop in
---
plot twist: OP is one of them
---
I wanted Vanguard to be good. Bought it day one. Ran like garbage and I had a pretty great computer for the time. Servers were just brutal. But man, did it look good.
---
Wow that was a fun read, what an awesome event
---
I thought this is the case but I was told on this subreddit that warrior never use overpower, even if switching to Battle Stance and back would not lose rage. I had a hard time believing it but it's true. If you go and look at logs for the best fury warriors in the world, they never overpower. I believe that's either because A) They are getting too much rage to possible switch without having losses and B) Using it on Whirlwind/Bloodthirst/Cleave is superior.
---
If it can be done solo then obviously it can't be done with two people, it should be slightly faster
---
Is he wrong though? Theres 1 alliance dominated pvp server on NA. Thats it.
---
I have a friend like this and asked me to vote. Saw WoW Classic and I straight up messaged him, it's over.
---
Every gank has a silver lining
---
Relax buddy
---
Depends. I hear that the proper way to play enhancement in raids is to gear specifically for totem twisting. Essentially every piece needs to have mp5 on it along with offensive stats.
---
So because you have trouble getting ganked, on a PvP server, I'm either forced to not play the game for hours or to leave my server, friends, and guild behind?
---
If you want to lose the masses, not just the vocal minority, this is how you do it.
---
I prefer classic. I quit playing retail for the reason that it was a joke and nothing seemed worth working for. 
---
I prefer the randomness of classic. There are plenty of alternatives, even if they are not BiS, then are not far off. So go farm them, have fun, run more instances, PVP, get honor.....but I'm happy in the knowledge that gear is just not handed out left, right and centre without working for it.
---
What's actually difficult about the current pvp scence?
---
Sometimes it feels like quest drops have diminishing returns.
---
Yes but with the current gankfest going on, I'd recommend dungeon-only levelling after lvl 30.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/original-joana-v110.html
---
Yeah but, the problem started when they offered realm transfers not faction transfers because the realm was too full, this lead to faction imbalance. Yeah now they might add faction transfers, but the damage has been done long ago.
---
Agreed. Better than living a long life never really being passionate about something, or getting a chance to do what you're passionate about.
---
I like waiting til they think they are safe after rez, I let them eat up, maybe kill another mob or two, and then its time for another corpse run you filthy gnome
---
Which addon is telling you nearby players?
---
it originated from the movie 300. Quoted from Xeres.
---
Gaming back in the day, players could influence the worlds they played in to such a degree that the game would be rendered "unplayable" for others. Corpse camping, killing quest givers etc.
---
Hell, in Age of Conan there was mercenary guilds. You'd pay for them to camp other players, so they'd have no option but to log off and play later. That was a FFA mmo, no faction everyone could kill anyone.
---
Only a few games are known to still have this, games like EVE online.
---
WoW classic doesn't have the same filters most game have today, where it tends to every single persons personal needs. You only got 2 hours a day to play? Ok, we'll make a special easy version of this raid, just for people like you!
---
The meta right now is zerg pvp, and the reasons for that are blatantly obvious. It's the easiest way to get honor. The world zerg pvp will fall off in the coming weeks and die completely when BGs hit.
---
Enjoy the mayhem while it lasts.
---
Do you have a link to  Seven leaves/Tactics - proper speedrunners ?
---
Is the Warlock meta to down rank Shadow Bolts? I feel like I haven’t seen much discussion of that.
---
I agree but there is one small detail: this only is the truth if server population is balanced.
---
My server is Gehennas EU on Horde side. Does anybody know about the ratio on that server?
---
For me it feels ok. But maybe somebody is telling me soon that from Alliance side this sever is not so fun :)
---
Telling me to fuck off isnt really a solution.
---
Because they wouldnt just have to add 1 small invisible barrier on the southshore inn roof, they would have to do that to EVERY SINGLE BUILDING in the entire game. And then there are some buildings where you dont even have to walljump to get on the roofs but where you can basically just walk straight on top from a nearby hill, i.e. as in Darkshire, so they would have to place invisible walls around that as well.
---
And sooner or later players find other places and other things where they can somehow jump or wallclimb onto where npc's cant reach, and blizz would have to "fix" those too, until eventually (and after hundreds or even thousands of working hours) the entire world is plastered in invisible walls and you can basically only move along streets and large flat areas. And with that they would have also removed tons of things from the game in pve as well, even though it was only supposed to prevent them to be exploited in pvp.
---
An easier solution would be changing town guards aggro range (on the southshore inn rooftop you're out of the guards aggro range) and instead of making them just walk/fly everywhere without collision, which would lead to weird and otherwise gamebreaking behavior, give them a new ability to teleport their target to them if its unreachable, similar to what Onyxia does to players that try to leave the area.
---
Or... people could just stop being exploiting cheating d\*ckweeds.
---
You are playing it wrong and whoever is accusing you should not be in any kind of raid leading position. 
---
I top meters as rogue always on this fight, and yes you are right I spam feint and have grace totem for 20 % lower threat. You don't have to strictly white damage p1, you just have to stay safely below MT on threat. 
---
Anyway, the issue is that if you are aggroing in p3 then it is because you got ahead of OT during the fight. This is a raid effort to coordinate and it depends on how many you have in the raid. Sometimes we go as 20 sometimes as 30-35 and then p2 only lasts for like a couple seconds no kidding. Last time I was amazed at how fast she flew down again. Anyway, in a perfect world you are above OT during p2 and get hit by a fireball and reset threat.
---
Exactly.
---
There was another thread where another user pointed this out and was buried below thousands of other whiny and irrelevant comments.
---
Glad this sticked out to the top. Hopefully Blizz realizes that it's time to reduce server population cap, create new realms and offer free *faction balanced* transfers so we can have a good and accurate reproduction of the original Vanilla feel.
---
No doubt 14 is the best FF since the PS1 days. And maybe some of the ps2 days lol. The story is great and while I know the vanilla MSQ is long I'm baffled  by how many people want to skip it.
---
Personally though I think Heavensward was the best expansion lore wise. Except Alexander was an odd choice for the main raid content. I liked the raid, I just felt like it was... out of place? Coil just felt much more meaningful.
---
But like I said above, I have to take breaks. A lot of what ff14 proudly has (like a dungeon finder, for instance, and gear tokens) are things that I personally think ruined the core wow experience and that's why I enjoy classic so much. But yeah the job system and the crafting are bar none the best in the genre so it does plenty right.
---
how would you expect a player who probably isnt a min/maxer or aware of the stat variables to know that? Even if someone is a vet of the game, if they're playing a class for the first time, they wouldn't know the intricacies of their classes pvp rotations, especially when surprised in wpvp.
---
well this is your 2nd level 60! Sounds like this guild is awful! MC should be cleared without even needing food buffs! 
---
Even early raids, where folk are gearing up, its still pretty easy. 
---
I'd find a new guild asap.
---
"he's just standing there, MENACINGLY!"
---
In classic the RNG comes from the loot itself dropping. In retail the RNG comes from the gear being good or not when it drops. That’s not a situation we want to be in
---
Because it's bullocks. The most important thing in raiding right now is whole dungeon clears.
---
He also cherrypicked some bosses and left out Shazz, Gahennas, Lucifron for example.
---
I play on Whitemane. Not a streamer server. Every hub is farmed by gank squads.
---
The title of the post is the always sunny meme
---
Dude I really think grinding is not a good idea around that level
---
No it wasnt obvious. There are always the "i told you so" people, and they are always a minority. If you really predicted this, why are you playing this game? Do you want to be part of this toxic community?
---
Here is an old thread i found. https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769567413
---
I've spent to much time on my account to reroll. When I can transfer I might come back, but I highly doubt the community will change.
---
I think you mean 300 reference.
---
Ah yes, EVE,  the only game that can be extriemely and boring at the same time..
---
Yep, often there's a spare point that's put into improved overpower just for this. It maybe tails off in usefulness in raiding, but for dungeons certainly you would rarely have enough rage for heroic strike but with bt and ww on cooldown and around 25 rage it's a no brainer to get a free regular crit.
---
Added Heads-Up Display for honor / gold, you can now classify a farm as a PvP one!
---
Full change log -
---
\* 1.17  
---
   \* Heads-up Display! Minified window with quick summary of your current session.  
---
   \* PvP mode! You can now switch between viewing honor or drops for each farm.  
---
   \* Added option to pause session on login, so it won't run after logging back in  
---
\* 1.16  
---
   \* Options screen! You can now configure FarmLog to your liking. Write \`/fl\` or Shift+Click the minimap button to see the option screen.
---
Warrior levelling gets easier once you get to around level 40. You won't have to eat/bandage after every mob, and you can take on 2 at a time much easier with sweeping strike et al.  
---
But the warlock will always be a better leveller and a stronger solo class in both PvP and pve.  
---
If that's the class you are enjoying more, stick with it.  Playing a class you don't really enjoy, or is way too slow, is just going to kill the entire game for you.
---
Got some money on my main and want to level a rogue as an alt.
---
What should i get to make my leveling experience as pleasant as possible. For example, and correct me where i'm wrong, i want to search the AH for some lvl10 or so boots, to throw minor speed ench on them. The same for some weapons, though i don't know what ench to get on them
---
Any more tips and tricks? Or does anyone know some link, guide for this sort of stuff?
---
Are you sure you've been bored?
---
Maybe it's rising sea level due to global warming?
---
I’m also curious what the cost is with honored and rank 3 discounts
---
The mage is probably raid specced 31/0/20.
---
yea man tell em! Its also a dick move pvping while questing, or traveling, or talking, or jumping, or anything honestly! I want a 5 min preperation time before we start fighting, starting with /salute and /bow. I mean, PvP just means player vs player, BUT anything not considering the stuff I wrote first just isn't!
---
Run up to them, Rend, Hamstring, then leave them to their suffering.
---
40 minutes to go to LBRS is perfectly fine and expected. 
---
You don't have to summon since people should be responsible enough to do their own run. 
---
I have no clue what stopped you from leveling engineering or mining before but hopefully you are at least at the point to mine thorium in DM:E, then it's not a problem at all.
---
51 alt can level a bit in ST/Mara (definitely not camped area) then going to BRD at 54 would be better a bit.
---
You also can group with other people to reach dungeon portal together. You can go there as your guild except instead of doing a raid you will do your 6-7 separate dungeon runs.
---
The major issue here is the fact most of your problems happen because you are outnumbered, so you are unhappy. But at the same time it means people who gank you as a majority ARE happy. Since Blizzard definitely aren't able to please everyone, I expect them to side with the majority.
---
A paid transfer option would be very nice I'd say.
---
20% discount, so 800g for epic mount.
---
I would say rogue is a good option for casual play because it is not that gear reliant to still have fun in wpvp and bgs.
---
As for raiding/dungeoning you will have a lot of competition for gear because warriors hunters and other rogues will all role on your stuff but thats the problem of most classes.
---
I would say go for rogue if you enjoy it, definitely a good option.
---
Nice to see this "phase 1" feelings at the eminence of the most hardcore PVP experience u ll pass for, 
---
Best regards from Stranglethorn Vietnan
---
Just farm the dungeon set maybe?
---
Wait, you can play wow AND have a girlfriend? That’s not a meme?
---
Or just not broadcast "sneak abilities".
---
I'm pretty sure mounting and dismounting don't trigger a broadcast, unless it's a Paladin/Lock mount; because they're classified as 'spells'.
---
The birds in deadwind pass are pretty decent. Around level 55, decent vendor items, usually uncontested. You'd have to run to stonard as horde to sell which might slow you down a bit but otherwise it's worth a shot.
---
My lack of game knowledge ? The reason that I think it's not such a big deal is not because I "lack game knowledge", it's because I don't attribute value to being potentially able to steer your honor farming group to a good spot in a very few select spots in the game that provide the verticality necessary to spy on people from far away. I just don't believe that specific use of spy is going to result in more than trivial gains at best, and if it does, if say it allowed you to farm honor twice as fast as before, I still don't see the problem. Everyone has access to it. And I still don't see how that is "anti vanilla", whatever that means. Also, if you attribute so much value to it, I suppose that you have a bunch of hunters or shamans in your squad far sighting common gathering spots to check for groups of enemy players ?
---
800g
---
I have no idea, I have never played a warlock before. I doubt it. Ours just wand when they get near pulling aggro I think. Sounded like OP didn't wanna do that so that's why I made that suggestion.
---
First lvl 60 I levelled without any guides, just enjoyed the game and ended playing 210 hours to 60.
---
Now I use Zygor and it's really good.
---
Wow such a nice read... enjoy your live on Earth and on Azeroth! :)
---
Yes, it now tracks instance locks
---
It is a very common combination of race and class. Undead have some nice PVP-utilities, so it is a popular choice for many players. And since rogues are notorious for having an easy time to jump up behind you, many people have probably met their end by the hands of an undead rogue - Probably in Southshore and Stranglethorn Vale. So there is much vindication hanging in the air!
---
the last youtube video from madseason explained it pretty good and had a listing which rank requires which level.
---
I feel a little betrayed by Blizzard, and disappointed in the playerbase. I played a ton of vanilla back then, and I thought I was coming back to revisit that in a leisurely way. Instead, we had huge numbers of players approaching it in an extremely hardcore way, and then Blizzard pushing out content into to keep them engaged. 
---
Now I'm level 55, Dire Maul has been pushed out and is old hat, Ironforge is full of people in Tier 1/Tier 2, and finishing my push to 60, if I do it, will require dealing with geared 60's who are incentivized to make me repeatedly corpse run.
---
The idea that this was part of the Vanilla experience is bullshit, because huge numbers of people were not able to rush to 60 and get geared back then. And yes, I know I can't control how others people play, but I may decide that there isn't really a place for me in this. And I resent how Blizzard has handled the content.
---
Playing on a german PVE realm.
---
You are not really gonna see many flagged players in front if dungeons ir while leveling. But there ist pvp in southshore every evening! But take care! People who are flagged on purpose normally know pretty well what they are doing! Already had some pretty awesome fights :)
---
I can completely understand that. For me personally I know the work they put into it so I had no problem paying a small amount for lifetime access to the guide.
---
Decay? What kinda DKP system uses decay?
---
There’s 2 so far
---
wholesome story mate, but one thing that made me a bit confused.
---
"The main tank asked me the day before Christmas Eve if I wanted to talk. I went offline right away to avoid answering. This was a regular dodge tactic.", what scared you off from talking to the maintank? was this the officer mentioned earlier that had a crush on you?
---
Not a huge deal tbh. I unsubbed as well and with Halo MCC, RDR2, Cyberpunk and Bannerlord coming out soon, there's plenty of games to play.
---
Still a shame though, was absolutely loving classic (this is the first MMO I played for more than 2 hours). But all good things come to an end eventually.
---
fury/prot is a high end raid guild niche spec
---
you will seriously gimp yourself in 5 mans
---
don't go fury prot
---
seriously, without tactical mastery you can't stance dance to save your life.  If you are tanking dungeons you need to stance dance quite frequently.  Yes you can do awesome dps as a tank if you are geared properly as fury/prot.  But if you are leveling, you are not geared properly.  If you are just entering MC you are not geared properly.  
---
Tank as arms till 55, then consider deep prot.
---
Committing to playing A ret pvp spec is Hard mode on the alliance in classic idk what you're on about.
---
depends on what you consider healthy wpvp
---
What an incredibly ignorant comment.  This shit is nothing like how it was back in Vanilla.  This isn't PvP.
---
[AAAAAAAEEEEEEIIIIIAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOAAAAAAAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DpsJdxMwXY)
---
Meanwhile on the alliance side “execute order 66”
---
Man, i played that game for years and only ever saw 2 Jedi. I unlocked 20 professions and still had 2 left on the hologrind before my force sensitive char was ready to go. I made  rank 10 in 8 weeks.
---
I did use BM but I didn’t follow Joana’s spec, I didn’t even know there was one ;P it was probably very similar though
---
heavily suggest: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vWgSvcn8ahFjhUER3BgYTSQGuCDgvtRkYJzt4kW2j5E/edit#gid=1385640031](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vWgSvcn8ahFjhUER3BgYTSQGuCDgvtRkYJzt4kW2j5E/edit#gid=1385640031) 
---
If your leveling horde.
---
Dear Blizzard: you think you do, but you don't
---
&gt; well i did play vanilla, and it was just like this.
---
Bullshit.  I played in Vanilla too and on a highly populated server.  It was nothing like this.  You literally can't go from Point A to Point B in any end-game zone without getting ganked multiple times.  A situation like that never existed in Vanilla.
---
Amazing.
---
Yah, I just noticed that.
---
Will any old music do?
---
Also, as soon as it dropped 1 person said "all roll need", no warriors in group, everyone rolled need except one person following what was said. Everyone was happy and no one complained...
---
Play what you enjoy &gt; everything else
---
Flamelash is around 65% Horde and 35% Alliance.
---
Any PvP outside of /duel is strictly VERBOTEN
---
Try to transfer on a lower population server (Sulfuras -&gt; Earthfury as Alliance). That’s what I did last week and don’t regret it. Believe it or not, yesterday, I landed in Un’ Goro and... no one was there to sap me and kill me. I mounted and went questing. Sure there was a couple of small groups roaming around killing questers, but that’s normal.
---
rank 11 requires you to be at least level 53
---
Rogue/Drood detected, who seems to be not able to abuse his extreme gimmik in PVP.
---
Fuck Lights Hope Chapel. I died at least 10 times trying to get Stratholme quests. Alliance killed the horde flight master over and over so nobody could leave without hearthing or teleporting. Stupidest most maddening shit ever. Fuck Alliance they're the biggest pussies.
---
No.
---
Was me last night. Buddy and I were getting constantly slammed by 60s in raid gear. We finally found a lowbie of that same margin, but when he /cried after I rooted him, I loudly told my bud "NO" over discord. 
---
"We shall spare this one. I am a generous God." So he sapped him and we left.
---
Classic wow has been relevant for 15 years,
---
im pretty conviced its gonna stay alive some more
---
Nope that is r5. R1 is 15 kills, r2 is 2k RP, r3 is 5k RP and then 5k steps until r14
---
Spy is cancer
---
Thats exactly what I mean. People say "it was the same in vanilla" are just factually wrong due to the sheer amount of players classic have, while the world size didnt increase. I want world pvp but getting my ass handed to me by 30-40 people while they sit on my corpse waiting for me to respawn hardly enjoyable.
---
“Alliance always honors 1v1”
---
Oh fuck off would you. That’s a load of bullcrap.
---
What power level mob tagging? Just tagging mobs someone else attacks or something? Is that what you do?
---
Jesus Christ, This is half the time it took me to reach 60.
---
Because you are on a PvP server in a PvP zone, playing a PvP game.
---
Easy 100g more to spend for runecloth. :D
---
&gt;40 minutes to go to LBRS is perfectly fine and expected. 
---
And that's a huge problem for a large number of people. I can't think of any other popular game where you're forced to do 40+ mins of something thoroughly unenjoyable before you can actually play the game. 
---
&gt;people who gank you as a majority ARE happy.
---
I'd hope most people don't find instagibbing a solo lvl 52 as a raid group to be challenging or particularly, it's just what they are being forced to do atm.
---
That rank 1 lightning bolt just to see then fart in fear
---
It's called Spy Classic :)
---
Just 399!
---
So a GM randomly ported you to vash'jr..........nice
---
&gt;mounts head
---
Is that what it's called these days?
---
Yeh, i have no idea why he did but he wasn't Salty at all. 2 person in the grp stated "everyone roll need" as soon as it dropped and even then 1 person rolled greed. Everyone was stoked for me and we carried on the instance with no one complaining
---
i love this post saying
---
* "it's simple"
---
* "no complicated changes needed"
---
* "just do this"
---
People dont get the implications of what they are asking... also #nochanges
---
Gehennas is like 60/40 horde/alliance
---
 If you don't know how to do Tribute runs, i recommend watching cdewx on twitch. He has been doing a lot of them on his Hunter lately and has the strategy pretty much down pat. 
---
I'm sure there are youtube videos out there too, but this allows you to ask questions in real-time.
---
This is false, FD+Trap was always instant.
---
I feel you on that unable to play. I can only play so much (still a good chunk of time though thankfully) so I wanted to level as expediently as possible as to not waste time. The warrior life is a whole nother thing though lol
---
You would think that, but if you look at the screenshots posted here you will see that that's simply not the case. And I assume someone on reddit to be more tech/game/keybind savvy than your average wow player...
---
It's common sense for everyone in a pug to roll need so no one can ninja it. No one there should actually use the item if they're just leveling since itll be replaced anyway. And if someone wants to use it, is it fair to let them gain priority in winning something worth several hundred gold without anyone else having a chance?
---
And once you get rank 3 once will that discount last forever? Or do you need to buy your epic mount the same week you get the discount?
---
Yes, writing `/fl` should work. If it doesn't, you may have a LUA error, try updating your addon and deleting FarmLog.lua at your account SavedVariables and your character's too - there was a related bug in the past.
---
After opening the AH interface, write `/fl ah` it'll do a 30 sec scan, which is much faster and simpler than implementing all the various APIs for each addon, not to mention maintaining it. I'd have to import it to my own database anyway, so there's not much benefit from that, apart from these extra 30 sec scan.
---
Errr I am sorry you feel this way but classic is definitely a fixed environment which whole purpose was, is and will be it's not going to change based on people demand and complaints. And it's definitely not for everyone, the versatility and quality of life changes were introduced way later and classic was created to exclude all of it. There is nothing wrong with overestimating yourself while approaching a game like that as long as you can accept it later and move on. I mean the fact this game isn't for everyone was the major Blizz concern why they have hesitated to make it in the first place (I mean rerelease of classic). If you clearly don't enjoy the situation, why do you stress yourself over it?
---
/cast polymoph
---
/kiss
---
And then run away
---
Reroll PVE Scrub, kek.
---
In vanilla times, I would have agreed with this.
---
Guilds typically had exactly 40 people at every raid, and would bench a few to keep rotations going. In order to not be a waste on progressive content, we would have demanded this.
---
But GTFO with this. No guild with &lt; 40 full team that can't clear content gets to demand it.
---
The honor tab is on the character screen 
---
That’s the social screen ^^
---
I dont really see any other reason to remove the priviledge to Handle the, in most players eyes, most important thing. Which is loot.
---
But also, as a former pserver player, I do know what could happen "behind the scenes"
---
So yes, if not logical, at least realistic explanation.
---
It's not so much that a druid tank is much worse in raids, it's more that warriors being so popular this time around leaves most guilds with an ample supply of offtanks already.  If you do find a guild offering the spot, you'll probably do fine.  Farming Crowd Pummelers can let you be a threat specialist.
---
As a healer, you'll have a competent and interesting kit, but the lack of a spammable rez WILL be annoying in 5s.
---
Since you did mention healing, a compelling option is leveling as tank, then going heart/ns at 60.  You miss out on ~15% threat and all buffs to your hots, so healing efficiently with this spec *is* just healing touch spam, BUT having someone who can tank 5/10s and heal raids (and 3rd string offtank where needed) is very handy for a guild.
---
If the server heavily skews Horde and you roll Alliance you will find it more difficult to find groups for dungeons/raids.
---
That's not how server infrastructure works in today's world with virtualization. Blizzard could quarter every server with very little overhead for each new server.
---
We no longer have a physical server for each realm.
---
100g .. I didn´t even bother with waiting a week to get to rank 3 and just bought the mount straight away for 900g. 100% worth it in the current situation of phase 2
---
Yesterday on Onyxia our raid master was shouting "Priests, put fear ward on tank!".  
---
But after finding that all 3 priests are Nelfs\humans he was very-very upset :)  
---
"Are you bunch of roleplayers or something?!"
---
Sarcasm is always the answer!
---
Please for the love of god don’t spec prot while leveling unless you are spending 90% of your time in dungeons. It will not make you a better tank at 60.
---
A laptop with an amd apu is usually a good choice. Check benchmarks on different websites on the 500+ ones. If you see a csgo benchmark that is high fps then the single core performance is good. A benchmark with high fps in gta/farcry is good for gpu performance. I know it's a basic assessment but easier to understand.
---
I rolled on a non-PVP server. Saved myself a lot of grief. I still die plenty just because, though.
---
If wow was released,in its Vanilla state,for the first time in 2019 it would never have won. No one would have played it even. Its literally just nostalgia. Spamming your two damage spells in an graphically ugly game for tens of hours to level up is not something anyone would have been hyped over
---
Which add on is that for the enemy frames?
---
A guild? You two are in a... guild?
---
How did you not know... the reason I invited you two into my guild... was to bang you. 
---
GET OUTTA HERE. GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE!
---
It's actually what makes you sleep at night in this case, since you are factually wrong and lulling yourself into a fiction in order to make yourself feel better for some reason.  Or you're just clueless, could be that.
---
Flask makes you do good dmg even in garbage gear. So yes, it's reasonable to ask for flasks if dps is the issue (epsecially for fresh second raid group, filled probably partially with alts and less experienced players). And in my eyes it's better to buy a flask, instead of getting 10 more randoms from pug to cover the missing dps.

The real question is - what do they mean by "low dps on Rag"? They probably can't kill him before submerging, meaning they need to handle the intermission with flame adds. So it could be just bad players, who can't play through the intermission and don't use GFPP's to cover the overall fire dmg taken and need to help themselves with flasks to kill Rag before the intermission (its 3 min timer I think). **But that's the trial for - they test you and you test them.**  
---
Ps: I envy you the prices of flasks, if 85g is current price in phase 2. It's 130+g on my server
---
Fuck me, you're right.
---
Rarely have seen that, must be a one off experience.
---
Flask doesn't fix bad
---
What if our characters are doing their own things once we log out - Kinda like Toy Story just with faction imbalance and corpse walks.
---
Rank 11 is the cheap epic mount - I did it in Vanilla, in hindsight no idea why, could have just farmed gold quicker
---
Spy ftw. It would just warn you off stealth detection. 
---
Such a stupid addon no joke. They should just stop portraying the shit that does not concern you in the CL.
---
Doesn't this lead to MC?
---
Look up Skarm Tank on youtube for lots of in-depth fury prot advice. He’s on twitch now, too.
---
What is even beter if you accidentally put a quest item in the bank. When you get back to finish the quest you will never see the last item drop anymore. Been there..
---
2 or 3 v 1ing is just as stupid and horde do that constantly.
---
I did not have to rebuy holy nova while respeccing. dunno why.
---
Any "pvp ranking" system in a video game that is a "grind" is inherently broken. When you're ranking players in a pvp setting it should be by how good they are at pvp in your video game. Aka skill over time investment.
---
(And before you pop off yes I knew before this week exactly what the vanilla pvp system was like. Because it's such a terrible system I didn't give it my time.)
---
There’s nothing wrong with taking a break from your Druid. It’s not like you’re only aloud to play 1 char at once. Play the hunter for a bit and go back to the Druid later. And I wouldn’t worry about hunter being “well received” this sub over blows A LOT of things in the game.
---
But how ? I thought the game was literally unplayable and that you get ganked even in the queue
---
Pretty much like others have said. enchants are relatively cheap and can help a lot. I'd grab some white level 5 daggers or swords depending on what faction you are so you can reuse them should you choose to level another character and throw fiery on them, or crusader if you're feeling really rich. I wouldn't do a skinning dagger like the other guy suggested as that will make it so you can't use weapon skills. you can throw 7 stam to bracers/agi to gloves/health to chest in there while you're at it on some cloth/leather and you'll effectively have a leveling set for whatever you choose to level from here on out. that will last you until level 25 or so.
---
"Go back to retail" nice.
---
Oops, sorry, I believe it should be public now.
---
no 48+ give full honor to lvl 60
---
he is right though. Most people still are mouse clickers and keyboard turners.
---
because you're worth the exactly same honor as a lvl 60 rank0
---
Day one on Phase 2 I felt the same way. This all changed when I joined the ally raid pvp groups which basically prevented the Horde from doing any dungeon or reaching a FP.
---
It's because of A. 
---
The extra dmg from an overpower isn't worth the risk of getting some big crits during that gcd, and losing the rage you gained, or having to stay in battlestance to dump rage.
---
I like how gearing in classic has an end point. Regardless of what patch (phase) we’re in. I’m bfa with titanforging, you can always have a better piece in each slot
---
&gt;Randomly found it on someones backup drive.
---
See the problem here? What Version or build is it? Was it a development build? A seperate branch with lots of discarded changes? Maybe even a client that was tampered with and altered by someone for funsies or as a base for pservers? But hey, this is what we'll go now as our totally accurate representation and reference to how Vanilla was, your collective memories are just all false.
---
LUL
---
I heard it shares the same ID as the faire fire spell so they dont stack, thats why nobody uses it.
---
The only weapon to use for this purpose is Annihilator.
---
Checked the site it’s fake
---
Lol or! Im just a great photographer 😉
---
This honestly is more sad than anything else, just shows the current state of the industry
---
lmao have you even tried to play or are you just crying on reddit since P2 launched?
---
My /played is 33 days but for 1 character only.
---
The best part here you don't have to reroll at all, you are completely fine, just raidlog and enjoy the game. I am not sure about PUG experience but organized raid taking a short detour won't have any problems to reach MC or Onyxia with 1, at least 2 corpseruns. 
---
Dungeons are slightly tougher to reach, thankfully you don't have to go to the dungeons at all.
---
What are the basis of your claims? Literally everybody is grouping up to honor grind.
---
Listen man, you rolled on a PvP server. Is getting 10v1’d fun? No but you had to see this coming. Idk how any of you did not see this coming
---
What I have done is putting the LFG in its own window, and mute it in every other chat widow.
---
Its not just for fun its people chasing the honor grind.  And its what a pvp server is in p2 compounded by blizzards lack of foresight on server distribution and population cap.
---
Sadly not everyone knew it was gonna be like this going in.  It sucks for the casuals and the people still leveling (and anyone trying to go near brm) but itll die down over the next month and slip into normal pvp again.  
---
Be patient and play safe for now :)
---
I mean, those classes are built around being able to do things like that, so it’s not a gimmick or abuse
---
I sometimes just run near low levels with my mount to scare them
---
You can go to BRD as a healer at level 50 and do arena/anger runs.
---
And an overwhelming list of subscribers.
---
His job is to publically take flak for ruining the game for long term fans while they make bank on selling MTX to kids and the kind of casual player that probably doesn't care or notice any of this going on. 
---
It's a classic red herring tactic where you have one authority figure take all the blame for the strategy the entire company and its shareholders are behind 100%.
---
 Such is the price of curiosity.
---
This is what you signed up for. Literally a warning on the log in screen when you select “PVP”.
---
I play alliance on Skeram. I get skullfucked everywhere I move, but bitching and moaning to blizzard is exactly why retail is the way it is. It caters to the lowest denominator player. Figure it out.
---
All this sub does is piss and moan about the game they desperately wanted. You’re getting wrecked because you’re just not that good or don’t have time to play. That’s not blizzard’s problem and they don’t need to cater to you. Maybe you’re not the target demo of the game anymore.
---
What nameplates do you use?
---
Yep at 60 i've gotten geared out, so I no longer need to even play. I could cancel my sub and wait for phase 3 at this point.
---
It spits you out just before Majordomo.
---
Unless you plan on speedrunning MC in under 30 minutes, there is no reason to flask in MC imo. Spend your gold on other things instead.
---
PC game of the year. Big distinction.
---
The only right reply on all of this whining.
---
"I want to make worlds, not games." - Brad McQuaid
---
As weird as it sounds, some of the best times I have had in life have taken place in the world Brad created in everquest.  Playing everquest as a young kid I learned a lot about how adults communicate, dedicating hours to earn some small things for other people, and tons of other life lessons...  
---
I will never forgot camping for my "jboots" in the desert for hours and hours, when I finally saw that giant spawn it was such an intense adrenaline rush.  I loved those boots so much.
---
Everquest is also where I fell in love with video games.  It forced me to keep working on my PC that was far to old to play the game but I just really didn't want to give up.  I remember one time I had to brace my desk in my bedroom with a couple 2x4's and nails because my 21"CRT monitor and broke my flimsy hand me down desk.
---
20 years later sitting as an IT professional, I wonder how life would have been different for me if there was no everquest.
---
Thank you Brad, your video games had a far greater impact on my life than you could have ever imagined.
---
LOL i got bugged there last weekend.
---
i Jumped down from the chains into the lava, lagged out, and suddenly i was inside Molten Core enterance O\_o
---
Re roll and youd still be complaining.
---
Ahh so all that nerd rage on the bottling forums after the ban waves is all fake. Gotcha
---
That's the thing.  A lot of people are saying "don't force a style of play on other people" while doing exactly that because they know that many of the people world pvping currently would rather be in BGs and would be there if they released.  But THEY would rather have world pvp, so they're ok with forcing THAT playstyle on people.  Just they don't want anything that would allow some of the people currently forced to play with them to be able to do something else.
---
Kind of funny, tbh.
---
They leveled by killing boars, even past the the point where they stopped giving exp, all in starter zones where its safe.
---
I'm sorry my little alliance friend but I don't pay $15 per month to have 1-2 downtime everytime I want to play the game.
---
He asked for PvP.
---
If you are unhappy with some distinctive Classic features which are removed in other versions of WoW, why not? There is nothing wrong to accept some games aren't for you and move on.
---
On Shazzrah albeit alliance is much fewer than Horde, it is just quasi impossible for both sides to farm without groups.
---
If you are alone, you are free honor. When I farm in WS it is usually in groups of 3-5. Otherwise I will get eaten by alliance groups of 2-10 every 10 minutes.
---
This is false, you could trap instantly upon hitting FD in vanilla.
---
Or you know, stop bashing their heads and go for the legs
---
You can go with the Druid feral/resto hybrid spec. You should be able to heal raids or be a solid off tank. Play whichever you enjoy more or even both. Try to get into the server discord there’s usually guild recruitment and you can find great hardcore or casual guilds depending on what you want.
---
Census data was out months ago. People should have payed attention back then. I currently enjoy balanced pvp on my server.
---
If you’re interested in being a DPS role end game and not much in healing I’d switch to the Hunter.  
---
I’m not saying that absolutely no guild will let you into raids as DPS in either Feral or Balance but most will expect Druids to heal or off tank in end game content for the most part. 
---
Hunters actually aren’t that common in Classic as they were back in Vanilla in my experience.  They do still kind of have the stigma of being the “noob” class but I’d honestly pass that title to Mages in Classic.
---
You dont have the 10rage/40en talent.
---
Flamelash horde here, my mate tried to do the hunter epic quest yesterday but couldnt survive in un’goro for longer than 30 seconds without getting jumped by 3-5 Alliance, so he has to git gud too i guess
---
How can i increase blizz damage? I see many video of people That does 170 + per tick while i do like 135 did i forgot a talent ?  Ty
---
Alliance mages hate him.
---
You won’t believe this simple trick that horde hunters are doing
---
Do you think I get to play the game when I have to die 10-15 times from the first ramp of DM to the dungeon entrance?
---
Before you say “just get a group and wipe them lol”, you have to understand there’s around 40 of them, and it’s the same shit for strat, scholo and BRM.
---
because that's how it was back in 1.12, there were a bunch of battlegroups and each had 15-20 servers in them that were pooled together for bgs
---
Now you can
---
From what I’ve read it was added in Vanilla as a way to try to stop ganking in BRM.  Alliance could just run over the side, swim down, and get into MC.
---
I feel you man. Five eyes in the last five kills. And I'm the only hunter. Haven't got the Onyxia sinew in five kills either. I guess I'm low on luck.
---
"Mom bathroom!"
---
Fuck do I know about wow forums
---
Point is honorbuddy was always save up to the end of wod (last time I've used it)
---
Neatplates
---
Yeah keep being delusional while your wife thinks about the divorce
---
You sound toxic. :&gt;
---
...is she a hot elf? :X
---
It's made worse because the server caps are much higher. But you'd still be getting ganked regularly in STV and Hillsbrad.
---
Also, private servers operated around 2k total online. So...way less than what Vanilla even operated at. ^ - ^
---
I started Nov 2006. Forum was still full of delicious tears of people getting ganked on (ZOMG!) PvP Servers. My point still stands. This was to be expected. If you didn't see this coming a mile away, then that's on you. Reroll or quit, but stop playing the victim.
---
Ok thx will check 👍
---
You dont lose durability when being pked.
---
You don’t?
---
I see one huge reason. Money.
---
If they can autoclose any loot ticket with a canned response they don’t need to staff up to the same level as before. Saving money on support costs is very popular in today’s age.
---
It doesn’t have to be a perfect 50/50. I think the whole of PvP servers is around 55/45 H/A. So at least shooting for 60/40 is a good idea. 
---
And lol at the other person who replied.
---
\#nochanges
---
&gt;If you are unhappy with some distinctive Classic features which are removed in other versions of WoW
---
You're ignoring what I'm saying in order to make your stupid and generic dismissal work. 
---
I like the social aspect of classic, as I did when I played vanilla. What I don't enjoy is the 20 man deathballs roaming every zone because of the multiple things that DIDN'T HAPPEN IN CLASSIC you utter troglodyte.
---
You can:
---
1. Grab gear with "Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to (X amount)"
---
2. 3/3 Piercing Ice in frost talents
---
Ice Shards is a great talent for pretty much any frost spell EXCEPT Blizzard, since Blizzard doesn't crit.
---
Hm, any ideas how would you change that?
---
Good for a tank, especially a feral druid as they get an additional ~380% armour contribution from items
---
I’m a casual player. I thought the release of dire maul was more for us than those who had already for raid geared.
---
Lol no it wasnt. I was there for each phase of honor content and the server size of classic has dramitcally changed and altered the meta of this type of pvp. The smaller servers of vanilla actually allowed you to find somewhere to escape if you were being outnumbered. This is not the case for classic.
---
There are a couple guilds that have the same onyxia raid time as my guild and there are usually some flagged people on either side that have some battles. These battles happened before p2 and still happen now, though not everyone participates, just those who want to. Randomly running around the world, though, it's very rare to see anyone flagged (though it does happen).
---
the golden god
---
If threat is the issue fury/prot can help (you dual wield in almost all fights unless u really need the mitigation, then u toss ur shield on, but mirahs song is his best offhand with those options
---
They didn't have the database data.  They have all the source, why wouldn't they?  It's in a source control that goes all the way back to Warcraft 3.  They went over this in the panel from last year's blizzcon.
---
Blizzard still bans in waves, because they want idiots to get complacent and think "Oh they won't catch me, they haven't banned anyone for months!".  Boom, now you catch way more people in one giant net rather than handfuls here and there.
---
@OP, I would suggest joining the Heartseeker Discord to find you for yourself. 
---
There is a channel in that discord that lets guild's post their current raid progression and on that page there are 30 Alliance Guilds and 19 Horde guilds that are claiming boss kills. Now we all know this is still a portion of the total population, but I brought this up to help show that the 35% Horde Population (65% Alliance 35% Horde as of the most recent Cencus Addon scans from 11/19/19) are healthy and striving in a "Alliance Dominated" Server. Please remember that Heartseeker by all accounts is still a low-mid sized server with about 5k-7k players online at anytime.
---
So up to you man. Enjoy and hope this helped put things into a better context!
---
Druids can burst in PvP it is just not their primary focus to win.
---
You want to kite and apply insect swarm and moonfire but you still can root someone and hit him with a big starfire crit.
---
Obviously if you look for a class which bursts much more consistently and more often rogue and hunter are better options.
---
T1 Gloves are good when you get your pvp blue boots.
---
This is what all the people who can't figure out how to stay alive and level on their server say to make themselves feel justified. 
---
I'm rank 4 on Fairbanks and I can absolutely assure you that there have been alliance death Raids roaming in Winterspring for days.
---
This post made me active Bloodfury for additional excitement!!
---
I played on a PVP server in vanilla and hate the current system, I'm not lvl60 (mostly alone)  yet so I'm a free meal for the roaming groups of alliance players who camp on some roads and in front of horde fp's, there are areas which are completely unplayable rigth now. That was never the case in vanilla...blizzard fucked up when they released honor system without BGs
---
Paladin tanks work if you have a druids spamming you with innervate other than that I'm gonna pass.
---
Didnt really get into retail tbh so correct me if im wrong:
---
Im priest healer full into holy and disc not a point into shadow. I cant DPS at all atm, wtf do i have really? Pain dot and smite and a couple others. Pretty shit. 
---
Duel spec would allow me to put points into shadow and whatever to make a second "class" on the same char pretty much. I could be full healer when i want or if someone wants dps i could switch to shadow without respeccing. I could be a Holy healer *and* a shadow priest technically.
---
I find that OP as fuck if thats how it works.
---
It's not meant as an insult, you absolute annoying person. There's two versions of WoW right now, so basically you got 4 options:
---
- play retail
---
- play classic
---
- play both
---
- play neither
---
You have all the freedom in the world to choose which option suits you best instead of playing the version without quality of life and then whining about not having quality of life because *muh time*. Nobody's forcing you to play.
---
As a rogue and a piece of shit, I usually wait for someone to blow their major CDs pulling multiple things. Then jump them at the worst possible moment mid fight. Ofcourse that's generally reserved for people that do the same to me, only to remind them that gimping a rogue can make your life hell.
---
Vanilla pvp servers were extremely fun. Bit of 1v1 leveling up, if you got ganked by a lvl60 you called in the guild, they called in the guild, and then the pvp raids ensured. Very rarely felt like a chore, it was rather an added flavor of danger. Other than that a few potshots and skirmishes around the bigger dungeons or the occasional city raids, but nothing abusive or game-breaking.
---
A shame classic pvp is such a cancer and nowhere near this.
---
What they need is something approaching faction balance on PvP servers.  Which could be accomplished with faction based queues on high pop servers.
---
Faction based queues should have been in from the beginning on PvP servers.  Then each PvP server would trend towards active player balance, with the players experiencing longer queue times trending to transfer off.
---
People would still complain, naturally.
---
At this point, what they need is PvP to PvE transfers, so that all the people who are experiencing buyers remorse can transfer their character rather than simply quit the game.  But since they're *preventing* outnumbered faction members from transferring off the most heavily populated servers, I don't see them taking steps to make anybody's life easier any time soon, and they probably don't give a fuck if a few people are ganked enough to quit.
---
Oh yeah, nothing quite as dynamic as spending half your gaming time corpse dragging yourself to BRM to try and run a dungeon.
---
As a warrior who still don't have his rank I had a 1v1 in ungoro with a guy with his trinket. Cost me so many consumes to win due to lack of trinket, but we get it soon so no worries. Still feels bad when you're on the shit end of the stick.
---
we both know blizzard will do the easy approach and just nuke the combat log anyhow in the end. they always take the easy route. remember the artifact weapons during legion,during the first part of 8.3 the empowered weapons had the effect on them that made the screen glow and the screen shook, but because of people who compalined over seziures,they nuked that before the end of the first week.
---
if too many complaints out there blizzard will do heavy handed approaches,which means the combat log is more then likely seeing its end of days,alongside all the addons u need for it.
---
Lol calm the fuck down.
---
NOONE'S IN ANY DANGER! How can I make that any more clear to you?
---
This is me
---
Ty. Great response. I'll let him know.
---
Pantheon has a great team behind it.  A LOT of Brad's work is already done and I trust the guys to bring his vision to life.  
---
I'm curious to see how Aradune will be memorialized
---
No matter how careful and polite you are going to be with this kind of an explanation, that's going to be strawmanned to "oh you tell me to go back to retail how nice" or "you tell me to fuck off, how nice", speaking from experience.
---
Melee and ranged (e.g. hunter) but not spell. Spell crit is granted when it explicitly says improves your chance to get a critical strike *with spells* by 1%
---
I charged a warrior 5 levels lower than me, hamstrung, stepped back, waved and said /hi.   
---
Poor fella looked so confused.
---
Ah gotcha. No wonder it's not talked about.
---
&gt;, you absolute annoying person.
---
the troglodyte content to imagine things and address those rather than address what I have actually said finds me annoying? How will I sleep tonight?
---
You're a collosal waste of time.
---
You can also get sappered by and handful of rogues if you are that grouped and then you all die.
---
That guy is being toxic just ignore him.
---
You guys looking for warriors? I was actually thinking of transferring myself.
---
Lol, like faction based transfers alter the fact that the realms in question weren't already horribly imbalanced.  The alliance wouldn't have left in droves if the servers were balanced in the first place.  But ok champ.
---
The point that you're missing, CLEARLY, is that pservers used BLIZZARDS OWN CLIENT. So YES, they were what vanilla WoW WAS and SHOULD BE.
---
And why am I here? Because Blizzard can do better.
---
Why would anyone pass on an upgrade? Just bid like 1 DKP for it and you get it for free if no one outbids?
---
I have told several members of the guild that they mean the world to me in passing conversations. I'm sure they have no idea exactly how much, but I do nice things for them like give free ports/water/food when I see them on my mage, or do funny things like send random objects in the mail like rose off-hands or 42-pound red gill fish along with poems or funny memories. I am almost always upbeat in game and try to put smiles on faces as much as possible. Thank you so much for taking your time to leave such a lovely comment, this is a great start to my day!
---
I agree. I'm still sub-60 on a PvP high-populated server. It's a tough go trying to do anything in and around Blackrock Mountain. For me, I relish the challenge as a non-hardcore player to hopefully help build me into a better version of myself. At the same time, if you aren't having fun playing a game (which is meant to be fun), reroll on PvE, wait till BGs, or leave (cancel sub/go back to retail). It's not good for you emotionally to hate something that's meant to be fun. All you're doing is helping the people you "hate" by farming your corpse while you're pissed off.
---
It's no deathball though. A coordinated 10 men group with 8/10 people being engineers, FAPs and dedicated raidPvP gear is much harder to overcome than 3 people synergizing their classes. 10 properly prepared players easily can overcome 25 randoms riding around together. 
---
Anyways why wouldnt I play with a shaman and a priest as warrior if my shortcomings are absorb shields generating no rage, snares and roots? Why wouldnt I want windfury to make 2k damage into 4k by some totem boi?
---
I dont complain that I play warrior and get dumpstered by warlocks with void walker, spriests, hunters if they get the drop on me, frost mages, druids, can't kill holy paladins without support etc. Sometimes I cant even break an spriests shield before I'm dead. Such is this game, therefore I find avenues to increase my class' strength by synergizing with others. Nothing wrong with that.
---
If you are getting 3v1'd in a *massive multi*player game, it's your own fault to go out into the world on your own.   
---
The environment in itself is supposed to be dangerous. Players are part of this environment.
---
Laughs in server transferred to a medium pop and not having any problems we can’t handle.
---
I see, thanks for breaking it down.  Seems like a lot of people have strong opinions one way or the other.
---
Ah the daily whine post about spy.
---
That's gonna happen whether or not Blizzard allow these transfers though, doesn't matter if those players quit the game or move to a PVP server.
---
give it time OP,most people will take off after this next week. blizzard probably will start to see a surge of unsubs pretty soon. the interesting part will be how much they get hit,we will see who are the gankers..and who are the victims. only time will tell,the gankers will be the ones who stay.
---
the thing is, that you're never going to please people. Never! There is so many folk playing there will always be whiners. Folk cried about release and fighting for mobs, about layers, about queues, then it was QQing about DM not being released, now its about people PvPing in groups, farming honor and faction imbalanace.  
---
Once Bgs are out, it will be that Premades are ganking non-premades and facerolling WSG and AV against pugs! This subreddit will be littered with posts about pugs v premades.  Then onec BWL is on Farm, it will be that PvE gear is way better than PvP gear and they are being pwnd by PvE'ers and want access to their gear! 
---
Seriously, maybe some folk should cut their loses. 
---
If they are not having fun, go play something else, its that simple!
---
Do you have the discord link or do you know where i can find it? It's much appreciated !! Thank you for you answer.
---
Lol twice, once was alone tho, strange what you guy won’t believe here.... the ave skill of the player must be one who cannot walked from BS to SW
---
Ashkandi [US]?
---
Blast wave has the same animation as sapper but the dude doesn't have a sapper in his inventory.
---
Desmond the moon bear!
---
It's an inherent flaw in the design of vanilla that is exacerbated by the higher population.  Server caps were lower at launch but were raised significantly to help with queues.  We're paying the piper for that now.
---
This is an indictment of modern game design.
---
I second this. I've been using Zygor in Retail for years but Zygor classic is not a speed leveling guide. More like a  "chill and explore" guide. It has a TON of over walking around the world. This is not a fast guide. More like a completionist guide. It does however automate most things just like guidelime.
---
Why? I would think them risking to go solo inside an enemy HQ surrounded with only enemies and killing people there on their own is a lot less of a low move than roaming around in a kill squad ganking single players leveling up.
---
One amazing aspect of EverQuest was that the developers created the world but players were the ones who determined what to do. In WoW, we have quests that lead you to different zones and continents where you'll discover new quest hubs and instances.
---
In EQ, there weren't any instances and this created a LOT of server drama every time a rare world boss was up. Think Onyxia's layer, but only one guild on the server could kill her every week.
---
Due to the lack of instances and quests, leveling was done in groups (only a few classes could solo effectively) and there was a lot of downtime and networking between pulls. EQ was truly the king of player socialization because NOTHING worthwhile could be done without grouping. Your server was your home, and word got out on who was a good puller, a good tank, a good healer, etc. Those who were toxic were ostracized in the community.
---
We just saw this with Jokerb or whatever for ninja looting. The difference in EQ though was that it could take a LOT longer to level than it did in WoW, so re-rolling wasn't always an option.
---
So thank you Brad for giving a lot of us some great memories in the MMO arena.
---
If you want to read some interesting EQ stories, someone years ago did an [iAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1cy607/everquest_old_stories_and_ama_by_popular_request/) regarding early EQ and some of the wonky exploits he discovered!
---
So I finished levelling my Human Warrior to 60, and I’d like a caster for a change to do a bit of farming and making gold
---
The decision is between Warlock and Mage (both Gnome)
---
I like the utility of Warlocks, with being able to summon, create healthstones, and the damage output in endgame is amazing and I like that the class seems to be quite involved with its rotation
---
For Mages, AOE farming looks very fun and I’ve been watching lots of videos of farming for the Archmage pattern which looks fun and a good way to earn money - also amazing DPS but overall a bit more boring
---
Both seem to be equal in levelling speed. But I really can’t decide which class to stick with
---
I get the appeal of 1v1, but if I see a faction-mate getting ganked, I'm going to help them. I'm not going to sit back and watch them die, and then finish off the half-health ganker.
---
I'll do whatever I feel like and there's nothing you can do about it, thanks.
---
For context, I was talking about game systems.
---
Justify what? Doing what everyone does since 2004?
---
P.S. the people who complain are usually just some lvl 57 or something trying to level.
---
I think you a word.
---
Yes it would have.
---
Unfortunately at level 44 if your son plays correctly you will never be able to win unless you get really lucky with crits or resists. 
---
As others have stated, berserker rage makes you immune to fear. It also breaks fear if you are already feared.
---
Charge in and switch to berserker stance and open with hamstring. Make sure you stay on him with your auto attacks and be patient.
---
Do not dump the first 30 rage you get on mortal strike yet. Your pummel costs 10 rage and you need to be sure to interrupt his first cast. His first shadow cast will likely be fear, go ahead and pummel this and use your next 30 rage for mortal strike. 
---
If you miss pummel and get feared and break it with your berserker rage make sure you re-engage your auto attack. If you successfully pummel get ready to break the next fear he does with your berserker rage.
---
At this point he may begin to panic. Make sure you keep another 10 rage pooled to interrupt his next spell as your pummel is coming off cooldown.
---
At this point the duel is kindof in his hands. If he plays proper he is going to win, but if he messes up you have a chance. The only thing you can do is stay on him and don't miss a pummel on a shadow spell. When he death coils you make sure you are spamming intercept as much as you can to stun and and stop him from casting. 
---
If he plays proper he is going to sacrifice his voidwalker and wait out your beserker rage. After that you're going to get deathcoiled and feared until you die. If he panics and coils you while you are still immune to the follow up fear you have a chance by intercepting him and pummeling his next fear. 
---
Couple of high level tips: When he casting a fire spell you have to be in front of him for the cast to go off. Run through and around him like a fucking maniac to try and get behind him before the cast goes off.
---
If you really want to super cheese him go to the AH and buy a restorative potion. Use this a couple of seconds after the duel starts. https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9030/restorative-potion
---
He's gona be super confused as to why his dots keep falling off and costing him the extra globals is a huge pain in the ass as well as saving you HP when the dots get cleansed off by the potion. If you get super luck you can even clear off deathcoil with one of the ticks.
---
Every time I see a lowbie and think about being merciful, I remember all the times I was ruthlessly smashed and camped while trying to level and I just can't bring myself to stay my blade.
---
none - it cant be changed. Its a vicious cycle...once you've been ganked over and over, you'll do the same and want to wreak havoc on the other faction the 1st chance you'll get.
---
Been playing on a 13 inch MacBook for the past few days. Works OK.
---
I like to sheep the lowbie Horde and let them quest and play the game. Unless they're rogues. They can get fucked.
---
Are we the tasty treats?
---
think chance to spawn resets when honor gets calculated. might be a bug
---
Bravo, hilarious :D
---
All Gnomes are KOS. Even for Alliance.
---
Weird, my experience is the same on a PvE server. Sometimes the Horde have control over Hillsbrad, sometimes the Alliance, but there's always a back and forth. I've actually had some really awesome PvP moments, and there's no bullshit deathballs running around giving everyone no honor and no fun.
---
If you think about it for a moment, you'll probably realise the people calling out people for rolling on a PVE server probably aren't the ones asking to transfer off. They're probably the same ones callling people out for complaining about being corpseganked 24/7 or asking for the transfer.
---
Ok but pls do post an update lol I’m so invested in this story now
---
Ah yeah, you're right, I was more thinking of stuff like mounts etc which came later from memory, but the shop was already there.
---
This could've been cool, but instead of it just being only your player house, it's 39 other people, and you can choose to join a "neighbourhood" where you either get 39 other randoms and those will be your neighbours for the rest of time, or a way so that raiders can all have their own neighbourhood. I'd suggest guilds but I believe that would end up being to many houses and it's still got to somehow fit within a certain space elected. You could also have your homies come visit. It's a similar design to how WoD had it's garrisons, but built in to be more community like, which is also gold gated. It'd make gold have a use for cosmetics, and introduce more crafting plans for different professions. It's an interesting idea to make the game more than just PvP or PvE. Another idea would be like a guild house, and the guild has to build it up and eventually you have this castle thing that all your guildies could hang out in, and this is where the guild bank should be. All cities can get a guild house, but you can only choose 1 and every city has unique plans etc, for example, Humans get castles, nelfs get a huge tree thing and so on. Might actually make people want to venture to Darnassus more for some sick tree houses. Tell me what you think.
---
Enjoying the Matt Daemon series, keep it up!
---
Yea I mean I’m just explaining part of why you’re getting downvoted.
---
good story
---
I love this comment so much. It's so awesome you have kept in touch with your gaming friends for so long - that's huge! I think one of the great things about making online friends is that it's easier to meet more people who have similar interests than it is offline since people congregate to places to share those things in a digital format, so you often gravitate towards people with a similar vibe. One of the nicest things about being in my "unfortunate situation" is I have literally built a family in real life and online full of positive people. They say you can't choose your family, but I essentially have.
---
"I don't enjoy being toxic and putting people down, I don't enjoy being around toxic people that are putting others down, even if its not me. I try to be positive because you never know what others are going through, and being kind and lifting people up is free."
---
I couldn't have said it any better. Thanks for stopping by.
---
He means the title of the post
---
No, this is ridiculous. We are paying for the subscription, we have friends and communities on the server. To be forced into long queues just because you can't handle PvP is a new level of entitlement.
---
I like to demo shout them on top of that. Make them have a harder time killing the mob. 
---
Sometimes they die. But that’s a risk I have to take.
---
Placed 64 with 63k honor (rank 4). Rank 1 on venoxis(ger) was 140k on horde
---
extremely is supposed to be exciting. I can't even blame autocorrect on this once cause i am on a desktop PC. Wtf, brain.
---
&gt;I played vanilla. The things I am complaining about weren't a thing in vanilla. 
---
Please don't contradict yourself. Vanilla at the phase of "honor system without BGs" was insane. Now add the obvious reality of:
---
1. Much bigger server size.
---
2. People preferring Horde for pvp racials.
---
3. People eagerly expecting and praising world pvp to the point ton of them play classic for this sole purpose.
---
and you get the situation predicted several months ago, supported by polls, censuses, warnings and so on. 
---
You are clearly angry and in denial, trying to justify your ignorance won't bring you anywhere: just accept your losses and move on, it's much better than waste your mood while being farmed for honor on a daily basis.
---
You will want to maintain rank 3 throughout the game anyways. Wiped a bunch on some boss in later raids? These 14g repair costs now become 12,6g. Shit adds up.
---
Yes, yes, you're hunter. You're surviving anyways. &gt;:(
---
I'm glad this was acknowledged, i woke up this morning and was going to make my own thread if there wasn't one. This guy deserves a lot of acknowledgement
---
Here comes the moneeeeyyyyyy. Here comes the money. MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY!
---
Which is why spy shouldn't be a thing because you should have been a victim of the great purging of that tree's denizens.
---
Thanks, I did not realise it worked like this.
---
hopfully Phase 3 doesnt come this year. I'd be happy with early January. Then Phase 4 easter......etc. I hope they dont rush Phase 5 or Phase 6. Naxx should be 18mths at least or hopefully 2yrs away!
---
Mage. Farm well, spend nothing on food and water, sell ports, etc.

cba to go download another addon so I'm with ya!

Horde exclusive
---
“It’s just nostalgia” 😂 
---
Yeah of course it is!
---
That is referring to block value. Which is what determines how much damage you actually block.
---
Disney + has High School Musical: The Musical: The Series... yes that's really the name of the show.
---
I'm sure you might run into a couple of warriors that don't like to share, but I did a ton of dungeons leveling to 60 and healed probably 90% of them, I never really had any problems getting invited to groups.
---
I thought I edited it afterwards. Guess it didn’t update. I skipped Flametongue Totem* you can make an argument it’s useful in dungeons before you have wf totem, but it’s personal preference really.
---
Fire Nova Totem and Magma Totem generate threat
---
I haven’t played much since the transfer (work + new born) so I couldn’t tell. I’ll need more play time to give an answer! Definitely quieter than Sulfuras (and first time my mooncloth didn’t sell on AH!), but being able to stay alive more than 2 minutes is totally worth it :)
---
Wait what did you report to the mods lol? I mean a bunch of people thought you were being a dickhead and that’s exactly why people downvote.
---
Prices vary from server to server. On mine as horde it's around 250-300g. But then you don't have the tankadins in the market which the shield really is for.
---
Made an edit
---
Seems like you're right about those, I need to widen my horizon and explore more areas!
---
Maybe you meant to say extremely exciting!
---
And that information wasn't as easily accessible to the general public (wowhead, icyveins).
---
How you could exploit the PvP system , min/max method etc all were relatively new back in 2005.   
---
It's a lot different in 2019.
---
In dungeon if SB crits, mob most likely dies before it comes to you anyway (if all dps focus same target), or you just get a hit or two, no biggie.     
---
In raids, yeah, it could be sketchy. If you are close to pull aggro away from tank, switch to wanding or use the time to tap and bandage. Once your tanks will starts dualwield tanking(you said your tanks are undergeared, so wouldnt recomend dw tanking to them atm), aggro wont be real issue anymore.
---
Fuck i hate retailers whinging.
---
I would put money on you fucking up loot.
---
Please enlighten me, i dont see any addon that would be impacted by a : "Reduce range of the opposite player faction for spells that don't impact our self/party/raid to 15 yards".  
---
If you have just one, i would be really interested to know.
---
You understand that quote was supposed to be viewed as self serving confirmation bias blind to the facts of the situation, not an actual critique of the concept of points of view right?
---
Even with pet passive macro FD&gt;trap doesn't always work. This guy is clearly BM  so he doesn't have scatter shot.  
---
So yea if his trap macro doesn't go off (which it doesn't majority of the time), this guy would be screwed no matter what he does
---
Worthy guess if I say so myself
---
lol it's true
---
I got my wife hooked over the weekend and she put in 24 hours in 2.5 days lol so at least I don't feel as bad having 20+ days played now
---
On the wow site, where you would go to transfer a toon
---
Just collude with everyone else going for it.  Which will be easier to do because they will most likely be in your premade.

---
&gt;ently trying to do my Hunter Epic Bow quest. I tried doing it at an unholy hour (3 AM) but still horde managed to find me at the edge of the map o
---
Im 55 Alliance hunter. Thought I\`d give the Onyxia quest a try, so I went to Burning Steppes 05:30 AM. Mayhbe I at least can get a few mobs. Boom. Dead upon landing. Res on the other side of map. I did "/who burning steppes" and I was litterely the only alliance in the zone. Imagine being such a wanker you just sit all night camping in an empty zone. He didnt even get any honor points from me, lol.
---
alternating on rested is a good idea. I also have a Tauren warrior that is level 15.
---
Pvp servers are magical when people on different factions cooperate. 
---
Just like in real life, the ability to do something cruel and not do it is the thing that makes being good mean anything at all.
---
Thank YOU! :D
---
Just look at stats. BiS is overrated. Obviously if you get a BiS item use it.. but unless you're a min/maxer you can still clear MC/Ony without BiS gear.
---
Jesus, you are next level soft
---
In the beta too along with my now passed on brother. Unfortunately, we missed the big end fight. We had fun though!
---
Its like $.30 per g rn usually, 1k is around $250
---
Phase 2 has me hiding in Scarlet Monastery trying to grind out my epic mount. As a DW fury warrior it's a little slow but I'm making progress. It appears to be my best option in order to escape world PvP, and running group instances during the week is tough for me given my schedule.
---
So, my question involves my plan to drop skinning and pick up enchanting in order to disenchant the items that I'm getting in SM. This could potentially have a two-pronged effect: the mats seem like they would be worth more on the auction house than the vendor price, and it would convert the greens/blues I'm getting into stackable items, which would save bag space, which would allow me to go longer without having to go to town to vendor.
---
Does this make sense? Are the enchanting mats likely to be worth more than the vendor price? If I look at Ravager for example, it vendors for 1g89s, while according to my addon the enchanting mats are worth closer to 3g.
---
Because you have to weave your autoshot and movement while judging exactly where 40yard radius ends. Not everyone has played hunter for 15 years...
---
I like the challenge of killing another player(s). Raidlogs, 5v1's aren't fun for me, even on the winning side. It baffles me that they didn't at least drop WSG with p2.
---
I've only been to the cities in Vietnam, with a short trip to a rainforest, but considering the amount of crocodiles I saw I have to agree with you!
---
Regarding Searing gorge I can't tell if you're joking or not, since I have no idea how it looks.. But from looking at some maps I can definitely see the similarity.
---
ok let me tell my uncle at microsoft
---
Wouldn’t be an issue if you roll PvE
---
It was always lifesteal or crusader back in the day. Lifesteal is better for drawn out fights or sustaining. Crusader is best for giving you a big window to burst down an enemy when it procs.
---
&gt; which is much faster and simpler than implementing all the various APIs for each addon, not to mention maintaining it.  
---
The TSM implementation is surprisingly simple. You can take a glance and make that judgement on your own though.   
---
&gt; I'd have to import it to my own database anyway
---
Instead of adding it to your database you simply call your wrapper method when you need the price.  
---
&gt; ... so there's not much benefit from that, apart from these extra 30 sec scan.  
---
The main benefit of this is that you're pulling a price that's likely built up of a history of other scans. For example in BootyBayGazette exposes mean prices for the past 3 and 5 days as well as the medians for both of those. Or the TSM price which is based on many individual users scanning and submitting that to a central source. 
---
The major draw back of doing a single scan is that it's not fully informed. I'm not sure if you're keeping a history of scans but even if you are the best case scenario is a user who scans between farm sessions, which is likely infrequent at best.  
---
In the end it's obviously up to you. I just see it as an opportunity to improve a core piece of the addon by providing accurate pricing. I'll use it either way :)
---
Because FD&gt;trap doesn't work most of the time
---
was said on the fourms,they had DMB listed,threat meters as well,and a few others. i wouldnt be surprised anyhow. alot of addons have to be part of blizzard's API to work,so even if im wrong here. if they break spy there is a 99% chance something is going to be effected. there always is.
---
If they don't do what I suggested you are right about that. For the dominant faction it is not fun either.
---
Spy is pretty bullshit regardless of faction balance
---
rofl
---
Winterspring is like a slaughterhouse on my server. Grinding alone is an impossibility for either side.
---
My dad is Blizzard and he says he will fight your uncle.
---
I’m a lvl60 ARMs Warrior tanking (with shield) end game dungeons casually with my friends (lvls 56-60). At this time we don’t have plans for raiding. Should i be swapping to PROT?
---
Healers haven’t complained much about my damage yet and while I’m still able to hold agro on mobs it’s really hard to keep it off my DPS at times. From what I’ve seem PROT just helps with damage mitigation an not threat/agro which seems to be my bigger concern.
---
Yeah these dudes are all over Benediction too. https://i.imgur.com/PI7FZlS.jpg
---
How about no
---
I use mind blast on cool down.  It is my main move, and i try to make sure that I have a good tank that is keeping aggro.  If not use fade to lose aggro and then repeat!
---
Outstanding move bro! I did the math and have a solid 30% lifetime on classic since release... more than work hours... Imma chill a bit now lol
---
Check out a website called sixtyupgrades, it takes a teeny tiny bit of setup but it's quite comprehensive.
---
&gt; well i did play vanilla, and it was just like this. 
---
And then you go onto explain exactly how it was nothing like this.
---
what why lol
---
Well he is correct. You guys asked exactly for this so don't whine now that your getting ganked.
---
How effective is dungeon grinding for leveling relative to questing?
---
Also, is it better or worse gold?
---
Grobb - US!
---
I actually just resubscribed and also transfered from a higher pop Server to low/medium pop... so well, I don't think so.
---
Agreed, 40k on offer at level 59.
---
&gt;DMB  &amp;  threat meters  
---
I'm not talking about monster, just the opposite player faction. And only spells that don't affect our group. So i don't see how it could affect them.
---
That's true tho pallys are only good at bubble hearthing.
---
arms until mortal strike, then you got some point sleft for either some fury or prot.
---
Why did any adult make a pvp realm character? We've still got a very controlled and enjoyable SS vs Tarren on pve realms. By controlled i mean it doesn't matter if your faction is outnumbered 10to1 because the stronger side always regroups outside of their city after a decisive engagement, it doesn't run amok and starts corpsecamping because no1 would rez then. And it's going on 0/24.
---
You remember layering, right?
---
17/34 fury build typically has one point in Overpower, which increases crit chance by 25%. 
---
This increases the likelihood that it would be worth switching to battle stance to use Overpower as long as you're not going to lose much / any rage by doing so. 
---
Someone more theorycrafty than myself could probably tell you exactly when it's worth switching and when not, but I personally will switch as long as I'm less than say, 35 rage or so. If possible I will try to dump rage prior to switching.
---
My PvP ego isn't big enough yet that I feel the need to record every 1v1 I've hadto post online. Yet...
---
It's like 5 hours of boring for every 5 minutes of exciting, but goddamn if those 5 minutes aren't the best five minutes you'll ever experience in an MMO. 
---
Then someone steals all of your money with a margin trading scam.
---
Just look at the map of vietnam and stv. Searing gorge does not really look like the 38th parallel since there is no fighting in the giant hole in the ground, but it is as much slaughter as in korea on the 38th parallel (sounds really bad how I wrote it, respect to the fallen)
---
Do you want a prize ?
---
 It's like the thrill of being next to the executioners switch. Knowing that at any moment you could throw it. But knowing you never will. But you could. Never isn't the right word, because, I could....and I might...I probably will.
---
(rewatching IASIP right now I'm just loving it even more!)
---
I know
---
We're not here to use google for you.
---
God damn take my upvote sir..well played 👍🏻
---
Dire maul wasn't released to early tho, i wasn't' lvl 60 either when it dropped, but it's just an extra 3 endgame dungeons added to the mix
---
&gt;fore 
---
As of the Cencus Addons from last night (11.19.19), Heartseeker is now 65% Alliance and 35% Horde. That is during Primetime (7-10pm EST), we are looking at about 3k Alliance Players and 1.8k Horde Players online and averaged over that time period.
---
&gt;where the only winners are factions that will be left queueing for all eternity for a BG to pop next phase
---
Why?
---
Ya, I found some cool people back in SFK and WC that I have been sticking with.  We have all kind of leveled at the same pace, and whisper each other to hop into some groups.  Cool guys, we have a ton of fun together and every one is cool with loot
---
While balance among classes has never been a goal in Classic WoW, I think this is a very fair point.
---
I've been leveling an alt paladin there, up to lvl 34 now. I've seen and have fought some horde, they're definitely outnumbered but I havent seen tons of alliance deathsquads around, even in STV. 
---
Thus I can't definitively say you wont be honor farmed at end game zones but I know on my original realm I couldnt run through STV without getting murdered by Horde (as a 60 druid). In fact I got corpse camped by some punk lvl 60 warrior in STV on my pally alt 2 days ago.
---
8-10g is nothing for someone who already has a lvl 60 main making money. Plenty of people just want the quests done fast.
---
If you took time to read the rules of reddit. You would find that you are not supposed to downvote people because you have a negative opinion of what someone says.

I think mounts might have come later. I played all of wrath and remember getting Christmas pets like lil rag and lil KT.

Imagine believing AskReddit. What a fucking idiot you would have to be.
---
I knew exactly what to expect and I love it.
---
It says that whether you were flagged or not.
---
If you are a melee class SwoleBenji has a 1-40 grinding guide
---
Ah yes, the cherry to our resistance.
---
Because there is just none who would be affected.
---
if you have finkles and your guild still needs ony scales you shouldnt drop skinning.
---
otherwise i would say go ahead.
---
you only need enchanting skill1 to disenchant everything.
---
so, once you are done with sm farming you can look into other professions that might be more beneficial to you :).
---
There is also the fact that revisiting MC or MC in later phases will still be viable due to the fact that with retail, you can go from being a fresh 120, do a couple of dungeons and enter the new raid on normal mode until you've got enough epics to try harder modes. And it don't matter cause in 2 weeks you gonna have full epics because free rolls exist, loot is personalised. Try doing that in classic, you just got 60, have all blues, couple prebis, and you try and enter AQ40. There is no preparation in Retail. It's just doing higher damage, having more healing or stronger tanks. MC requires specific playstyles in different situations, which revolved around some gear types.
---
I'll believe it when I see it.
---
yes it is.
---
You are the dumb one ;D talking like Spy makes it LiTeRrAlLy ImPoSiBle to play rogue or cat drood. xD funny how nobody knows how to play this game apparently.

For me, I like the pvp and I don't care about getting ganked by a group of 5-10-15-40 however many is w\e.  I've been on both sides.  I think the shitty part is the camping.  I get it, your group of 5 killed me while I was herbing, but why the need to camp for 20 minutes?
---
The term meme was coined in the 1970's but memes have been around a lot longer than that.
---
your going to be sorry when your server turns into a ghost town. its what happened in retail,not everyone left pvp servers because of the game itself, it was people like you who ran them off.
---
its people like you who are going to turn classic into a self fulfilling prophecy,either blizzard is going to cave and shift something major to deal with the ganking,or your servers become a ghost town and blizzard has no choice but to throw on CRZ. because lets be real,they wont merge...otherwise retail wouldn't have 40-60 servers.
---
pvpers are only going to hurt themselves in the long run,and I honestly cannot wait to see u suffer as much as the people you make miserable.
---
ts a valuable item for everyone, and everyone needing is a better alternative to hoping everyone greeds, what is so difficult to understand? Even if you're going to equip it after you won it, that is still a raw gold value you've just received from getting the item, because now you dont have to go buy it from the AH later since you "need" it so much. The value of the item is literally equal for everyone whether or not they are equipping it
---
Or NToV clears. The original 5+ hour raids. This sucks, I was so hyped for Pantheon. :(
---
hahah :D correct!
---
Thanks mon, I'm a troll rogue, yeah, I'll be checkin' that out!
---
Yup, I just take it on the chin when trying to do my daily bits and pieces and if it gets too much log off and do something else
---
It will calm down when bgs are out
---
So many realms going to be 90-100/10-0 if they allow unrestricted character transfer.  They just need to release BGs to stop the gankfest and at least make it tolerable for alliance.
---
I've been dual respecing every week for a while now, still not to 50g yet, almost, but not quite

The price hovers around 400-500 on Skeram-A, managed to snag mine for 300. I wouldn’t settle for less than 300 if I were you.

Lmao good for him.
---
I noticed one of these on my server in the same spot in UC. The farmers had leveled it to level 7 for some reason. I guess to avoid automated detection somehow?
---
That wouldn't make any sense then. Because that would mean Drillborer Disk has 69 Block Value and Malistar's Defender has 52 Block Value. Which means the ONLY stat that Malistar's Defender has over Drillborer is marginally higher armor. If that was the case then these best in slot spreadsheets wouldn't declare Malistar's Defender as better than Drillborer.

I kept every single piece of every single tier set for years.

What were they supposed to do, redesign the game cause you’re not NEET any more? Im cutting my losses on this community, where half the posts are straight up pouting. Stop.

I want everyone to stop complaining about it when they did it to themselves.
---
Rise and reign are both very competitive guilds on the alliance side. They're just be fed mats beforehand. The server will have enough mats to complete the AQ event within the hour.
---
Thanks for the guidance. I’m a lvl 19 warlock and on a PvP server (Thunderfury). Also in the horde. 
---
I’m guessing there will be safer places to grind though, right? Or is no where safe? lol
---
and where would I find one in the specified budget range?
---
So it's not possible otherwise?
---
We welcome everybody, regardless of their class, as long as they arent toxic and show up to raids if they signed up
---
Top 3 brackets is what I heard. So, top 2% of players.
---
what addon are you using for that SnD timer bar?
---
Ohh yeah now I see it!
---
Yeah I basically haven't been able to play/level on my horde character (unless I want to dungeon spam) because of Alliance ganking groups since the second servers went back up Thursday. Even before honor was on. Everybody is doing it lol.
---
I saw it on the AH for 469, but wasn't sure if that was what it was actually going for. I'll probably try to sell it for 450G in trade chat (no COD of course). Should juuuusssst about buy my epic mount.
---
&gt;has ~~payed~~ off
---
**paid*
---
It looks like BWL is 3 months away and I am sick of MC and Ony already.
---
Not all Horde!
---
You think I came back to this game to kill 15 year old bosses for purples???
---
Honor farm trading it looks like.
---
When you get a block, you reduce damage taken by your block value, which would be 52 in this case. Talents and some pieces of gear can improve that value.
---
doesnt matter,if it uses that API it can be effected regardless of use,you break an addon your risking anything else that is effected by it. monster,player faction,makes no difference.
---
remember when they broke the addon for every single census addon a month into classic? they didnt just nuke one addon, they nuked EVERY SINGLE ONE on that particular system.
---
Thanks sir. 
---
If I supplemented grinding mobs with dungeons would that possibly make up for the missed out quest items?
---
I should have been more specific, the concept of posting stupid pictures with boldface print existed. I’m aware it was coined by Richard Dawkins as a cultural analog to genes.
---
Scholo is BiS Dungeon Farm for any Caster/Healer. Dark Runes and Major Mana Potions (rarely seen, but do exist). Farming your own raid mats in a dungeon where you are mainly killing humaniods mean the gold you make as income, stays as income. 
---
Get yourself a crew that you can always rely on to do a fast efficient run. After raids I tank (Prot Pally) with the same DPS and healer combo and we got our runs to about 35-43 mins.
---
Yes. That's the 3.5%. There are a whole bunch outside of those who have realised how sweaty they need to be and that they aren't going to get there.
---
Is Runecloth rising in price on anyone's servers as well? On Horde Benediction it was hovering around 5s-6.5s each for a while and now it's closer to 7-8s each.
---
I can only assume phase 2 is to blame.
---
Or keep complaining! Who's gonna stop us? You?
---
But here you are, still throwing your wallet at the screen begging for more.
---
On packs 4 + , I'll usually charge , clap, swap to defensive, rage, sunder main , sunder second, taunt what's needed etc
---
Gonna be honest, I rolled a 36 mage, got bored, rolled a 51 lock, also got bored. Now that pvp is out all I want to do is pvp on my warrior.
---
Warrior will always be my favorite to play. I’ve tried the others and they’re all cool (especially Shamans) but warrior will always be my go-to.
---
You again! Have you seen that one molten core experience video? There is one awesome moment I wish you would draw the "at least nobody important died" scene. It it just too perfect
---
True for sure. I'm trying to help him realize he doesn't need anybody else's validation when making his own decisions. It's a valuable lesson to learn imo.
---
It will never leave my bag.
---
That’s not at all true of several classes. Are you perhaps playing a paladin?
---
No because you're too lazy to look for yourself, so you just assume there isnt for the sake of your argument. Get out troll.
---
It quite literally says that downvoting is for someone not contributing to discussion or dialogue and to many people they read what you said as being a dickhead to someone trying to answer your question. That is entirely within the bounds of downvoting. Crying to the mods about being downvoted is hilarious though. I’m done responding to this though.

In a DKP guild, but a healer put all they had down over me (mage) to get Choker of the Firelord last week. It happens.
---
Not being ganked and treated to a corpse run every 5 minutes is pretty fun, I'd say.
---
How can you argue that my inability to play the game is actually a success?
---
Laughing because I read an unironic bitching about PVP post where someone said they rolled on PVP for the implication or the threat of potential PVP
---
Once you get past last stand and improved shield block all the prot talents are threat oriented. 
---
12 rage sunders - threat
---
8 sec taunt - threat
---
defiance - threat
---
1h wep spec - threat
---
concussion blow - threat with some mitigation
---
Shield Slam - yeah thats massive threat and at 20 rage v 30 rage is a lot easier to hit on every CD.
---
As you see you can absolutely tank as Arms with a 1h+shield for endgame dungeons, but QOL is much better with deep prot
---
“And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.”
---
So my guild ran into something similar, they were running 30 people and were struggling, but once we got a full 40 man they were so surprised how much of a difference it made. Your guild is severely underestimating how much 10 more DPS really is, so IMO, Buy a flask, watch them fly through MC, and when they get to rag, just don't flask, if they notice and ask why you aren't using one just say that you don't think it'll be necessary. If they continue to pursue, figure out how much you like the guild and use it or sell it. They'll soon realise that it was a kiss easy fight with a 40 man and won't require you to take one every week.
---
Generally new raid groups that haven't got MC on farm will try and push the whole we need flasks thing, but it quickly dies down once they have cleared it.
---
Those old days of MMOs were so fun. Post-WoW everything kind of felt like a WoW clone. There just wasn't that much innovation in the space it felt like and that allowed WoW to remain king for so long. 
---
I was hoping Pantheon  would be able to reset some things as well as introduce something new into the genre. With Brad out of the picture I'm not too sure. We will see.
---
I know this comment was 4 months ago, but this topic is relevant to me now as I just started leveling a gnome rogue, and I'm reading into people's opinions. 
---
&gt;vanish security against dots
---
Stoneform still doesn't break magic or curse dots, so it doesn't guarantee vanish against locks, mages, priests, shamans or druids.
---
But I see from the many opinions in here that this is a very subjective topic and there is no clear answer what is better, it's all situational and up to preference. I love escape artist and I'll even still spec into imp sprint, just so I still have options after I fought a mage for example (even though 4x root break is still great on its own, but that's on a long cooldown overall).
---
I doubt a list of pre-pre-bis exists because, tbh, it really doesn't matter that much (to the point where someone would go out of their way to generate a pre list *for the pre list*. Anything with spellpower is your priority. Anything with int is your next priority. 
---
Off the top of my head:
---
Weapon: Hypnotic Blade from SM Lib
---
Offhand: Offhand from SM and then Drakestone from ST (of the Eagle or Frozen Wrath if you get super lucky)
---
Robes: Dreamweave Vest (BoE, tailoring) 
---
Hat: Dreamweave Circlet (BoE, tailoring) 
---
Gloves: Dreamweave Gloves (BoE, tailoring) -- alternate for poors: Red Mageweave
---
Pants: Red Mageweave
---
Belt, bracers, boots, cloak: I don't think there are many spell damage options before you start doing higher level dungeons anyway. Omnicast boots, Spritecaster cape, ban'thok sash are pretty easy to get out of the first half of BRD which you can start running at like 53 or something.
---
Sorry, no clue, I played a class likely worst for the grind so I haven't investigated it at all :)
---
No one's blaming the people ganking. The blame is on Blizzard for releasing so few servers at the outset, which is what has led to things being the way they are. Oceania had one - one server! - for everyone who wanted to roll PVP at name creation.
---
Yeah, and they don't share cooldown so it's pretty sick.
---
Of course, the drawback is being a warrior
---
I'm aware of how block value works, but that stat says "Block", not "Block Value". Are you implying that [Drillborer Disk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17066/drillborer-disk) has 69 Block Value? Originally I thought so as well but there are multiple source that declare Malistar's Defender as a superior item. It can't just be because of the armor.
---
KILROY WAS HERE
---
&gt; I am just not getting the current mindset here on reddit. You want to play on a pvp server and pvp but you only want some types of pvp? It sounds to me like you want a pve server you can pick and choose then.
---
I want to have the PvP we've had in Vanilla. Where most of the times skill actually mattered and roving groups and raids of 60's didn't exist or were very rare. I want to have the fun PvP back.
---
They removed the lightning effect in a recent update. I’m not sure if this was intentional.
---
Because of the 40 to 1 ratio. Imagine if a president got 40 of every 41 votes.
---
Poignant story.
---
While I don't actively see games as an escapism mechanism, I can certainly understand the appeal of using them to get a reprieve from rough IRL circumstances. And yeah I've certainly had good friends online, even over longish time periods of nearly daily talk, once a lot of physical proximity friends moved or drifted away.
---
Forgive me for not knowing the living bomb mechanics but why did the boss change aggro after he exploded?
---
Definitely. Damn this horrible out of context.
---
So as an alliance player my flight point was being camped by a 10 man group “no surprise”
---
I finally got away making my way towards BRD and noticed someone else rez 
---
Ahead of him was a low level undead rogue questing the warrior immediately charged him. Luckily the rogue popped off a cc and begin to get away
---
This warrior was typing in chat “KILL HIM!!!”
---
My only response was “really man?”
---
JUST PLAY THE GAME
---
I think questie was a nice middle ground between using wowhead constantly, and speed leveling.
---
In 49 with 6 days played on a priest using only questie and casual dungeons. My last time leveling with a guide, I got a Shaman to 60 in around 6 days using Joana.
---
Amazing that means I can blow another 100g and hopefully round off the last 3k I need for that darkspear exalted
---
Is this some irony to remind what became of us?
---
This and DKP cartels is why DKP sucks imo.
---
Only been in pugs so far, 3 full MC runs without any lock gear.
---
4th run, 3 pieces drop, lose em all.
---
Let's see if it changes today with first guildrun
---
&gt; you know what changed? the amount of people doing this kind of stunts
---
Yes, which is exactly why it is not like it was in vanilla.
---
Yesterday I took off my raid gloves an headpiece so I had only 6% hit and the amount of misses almost got me killed by lvl 46 mobs when I was helping out my friend with some quests. The single target dps is great, but pressing key 3 expecting a juicy mortal strike but then casting bloodthirst makes me feel I am playing rogue and doing sinister strikes lol
---
I thought this was a runescape screenshot lol
---
Like wtf...how do people use F keys for anything used in combat
---
Murmurmurmurmur
---
pve is the acception to this rule,i was talking pvp.....people have had to deal with assholes for 14 years,if this isnt nipped in the bud your going to either see a massive uphill surge in every pve server to the extreme they have no choice in putting layering back up,or people will just outright quit like they did in retail.
---
pvpers dont give a damn, as long as u bend over and die to them,they dont care about you
---
Had a night elf stop dead in the road and shadowmeld when they saw me coming 😭😭
---
Help in the form of some dude in a dress with a staff?
---
And this is why I immediately leave the zone after I demolish a rogue. I just know the rogue is going to follow me around for the entire time I'm in the zone, waiting for me to drop my guard.
---
Put a dot on them that barely doesn't kill them and watch them run in fear
---
No. It’s just a post about some fun I had haha
---
It would be pretty pointless and wouldn’t really make it easier. If anything, you double your odds of screwing up because both hunters need to get past everything, and the ping pong strat would rely on both hunters not having FD resisted. 
---
If you want to get into it, spec into improved FD and try your best to follow what the good DM runners do. You need to learn how to skip every pack by yourself. Having another hunter there isn’t helpful. You can learn a lot from watching people like Zeroji do sub-10m runs.
---
Every single group I was in did the opposite. We did need if need, greed if greed. You’re still just as bad as the “potential ninjas” you’re so scared of when doing that
---
Meta means “most effective tactic available”
---
20+ people pug honor farming isn’t even close to meta. It’s equivalent to MC pugging. Slow, clumsy, have to deal with idiots. Half the group isn’t on discord, people are randomly afking, etc 
---
Meta is small, skilled groups of 4-5 in a good comp with good gear, or playing a rogue in general (solo, or small groups of rogues)
---
Haha, thats how I roll, Im too kind to be a rogue... Errr I mean generous.
---
Wow Blizzard catering to the audience that will continue playing the game... CRAZY!
---
There is NO worse murloc quest in the game then the  Hand of Dagun portion of The Star, the Hand and the Heart. You need a single kelp drop from some murloc oracles out on an island in dustwallow. Had to kill well over 100 of the oracles, not including the other NPC types needed to clear. Murloc quests are miserable.
---
Not a mage or aoe farmer, bit if you're an herbalist SM might be a good option since it has stuff like fadeleaf you can harvest inside.
---
That's me
---
Is there a BIS list of only BOE's? I like playing the AH more than grinding dungeons, and I'm wondering how to best get geared for raids by just buying shit.
---
then friend groups/guilds would never change. that would be bad.
---
Oooh, it's just like in 2005 again. We're starting to get the genuine "I'm quitting WoW because of X, Y and Z." Posts again! Whoo!
---
I love it.
---
We had a bad domo chest and they gave us the loot the next day.
---
Not sure why they didnt fix your issue
---
that's from the 300 movie
---
This is a complicated one, and only you can answer. First, what loot system? If it's council, you can try talking to one of the officers and explaining your situation. If it's dkp, you're gonna habe to stick it out and build some up.
---
This is how vanilla raiding goes sometimes. There's not a lot of loot, and guilds don't want to give it to people who may not necessarily be as loyal to the guild. Try and get involved in other ways maybe if you can give more time. Help other people run dungeons, help with attunements, farm materials, etc.
---
If none of this helps, then you can always consider leaving, but I would suggest that if you enjoy the guild atmosphere and are raiding successfully, take a while before you make that decision
---
Just saying. My comment was intended to give you an idea of how well classic runs on something as crappy as a MacBook from 2016. Integrated GPU with a weak ass CPU.
---
We do loot council, was skeptical with that system but it has been great so far.
---
On the other hand I waited until yesterday for Rank 3 and have 300g instead of 100g.
---
So worth
---
lol yes, I'm not sure what happened there &gt;&lt;
---
rip brad, he made the greatest mmorpg that has ever been made, you may think wow is awesome but if you ever played everquest during its "vanilla" era you would think wow was dull and boring.
---
everquest felt like a true adventure, with real dangers around every corner, the pvp was also absolutely amazing because all the pve bosses and content was not instanced all pve was pvp'd for and pvp in everquest was nothing like it is in wow. every kill ment something and you couldn't just run back, each kill was a huge victory to your team and it felt to your core when you died because there were no easy corpse runs in everquest.
---
rip brad!
---
Well at least it's dropping for your guild.
---
Warriors have around 5 pieces of loot realistically they need from MC. Fury warriors are always one of the last classes to get geared, but they do the most damage without gear also. We run with around 6 fury warriors and last night got our first onslaught. But on average the other 5 warriors have ony necK(we prioritize warriors since they get shafted on loot) and 5 of them have gotten OEB. So they have about 2 pieces in 6-7 weeks. The only items they really need are quick strike ring(none have dropped for us), wristguards of stability, 2 rag drops and weapon drops but usually one of the last in line for weapons.
---
There were no warriors in group. If there were I would happily have passed if he did indeed need it. However, no one could use it. Thus, "all roll need" was called, avoiding any potential ninja opportunity, everyone had ample time to read the message and act accordingly. Everyone was stoked for me and happy to have a chance at it. The pixel farm continued.
---
sounds like a rogue
---
Too bad Spy exists.
---
Damn, takes a bit of time to get a group and so. No easy way to just go in and play for an hour then...
---
Add me swifttalon#1285 bnet .. Ill make a toon n help u out
---
Resto is by far the most usefull tree if you plan on healing. Not trying to state the obivious just look at the 3 trees. Ele has a lot of good stuff, enh has some sweet perks, but you can put 41 pts into resto tree without wasting a single one. It's not horrible for soloing either, longer fights but less downtime.
---
If you are a caster this could kind of work.
---
&gt; Paranoia 
---
Was created in TBC
---
This is a pure speculation. I speculate now that a good 25 of them would much prefer to actually have to PvP for their honor. Only a small part of the PvP community enjoys piling up on 5 dudes as 40 men raid to hopefully gain 20 honor.
---
It drains the fun for both parties.
---
Dual spec would be great.
---
I'd also LOVE if there was a way to play around with different talents for free. I've never played a rogue before classic, and there are sooooo many builds I want to try out. But I don't, because I can't afford it. I don't know if I would like the play style of them, and any of them perform well enough so I just stick with what I have. I actually REALLY want to try one out that I think I'd like (but might be wrong), but I can't afford t change specs twice if I hate it.
---
I'd love to see the price to respec decay over time honestly.

Cool story

38 hks for 1200 honor? Sheesh
---
Clap provides a low amount of threat since you can't use it in defensive stance and only affects up to 4 targets.  You're better off spamming Demo Shout in def stance for aoe threat.
---
Generally there is a minimum bid. My guilds is only 5 but I've heard 20 or more. 
---
The problem is some of the big ticket items are so good that you simply have to guarantee your slot if you want to be competitive later. For example, one warrior in my guild wanted bonereavers edge so bad he never spent a single DKP so that he would guarantee his slot at the top. Recently he had to miss a raid which put him in like 3rd place in dkp so he just quit the game.
---
Insane to me, but it can be like that.
---
1s1, 2s2, 2p6...

47 warrior nearly hitting. Been using WW Axe for God knows how long. How do I determine which weapon is an upgrade over ww Axe? Which weapons would you recommend hunting for? I playt as tauren.
---
Oh yes, I know the pains of grinding that neck - and it drops off the second last freaking boss! Ugh.
---
Well, it sure is a great upgrade if they could not get Animated neck - but other than the use for PvP/hybrid play, the only real difference is the Rag neck comes with intellect rather than spirit.
---
Did you get an alert telling you you’ve failed and then have isillien despawn? Because I sat around hoping Torino would show up but isillien timed out. 
---
The status in my quest log also has it as failed
---
I rolled horde because I love the horde and I hate night elves but I feel bad for you guys.  I know I wouldn’t stick it out if it was like that.
---
Yes, alliance is massively outnumbered by horde on most realms and that was expected from the beginning. People rolled alliance on PVP servers with an intention either to avoid PVP activity or to play guerilla with killing horde and changing location while avoiding obvious areas like BRM or DM altogether most of the time.
---
So Lord Kazzak and Azuregos?
---
I failed the quest 3 times now and just said fuck it and haven't gone back to try again in over a month I'd say. 
---
First time my disguise faded mid-escort. It only last half an hour and I had to wait for him to respawn so I could take the quest. 
---
Second time I logged out in the room he spawns in so my timer would pause, and then one of the times I checked, he had spawned so I was able to do it. He got to the bottom and was killed and my quest failed. 
---
The 3rd and final attempt, I had a full group of 5 people. We all followed him and we all stayed together. 4 of them passed the quest, and mine failed for absolutely no fucking reason. 
---
So yeah I'm done trying. Fuck that quest
---
/y Such is the price of curiosity.
---
Terrible guild
---
IGN Checks out.
---
You can play as soon as you are willing. If you want to play on your server and your faction has a massive majority over the opposing faction, then why shouldn't you have to wait your turn? You would have the option to server change to a server where your faction is in the minority, so you could play instantly if you took that route. 
---
My point is you have the option of playing in a fair environment. The players who are in the reverse situation have no options other than play on an unbalanced server or reroll.
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dz2ujv/my_level_16_shaman_looks_cooler_than_my_level_60/). 
---
You realize there’s ways to count active players right? Census can track names and keep them all logged to give you numbers on how many are playing at a time. And as I said to you in another comment we actually do know vanilla numbers from what John Staats said in his book as well Kern who said vanilla servers held between 2500 and 3000 players maximum. We get more than that on one faction alone.
---
Also he’s right. More people went horde this time because everyone talked about how godly their racials are for PvP.
---
I also enjoy it because I get a feel for every class and can see which one I'm best suited for. I discovered I enjoy warlock more than priest or mage, which I wouldn't have known had I only played the priest.
---
No, a warrior
---
Gearing in raids has always been slow. Drops are not guaranteed and the loot system you use is a factor. Is it rolls? You got bad RNG. DKP? Save yours for the piece you want! Loot council? Be a good and committed raider. 
---
If you're still not happy and don't want to be patient, find a new guild. This still won't guarantee drops.
---
If you're having to buy flasks I would question where any of the guild bank gold is going, most guilds I know of are saving them raid gold to provide either free or heavily discounted flasks to members in P3. But yeah, general consensus is don't waste flasks P1 unless you're going for some crazy logs, and probably bail from that guild if they try and enforce flasking for MC
---
it definitly does. :D
---
I wish I had better news but I’ve tried everywhere this whole week. You may have better results on your server because I’m on a pretty high population server on Grobbulus. It sucks cause questing is my favorite but it’s just not worth it :/ I hope they release bgs soon
---
Not at all. On the overwhelmingly dominant faction, you have to exert more effort and push for longer each week because it is much more difficult to stack brackets because there is less honor available in the system. Alliance on servers like skeram and stalagg will have an easier time hitting their honor caps before the weekend and getting to chill. They just pay the price of getting zerged often.
---
Also we had battlegrounds from the start so the only time people would be out ganking would be when they were in queue for a bg and it took some time to pop
---
Oof requiring flasks for MC.
---
Throw the whole guild in the trash.
---
Well, you exactly kill a person 5 times until they give no honor anymore. The problem is the staggered positioning of the honor farmers. Everyone wants to kill them 5 times leading to 30 deaths from  thorium point to BRD entrance.
---
this guild is clearly dumb/bad but I think putting trials at the bottom of loot priority is pretty common/fair. Imagine giving your loyal members who have been there since day 1 and are socially entwined with your guild equal prio to the fresh trial who could gquit at any moment if a different guild holla'd at them.
---
I can't imagine the frustration of being in a guild that doesn't use loot council, imagine working your ass off for prebis and using full consumes to make the raid as easy as possible but some newbie in levelling gear outrolls you, or some raid logger outbids you on your BIS piece because you both get equal DKP for just showing up.
---
Loot council &gt; anything else.
---
Imagine standing in a line for hours and then a whole group of people just step in front of you making your wait start all over. That's ninja looting and why it's so shamed in the community.
---
Its about being a frustrated 12 yo
---
Interesting. I like the change, but I wish blizzard would inform us on these types of changes.
---
Wait until something you need is Ninja looted.. then you will know.
---
Weren't paladins warriors trained in the ways of the light?
---
If i remember correctly lore wise, that's the case.
---
Everyone deserves a chance for the loot 
---
One guy taking it for himself = wrong 
---
This...is really common sense
---
You’re correct the highest rank you can achieve is about half way through 4 atm with the current highest rank points
---
ah. Don’t worry. You’ll get a more dynamic style of combat around level 38.
---
The outputs are very similar today. 2 people in my guild will not connect until tomorrow’s MC raid because the game is unplayable right now. Literally. They already said that if the situation is not going better in a week or 2, they are going to cancel their subscription.
---
Another person in this subreddit told in a thread asked if it was worth resubscribing. The majority of answers was no. People will quit if there is no way to find a balance between faction, regarding pvp.
---
So either the pull BGs sooner than expected, or implement a way to balance population of faction, or blizzard will see impacts on the number of players playing Classic
---
Go into combat and Tirion will come.
---
Because certain items have a low drop rate as is and they're needed for maxing your build. If its ninja looted and I spent 30runs trying to get it to drop then fuck that dude who wanted the 1g he will get for it while I need to spend more hours grinding the same fucking dungeon for that one drop.
---
&gt; I played a ton of Vanilla, was greatly looking forward to Classic
---
It's hard for me to understand how people who played vanilla on a pvp server are surprised about how this is all unfolding. 
---
I think that most people are just looking back with rose tinted glasses and forget about how very frustrating leveling and existing on a pvp server was back then. The same exact shit that happened in Vanilla is happening now; I lived it, I remember it. In fact, once "phase 2" launched in vanilla, I "quit" for several months because it was extremely difficult to level (and I was on a med. population server).
---
There are some differences between vanilla and classic, but none of them should come as a surprise to anyone.
---
EQ had such a huge effect on WoW.  As I recall, Blizzard recruited at least 28 guild leaders from EQ to come work for them. 
---
Foror in classic is named after the warrior Furor (aka Alex Afrasiabi) who was the guild leader of Fires of Heaven, the vary famous EQ progression guild.  His profanity laced rants against the EQ Devs on the message board are infamous.
---
&gt; You should win 100% of duels against a warlock while leveling.
---
It's funny how half the people here say this, and half say the opposite.
---
I'm rolling mage for my alt. Highly demanded dps class, get tips for water food and ports. Best aoe and very strong single target. The list goes on but in early stages they can be a bit boring but that changes as you get more spells.

Warlocks are a close second for an alt for me. I don't like the mechanic of draining hp for mana tho. As someone that heals they can be annoying. but nevertheless having summons , soul/health stones are very much in demand as well. Also very good dps.
---
Maybe at the start. Nost eventually was like 5-6k average.
---
&gt;	Aye even the massive amounts of subs Classic is responsible for (the largest surge in WoW history by a big margin) doesn’t compete with the value of the cash shop in retail.
---
I find this hard to belive. Is it coming from anywhere other than your ass?
---
Yeah it’s dumb. Leave that guild I’d say. Unless you’re trying to join a super hardcore guild that wants to break records for speed clearing MC I would say get out of there and don’t waste your time or gold.
---
You gave yourself away with "donjon" and "sinefull"
---
I am low lvl, and I was shooting my gun at lvl 60s to score honor
---
so I might have tagged high honor targets
---
yea, just skip out on getting any upgrades in hopes of getting the one item you want. Hopefully no one else is doing the same thing 4head
---
Some items take hundreds of runs to get. Some take two to 3. Really depends on the item and the person. Some dungeons take over
---
An hour to complete and not everyone has the same amount of time they can put towards a game like this.
---
" You just redo the donjon a second time and a third and you end up having the item. " 
---
Yeah you don't play classic WoW for sure
---
There's a cast time on switching. It takes like 10 seconds of casting to switch your spec and if you enter combat at any point you'll be dropped from doing it.
---
Dude likes gay porn. That's all. Nothing nefarious.
---
The number in your chat doesn't take diminishing returns into account. Its just an estimate based on your level difference and your damage done to the target.
---
That always leaves my skinners sad.
---
I guess to an outsider the shaming might seem like an over reaction for a silly computer game but considering that's the only tool the community has against it it makes more sense that people get socially ostracized for it.
---
Imagine you spend 11 hours grinding for something, that thing is then available. But someone else takes it and now you have to spend 11 more hours for it.
---
I'm actually currently lvling an Spriest with plans to raid as one, did you find any difficulty getting into raids?
---
You’re not. Especially if they’re putting you in what’s likely considered the B team raid.
---
Grind a big bank and wait until GDKP runs become a thing I guess. Or host your own.
---
I would tend to agree if someone is spending their time camping you more than a few kills, then that's definitely a bit of a dick move. But it's still part of the game. I personally take it as a challenge. The game is full of challenges and when it comes to anticipating other players actions, it's not a far stretch to imagine that based on how people communicate on the internet, that someone's going to be a douche and kill you a bunch of times to get "under your skin".
---
Unless you manage to grab a BOE blue off the AH your next upgrade will probably be gatorbite axe out of Mara, that seems to be the usual "progression" so you can keep your 5% crit talent.
---
Sure, someone going all in on a particular item losing all their points is fine. However:
---
&gt; A cartel is a group of independent market participants, whose goal is to improve their profits and/or market position by reducing their mutual competition.
---
If you are in a guild where people have secretly formed a cartel to not go into a bidding war against each other to minimize DKP spending on items they divide amongst each other you're kind of screwed.
---
/Run
---
"there are more people" "not a huge difference" 
---
Mfw there are literally 8000 more people on the server
---
Un'goro has cooled off quite a bit for me in the last 2 days. But I'm a level 60 grinding devilsaurs, I guess maybe the questing areas are still being hunted.
---
Hey there. No there is no arven en aske on Heartstriker but a Horizon. The german server Kil jaeden ? With other guild like Pain and pleasure, encore etc?
---
Dennis is also referred to as the golden god so I'm sure that's adding to the confusion
---
&gt;2 dishonorable kills
---
Loser.
---
Ok I’m a little represented in this post because this is the most fun week I’ve had in ANY game, although it’s mostly lvl 60 v lvl 60 at a roughly 5 man scale, or 1v1. But this is still hilarious.
---
It doesn't even come close to deserving it. It's nothing more than a mediocre port of a game released 15 years ago. If that's the bar for Game of the Year, we've hit a low.
---
It's as if somebody put an arbitrary restriction on what was allowed to be nominated for a "PC game." Sekiro was released this year, and received no awards despite being the only game released this year people will still talk about many years from now. Slay the Spire officially released this year, a game I will highly recommend to anyone who enjoys roguelikes. These are original games with original concepts we should be celebrating. We should not be celebrating a company that only remade this game because we yelled at them for several years about how badly we wanted it.
---
Its just the population. This stuff always happened, but the group would roll on and you'd have at least 5-10 mins of interrupted questing or grinding before the next group rolled through. 
---
Now there's a lot more groups that are made up of more players. 
---
I used to deal with getting ganked all the time, especially since I was around level 45-50 when honor went live in 2005, but this isn't the same at all. 
---
There weren't multiple groups of people 20+ deep rolling through all the zones.
---
We just went on the hill above to watch, Tirion spawned maybe 2-3 minutes after Taelan dies.
---
It takes the harshest scar to flourish in such an inspiring story.
---
Thank you for saving me today.
---
Yes, I do. That still doesn't make the statement that Blizzard has made far more modifications to the game than private servers did any less ridiculous. The private servers got some fundamental things completely wrong, loot drop rates beign just one of them (seriously, try some gold farming spots there were great on private servers and see for yourself how shit they are in classic).
---
Frankly, I fail to see how much different layering is from what Northdale did, i.e. cram a gigantic number of player on one server. Only Northdale managed it with an ultra-agressive dynamic spawn algorithm.
---
Not really? You can get home at 5, do some shit for 3 hours, play for 3 hours and then go to bed at like 11. Most people get home from work and just eat and watch tv or some shit until they go to bed, playing WoW isn’t rly any different. 
---
Plus weekends
---
Fair enough,  thanks!
---
The only time I use war mode on my main is to kill any alliance that are ganking people.
---
This explains why certain skull players go after me like I stole their baby.
---
Then stop plotting with the shadow council
---
LOL blizzard losing their shit
---
Fair enough. I'm quite happy on my german server with 1000er queues at raid night, but that is to be expected and can be circumvented with an early logon.
---
What's queues on Gehennas?
---
I mean, at this rate it's less that 2.5 months away. But this is why I think the people who were decrying MC speed runners were pretty laughable:
---
"Who wants to make trivial content more trivial"
---
"You don't need all those buffs to do MC, people were clearing it sub-60 in leveling greens"
---
Yeah, but I also don't want to spend 4+ hours every week clearing "easy" content. Let's crank it out in less than 2 so I can go back to leveling alts/pvp/grinding.
---
You buying flasks isn't going to fix them trying to 30 man rag when they clearly aren't ready for that.
---
Yeah, perhaps. I tend to be the guy who sees that X faction is 45% of the server so I will pick that faction.
---
But on the other hand, if I could see that one server was 80/20 ratio I just wouldn't waste my time playing there, and instead look for some server with decent balance.
---
Its a shot in the dark, and its not even that noticeable until you reach the contested zones in 30+ where you realize that every fucking zone is utterly dominated by the other faction, only to later realize that the shitserver you are playing on is 80/20 or whatever.
---
THe best was if Blizzard took their thumb out of their ass and offered free faction transfer or something to try to deal with this issue, as playing on shit ratio servers is not fun at all for the lower pop faction. 
---
If a server is 80/20 it might as well just be re-labeled as PvE server, as thats what it is anyways.
---
Oh my god, he kills Alliance at Morgan’s Vigil? This is an outrage. He must want to rank up for rewards to progress his character via the system blizz designed. What a bad person.
---
The only spells that reset your swing timer are heals, holy wrath, and (maybe) Hammer of wrath.
---
I played with daggers from about 28-39 and, while deleting clothies is quite fun, the dps difference both in dungeons and the solo ability while questing is vastly superior now that I'm specced for swords again. My kill time on mobs is much improved and I have almost no downtime. I'm still very strong in PvP, in fact I am stronger against warriors and paladins than I was as daggers. I'm level 41 also. 
---
The plan is to respec daggers at 60 for a hybrid raiding/PvP spec, but swords is superior for leveling by far.
---
It’s a guild name bro
---
f
---
Cheers, thx!
---
My guess is Josh is busy playing Classic and will hopefully hit us with a new episode soon :p
---
Definitely a worthy guess. But I'm not that obsessive.
---
As a role playing orc: 
---
I see red name, I hit red name.
---
They're usually on the server-specific subs.
---
You’re absolutely correct. I rerolled alliance about a month ago for this exact reason and couldn’t be happier. Every 10 kills I get mowed over by a group of 7+ horde, but then I’m back to it. It’s a much better experience for hardcore players.
---
i laughed harder then i should have
---
No. He realized he embarrassed himself and deleted it out of shame.

Rogue -&gt; MUDS -&gt; Ultima Online -&gt; EQ -&gt; WoW 
---
There's a few offshoots and branches here and there (DAoC, Asheron's Call, Diablo 2 , Maple Story, etc), but the lineage of the holy trinity modern MMO effectively follows that line.
---
That's my problem. I enjoy playing both,  but it's simply not feasible with the time I have to play on two characters while raising and ranking up on both .
---
Yeah, healers could buy all the + healing gear and do decent. Mages + frost damage etc.
---
Flurry axe or a few really rare epics are pretty good for most melee, and obviously devilsaur, but past that you have to go into dungeons to get really geared.
---
Also, for 5 mans mind control can be extremely broken.
---
His whole goal was to justify the mistake he has made, so of course he is going to complain and curse people. Don't try to reason with someone who tries to avoid reason so hard.
---
Once I hit 60 on this pve server I just rolled onto with old friends, I'm gonna be flagged a lot.
---
Alliance just live in orgrimmar now. Logged in yesterday to a handful standing on a roof yelling "OUR HOUSE" while a sea of blue named 60s just stood around. I've seen something like this nearly every day. Sorry, that's unacceptable and I'm going to put a stop to it when I'm able.
---
Keep up the honor farm and maybe one day the Warchief will gift you some
---
No it doesnt
---
gonna depend on server but in my experience all of them are equally bad.
---
You want to stay the hell away from these areas:
---
* road
---
* flight path
---
* town
---
If you are away from these 3 then the gank-rate goes way down
---
When i was there queues could be 2-4 hours
---
Saw one on Arugal OCE, level 6 troll mage in org. So weird
---
we are being sold, on the game. $15 a month. we are paying. that should be enough.  
---
the game peaked at 12 million players. $15 x 12 million is a whole lotta money per month.   
---
Wasn't blizz highly profitable at that time? FFS, we have no problem pouring money into the pockets of developers.
---
Horde Rogue tried doing this to me at the vendor by the Bank in IF. I just bubbled and ran upstairs and laughed as he tried to chase me out and died almost instantly by the countless 60's outside. Bubble and /laugh is my usual go to.
---
You can but most wanted items have low droprates, divided again by people who need it.
---
Also you need to run the whole 1h dungeon to farm one boss most of the time.
---
For ex as mage i got ninjad a wand from a dungeon after maybe 10 runs. I've done 20 more since then and never saw it, so... You know
---
&gt;You have 14 Days. If after that time the Plane is not properly tuned, I am deleting my characters, and cancelling all of my accounts. The rest of my guild will follow suit, as will several other guilds and people that play Everquest.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;EQ had such a huge effect on WoW.  As I recall, Blizzard recruited at least 28 guild leaders from EQ to come work for them. 
---
&gt;Foror in classic is named after the warrior Furor (aka Alex Afrasiabi) who was the guild leader of Fires of Heaven, the vary famous EQ progression guild.  His profanity laced rants against the EQ Devs on his guild's website were infamous.
---
&gt;To be brief, I did not work my ass off, jumping through your idiotic hoops with my friends and guildmates, so I could go to a zone where only groups of 18 could enjoy the content. EVEN if past these initial moronic events I can finally get my entire guild in to raid with me, FUCK YOU GUYS. Seriously, FUCK YOU.
---
&gt;I cannot believe this... right now I'm just so pissed off. I am sitting here in the Plane of Time, and 3/4 of my guild is just sitting around while a group of 18 is repeatedly trying to beat one of the mini ring encounters. Don't you people have ANY FUCKING DECENCY? SMEDLEY WHY DON'T YOU STOP COUNTING YOUR MONEY AND START ISSUING ORDERS?
---
&gt;The tragic irony of creating the ultimate cockblock encounter in the form of the Rathe which requires 80 people to defeat and then to limit encounters in the Plane of Time to 18.
---
&gt;14 Days.... after that this site will change from the most popular EQ fan site on the internet to the most popular World of Warcraft fan site on the internet. I'm done playing ball with you useless fuckers... it's my turn.
---
He was true to his word too. The very next post was something like "Hello Azeroth". The rest, as they say, is history.
---
Another great way is to wait til you’re always leveling on rested XP. Be sure to quest in zones around your level.
---
Yea it does. Flemish dialect though
---
Sounds like someones just jealous than.
---
Yeah, the best call since launch has been to just stay off this Reddit. It’s just the whining zone. I’ve been enjoying the game, including the launch days and week 1 of p2, immensely. If people want to stop playing that’s their prerogative, there’s really no reason they should feel compelled to play something they don’t enjoy.
---
That seriously seems like an awful way to do loot distribution... I'd either be pushing *really hard* to switch to a better system, or I'd be looking for a new guild if they weren't receptive to change.
---
Uhm yes. It would not even be included in any " BEST UPCOMING MMORPGS OF 2019" if it was announced in 2018 for the first time. It is only played because people used to play it. It was good for its time
---
And we were told to store all our buffs for Bwl, because Mc and ony is a waste for buff mats. 
---
Quit the guild and go random.
---
\*facepalm\* haven't noticed the blacked out name
---
That's so weird. I'm lvl 56 which makes it harder to gain ranks, I have 80 hks and 4700 honor, and I'm about 90% in rank 2.
---
Are we sure is not an addon problem? Cause you're super close to critcap and I'm worried you're making missinformation via an addon that calculates stuff wrong.
---
You have a clip where you open character sheet showing crit?
---
Oh hell yeah, those battle mages or whatever they are in strat live are absolute units
---
It wasn't me I swear
---
How do I compare weapons to ww? I got some str on its, and some drops from dungs lack any stats despite having more DMG range and some extra passive procs.
---
Same for me. Was at the pirate place in tanaris just questing. There were about 6 or 7 other horde players and 1 or 2 ally. Everyone was cool and left each other alone.
---
Until most of the horde players left and it was mainly ally there. Couldn't quest anymore since I was then KoS.
---
I didnt, and my friends whom are playing alliance didnt. 
---
They did it because they wanted to play elves and dwarves. Literally none of them had any clue it was going to be like this. 
---
Gotta get out of the reddit bubble. 
---
Think about that logic. Alliance players should avoid busy areas most of the time because the content they want to do is essentially unplayable.
---
Nope. Not it.
---
Just dont fly to Minithel Harbor and we are fine (some of you should still come though)
---
I’m not saying this is ideal, but if the problem is people not taking you to groups than you’ll have to form your own. Once you’ve ran or quested with some people you know can play their class, add them to your friends list and invite them first when you’re forming a new group. They will do the same and forming groups will be much easier.
---
I play WoW and come up with shitty jokes I don't have fuck trophies.
---
Choker is still BiS for healing though, so what's the issue?
---
Is his/her point, to just stop playing and in fact I think the same. It is not funny for me but not because the game (classic/retail), it's about the players. We have evolved and don't take the game as we did in 2004-2007. So even if it's classic, it's mostly "retail type" players (i call it like this haha) therefore it will be impossible to replicate the classic experience. Maybe the mistake is trying to sell the game as a comeback, but it's not.
---
Are you talking about post Naxx?
---
OK Boomer
---
My server has a queue again so no. No crisis here, lol.
---
Thanks for the nice answer
---
Warriors can’t hearth?
---
People aren't trying to grief players into oblivion they are just trying to eek out every point of honor to climb the ladder.

---
Slow yourself down, that's all there really is to it. Killing an enemy 5s slower is always preferable to wiping. You are not the star of the show, even if you can top dps, so there's no need to rush.
---
Of course, in 5-mans, sometimes I ignore my own advice and blast 'em. Worse case I'll just fear-kite whatever I pull. Be prepared to be a badass if you're gonna crit like one ;-)
---
It really depends on your group. I have been doing a variety of grouping and solo, the first day we had a 40man raid, after that its usually between 3-8man groups which gives you a lot less honor than a solo kill would (which is around 199 at 60)
---
Shimmering flats is 100% based on the salt flats outside of salt lake city. Why would they have a race track there otherwise?
---
How do I turn on combat logs?
---
Can someone explain Warcraftlogs to me? Parses vs rankings and the number seems to like a percentile? Is it of all healers/dps, my class and spec or?
---
I was a dark pact/drain tank build on my warlock until 52. when phase 2 hit I was getting ganked by everyone and their mother so finally after a particularly tough run in the blasted lands I hearthed and made the swap to SL and traded out a few of my shadow damage pieces for stam/int pieces. 
---
I may not be able to kill every 60 I come across but between double void sac and soul link they're going to have to try really hard to kill me, and i've taken out quite a few myself. It marginally slowed down my leveling but it's worth it to actually be able to "enjoy" pvp.
---
I know a lot of people have a looking for group macro so they can press it and spam in yells, general, looking for group, and trade.  They just change the dungeon name.  I would imagine most mages and professions have a similar macro for selling goods.  They just use the mouse to click the macro instead of key binding it to something
---
But EVERYONE believes him, and NO ONE believes you.

Fuuuuuuck

BEST IS SLAP ENEMY IN FACE WITH BIG METAL
---
I am just bored because I started playing classic for raiding which was praised as difficult but happened to be rather disappointing :p
---
Looking forward to BWL - I get I am the minority since most people started classic for wpvp and are absolutely having a blast right now.
---
Ony sometimes comes up twice during our week.  This week we are doing MC/ony Tues, ony again Thurs.
---
Spronzo? Is that you?
---
Not bad, but if you combo correctly (casting Flamestrike while invis into Blastwave) then you guys could’ve wiped them
---
I'm leveling an alt until this all cools down. No biggie. Fish and get rested with my main, while leveling safely with my movie alt.
---
Yeah you need to dip. The only consumable you really need to kill Rag is Greater Fire Protection pots. You pop two of those in a fight and you should be golden. There's no reason to burn flasks on the content right now, most good guilds are saving them up for BWL.
---
This was what I was doing, but then I said fuck it I’m grinding. Grinded harpies in Feralas from 49-50. Not the most fun but at least I was able to level
---
Although I was one of the sceptical ones, being only lvl 46 myself, I have to concede a lot of people are having fun and that's what matters.
---
The only thing really bothering me and that blizz should do something about at this point is the faction imbalance.
---
Sadbuttrue.jpg
---
It's a joke man
---
- the corpse run is ridiculous, its high risk/high reward
---
- you're outnumbered 50 or 100-1, AND the guards who have stealth detection
---
- it adds flavor to the game. if you're flagged, you're *never* safe.
---
And this is something they improved upon with the token system instead of straight tier drop.
---
My guilds never did dkp on class pieces and basically did a vote.  If they can't decide among themselves then it gets DEed.  You'd be impressed how quickly people can figure out relatively simple things among themselves.
---
It also works whether or not the raid has a lot of some classes and few of others.
---
That's only for people who are already in the raid though. I'm fine with getting geared from raids, I just need good enough BOE to get in.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers (RP) has had almost consistent all day SS/TM raids going on since the honor system came out.
---
I don’t know what you’re on about mate, nost only got more popular with time. In the months leading up to its unexpected cease and desist it was peaking over 13000 with average online around 8-12k. You realize that currently classic servers have a 5k cap and vanilla servers were ~2k cap. Classic servers currently hold less than half of nost’s peak pop when completely full.
---
Cool thing is, I could totally see the banshee queen enlisting kamikaze mages.
---
Fury warrior question. I read online, hit cap is 9%, so after i hit 9% hit cap, should i go for more crit or is more hit still good to have so i get less miss from auto attack?
---
A chill experience so you joined the most hardcore guild on the planet. Well played.
---
Sure thing!
---
It's also the reason why alliance premades are considered superior to horde ones.
---
Paladin support can outlast anything the horde throws at them, then dealing the pain via warriors with blessing of freedom. Shamans ultimately run oom by purging, healing and DPSing. A paladin just keeps on trucking.
---
But without a paladin any kind of shaman will hopefully still put down his WF totem and be a menace.
---
alliance premades &gt; horde premade &gt; horde pugs &gt; alliance pugs
---
3 mageblades so far for us. raiding mc since week3.
---
16 people its biS for.
---
at least we will run mc for a long time.
---
You lose hit% with that sash which affects resist for banish, but the DPS is higher.  Something to consider.  Similar with Choker of Enlightenment vs Star of Mystaria.  If your raid is counting on banishes for Garr you might at least bring your hit% pieces for that fight and swap gear for it. 
---
Skullcap is lower DPS than something with more spellpower, though I don't blame you for running it.  The stats will give you a bit more consistency.  The int isn't enough for even 1 extra shadow bolt, though, and stam can be refilled by healers anyway, but the extra stam might save you a death here and there. Ideally you rarely take damage, use GFPPs on rag, etc. so that's why a ~40 shadow power BOE hat is still technically better from an absolute min/max perspective.
---
It's considered priority for caster dps since it is damage and healing. The Animated Chain Necklace is almost as good (as in -1 healing) for healing only.
---
The title is an Always Sunny reference, and the art is a 300 one.
---
Woah! Tauren Druid?? I haven't seen one since ok boomkin became a thing and my friend and I kept bullying one when they were dueling outside org when we were levelling alts. 
---
Not even kidding there was this undead who toom his tauren, told him to drink a potion, then mount, and made a freakshow outside the AH asking for tips. 
---
Since ok boomkin stocks are still high just go around roleplaying demanding/asking/begging/blackmailing people for tips or straight up gold and that is tour best money making strategy.
---
Also, offer raid service for gold. Not even kidding I can imagine guilds paying you to come raid with them. You will get all the druid loot too!

I made a ticket in May to get my account fixed, because the physical authenticator I had on my account broke and I couldn't read the numbers any more.  I was told when it was submitted it could take up to a week to fix.  In that week I just forgot about it.
---
Wasn't until August that I realized my ticket was still open and unanswered.  So instead I called CS, waited on hold 75 minutes.  The rep couldn't find an authenticator on my account, asked me to log in.  Worked just fine.  I was super confused, because an hour earlier the authenticator was attached.  
---
An hour after the phone call, I got the email saying my authenticator had been removed from the ticket I submitted in May.  3 months it took them to answer, and they did it while I was literally on hold with customer service.
---
Mine was joke too, I know warriors can’t hearth
---
We failed the quest as well.
---
The very important thing is, that the big boss lands the final blow and kills taelen. 
---
If some of the random elites do the last hit, the quest will fail.
---
Balance seems fine but it’s quite a casual dad server. I know that the 19th standing on leaderboards individual on Horde side has about 13k honor. For reference I have 106k honor on Firemaw Alliance and that puts me at 99 standing.
---
Had mageblade prio for 5 weeks, but it has not dropped for us yet.
---
1 staff dropped Our 2nd raid, then the gun, gun, double chestpieces etc. PLS golemagg, be nice on sunday.
---
Classic is subsidizing retail expansions using a decade and a half old game. 
---
We are blizzard's paypigs.
---
So basically focus on dmg range, and treat extra stats and procs as extra bonus rather than important factor?
---
Yeh epgp or dkp sounds like it would work better for you since you seem to attend consistently
---
@OP  
---
Sorry I used the wrong discord. Correct is raekon#3842
---
I'm sorry but there is no point in getting gear past 60 other than being stronger in order to pvp. The real time sick for this game, from here on out will be pvp for the majority. If the majority of the player base asked the majority of their time pvping, how can you not realize it is a pvp game.
---
 *All of this, of course, is confined to PvP servers for players who opted into that riskier ruleset from the outset*
---
Hero. Keep PvP servers PvP. As usual, the casual player base has no idea what it wants.
---
I'm in a committed relationship, we bought a house, have two cats, and among other things IRL. No kids though. I have 6 - 7 days played between my toons.
---
Yes, Joana’s guide. I followed it probably about 95%
---
The first time I typed /played after hitting 60, I pretty much had already doubled my play time and this was definitely my face hahahha.
---
its a great system when the people in charge care about the health of the guild and progress.
---
transparence with distribution is very helpful aswell :)

I love your drawings! keep them up!

I don't understand why you horde can't understand the point we are making. Yeah Ally group up too. But there is 30% less of us. So there will be less groups by default. So more solo ally will get ganked by roaming horde zergs, than Horde going through the same thing.
---
So because it happens more, it feels more unfair.
---
I know you guys don't really care so I don't know why you keep trying to argue with us.
---
So just my experience in small groups vs large raids, the people doing the large raids are fucking themselves out of *a lot* of honor. I made way more the 2nd day just hanging out in Searing Gorge for a little bit with a handful of people than an entire night of back and forth between full raids in Hillsbrad when it was released.
---
Absolutely no one except masochists has fun getting outnumbered and then ghost/graveyard camped by a gank squad. Playing like this is detrimental to your overall playing experience even if you don't recognize it yet. Keep outnumbering and grieving the lesser represented faction and watch classic wpvp very quickly resemble retail with no one at all playing on the other faction. And pvp servers becoming defacto pve servers.
---
Yeah SL is pretty amazing.
---
Well, as long as you were interested in classic, the whole game was out for 14-15 years so all the data was there. I won't call you ignorant, let's say clueless: for now, the only solution would be rolling on PVE server or waiting the storm out. 
---
WoW classic lacks TON of quality of life updates introduced in later expansions but this is exactly the charm majority of the playerbase finds about it.
---
It's just not a "random news site", it's one of the oldest news sources in the US.
---
I'm not saying it's a bastion of good journalism, just amused at your seeming dismissal as a small town newspaper.
---
If there is a transfer off Arugal (PvP) to Remulos (PvE) I'm taking it.
---
I did it - you keep rank but you lose your lastweek/today kill stats.
---

---
Also, I went 125-140 last night, smelting iron ore sent from my bank.
---
Sure, but on average most people need to spend an hour on cooking/cleaning/chores, and then if you have really any responsibilities in your life that's going to probably eat into another hour or so depending. Now you're at 3 of your 4 free hours per day on this sole activity.
---
I'm not coming down on anyone that chooses to spend their free time playing WoW or any game, or any interest generally, but 3 hours a day is a great deal of time to spend doing anything.
---
Does anyone have a link to a good Holy Paladin profile for grid2?  I just hit 60 and have started to learn the heal addons.
---
You mistake me good sir.
---
My one honor kill was [perfectly fairly inside the cage, not on top of it](https://youtu.be/9yDL0AKUCKo?t=97) and the player it was against was a 57 mage against my 49 warr. He stomped me twice easily but entered a third time where the guards plus him being nice enough not to blink away let me get my first honorable kill in classic.
---
This is why our guild uses a straight "50% DKP drop" on any item you want.
---
We drop our name in chat for an item once linked in raid chat, whoever has the highest DKP wins that item and gets 50% of their DKP removed. This make it so that people who horde more DKP lose more and prevents people from colluding as much as say a 'bidding system'. 
---
You have more control over your spending, you can wait out for staff of dom/WARLOCKblade. or you can spend on Arcanist/Felheart gear. 
---
This helps not only people who have been in the guild for awhile with giving prio to people who have been committed week by week but also gives lower DKP guildies opportunity to gather tier gear, and then rotate.
---
There it is.
---
&gt; He has terrible reading comprehension, and probably didn't even understand what you just said
---
Lmao.  Scary thing is he could actually be a dev.  I've worked with people like this.  Zero vision and too much sniffing of their own farts.
---
Go here: https://sixtyupgrades.com/  Then:
---
1. Make an account
---
2. Go to Create Character
---
3. Fill out all info your character
---
4. Create a gearset
---
  * Choose your main profession (I'm assuming frost mage)
---
  * Pick Phase 1
---
  * Choose your equivalency points - this is basically sets how the stats are weighted (I don't play mage but you can just take the Frost EP preset)
---
  * Set the filters as you see fit (this will decide what types of items you can search for and what the site will auto-fill)
---
5. click auto-fill on the next page (or you can set each item one-by-one)
---
At this point you can then select each item and you get presented with a list of the best items starting with the best, then showing 2nd best, then 3rd best, etc.
---
Here you can customize and see what's out there and decide what's easiest for you to go for.
---
Not sure if this Reddit is the place for this but good luck, the server discord is probably the best place
---
&gt; you seem to have flipped
---
That's interesting considering I haven't even been part of this discussion.
---
I'm not entirely sure how you come to the conclusion it's a big deal or that "go to retail" is an insult, either. 
---
I mean, it's pretty simple and straightforward. Don't have the time and motivation to play Classic, the tedious and time consuming version of WoW? Then play the enhanced version of WoW that offers lots of quality of life improvements and was specifically developed this way so people can avoid having to do the things you don't want to do now.
---
I like retail, personally, but I like classic even more. I enjoy having to call all my friends and guildmates to fight our way into LBRS/UBRS for an hour because Alliance has made Blackrock their stronghold again. It's what this game is about, open world interactions. And when we're offline we all banter or laugh about it together on our cross-faction discord.
---
It's a game, not work.
---
Then he must pay the *wrong race tax* and buy Edgemaster's that will serve for the whole duration of the game, or use daggers for now in combination with one of three items providing daggers skill (Aged Core Leather Gloves, Mugger's Belt or Distracting Dagger).
---
Just finished under 12 days. I thought that was decent. Guess not X[
---
Do you have a better suggestion for alliance players on horde dominated servers?
---
There would hardly even be a category for mmorpgs in 2019 without vanilla wow.
---
Nope, tons of being love a game breaking disadvantage..
---
/combatlog and you can go into Network Settings to enable Advanced Combat Logging
---
I mean sure, but also no warlocks actually want the tier 1 pieces, becuz tier 1 for Warlocks is garbage outside of PvP. Nobody wants to spend DKP on an item they're not actually going to use.
---
Even on a perfectly balanced 50:50 server, horde are always the more prominent PvP faction, therefore the actualy population engaging in PvP are still 60:40.
---
Maybe.. but t1 gear for warlocks is not even close to bis for PVE, and doesn't really make much sense unless you have 8/8.
---
But its AMAZING for SL Locks in PVP
---
You have a very rose colored view of the community back then. And I haven't noticed anyone avoiding fighting other equal level players to farm lowbies.  The honor from that sucks. What you DO have is people in small groups avoiding the zerg that every zone has. 
---
But yeah, 15 years ago every server had an honor farming group that would have a spy announce other premade so people could drop queue and stomp pugs instead. Maximizing honor gains is nothing new at all.
---
Consider that a single solo/duo kill is going to net you more honor than a dozen in a 10+ member raid group where honor is being split up. Go to small, out of the way areas.
---
Means mom in american
---
That's exactly what I'm doing, gonna try to wait out the first wave of hardcore rankers to make it easier on myself. It's also going to be a lot easier on Ally with near instant queues when wsg releases. If you can premade for even 10 hours a week you'll get more honor than people pugging for twice that.
---
In general, stack crit from here out. When BWL comes out it might change, reassess then.
---
Playing 12 hours a day on the weekend sometimes. It feels just like it used to.
---
Its both
---
Such a shame about Wildstar, the core game play was insanely fun. The whole holograph thing in dungeons and raids really made the game fun to play and I wish there was a popular mmo with a similar fast paced combat system + hard difficulty
---
Feels exactly like vanilla WoW to me. I've never join the PvP server mess though so that might be why.
---
Exactly, I kinda understand where they're coming from even if they lash out. I put /bonk and /cry on a macro it makes the unfortunate situation kinda funny and can disarm their irritation haha
---
fun fact, I will only check my played when I hit lvl 60, I am lvl 49 and have no idea how much I played so far
---
Cool, thanks for the quick response. At first, I just thought it was a personal notes type thing when I saw your post, and for that, it is exactly the addon I never knew I needed.
---
When you are a warrior and play alone, you die, die, die, die and die and cant event kill an elite 4 levels below you. Fury warriors cant get groups too, but you can always make your own groups.
---
r/The_Dennis
---
But I don’t want to!
---
woah woah, hold your horses.
---
are you saying that there's another salt flat, with a racing track on it!? In that case, my bad, will update it right away!
---
I've seen lvl 60 give 60 honor and I've ssen lvl 54 give over 100 honor, and even if it's only 50 - I'm not gonna pass on a free 1/4 kill
---
The title is definitely not both, which is why I specifically said "the title".
---
Come to jesus moment, but nothing about current Classic is hardcore.
---
"Min-maxing" is not hardcore; it's literally just going to Wowhead and finding out where your best potential gear comes from and then playing that part of the game. I ran about a dozen Scholomance runs just to get my wand that I won't replace until I get Cold Snap from a free roll Azuregos kill, or that wand from BWL which isn't even available yet.
---
World bosses are easy, you can 10 or 15 man them.
---
MC is easy, you can 20-30 man it in half greens, even without BiS damage affixes.
---
Onyxia is easy, you can 10-15 her in BiS blues and easily 20-30 man her in half greens, same as MC. The hardest part about Onyxia is doing the attunement.
---
Dire Maul is FOR the casuals who want great pre-raid gear without chasing attunements or farming the same mid- or end-bosses of dungeons for weeks.
---
Hitting level 60 takes weeks instead of months, thanks to the abundance of information available to us in the form of guides and addons.
---
How dare world pvp happen on a pvp server.
---
yea cause we all know the game was balanced around twink vs twink and low level skill availability.
---
Why are you so certain you can't filter out enemy combat logs.  What systems rely on that information or is it just extrenuous data?  You don't know unless you work on the team.  So really you don't know shit.
---
I mean, that's just the rogue class though. I have much more respect for a rogue that infiltrates enemy territory (where people might not even be flagged) and take out enemies while surrounded by guards/other people of the enemy faction, compared to rogues who only initiates on players who are actively fighting a mob and already on low hp.
---
Do you mean the tier pieces of actual lock gear like the shadow damage belt and mageblade?
---
If you mean tier pieces, don't even bother. Most of the tier 1 is garbage outside of PvP applications, due to it's poor stats and lack of spell damage comparable to other pieces with shadow damage. If you mean stuff like the mageblade...big oofs.
---
Its just the populations. There are so many more people than there used to be so you can't hide anywhere. 
---
Spy also wasn't nearly as widespread. People know you're around even if they don't have tracking and you're inside a cave / underground. That was generally not the case. Irontree caverns were my hiding spot on my medium - high pop realm the week honor came out and I got mostly left alone. 
---
Now every zerg group rolls through because they see a popup with my name, class, and level that lets them auto target me as they ride above me.

For some reason, only crocs south of the bridge to Barrens drop it.
---
&gt; They always choose places where are few guard and they just blind run away and stealth.

So he's playing rogue correctly....? Literally the entire point of the class...
---
Usually takes about 2 mins for Tyrone to show up, I’ve seen the quest completing properly dozens of times in the last couple days farming for crusader.
---
That macro is broken right now. It doesn't work like it did in vanilla. Just a quick google search will get you to multiple complaints about it on blizzard forums
---
To my knowledge the hit cap is so you can hit bosses consistently end game when they’re levels above your 60 character. You won’t need more hit because your chance to hit is 91% at 300/300 weapon skill, hence only needed 9%. 
---
I read that somewhere and it’s been a hot minute so anyone please correct me if I’m wrong.
---
I wouldn't classify myself or my guild as top of anything, we're just competent.  We meet up at Ony around 8:45, she's dead by 9, hearth to Kargath, MC should be rolling by 9:10, done before 11, go back to Onyxia if resets line up.
---
The biggest factor here isn't that we're a "top guild", it's that we don't raid at prime times and waste inordinate amounts of time with worthless wpvp.  Sat/Sun in the mornings BRM is absolutely deserted.
---
if you think this subreddit is bad holy fucking shit dont go on the official forums
---
when I was bored I used to run to low level area and watch the opposite faction level and just follow them, it was like mental warfare, now I couldn't attack them but I was flagged so could they resist attacking me? 
---
Would they accidently rt click me? Would the get nervous enough to make a mistake or just ignore me?
---
some actually did try to kill me, no one I remember actually accidentally right clicked me a lot ot people got nervous and over pulled or ran into mobs...I would help them if they were about to die.  
---
sometimes..
---
It's mostly how the fights are going for horde as well. There are tons of gank groups of both factions roaming. At least on balanced servers.
---
It resets all DRs on kills on server reset daily
---
For classic the most important thing is game knowledge, for retail it's mostly skill with your class
---
don't ask for advice and then ignore advice given. that is rude
---
Let me guess... it was low pop the 3 third day after classic launch
---
How big of profit margins do you shoot for when selling crafted gear using your own mats? This is for boe blues from leatherworking.
---
They call if Big Dick Points, he should look for another guild out of general principle.
---
All the good ones
---
You can tank instances well at and on the way to 60
---
What a lovely turn of phrase, I am not going to say you are an arsehole, let's say socially inept. 
---
I rolled alliance so I could steal the name Legolas and have a hunter. There was no more intention than that. 
---
You shouldn't make huge drastic assumptions and then turn around and insult people when you are shown to be incorrect. I am not going to say you are an idiot, let's say clueless.
---
I mean pvp obviously stands for player versus party, everyone knows that.
---
qq l2p
---
classics been out for like 80 days and there's been scheduled maintenance on like 50 of them
---
I think so too... its just a tool against rogues to make it not that easy to get ganked. Its actually balancing world pvp. 
---

^^ How you know someone is not a programmer. ^^
---
Now you got 10-15 not willing to bid on items because they want that one weapon and the raid suffers for it.
---
20+ years of Call of Duty and 2019 is the year of the crisis?
---
we have a bunch of guilds that ruin our worldboss kills.
---
at kazzak they stand too close to him, get aggro, run in a random direction, make him fire his aoe shadowbolts which cancel our summons.
---
then they attack him with 10 people and wipe.
---
it usually takes us about 5minutes to summon 1-2 raids.
---
with them fucking around it took 15-20.
---
when we finally were able to get a tag and they realize we are able to kill him, those inbreds started griefing.
---
we lost an azuregos kill to the horde because they delayed us with their fuckery until the horde arrived.
---
No, that was my tldr of dagger leveling.
---
Chooses PvP server. Whines about PvP.
---
This is my first playthrough but I would consider a hunter ! A lot of fun, easy leveling (aspect of the cheetah, built in tank, etc), and I find somewhat challenging due to the amount of things you have to manage during fights.
---
For abilities yes 9% but white swings will still miss.
---
By that logic games like CS:GO shouldn’t regulate team size either, because people are just trying to play with their friends and online community.  You’re just as entitled as OP...at least OP’s comments are trying to provide a solution to a problem he’s identified.
---
Maybe a pve server is more your speed?
---
Lmao welcome to classic WoW bitch.
---
Only sucks if this is on your day off and if it is, great opportunity to knock out some tasks you’ve been putting off. 
---
If you’re like me, you’re at work and it doesn’t matter.
---
I farmed 35k and i got rank 3 80%
---
I’m thinking of partly countering that problem by forming my own groups (no more ”full on rogues sry”) - also I guess farming gold for BoEs is slow but guaranteed non RNG success.
---
It's also impossible to do.
---
I feel like instead of writing “book” you should have made a bright icon to pinpoint closer the exact location and be more obvious to see
---
I actually was there in 2005 before BG’s (I think a lot of people who say they were, actually weren’t - people don’t lie on the internet do they?) and there were roaming gangs back then too. Just look at any PvP video from the time..
---
We asked for no changes, and they are delivering it as authentically as possible. I seem to be missing the issue at the moment.
---
Imo anything under 15 or 20 you can’t really know if you like the class yet. Like your warlock doesn’t even have big blue yet.  But if you want a well rounded class that is always liked and invited in groups, while still having a fuck ton of options in solo endgame (farming gold, wpvp, what have you) I’d go with your mage..people pay you money to cast your own spells.  if you really wanna heal or tank your fucked though.
---
Fully half the people I show these to just assume he's an undead rogue and not an undead warr because apparently I just picked the peak edgelord aesthetic

3. Horde/alliance ratio is way out of whack on some servers. Before any sort of server transfers opened up, I'd be very surprised if any Vanilla WoW server was worse than 40/60. Now it's the norm.
---
Suck a dick
---
So quit
---
&gt;Meh, it isn't fun when it requires no effort.
---
Gamers don't enjoy challenges. In fact, a worthy opponent is just a barrier to their next dopamine hit. 
---
That's why they rage so hard whenever anything slows them down - they have a chemical addiction that they have to feed. When someone beats them or they lose a loot roll its like a drug addict realizing they're out and the rage begins. 
---
They really are mentally ill. They allowed video games to program the way they interact with everything and everyone and its sad. They need help, but instead they just congregate into a large hive mind and assure each other that its everyone else who is the problem.
---
&gt;Hows the damage in dungeons?
---
Big problem daggers tend to have in dungeons is that, especially while leveling, nobody can stand fucking still. This is fine as swords since you have a much bigger radius around the mob to avoid parries, but daggers consistently get fucked with any time the tank moves.
---
You'll have more downtime between mobs, and honestly sometimes you don't want to stealth creep between every single mob. Daggers you'll struggle to do that, swords it's no issue.
---
I bought 32 silver ore trying to get from 123-125. I got 1 skill point. Don't do this. Just go find Tin Veins. They're all over Hillsbrad. Then the Badlands have a ton of Iron.
---
Mage -&gt; goal: learn to aoe farm so you can level fast as fuck and get gold quickly to support other characters. At 60 craft robes of the arch mage and drop tailoring for alchemy. Use gold income to buy undeath -&gt; water recipe. Buy many times. Foster an army of alts with alchemy and undeath to water recipe. Profit?
---
I like how the only argument is "shouldn't of rolled on PVP server" because you know people arent going to stop being dicks, because the game literally rewards it.
---
Oh shit its me wtf
---
I personally use [REHack](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24734-REHack-UINotebook.html)
---
Thanks! I'll listen to your advice and carry on to 60 and try to heal more dungeons
---
Did you play WoD?
---
HaHAhaHAha
---
Contribution does not equal bracket. This week the pvp hype was great so I would assume that you had to contribute way more to be in a certain bracket.
---
No wonder the prices shot up😂
---
Sounds like you shouldnt be on a pvp server.
---
Leveling partner and I do something similar. We'll open up on someone, leave them within an inch of life, he sheeps them, and then we dance while they turbo regen. Most take it in stride, one brave hunter dropped a freezing trap on the mage and cheetah'd the fuck out
---
Isn’t the book for alz in east on the wrong side?

So you speak for every classic wow player I assume? I have met countless people who have never even touched wow before enjoying classic. Is it just nostalgia for them too?

Neither are you or your ugly wife

so....because I dont like to be killed 15 times by 5+ Horde everytime I want to to Brd I "dont like" pvp? Dude I like the open world pvp but this? its just annoying.
---
Pleeeeeaaase stoooop :(:( I cant keep reading the same post.
---
*extra 406% contribution. So whatever the number on the armor says, multiply it by 5.06. 120*5.06=672. Stoneshield gives 190*5.06=961

Lol I quit days ago mouth breather, I have plenty of other enjoyable things in my life.

Why are you booing him?

He's right
---
&gt;What were they supposed to do, redesign the game cause you’re not NEET any more? Im cutting my losses on this community, where half the posts are straight up pouting. Stop.
---
It's not as much the game that changed, but the player base. Classic is pretty good #NoChanges The main difference is the number of players, and the attitude of those players. 
---
Right now a lot of players are not really able to play the game because the only available activity is joining a big PvP raid.
---
People playing multiplayer games like WoW should read up on Game Theory. Right now everyone is acting selfishly in a mad scramble to get PvP rewards, with no concern for what it does to the Server. 
---
Blizzard are not the ones who have to fix this. The community is the only thing that can redeem the situation. Nothing Blizz does will be a good solution.
---
It's like governments setting up quotas for hunting and fishing. If you hunt a species to extinction, you lose the ability to hunt it altogether.

Then you knew nothing, Jon
---
Owned.
---
He's not wrong tho. Warriors are cut from a different cloth
---
Because in Vanilla you didn't have 60% of playerbase being max level, with every PvE content on farm when honor system was introduced.
---
There was a skull druid in my 20s who followed me for 15 minutes jumping in front of me as I fought mobs waiting for me to accidentally right click on him and flag myself so he could kill me.
---
When it finally happened I wasn't even mad - this was before honor so the guy just spent more time haunting me than it took me to ghostrun back and by the time I respawned he was gone.
---
Well that's interesting. Bars are roughly 10% the cost of ore on my server for silver at least.
---
His response was presumptive and rude. I don't respect those that don't merit it.
---
As you've described, no. A flask isn't the magic bullet to their problem. 
---
For science, I'd have a conversation with the raid leader about the issues they are facing. I bet you learn a lot about how to not lead.
---
What map addon u using m8? Ty for this!
---
You're confusing "scheduled" with "recurring".
---
The burning crusade :) I’d be so fkin hyped if they really released this
---
All I hear is crying.  This was Vanilla.  Don't like it?  Quit.
---
Stalagg is 71-29 in favor of the horde according to warcraftlogs. It's borderline unplayable. I've resorted to farming SM Cath for gold/BoEs because the open world is flooded with horde, even the "isolated" areas.
---
Oh yeah that's absolutely the premier undead rogue look
---
Possible, but I was in a flanking group that stacked like this a few days ago until we also got blown up by a lone mage.
---
If u would have been frost you would have killed all of em with nova cone snap nova cone
---
You are pathetic
---
Not necessarily. I prefer horde as a general rule, but I also prefer being the underdog so have been rolling alliance for awhile now. Being outnumbered 40/60 isn't so bad, it's when it tips far beyond that that everything goes to hell.
---
To be fair we tend not to take dungeons particularly seriously when it's guild runs, there good to wind down after a raid or that.

I always remembered this from the episode.  Rogue w/ a 2h mace.
---
Most people, unless you’ve got kids or something, have plenty more than 3 or 4 hours of free time in a day. If you got home at 5 and had absolutely no other responsibilities, you could get in 6 hours by bed time assuming you wanted to get 8 hours of sleep. 
---
It doesn’t take 3 hours to cook dinner and do whatever cleaning you may need to do, and not everybody has kids to clean up after so daily, after say 6pm, there’s really not much to do unless you have a business or need to study or some shit. 
---
For example I work 5am-2pm weekdays, go straight from work to the gym for about an hour- hour and a half depending on what I’m doing then go home, maybe grabbing some stuff on the way home. I cook and eat dinner then wash up. I go to bed at 930 and by the time all this is done it’s usually about 5... that’s 4 and a half hours until bed that I could spend playing WoW a day, call it 3 and a half to be generous and include little things. 
---
I don’t even play WoW or really games in general anymore, but I hate it when people think spending 3 hours a day playing a game is bad but thinks nothing of somebody watching that amount of tv a day, which is really common. 
---
Got the entire weekend too and if you want to you can stay up on fridays
---
Nah man. I believe emerald dream is next. Also I'm thinking about the hole on the door in tanaris. Maybe a next expansion...
---
I like that answer too because it's 100% true. If you don't want to open yourself up to ganking, roll on a PvE server. There are plenty of them.
---
I saw the mass hardcore reddit fapping to pvp servers months ago and was like "Yup, most of them will be bitching about ganking" as I quietly rolled on a PvE server. What happened to the the daily STVietnam nostalgia/excitement posts in this subreddit?
---
Pot, meet kettle.
---
People still play HOTS? lul
---
This is what causes you to fall on my KoS list and I will make your life as inconvenient as I can :)

LuL. Fuck em they suck
---
I did the same I'm logging in less every time until things are calmed down or bgs are implemented. On the meantime let them starve of honor and people to kill.
---
What is that itemrack addon to make it dark around it?
---
Oh really??? That’d be fuckn dope I’m just hyped for anything classic this game made me fall in love with wow
---
I'm dismissing it because it provides no source - you can only find that quote on their page, could be something he said before Patch 2 but they were quoting it as if he just said it.

I can't believe this guy in charge of one of the most popular video games of all time.
---
You mostly care about what has the highest average in damage range. This usually means slower the better.
---
Don't remember anyone on this sub saying mc would be hard
---
Because?
---
I farmed 80k honor and got rank 3 90%
---
So we’re back to using 90’s jokes huh?
---
I haven’t had the displeasure of levelling in p2, - my condolences - but I would recommend just grinding mobs out in silithus or deadwind pass when you get to the high 50s. You’ll just be farmed for honor somewhere like EPL.
---
I guess Felwood can work if you stay far from the road, but I spent a lot of today massacring people in Felwood. I don’t feel good about it when the person I kill isn’t 60, but hey, that’s the system blizz designed for character progression, so what can we do.
---
But you can't really see anyone rage in real time.
---
So where's the fun?
---
Rob Pardo led LoS, Tigole managed their website and wrote updates I think.
---
Why is this so funny lol
---
There is no parallel to make between the two. Of course, I am absolutely entitled to receive a service I'm paying for and I see nothing wrong with that. It's the same as how you're entitled to use the tap water you pay for. There are regions in Africa that are hit hard by drought. Let's help those regions by cutting off your tap water for 12hrs every day and shipping it to Africa, but you'll still be paying the same monthly bills.
---
Too bad the "spy" addon exists, hiding in buildings is useless and stealthing greatly hindered.
---
I've been there before and believe me, the place really doesn't live up to the name.
---
I don't use it, i prefer not to cheat.
---
Oh okay I guess this is going to be one of those "crying in the morning" types of days!
---
I personally don't see a point in unbinding wasd (besides a/s to strafe, though with right click held down you strafe with those keys), as there are many other keys around to hit with ctrl, alt and shift mods to hit your main abilities when you need them. The issue with unbinding w, as you have noticed, is targetting. With W bound to forward you can still keep up while moving the mouse to target your enemy.    
---
As for tab targetting, tab is very useful and pretty smart in targetting who you are looking at. I would definitely recommend using it and getting used to it. If you are having trouble with what target is tabbing to, I might suggest moving unit frames closer to your character model to be able to tell more quickly who you are targetting.
---
I am assuming you are a warrior and horde. If you are an orc, I think flurry axe is prebis so you don't have to compete for dalrends. But other than that and devilsaur, BoEs don't really have the hit/crit needed for you to DPS. As others have said, you could probably buy runs, but it would be very expensive, like 100g+ an hour, and gold bidding raids will pop up, but that's probably thousands of gold to win good items.
---
Thats exactly how original game book describes them
---
Venoxis, EU - 800-900g
---
I did the same. Felt like it would have stressed me otherwise.
---
Maybe 800g is a bit excessive but I guess it pays for itself pretty fast at ~15g a day.
---
I dont want early BGs released! then whats next, Early ZG, early AQ40 and Early Naxx if we all QQ hard enough? By this rate all 6 phases will be released by Spring time!!!
---
Used to be a nightmare but not too bad now imo.
---
Harder to click on, easier to hide in foliage and terrain, generally frustrating cutesy look as they mercilessly gank you.
---
It's not that all gnomes are pvp assholes but the ones that you run into are usually the most memorable.
---
Haha thanks, single handedly defending feathermoon stronghold ;-)
---
&gt; before the wave of transfers
---
Ok we're talking about the current time, not the good ol days boomer.
---
Cross server was the beginning of the end, let’s hope Blizzard doesn’t make that mistake again.
---
They tried that with 30sec honorless buff. What happens is that if you are the only person coming by, priests will just MC you.  
---
We first sheeped people for 30seconds, then we started MCing them to make them attack an alliance NPC to lose their honorless buff. 
---
Then they got nuked for honor. There really is no easy solution.
---
I'm not fucking crying, you are. Fuck you guys. I love you.
---
Incredibly weird is a bit of a stretch.  Nothing out the ordinary being awake at 8am on a weekend.  Now if your guilds raid times are between 12-6am on *any* day of the week and you're not and oceanic guild playing on NA or something, *that's* incredibly odd.

I think Ravenhold rep and quests. The first class hall ever
---
That's what I mean. Early on it's best to find the sweet spot to gradually climb the ladder without much hassle. I enjoyed every second of my 65k so far, then stopped PvP for 3 days. 
---
Grinding hundreds of thousands only puts you up a couple % over the one putting a fraction of your effort into it.

Only later you really have to start grinding hardcore to overcome the decay.

You're more beholden to whatever the market prices are than to anything else.  If the materials sell for C and the item sells for R, then R-C is your profit.  You can't make the market pay for whatever you want them to pay.  The market is set at whatever the price is on the AH for both materials and finished products.

Brilliant 💪🏻
---
Haha gotta love that, tough on a boat with no teleport though :p
---
Yeah, the german server with all these guilds you mentioned. Were you also in that guild in Vanilla, Burning Crusade? My name was Paladinor/Terrador
---
I’m level 55 now. Guess it’s time to do BRD? Do you guys recommend getting all of the wuests. Any tips before I start getting them all?
---
The PC GOTY award is likely only eligible for games that were only released on PC.
---
It's very interesting to see this specific spot in Baradin Bay, as i've never seen it before. My known dumping places are: 
---
Crossroads if the game can't find the graveyard and you're Horde, Sentinel Hill for the same reason if you're Alliance. 
---
The Alliance's Battlemaster for Alterac Valley in Hillsbrad if the game tries to send you to an instance it can't find or if you fail to get teleported by a transport leaving Eastern Kingdoms.
---
West of Stonetalon Mountains in the ocean if your character does not have a starting location but is told to start on Kalimdor, I can assume Newman's Landing might be that spot on Eastern Kingdoms but i've never been able to prove that.
---
Under Stonetalon Mountains (nowadays in Retail it's a graveyard in Stonetalon) if the game is unable to send you to a location on your transport leaving Kalimdor.
---
There might be a few more I can't remember off the top of my head, but I wonder what reason could of been had for him to get sent here
---
No, it's your group if people don't like it they can start their own
---
If you stated the loot rules etc. Before the run then there is no issue. That guy was just a clown.
---
I mean mail coif is like the only helmet model till very lvl 35
---
You're very welcome.  It's a great spot for melee!  I don't know when it comes around, but by the time he Darkmoon fair comes around they drop a collectible feather for the fair vendors too!
---
Thanks, man. I appreciate the response :)

You don't speak for all, and a checklist addon of the things you've done vs a in game achievement screen are two different things . I'm not trying to get it implemented, I just want to be able to track certain areas of progression, which was fully achievable as an addon in classic.
---
Heyo jako
---
I am not a fan of reserving gear, but if it's clearly stated while building the group then there is no issue

---
Probably a lot of previously bored level 60s now have a new purpose other than the weekly raid ;)
---
Well it doesn’t matter if he banks it or not.  If he took 5 weeks to level with 4 days played it’s still the same amount of rested.  The only difference is he spread it out instead of banking it for one level. 
---
What you’re suggesting I understand like playing until rested is off, not play for 10 days, then play again until rested is gone.
---
But I was just clarifying what that guy was saying, saying he didn’t play with rested doesn’t make sense.
---
Yeah, I don't need that stress either. Especially in these hard phase 2 times lol.
---
Haven't seen any Vis'kag yet. Still waiting. hoping. Killing Ony 2x a week for 5 weeks now.
---
ElvUI
---
Vanilla servers didn’t have 10k+ people on at once
---
Yeah that is delusional. WoD literally nuked the economy and put everyone in their own instanced house with everything they could ever need. You can’t just ignore that. What in BFA will have lasting impacts into xpacs 6 years from now?
---
Classic Naxx was a whole different ballgame.  The question isn’t “should I do  it”, it’s more, “will I be with an elite enough guild to even have a chance to do it..”. 
---
The difficulty was extreme.  We were a BWL farm guild, that was stuck on a Cthun in AQ40.   We struggled in Naxx, and only downed a few bosses.
---
I also don’t pay $15 a month to have 1-2hr of downtime corpse running every time I play the game, but here we are. 
---
Is your time more valuable than mine because you chose to play a different faction?
---
I got it the first ever BRD run i did on my hunter and no one else needed it, so i got it
---
I also got it on my 3rd BRD run on my alt shaman. Its so common drop that i am surprised not everyone has it by now
---
Ranking up in this system will generally become easier and easier over time, as the competition weeds out. Unlike raiding you're not missing out by waiting a few cycles before you start grinding. You can start now, in two weeks or in two months and the RP progression stays the same. But as mentioned, the honor requirements to reach higher RP gains will most likely fall over time (until BGs arrive). The most important thing though is that once you start grinding you do NOT want to stop before reaching your goal.
---
If you are not reserving half of the loot like onyxia/mc pugs, it's ok. 15-17 people out of 20 doesn't even give a damn about those weapons.
---
Run with 58s and 59s and get more 60s for your faction to PvP for your faction.
---
Trends are cyclical.
---
Guild full of toxic and elitist idiots who can't kill Rag /gquit those losers
---
"is it a dick move?" Yes. But the rogue was absolutely the bigger dick in that scenario if you did announce before hand it was reserved. Imo if you have to reserve loot in general you're being a dick, but that doesn't change that he's a bigger dick for throwing a tantrum because he can't or didn't read.
---
No, that guy sounds like a baby.  
---
Some people might not like reserves. Those people can start their own groups.   
---
I personally don't think reserving an item (as long as you let people know ahead of time) or two is all that bad, it's when "every green / blue / gray" is when I start getting annoyed, though after looking for a tank for half an hour I'll take what I can get.
---
Hey, happy cake day!
---
That feeling when you sit down for 2 hours to play.
---
Passing by a random quest
---
"Ohh I should do that before I move on"
---
Find 1 Strand of Hair from any living creature
---
"Sounds easy enough"
---
2 hours and 5 genocides later, still looking for that one drop
---
"ffs, not again blizz"
---
this is dumb
---
I personally hate reservations so I dont join those groups, but I dont think it's a dick move to reserve as long as it is stated before the run.
---
&gt; It doesn’t take 3 hours to cook dinner and do whatever cleaning you may need to do
---
I didn't say that, I specifically guesstimated it at 1 hour.
---
&gt; not everybody has kids to clean up after so daily, after say 6pm, there’s really not much to do unless you have a business or need to study or some shit
---
Yeah that's what I was getting at with the responsibilities part.
---
&gt; I hate it when people think spending 3 hours a day playing a game is bad but thinks nothing of somebody watching that amount of tv a day, which is really common
---
I agree with that but I never intimated that. I think 3 hours of TV a day is essentially the same.
---
Reserving is kind of a jerk move generally speaking but this guy is obviously in the wrong since he joined the group etc.
---
It's not going to get better and battlegrounds will combine PvP and PvE servers cross realm.
---
Time for you to accept your new reality.
---
Not if you can't get to it.   But obviously the answer is to continue to bang your head on a wall for three hours and ignore all other content in the game because it isn't as (((optimum))).   Then cry that the game is literally unplayable.
---
reserving anything in my opinion is wrong. You cant get the kill solo, so need help to do it.  But if you're putting the group together then its your call. At least folk know what they are signing up for so shouldnt complain.
---
The other rogue was definitely in the wrong, just going to wipe everyone else, cos he's in a huff!
---
Welcome little 50+ lego honor boar!
---
Show me some
---
That is something that surprised me about Classic. Most objects that I'm used to breaking LoS in retail don't break it in Classic.
---
East flemish too broski. And screw you, Brehhe for laif ;)
---
The amount of devlopment effort Blizzard put into the PvE aspect absolutely dwarves the resources that Blizzard has invested in the PvP aspect of the game. WoW was devised as an EverQuest-like game. PvP has been an obvious afterthought and remains an afterthought to this very day. If WoW had been built from the ground up to be a PvP game, it would look very, very differently.
---
Oh, and by the way: There are no "PvE servers". They are called "Normal" servers.
---
I think reserving loot is a douche move but you did form the group and and tell them before hand so If he had issues then he shouldn’t have went with your group.
---
**you don't need to constantly read your logs, just when a new entry comes up with a new name that isn't your own. 
---
moron.**
---
&gt;insert random "reroll to pve server" quote.
---
If you don't do raids, you can go Fury-Prot. Awesome threat, and improved shield block + Last Stand is enough to tank dungeons.
---
Nah bro
---
Agree with this. Cross server was detrimental to the experience of retail WoW.
---
dkp? lucky? LOL.
---
Downing bosses doesnt mean anything. 39 people can carry 1. 35 people can carry 5. Doesnt mean those 5 were doing their job the best they could. So those 5 will not be rewarded over the other 35. its a garbage system.
---
How should I be using the Swing Timer addon for a rogue? I have it, but I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing with it
---
From 17.30 it's 1000+ everyday except Friday and Saturday
---
I’m sorry but you honestly have no idea what it’s like to play a seriously imbalanced server. There are zero in game options, you either sit in IF or spend an hour+ corpse running to an instance
---
Nothing to do with faction balance. Grobbulus is perhaps the best balanced server we have with heavy PvP participation on both sides - a bit more on Alliance side actually based on yesterday's PvP rankings. But the Horde still love to camp that boat. It's just an easy and fruitful spot to camp. We wiped them several times last night but as soon as we left they were back at it, so either Alliance camps it or Horde will, basically.
---
It's actually great. Takes about 1:15 to clear MC then I can go pvp or W/e I want.
---
This assumes the players logging on are going to/want to participate in PvP that day.
---
You can't compare wow to a first person shooter, there's much more people do when they log on than shoot each other and those people shouldn't be punished because people think it will cause fair PvP encounters.
---
It's called Bonus Roll, BDP is just what most of the guild calls it. The guild leaders created it as a compromise to DKP in order to prevent long time players from completely owning loot. Yes they'll have an advantage, but they can always roll poorly and lose. That's the philosophy as it was explained to me, with items such as legendaries being exempt from this system.
---
Lost roll on Finkles D:
---
Thanks. It sounded like a good plan to me but I wanted to check in first.
---
Yeah I have heard horror stories about it, but our guild has been good with spreading items out for the raid or getting specific items to those who need them.
---
Ha!
---
The game is built on having problems that reduce quality of life. If you wanted a streamline and fair version of the game that is what retail is for. Otherwise, wait out the storm or reroll. 
---
You might not be having fun, but this is quite literally the most fun I've ever had in a game (I'm alliance for the record). It's never coming back after it's gone and I would rather not bandaid fix this just because of some people's poor choices in server.
---
Did you get it though? :)
---
You’ll be more mana efficient and clear faster if you put points into Fire for Ignite instead of Arcane, since you aren’t using R1 Explosion to fish for procs, clearcasting is being wasted
---
First of all show me the official info on how big the server cap was in Vanilla. Then show me your census data that right now there are 500% extra players allowed to be before queue kicks in.
---
People seem to think that a game *being* on PC makes it eligible. Last year won, and all the other nominees were only on PC.
---
I just remember that almost half of it was spent intermittently jumping in the cross-roads Inn.
---
If you elected to play on a server where you would. be a farm able resource at all times I am not sure how much sympathy I can feel. Nobody forced people to do this and many warned that it would not be fun.
---
I rolled on a pve server and there are plenty who run around flagged now looking for a fight as well as perpetual pvp available in Hillsbrad for big battles.  We are having a blast
---
Ha knew it. How's it going? Sounds like ya'll had a good run last night if you saw Mageblade drop.
---
I’ve leveled Sub daggers 1-54 so far, and I’ve loved every second of it. Just know that they are less efficient PvE than Combat Swords. But as a trade off, you are better in a PvP situation, and you have WAY more control options.
---
I do not have the same experience as the others in this thread talking about dungeons, I top meters spamming Backstab and keeping SnD up, it’s the same rotation as every other rogue spec.
---
Your talent tree looks fine besides one thing, that one point in Master if Deception is wasted. Stealth levels work in factors of 5, and each point in MoD gives 3. So you either want 2, 4, or 5/5. I’d take it out and put one more in Camouflage.
---
I didn't downvote by the way, but I was just going off the top of my head. I also think it's pretty fun that we are able to calculate the brackets and where you need to place to end up at a certain rank.
---
Don't use SS mid-swing, but right after it.  
---
It reset auto-attack timer.
---
Let's how you feel when every server is dead and you got no1 to greif.
---
I’m enhance for pvp purposes, your priority is stamina, then I would value strength around the same as agility.
---
Primarily because 1 STR=2AP, and 20 AGI=1%Crit. You want both of those stats to successfully kill people.
---
Hunter dungeon gear is good if you aren’t able to get melee raid gear, like me.
---
I also have a soft spot for the black dragonscale leather working mail set.
---
Very high AP, average stamina and good set bonuses. Only downside is a lack of agility, but you can make that up with rings/trinkets or necklace as you see fit.
---
Yeah but you said it like someone would only have 3 or 4 hours of spare time in a day, when it’s more like 6 excluding cleaning and what not, and assuming 8 hours of sleep and an hour to get ready and get to work is suitable. And yeah I was just confused because you said “there’s an hour out of your 3” or something along those lines
---
This... wrong solutions for the actual problem.
---
Raid grouping is not the meta. You'll be getting less than 10 honor per kill in a large group. Considering it takes 10's / 100's of thousands of honor to rank up beyond R7, it's basically impossible to rank this way.
---
Just you.
---
Don't iceblock in the middle of the raid.
---
Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't realise my enjoyment of the game was dictated by your standards, you self-righteous pelican
---
No. Reserving an item is fine. If someone is mad you are reserving it, they can start their own group.
---
Hahaha “it’s a trap!!!”
---
They don’t, someone already said it - he probably has his mouse buttons corresponding with those keys.
---
Druid
---
As a warrior who did not take engineering and keeps forgetting to bring consumables when going out to world pvp, it's definitely not amazing. I can't kill anything that casts spells for the most part. I should also note that I don't have any of the crazy good MC weapons to bonk squishies with, so mileage may vary on that.
---
With all of that in mind once battlegrounds come things will become a lot more enjoyable.
---
Sounds great, see ya in a week!
---
Then why is everyone not doing it? Does it only work randomly?
---
What ever happened to rogues rockin 
---
Fiery **and** Icy? 
---
Dmg + a slow!
---
Did you spec elemental? Because you just spit some lava hot fire
---
Was spy in vanilla? I remember world pvp much differently. 
---
Also does a hunter with aspect of the beast which is supposed to be untrackable show up on spy? 
---
As a NE hunter a good amount of my kit and racials are fucked from the addon
---
I'm about to hit 57 on my Druid.
---
Is now a good time to respec to my proper HotW/NS build I'll use at 60? 
---
I'm 1/31/15 right now with dps talents for questing. I'll still quest some but plan on starting to heal/tank BRD and other end game dungeons for my prebis gear.
---
I'm pretty undergeared from just questing mainly so the respec would help a lot.
---
Horde nethergarde keep underworld, we need ranged dps
---
My mount gold farming strat right here lol.
---
Granted, but if he's killing botters, he's still doing the lord's work.
---
I don't think the "oof" applies to druids anymore. Because druids have their talent revamps and Dire bear armor buffs and stuff from the start.
---
Sure, many will still parrot the "druids aren't viable" cliche because the sweaty speedrun guilds prefer classes that can snipe heals to pad meters, but the rest realize that when there's actually healing to be done druids perform just fine
---
The warrior poppped reck or death wish
---
People have been posting all week here how they would like to transfer to a PVE server so they can actually play the game when they log in.  Not everyone played 15 years ago, plenty were basically peer pressured into joining PVP servers as they are the “real” game. 
---
If you enjoy the game as is and are comfortable with your choices then you are all set.  For all the people near 60 regretting their server type choice why shouldn’t they be allowed to bail?
---
Yeah i also thought of it (since i livr in the alps) but unless you're on a glacier theres no snow all year around. So maybe it's a higher mountain akin to mt. Everest?
---
Or it could just be a random glacier in the area, haha.
---
But definitely think the rest of the landscape is fitting
---
normally it'll be like... i've got a pretty packed inventory but i'm about to go do something. last time this happened was when i picked up playing an alt that used to be my main and i hadn't logged into him in over a month. Super messy inventory, already had a goal in mind.
---
Im what I've noticed: None of them.
---
Right, it's all about your standing. That's what determines your bracket and rank points. Week one I farmed 24k honor, standing 552, and achieved R3 60% which I think clearly shows on my server (Whitemane) that there is a pretty large pool. I only moderately grinded Hillsbrad one day, then a bit more on a couple other days and nothing else.
---
When Wildstar was coming I was interested but when they showed trailers I lost all interest in it. It was trying too hard and the "edgy" humour was at the level of r/iamverysmart / hi every1 im new!!!!!!! *holds up spork* my name is katy but u can call me t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m!!!!!!!! lol…as u can see im very random!!!!
---
So it was just cringy and the amount of second hand embarrassment was too much. Same reason I don't like Borderlands.
---
I hope they don't do cross server BG's just to fuck over the people who pilled up on the practically horde only PvP servers.
---
Agreed
---
The fighting seems just about right in the plaguelands. Win some zergs, lose some zergs, most of my honor is from 1v1 or doing. There is some BS FP camping, but nowhere near as bad as this subreddit led me to believe the state of the game was in

Here is what the pros do:
---
You rebind S to an important spell since it is excellently positioned and you should never backpaddle EVER. So in theory: you don't need the key. The only exception is vehicles and when tanking sometimes.
---
You can move your whole movemet to your mouse if you are comfortable with it. As a melee dps in a raid environment that actually works out. However, if you are ranged, a healer, or not in a raid environment that you might run into targeting problems.
---
Drops in Uldaman
---
See, this is why I've ended up with more playtime on my mage. Always enjoyed the mage fantasy, but I'm still struggling through the early stages of learning AoE Farming
---
Learned it after getting a drop and happily making 15g a day ☺️
---
If you don't have Sword Spec or a Hand of Justice it's irrelevant. 
---
If you are Sword Specced, you have to try to time your abilities and use them immediately after your MH autoattack triggers. e.g. if you have a 2.8sec swing timer, you want to use your abilities at 0.01 (at the beginning of the swing).
---
I started daggers and got frustrated. Swords.
---
Lets stop pretending the roving death squads are only the dominant faction.
---
You sure about this? Last night I saw a pally bubble off the bomb. Shouldnt IB remove it as well?
---
the main takeaway i think Ion should take away from this is that vanillas PvP system makes people do world pvp. sure when BGs comes out if you are serious that is where you will be but the rewards for doing world pvp is good enough that you will still do it when you are farming herbs or doing quests or walking to the raid.
---
study how rewarded players are in a pvp sense by doing pvp in vanilla and try to apply it to retail.
---
I heard so many horror stories about loot council that I was suspicious of the guild I joined because they used it. I’ve totally changed my opinion. If you’re a member of the core raid team, each piece of gear is making you stronger as a team, and you know that there’s a good chance that if you don’t get a piece this time, you may have priority for it next time. Awesome setup as long as people communicate and set expectations.
---
Imho they said that in a dev video it will be cross server from the start.
---
Although wether that is better or worse depends on what factor one is looking at. Certainly bad in "know your enemies" as there are off realm enemies you will be facing. It won't do any good for queue times though as faction imbalance is global not local. Pretty much all PVP realms have horde dominating as min-maxing racials lead to that. Pretty much all PVE realms have alliance dominating as min-maxing again leads to that.
---
There are a lot fewer PVE realms than PVP realms. Highest population realms on top are almost exclusively PVP realms. Therefor: crossrealm bgs won't help horde queue time and might even make it worse than if it is realm only.
---
The FUCK? What are you supposed to do?
---
LMAO who would stay in a guild so bad you have to use consumables in MC ? I mean I understand GFPP for rag cause if your not giving yourself an extra life worth of hp for free that's just stupid but there is 0 reason to be popping a 100g+ flask for this garbage.
---
Yes it is. Only if you guys struggle to kill Rag before sons spawn should you be flasking. Every other boss does not need a flask. Be prepared for BWL though as it is going to be a “flask every night” raid.
---
Be prepared for sociopath comments, it's the only result you will have on this subreddit with this kind of post. 
---
don't even reply to them it's pointless. 
---
Sincerely good luck!
---
yeah, but as a rogue there's better methods to make money that will probably net you just as much honor in the process.
---
Dear diary
---
Explain to them that the guild should grind dungeons a week or two before going into MC, leave when they don't listen. If you have 30 people who can stay on for hours at a time who need full raid to flask to clear MC, you will get way better overall upgrades from grinding dungeons than spending that time in MC.
---
What the fuck? Sorry dude, that sucks. Leave asap
---
Swamp man good.
---
RC Bad.
---
They could be called banana servers it doesn't change the fact that the biggest time sink in the game is pvp :)
---
Well I did put it under nostalgia.
---
You could join your servers discord and set up a meeting for the evening to have a full group ready to rumble once you log on. 
---
In the morning you can get fairly decently into the BRM on my server which is high pop as well. If you have the time to spare, run the chars to the dungeon you want to run in the evening and be in the dungeon when you login. 
---
Dungeon grind to 60, prepare groups for when you want to do preBiS dungeons, dont just hearth out, rerun the same dungeon couple times an evening.
---
I'm currently using [Shadowed Unit Frames](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames), which until now I've liked a whole lot, but I'm running into a limitation of it that I can't figure out how to get around: it doesn't show enemy buffs on the Target frame. 
---
Anyone know how to get these to show on this addon? I'm also open to suggestions for other unit frame addons that DO show enemy buffs. The only addon I'm not willing to use is ElvUI because I used it too much in retail over the years and the game doesn't feel like classic to me with ElvUI installed.
---
Hm wonder if the RP walk was on purpose.. I used to hit that key by mistake before I disabled it
---
If you need spy in order to pvp you should be the one going to a pve server
---
I mean, I'm a mage and I fucking blow  iceblock every single time it's up, even to shave a second or two off a stun
---
If you got em, use em
---
On a clear day, if you crank up your detail settings, you can sometimes see the docks of the Horde town of Southshore from across the Beradin Bay.
---
Which server are you on? I'm sure a lot of servers are getting a similar dynamic to this, but I'm Horde on Smolderweb and we have this TO A TEE. Pretty much exactly what happens. At least for anything like 7-10+. "Small scale" is a bit different. Mostly because its non existent :( I have had some REALLY good 1v1s though. Sylves, if you read this. Great 1v1 in Azshara last night buddy!
---
Unfortunately there aren't many rep quests beyond just collecting junkboxes. The level 50 Ravenholdt quest isn't in the game in until phase 5 (I think).
---
What's the add-on for extended character stats?
---
Free casts
---
You go for 9% hit so that you are yellow-capped (minus weapon skill stuff). After that you focus on getting crit capped.
---
If you have those two, you played enough warrior to answer the remaining questions yourself.
---
The problems, which stated in the screenshot *did* exist in Vanilla.
---
&gt; Faction imbalance + overpopulation...
---
&gt; Significant disadvantages in PvP and PvE for minority faction...
---
Those are the problems that most people are complaining about and they were problems is Vanilla as well.
---
Perma camped by 5-10 alliance? Please, that is not being camped at all. Form a raid group and fight that. That’s what PvP is about! 
---
But being camped by 40+ people at all of those points, making any sort of resistance futile is exactly what limiting one faction would do to servers. I can tell from your posts you just cannot comprehend how bad it is on severely unbalanced servers. 
---
Everyone gets camped and griefed, that is part of the game and comes with being on a PvP server. But being outnumber 10:1 at EVERY place in the game is beyond ridiculous.
---
Water is going for that much on your server? It's barely worth transmuting for it on mine.
---
Well purposely not inviting people that may roll on your loot is kind of the same as reserving isn't it? You are not saying it out loud in /4 hat you are reserving the item but it's honestly the same if you make it so you are the only one that can roll on it.
---
Lets say a mage is making a group for LBRS. He want the gloves. Me, alse being a mage, want the legs. If he advertise the gloves as being reserved then I can join and get my legs and that's better than if he just ignores every other cloth casters.
---
AND I must say that as a person that don't really want to make groups, I'm really grateful for all the Rogues doing the "Jed/Rend MH Reserved" groups. Got me my Briarwood :)
---
about 8 weeks or less
---
I am sorry someone hurt you, and I hope you can find peace.
---
Yes, ice block and bubble remove all debuffs, including Living Bomb and Weakened Soul.
---
Good to know on the MoD. At your level 54 did you opt into Master of Deception at all yet?
---
From what I've heard, hunters fall off pretty hard in later phases in terms of damage. If you can find a more relaxed guild you can heal for on your druid, I would do that. I think the most important thing is finding a guild you like playing with and sticking to it.
---
You only got 7. Next time you need one or two more mages to wipe everyone but the paladins out.
---
This is just anecdotal, I know, but nobody of my friends or guildmates plays Horde for the racials. They played Horde in vanilla because they thought it's badass when they were kids and now everyone wants to relive the whole experience. It's nostalgia.
---
The imbalance ofc. Like Gadzetzan right now. It's 30 horde roaming the town looking for alliance spawning/flying in and if they are worth honor they get zerged by 5 mages. You stand no chance. Even now a group of 10 lvl 60 alliance flew in to fight and in 2 minutes they're all dead. Can't even blame the horde cus it's decent honor.
---
OKay, didn't know that !
---
Yeah and I decided I didn't really care
---
It only works if you die on the boat. Good luck making it to the boat.
---
So he also has a keybind for = for his trinket?
---
No, we're not. I've worked on several in my time and most of us are playing classic and enjoying it and agree about its good points. However the games I've worked on have all been full loot pvp mmos because we miss the days before WoW (UO especially).
---
Anyone who is working on the games you're probably thinking about most likely has no problem with it either or feel no shame. It's a job, a regular employee has no say in what is being made and if people here think that upper management is scratching their heads wondering why classic won like someone here posted then you underestimate their insight a lot.
---
If you're making a cookie cutter mmo right now you're there for the money and many games are making more than classic is which is what matters to them.
---
No, you’re right. Just roll greed it’ll be fine. One less dummy to beat for some sick loot.
---
Speed to boots. Spell power to staff.
---
I play on a server where my faction is severely outnumbered and I enjoy it. You just need to be smart about going around and if needed travel with a group together.
---
How? Are you in college?
---
And how many of them actually use the boat? I'd rather swim.. or uh, walk.
---
He’s right though- it’s laughable how you say “this my
---
Endgame tank” “endgame healer” when you are level 15 three months in lol. At this pace, “end game” will be phase six
---
Ya its more about playing as a group and having fun.
---
The level 80 fights were extremely easy compared to the level 60 ones. Just look at four horsemen;
---
https://youtu.be/IE-8l3UXtYI?t=195
---
There's the 4 corners and the safe spot in the middle and the bosses stack up their increasing damage debuff in their corner like the level 80 version. At level 80 you just had 2 range tanks in the back for a minute, 2 tanks in the front, and you just burned them all down one by one in like 30 seconds each. At 60 you need to have a rotation of 8 tanks, 4 in the back 4 in the front. For each half of the room, two tanks are on the bosses, one is in the safespot dropping his debuffs, and the fourth is rotating to push the next guy out of his spot to start running. 
---
The front bosses you kill first. One has a meteor though that splits damage on everyone it hits like at level 80, it's just much more dangerous here. You literally can not be in his range while not stacked as a group or you risk being one shot. This means that your dps can't just rotate freely, you need 4 groups of them that are rotating like the tanks do. One group goes into the boss to dps and soak meteors, as the next dps group runs in, they run to the safe spot as a group, then from safespot to the other front boss, then back to safespot.
---
For healers we had 6 pairs of healers rotating in a full circle, with one just camping in the safe spot to top people up and fit themselves into the rotation if another healer dies. 
---
The thing with naxx40 compared to MC/BWL/AQ is that there are a lot of mechanics that make one person wipe the raid pretty easily. It's not enough to just let your good players worry about mechanics, your lower players will also have to execute them well.
---
i waited for a hunter to finish skinning his devilsaur, it was the least I could do.
---
Even timeline aside, Blizzard has been screaming to the heavens to get off the "mega" servers and doing everything they can to try and spread the population out. Should they have released more servers to begin with? Yes, but they've since done so and people still refuse to move. Blizzard isn't blameless but they also aren't forcing you to sit in a queue when there's free xfers available.
---
Sounds like guild leadership isn't aware of raid mechanics to effectively lead a successful raid. There are numerous and much more economical requirements they should explore first. For example:
---
-Get MT capped on Fire Resist. (This can be expensive for MT but gearing a MT effectively makes the ENTIRE raid better).
---
-Make it required for every raid member to pre-pop Greater Fire Protection Potions. (6 to 8g per pot on my server).
---
-Before Rag head to UBRS in groups of 10, have Priests Mind Control the Flamecaster mob at the start of the instance and cast the Fire Resist buff on everyone. This 81 additional Fire Resistance and besides time / coordination, it's free. 
---
This isn't about Spell Power, healing or DPS necessarily. This is about mitigation. DPS taking excessive Fire Damage results in less DPS and more strain on healers. 
---
If they are making this a hard a fast rule, I'd thank them for their time and find a different guild. No serious raid group is requiring Flasks for MC.
---
Because it will further ruin the faction balance on those realms. Of course
---
LOL I did a similar thing to a 60 mage in shimmering flats while I was leveling. I just stayed on the other side of a round building from him. He tried for a minute then finally just gave up and ran away. feelsgoodman!
---
&gt; Those are the problems that most people are complaining about and they were problems is Vanilla as well.
---
They are problems that literally every MMO with a 2-faction system has. Even 3-faction systems (Planetside) still have this issue, but to a lesser extent.
---
Don't build the robe. Ele fire is super expensive and hence extremely contested. It's a thing for 60ies to farm and even then it's pain.
---
This is supremely heavy for this subreddit and I like it’s existence. Thanks for your experience and sharing.
---
Your constant complaining is proving them right.
---
Beanna literally helped compose the most comprehensive guides on tanking and warrior gameplay. Everything he said in that post is backed up by countless hours of theorycrafting a testing. You may want to take his advice a little more seriously. It's 100% correct.
---
This makes no sense
---
I know the horde guide is good, have you tried his Alliance? Also would you happen to have a link you could PM me? I have an older version of the Horde guide but money is tight so I can't afford to pay for a guide unfortunately.
---
Oh man I laughed way too hard at this, this was amazing.
---
How where they supposed to know about their servers imbalance before already investing much time into their character?
---
Selling warrior charms and rocks lol. Payed way better this time around than it did the first time through lol. 
---
Although back in classic I got a fiery war axe from the elemental grind that helped out alot haha
---
Generally data will be cached if it is data that's accessed often enough to warrant moving it closer to the processor, thus reducing the time it takes to access this data. By that logic, deleting the contents of the cache folder will not speed anything up, but rather the opposite.
---
Regarding your other issues:
---
* Screen flickering will most likely be to do with display settings or graphics card drivers / settings
---
* That sounds like it could be an issue with the Bagnon addon - do you still notice it if you disable it?
---
I mean the first time you get to it it's gonna suck. But after that just stay in the dungeon, when you die, don't even walk back into the dungeon to ress up, look for a group as a spirit and once your group is all dead and ready to go, then you push in, rinse and repeat. It's what I've done from 50-56.5 on my resto druid.
---
Only pick a druid if you think you would want to heal or tank at all. If you just want to dps go rogue.
---
cross server bg's were a thing in naxx patch of vanilla.
---
 But being outnumber 10:1 at EVERY place in the game is beyond ridiculous.
---
Isn't 10 alliance vs 1 horde just that?
---
How are so many replies on reddit so incapable of understanding jokes?
---
What??? Tuk has a huge config menu and everything is tweakable, but it's not so tweakable you can break things (unlike Elv).
---
It's based on Ace2 instead of Ace3 which makes it a lot less bloated, and for a new UI beginner, Tuk&gt;Elv any day.
---
Griefers justification for themselves never fails to be amusing.   
---
Sorry your parents didn't love you, but it certainly has created an entertaining human.
---
You now earned yourself a spot on the list!!
---
I haven't looked at it yet, but with my 53 and 44 and 19 combined.... probably not gonna be good.
---
Easy solution: Allow Ally to Horde transfers.
---
Just ragequit DM because I thought phase 2 screwed something up with the linking and Blizzard would take 2 months to fix it but this makes perfect sense. Had 100+ runs without problems and now just after completing 5-set the problems appeared. Thanks mate!
---
Definitely miss blade flurry for easily taking down two mobs, but the pvp potential outweighs that for me completely, haven't noticed to bad of an impact on hit but I believe that's because I'm swords and have sword racial with human?
---
&gt; "how can we copy that stuff better"
---
More like how can we do the least amount of effort to make the most $$.
---
well, afaik spell\_aura\_applied is a part of the [2.4 version](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/86577-05-02-240-guide-to-the-new-combat-log/) of combat\_log\_event. In the 1.12 api there's CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL and CHAT\_MSG\_COMBAT prefixes. These are all the events [Paranoia](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/Paranoia/) registers:

There's also CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_BUFF, but interestingly it is commented out in the code with the comment "does not work". You might be on to something here
---
Farm 2 hours in hillsbrad and then do to hours in BRM, Kargat or TP with a group of 5.
---
You will see a major difference in honor gain.
---
Charms had a crazy fluctuating price on my server. There were days when they sold for like 10 silver but there were days when I could sell one for a gold each.
---
That’s not how it works.
---
Would the zeppelin near UC be good for this? Lots of horde arriving and jumping down and lose 90% hp.
---
I'm not saying that every player is trying to escape it, I'm saying that as a group we are trying to escape some of the odious and/or unhealthy game design patterns that have emerged in recent MMOs.
---
Achievements in more than just my opinion, one of them.
---
He's dead wrong, Tuk has a huge configuration menu. I don't know what that guy was smoking.
---
ElvUI is so tweakable you can actually break things easily, and I went back to Tuk in classic after using Elv on pservers for years. They're done by the same developer and he updates both constantly.
---
I am old,  with an infant and wont be able to raid on a constant schedule. I don't want to roll on a pvp server. I raised classic through lk as horde.
---
What normal server should I roll on as alliance. And should I roll holy pally or disc priest for pugs/fill in raids?
---
What is suicide kings, is that just regular rolling?
---
Probably helps yeah, I'm Orc so I don't get that, also swords though as there's no other worthy options!
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers
---
54/46 horde/ally doesn't sound to bad.
---
I have to say I'm really sorry to the few rare lvl 30 alliance I've come across while battling in Hillsbrad. I usually don't realize your level before I've oneshotted you T.T
---
Realistically the first upgrade from WW Axe are the green BOE "Colossal Axe of the xxx", 43 dps, 3.8 speed, level 51.
---
I used this from 51 to 60 until I got some dungeon weapons.
---
Without 305 weapon skill you're forced to get 9 percent hit to cap, and your glancing blows deal 70% damage. With 305 skill you only need 6 hit to cap and your glancing blows deal 85% damage. So, yes lol.
---
Silver ore is 1g each on my server, silver bars are 6-8s.
---
I agree. It’s just incompetence. Not malice.
---
This isn't a solo game. This retail mentality that you should be able to do everything solo and never have to group or communicate or adapt has to go. 
---
Anyways it seems blizzard is going to do BGs soon. Mark my words we'll see complaints about premades stomping pugs within 2 days of those being released, and how blizzard should change things because "I didn't fight premades in vanilla! It wasn't like this D:". People literally always complain. It's how we got retail.
---
I would tell those 48s to either quit or take break for the time being. People that are not 60 at this point are incredibly casual. Like people in my guild with kids and jobs have been killing rag for weeks. So what does it matter if they take a break? Sit it out and wait for BGs to come placate you until you realize you're still not going to win anything meaningful because you're just plain bad at pvp. 
---
If you
---
Nah it doesn't. You can team up in 5 man teams and follow the big raid groups. You get Honor based on your damage output separated by number of group members. If you've got an aoe clas with you, your good to go.
---
If you think you'll be playing solo 95% of the time I'd stay away from a warr.
---
And how is that suprising?
---
I'm usually in the same boat but his reaction seems genuine
---
I'm torn between my 56.5 druid or an elemental 30/0/21 shaman. I want to focus mostly on PvP with some PvE, raids here and there, dungeons, etc. I really like healing in PvE and I LOVE DPSing in PvP. My issue with druid is how long it takes to kill certain classes, basically becoming a mana battle down to the last drop. What would you guys recommend someone who wants to PvP &gt; PvE but still wants to raid, even if it's much more casual. I'm also a casual player on the weekdays (1-2 hours) and I can play a few more hours on the weekend (3-6).
---
It's time for some private servers m8. This ain't no vanilla this ain't no classic this is some leftover shit from retail...
---
I think Hunter's sets are ugly, but other than that it fits your criteria the best.
---
Your other option is that your server slowly turns into a Horde PvE server.
---
Ah yea leeching
---
Yes if you're a caster
---
Well while I don't have a spreadsheet heres why from an anecdotal perspective.
---
You want a big hard hitting main hand, and a fast offhand.  Also, never forget the STATS on the item.
---
The Dal Rends SET is the best because the top end of the one main hand is comparable to Krol and Zeal, but the set gives you 50 attack power, giving it the edge.  Note also that the dal rends offhand sucks on its own since it doesn't give you offensive stats.
---
Krol is better than Zeal because it has 1% crit, and str on it.  Those two stats give it the edge.
---
Mirah's is the best offhand because it gives you Agi and Str, and its fast so more poisons and sword procs.  Way better than other offhand sword options.
---
For that purpose I have leveled warrior solo and deeply regretted it in the end lol.
---
i love baby yeed like you wouldn't believe
---
Cross server doesn't help faction imbalances at all, if the dominant server isn't waiting 20 minutes per queue they're not gonna xfer to a more balanced server.
---
Especially when AQ rolls around and you STILL have to farm MC/BWL/ONY. Knock all the farm content out on one night and focus on progression on the other raid night(s).
---
Your rudeness isn't necessary, but I'll respond anyway. I responded form a server that also has horde bias. Everyone knows Herod is horde dominated, and so is Shaz. Also complaints like his are common from all alliance right now across servers, so it goes both ways. So according to alliance, all servers that are horde dominated are impossible to play on. It's bull shit. You seem to be on his side though so you're interest is in picking apart my points and worshiping his. I get it.
---
Why is my anecdotal evidence stupid and irrelevant, yet his anecdotal evidence you seem to hold sacrosanct? Why aren't you questioning what time he was there, how long he tried to get into Ony. His claims are ridiculous, that it's impossible to get to Ony. My point was that this claim is simply impossible, and I've seen access to Ony uncontested. There, there's one time it was possible, it's a counterpoint to his absurd assertion. I didn't feel the need to describe the exact time, but it was in the evening between 5 and 9, which is when I play and most guilds raid. Obviously I wouldn't make the point if I was playing at fucking 3 am, but since your interest is in agreeing with him and believing his ridiculous assertion that alliance is absolutely fucked at all times, you've decided to be a pedant.
---
Why do people keep saying this? A lot of people said it was hard. Plenty of comments talking about how itll take weeks for rag to be downed after launch. It didnt go that way at all and now everyone is denying it was ever said.
---
Dwarf warrior is fine for PvE. Stoneform is super useful, and you get a pair of Edgemaster's and you can top the charts just like any other warrior.
---
95% of the info is the same?
---
IMO you don't need prot at all for 5 man dungeons.  Arms even helps for that as mobs don't hit too hard and you can sweeping strikes/ww to get massive agro.
---
I've tanked all 5 mans with Arms and even wearing some leather (devilsaur gear, etc.).
---
Prot is only needed for MC once mobs hit a lot harder.
---
Do people not know that if you die on a boat and do not release that you will be revived on the boat when you zone to the next location?
---
you do you i cbf w/ wpvp tbh
---
If faction based queues were to exist, 55:45 is too low. Maybe more like 60:40 or something. However I don’t believe that creating artificial queues is the right way to do it.
---
You can definitely ice block to remove the debuff entirely. It only cannot be reflected is the only condition as far as I'm aware... unless they changed something in 1.13.2
---
To all rogues camping it on Razorgore, please gank me again, I need that honor.

Gandling EU its soldi for 1k

Essence prices: 20g each

Because it is. When the kids get older and keeps asking mom why she hangs out with Brad, Chad and Jeff all the time, dad’s going to have to break the news that she gets dicked by men that aren’t ol’ daddy here. And why’s that? Because daddy doesn’t/isn’t able to satisfy mom’s dicking needs and doesn’t put mom’s dickings as high a priority as he should over his MC raids. So now you have emotional neglect, sexual neglect, and lack of empathy between partners. Maybe the kids learn from others that this shit is weird af and not to use their own parents as role models but 9/10 kids wanna emulate their parents.
---
Damn RIP
---
So on a server with a substantial faction imbalance, you *don't* want cross server BGs?  The queue times for the dominant faction will be *tremendous*.  Add to that the fact that if they do open up paid server xfers, the faction imbalance on your server will get substantially worse than it already is.  
---
Frankly, so long as they keep battlegroups, you will still pretty much see most of the same faces again and again anyway.
---
I work, but I had 3 weeks paid vacation saved up. Got another one coming up first week of december, so that’s gonna be pvp farm time.
---
I'd open another ticket. You may get a different GM with a different answer because they're inconsistent. It's like getting the wrong order at a fast-food place. Sometimes you get a hardo manager that argues with you about it, sometimes they let you keep what you got and get you what you ordered also. 
---
I've played for long enough that I've had GMs refuse to restore items, GMs restore items etc.
---
&gt;I can't reroll
---
Not true. You can, but you don't **want** to reroll.
---
I really don't get the invested time argument, sure you would have to invest time again, but aren't you having fun during that investment? Do you just like the end game content or why do you think you "can't" reroll?
---
As long as the game is fun for you I don't see any problem in leveling an alt on another server.
---
Kill that addon
---
I would say any game with lootboxes or microtransactions that include RNG are basically indistinguishable from casinos, and possibly worse due to oftentimes lacking any kind of regulation. I think targeting addicts is at best insanely immoral and unethical even if it isn't illegal per se.
---
&gt; guilds keep them for themselfs.
---
We constantly sell ours to other guilds. When we get an eye drop the person getting it can wait for our drops or buy them him/herself.
---
If you were actually playing instead of raid logging you’d see that there are basically more allis going hard at the PvP than horde. Yea there are more horde, but it seems like most of them are casual with a solid handful being deep into PvP. Basically every alli who stick around on the other hand is all in.  It’s not been uncommon to run into massive alli raids as a small group and to really have to rally the forces in order to compete with them. There have been some great and even fights lately all said and done.
---
I always wondered what I should do with the „just /target him“-tipp. 
---
Now I know. Thank you!
---
In general I’d say the hybrid classes tend to always be on demand because of the amount of people rolling warriors and mages, shamans in particular seem to be fairly rare.  
---
For DPS classes there seems to be a demand for Warlocks and Hunters to some extent.  
---
Granted.  I’m on a US server though, just what I noticed over here.
---
bear form give a 360% bonus. That's (100%+360%)*1.10(from thick hide)=506%
---
Also horde on Skeram and it feels bad. That's not to say alliance wont randomly control light's hope chapel and gank everyone that lands from the flight path, but they definitely have it way worse. I kind of feel like a dick killing anyone that isn't in a big gank squad.
---
Well, I don't have a guild, so I don't have a spec, but just looking at the numbers I'm probably going fury. 
---
I really don't mind the expense. The extra gold cost to not grind the dungeons is well worth it. 
---
In your opinion, if someone showed up with all the best BOE gear available to a fury warrior, would you let them into your raid?
---
Four weeks with no Eye of Divinity drop. Hoping the 5th week is the charm.
---
you’re kissing yourself if you think acknowledging something matters.. people don’t stop complaining until their precise solution is actually implemented
---
Yes, always people leveling alts looking for all dungeons in the evenings.
---
Getting groups as a healing druid is not easy IMO. If you want to get easy groups you'll have to tank.
---
Apparently you don't. You're still here whining.
---
&gt; Imagine if platformers hadn't improved since Super Mario Sunshine...
---

---
MetroidVania's pretty much saw the genre close to perfected on the SNES with Super Metroid.  Symphony of the Night probably equals it but I am not sure it really beats the experience of playing Super Metroid.
---
How is it leeching when you're doing exactly the same, but not in raid?
---
Very good point.
---
Same except one key fact: Horde have way better access to world PvP than ally, such as their 2 fps with a guarded base in STV.  They have a flight path in Badlands, they have a guarded base in Arathi... the list goes on.  World PVP and leveling is definitely more accessible for Horde, which I used to know back in the day, as a Horde.  Why i switched to Ally I will never know or forgive myself for.
---
Better they have many resets that take 5-10kin each than them not fixing/adjusting shit. It’s a few minutes at a time that many people *should* be at work/school
---
damn dude i got up to 140 before i got mine, it was rough, while i feel you 600+ runs seems insane without a chest drop  
---
sadly its all RNG and a numbers game. i started reserving mine after losing a roll to a hunter after about 80 runs
---
i was doing angerforge arena farm runs, and that generally is just fast enough to avoid lockout and has enough draw to get pugs in there that want an HOJ to help fill dps slots, and since you have a healer that will make it even easier  
---
i have been using a fury prot build to help speed up the runs when im with a slow group with grenades mixed in, for fast groups its all about keeping pace
---
I'm bored. If anyone has questions about 2h Fury lemme know. 
---
If you're undecided on what to play, I strongly suggest warrior and sticking it out to 60. They feel pretty underpowered bjt when you hit end game and start getting your bis/pre bis they are absolutely a blast to play in both pvp and pve. Stick with it!
---
That makes sense but for the items I am selling (dragonscale stuff), there are rarely items on the AH. Maybe 1 at most and that is not even every day. So the market price is not as clear compared to more common items like bags, wands, etc.
---
For the majority of vanilla it was not
---
General Contempt
---
The volume of those douches is the problem. There isn't anywhere to quest in peace right now.
---
You’re stupid as fuck if you get with someone and cannot figure out what they do with 10-15 hours of their lives every day and you end up marrying this person just to be shocked to find out they play fucking video games. If you couldn’t figure that out before then you deserve to be with a fucking idiot like him. I bet you justify her cheating on him too don’t you
---
First, [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro) scans player uploaded raid logs, not more not less. Second, there are total numbers too per realm that this site has seen. You should include these per each realm and thus get the relationship.
---
For the Horde!
---
I won't be too upset if we lose the spider sense, but I'll be angry if I lose my KoS list alert.
---
On Herod last night I got bored with AoE farming Ogres in Tanaris on my level 47 Mage.  I went to STV and started ganking all the low-level alliance I found.  Levels ranged from 35-40 but I killed them so much around the temple/beach area that 2 groups of 2 each tried to tag team me and get me.  I was on the beach, 2 were behind me and 2 were in front of me near the ruin area.  I couldn't take on 4 level 40's at level 47 so I peaced out lol. 
---
It was a fun hour and a half of ganking lowbie alliance players though.  Probably killed people 20-30 times in total.
---
It's not supposed to represent the entire population of the server, but it gives you a good view of the "hardcore" crowd that is serious enough to log their raid encounters.
---
Why do people want to rush things so much? Sure  this week has been chaotic. It's made me change my playstyle. It's made me level slower than I expected to. 
---
 But adapting is part of the fun.
---
That sucks, they were great to play against. Frustrating at times, I can still remember getting corpse camped in Silithus lol, but still. They made the server exciting and dangerous.
---
Was laughing about this last night.
---
When I played Vanilla I was on an Alliance dominated server, Gilneas, and PvP queue's were (and I'm not kidding) over 1 hour at times to almost guarantee a loss unless our best PvP team was running that evening.
---
In Classic, it will be the opposite, where I've been horde since BC and the server I'm on, Kromcrush, appears to be horde dominated.  So while WPvP isn't fun at all, or at least I have not found the situations where it is not fun and just outnumbering and massacring players, queue times of 30 minutes to 1-hour are going to be just as frustrating.  Hopefully this can be figured out, but can we be angry?  It'd just be duplicating the Vanilla experience.
---
Why is LBRS almost never run by anyone despite needing dozens of runs to complete the Seal of Ascension?
---
[Shadowpanther.net](https://Shadowpanther.net) will probably be your best resource, for instance:
---
 [https://shadowpanther.net/daggers-pvp.htm](https://shadowpanther.net/daggers-pvp.htm) 
---
You can just change daggers to sword/mace and pvp to pve in the URL to see all the different items.

HYBRID MEMES
---
I've /who'd Blackfathom like 15 times this week and it returned 0 every time.
---
&gt; but aren't you having fun during that investment?
---
No, I would not enjoy leveling the same class again so soon. 
---
I also don't have the time to reroll if I intend to be at 60 when P3 launches. I won't have the time. 
---
Not everyone can play for 20+ hours a week. Some of us can barely manage 5-10.
---
And they ruined the community IMO
---
Mind controlling mobs in low level areas and buffing the shit out of them is also fun. My favorite is giving Thorns to Hogger and watching rogues kill themselves attacking it.
---
&gt;But you already knew that didn't you you fucking piece of subhuman shit. I'm tired of this false flag, pretending not to understand garbage.
---
Lmao holy fuck you're mad. Maybe it's for the best you step away from the game for a while...

You will have to change the pet names to either their name or type (voidwalker/succubus/felhunter).  I used their names because they were are shorter.  The /use Soul Shard at the end is there simply to have the icon be a soul shard if I don't have a pet summoned because I don't like having the ? mark icon there.
---
Why is this incorrect info getting upvoted?
---
That's the real point i'm trying to make I guess. This is being painted as a horde only issue, when alliance is doing the same thing. Alliance is the underdog on Herod too, and they've been controlling BRM and Gadgetzan. It is what it is. My guild was still able to do MC last night even though it was tough to get there. The people saying the game is unplayable are 100% exaggerating or should have been on PVE servers.
---
Almost requires being unemployed. Thats almost an average of 12 hours a day every day since release.
---
I use skinning as my only source of income (Rogue). I farm devilsaurs. But it is highly dependant on your server, the size, if its faction heavy and when you are able to farm. I play on Flamelash-EU (High) on Horde, its a horde heavy server (65-35) and i am able to farm on absurd times due to my work schedule, i have also realised P2 release have made it easier to farm Devilsaurs since the people that was farming them are now PVPing. The leathers sell for 6g per on Flamelash and if i avg around 17-20 an hour. I actually dropped mining for Engineering, instead of dropping skinning. So roughly i make 100-120g an hour skinning devilsaurs. Worth to mention you kinda have to know everything about devilsaurs and have a system for it.
---
Its overpopulation, Cap back than was 3k, now its 10k. Theres only so much room in the world. I played in Vanilla, it was bad but not nearly as bad as it is now.
---
y o u RE an e VI L K o R e AN

Honest.

Reddit egos. He has to make sure it sounds like hes talking down to you l9o
---
Have you ganked some for me yet? ;)
---
&gt; or uh, walk. 
---
Priest high five\~!
---
Cant really watch the video but he is saying you can make 300g per run in Shadowfang Keep? That does not seem right
---
Loot is all middling at best, guilds run lbrs a lot to get keys for people, but don't expect pugs to operate the same.
---
All the better reason to invite those lvl 58 and 59s to it btw
---
You really need an explanation for why Dals are bis? It’s pretty self explanation, they do the most damage have the highest stats. Sounds like you need to learn the basics first.
---
To keep the suspense you just gank randomly, wave at them or even help them kill mobs at other times. They will never know for sure if they can trust anyone or not.
---
I hate reserved group, so I don't join them, pure logic.
---
so what else resisted my FD when it fails to drop combat in a 1v1?
---
Fairly certain Firestrike doesn't stack.   Just like Consecration from Paladins.  Only the most recent one ticks for damage.
---
really only 10/day though because you're losing the 5/day from fire to earth.
---
80 days isn't exactly a quick turnaround for an investment in classic
---
Unless it’s a warrior, sorry but you don’t get a 800g sell just for being that class
---
Alternatively, alliance is forced to PVP 24/7 to rank while horde can do 1 bg and then take a 2 hour break, watch a few episodes of Netflix, and then jump in again
---
why not run cepgp at that point?
---
DKP has a ton of issues, that was resolved by epgp, a lot of the problems DKP and bidding have epgp solves.
---
Strath UD, north side of the courtyard before Baron, there’s a little hallway that leads to a gated-off raid portal. I searched when I first saw it, it appears to be originally intended as an entrance to naxx.
---
Maybe that practice helped him slightly. But its no secret the dude abused the crap out of layering to do it. I dont call that working for it. Arguably a smart move of him, but morally questionable imo.
---
Why though?  It's not really even a new game.  And I can't even find a list of who was nominated.
---
Pretty much this.
---
3 hour corpse recovery operations when we went into Plane of Fear with too small of a group and wiped. Had to enlist a bigger guild to come and break the opening and rez us all.

And the other pig is Kevin!
---
lmfao no. A youtuber figured out the sequence of commands for FD is coded backwards or wrong. that is why it behaves like shit, because the spell is executing its functions in an incorrect sequence.
---
Oh that's interesting, I guess that settles it then warlock it is! Thanks! By the way how do you feel about world PvP right now? I'm tempted to roll on a pve server for the lock and do a lot of battlegrounds, I rarely play in a 1v1 or a small skirmish?
---
What a ridiculous claim.  Calling everyone else idiots doesn't make you sound cool.
---
The entirety of p2 is about encouraging dick moves.
---
"Zones like Hillsbrad (the infamous setting of Southshore and Tarren Mill) turned into chaotic melees"
---
Unless he meant to say every fucking zone in the entire game world, he's wrong.
---
#nochanges. Go back to retail
---
Hard to scream #nochanges when changes were made before the game even came out, you think populations were thus big in vanilla? No. You think layering was a thing? No.
---
I would say the only way you are making 300g in SFK is if that rogue twink dagger drops.
---
Yeah, it was garbage
---
Can you remove magic debuffs with dispel magic even if you can't detect it?

This is why real pros dont unbind backpaddle :D

Then you can just put random words between self filtered sentences. It's great! #$*" penguin a*" @#*@ and you're *#$@ #"@ with a ceiling fan

\&gt;People conclude Vanilla PvP =/= Classic PvP and needs to be fixed
---
The source of unhappiness of vocal minorities here lies in the fact they are literally minority. 
---
We are yet to see a significant amount of complaints "I am tired of roaming in my death gank squad since we need to spend 10 minutes to find a victim". They will eventually appear but at that point I expect BGs to be released.
---
She's likely breaking it too early.  Wait and one whole second, about til your character falls to the ground.  Works just fine for me.
---
I bought mine for 350g on Blaumex, on the ah people have been listing at 1000g+ but they are moving between 600-800g

Leveling as daggers is too slow. But if you enjoy it, go for it.
---
I have a mage at 60 and am nearing pre-bis (For most slots I either have optimal or optional according to [this list on wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow), except for real expensive BoE items).
---
I have three questions. First off, is there anything productive to do for me outside of raiding and goldfarming? (I'm not really interested in honor farming as a path to gear as the time investment to get anything useful seems a bit high to me).
---
Secondly; I think I should be looking for a raiding guild as that seems the best way to be farming MC. Any tips on how to find a good guild? (I've mostly been looking at the forums to see if any guild that has already cleared MC before needs another mage. Is that too demanding or is that a reasonable standard at this point?)
---
Lastly: What is one expected to bring to MC runs in terms of consumables? Is it normal to be full of mana pots and fire protection pots or is that more a thing for try-harding uberguilds only?
---
I think you are looking at it wrong. You just happen to be in a highly contested area  for both alliance and horde. They run through this place to  get to MC. They weren’t going out trying to start a 22v1 fight. It’s not even about you at all. They were probably going to raid and you were there along they way. Of course you’re going to get killed if you put yourself in harms way.
---
I know this comment is 4 months old, but as a hunter main who's just now leveling a gnome rogue, I'd argue that escape artist is way more a counter to hunters than stoneform is. I'm not even stinging a rogue to get them out of vanish or anything (serpent sting's dot ticks every **three** seconds), flare with a @mousecurser macro is reliable enough at that.
---
He has a point though farming valuable mats from level appropriate mobs is a great way to level. Particularly near 40 when you need mount money.
---
That said this dude is clearly making a bad strategic decision. Sell ports for an hour or AOE farm SM for gold and he'd pay for his two elemental fire very little time
---
Because If you sell it you have enough gold to buy your own bis till phase 3 :)
---
Download Spy. Its the same thing, jackass.
---
Both of your points are valid, but as you perfectly understand, whose who are being farmed are the minority here. This is why they are farmed and this is why Blizzard cannot cater to their complaints.
---
I warn you, my fighting shtyole is unsurpassed!
---
The irony is that by that point Alex Afrasiabi was working for Blizzard, on WoW.
---
Naxx in wrath was a scaled down easy version for entry level players. Vanilla Naxx is a hellhole that tests guilds that didn't break up on Cthun.
---
The exact same thing happened in the guild I was in in Vanilla, and while it was definitely for the better, it was not without a lot of animosity.  I ended up leading the guild made up of the better players, and lost a lot of friends because of it.
---
The amount of time you spent grinding the honor could have been spent grinding the 90g discount.
---
What realm is this? I was on 6.7k last week and only managed to get rank 2
---
How do you play with nameplates?  Every video I have watched with them on, the bars keep jostling and reorganizing for space and not overlapping.  I really dislike nameplates and have never used them personally, and thats with playing from vanilla through Cata too.
---
I soloed and got rank 3 and didn't even spend slot of time compared when bgs will come
---
If you want recruitment advice to get into a higher tier guild, here is what I can tell you:
---
Gear, even char level in Classic to some extent, is somewhat secondary. High end guilds are looking for **dedicated** people which are also **reliable**.
---
What top guilds are looking for is the fire in your eyes, a high level of commitment, a spirit of tryharding, and being competitive at all times. Minmaxing stuff which is already more than sufficient. Going above and beyond what your class can achieve.
---
The other big thing is reliability: we don't need on&amp;off players. Doesn't matter if you commit hard for a month and then vanish for two weeks. We rather have a person which is always there when needed. That doesn't mean that RL should come second or you need to be online everyday (for many guilds that's even a big nono). It means that you stick to your game and your guild through thick and thin. That you are there for an extended period of time. That you are a trusty companion that isn't easily shooed away by whatever might come up, ingame or irl.
---
The problem is: dedication and reliability are not easily quantifiable and thus you will need to proof that somehow. Competitive experience in other games, playing in a guild on a similar level, know somebody in the guild/server that can vouch for you, your class is in high demand for that guild, be a really good talker, sell yourself, etc. You need some edge to make it. Trivia: that is also why the top50 world guilds usually don't have classic recruitment and only talk to people which come personally recommended.
---
Noice
---
Completely wrong.
---
Source: I am a mage and have tested this
---
Selfish and greedy is what that is. But like I said, I don’t have to worry it. As a tank I make the loot rules for the group. Don’t like, don’t join.
---
.... but I'm a rogue
---
What addona re you using for the unit frames? I can't find one I like for classic shadow frames doesn't seem to work and easy frames looks terrible
---
Salty with drops, my team did NOT have any BRE drop at all...
---
the other team LCed it to a paladin since the single true fury (IE not fury/prot warriors) wanted to go dw...
---
MC/Ony is boring, but at least a few of us are having fun chasing parse %, but I hope either visk or BRE drops soon. I think I am going to need fight club parse help to get beyond like 90% in MC, but I don't want to waste their time esp since I know I am missing DMT buffs and not consistent on ony + songflower (stupid server have no set ony).
---
No changes isn't work with today's mentality, sadly. 
---
Blizz already made many changes.
---
I still have a queue on my server, I wish more people quit so I can log immediately.
---
It already exists. Its called Spy addon and it will help you avoid 80% or so of all world PvP interactions.
---
A strike to a player's back cannot be blocked, dodged, or parried, and they cannot attack while you are behind them. 
---
It's also harder to predict where they will be/what they will do if they're always moving.
---
I was feeling burned out probably five days ago.  Then I logged in tonight, did an instance run with someone I knew, did some grinding with an alt until I got bored, and then did an instance with another alt, until I logged out.
---
I enjoy WoW if I keep the following in mind.
---
a}  The "meta"/player opinion/player politics in virtually any context is garbage, and doesn't achieve anything other than inducing stress.
---
I did a ZF pug the other night with a Moonkin Druid, and had a great time.  I don't care about the elitist opinion that Balance Druids are bad, and I also don't care about the comeback that they're bad in raids, and ZF wasn't a raid.  This leads me to my next point.
---
b}  I want nothing to do with raid culture; because again, it does nothing other than generate drama.
---
My main is a level 52 tanking Warrior.  I haven't decided if I am even going to bother trying to raid yet.  If it becomes too much of a headache, I won't.  I will simply put that Warrior away, and either decide to roll another one from the beginning, or focus on alts in other classes.
---
c}  I want nothing to do with the treadmill.
---
I log in when and if I want to.  If I want to take multiple days off to play Factorio or do something else, then I will.  I don't care about being left behind by anyone else who plays the game.  If the group I've (partly, because they've moved at different rates to me anyway) levelled this toon with goes past me, that's fine; because there's always another group coming up behind them, who I can do things with if I want to.  There is no limit on the amount of contacts I can make.
---
I've had friends ask me if I'm looking forward to Dire Maul or phase 2 or whatever.  My answer is no, because I'm perfectly happy with the content I am doing right now.
---
&gt; The cities are full of raid-geared people.
---
Why does this matter, exactly?
---
&gt; The playerbase ended up being heavily hardcore and min-maxing their path through the game
---
Again, so?  Why do you care?
---
Yeah I feel you there, this video alone cost me like 4g which was about all I made from the run.
---
Faction change did nothing to mess the game up and you clearly didn’t read what I wrote.
---
How do you get to/from zeps?
---
Nice.
---
Yeah the first thing I do when I log on, every single time, is find a mage in Org and give them 1g 50s for 3 stacks of food, 3 stacks of water. Almost always lasts me the entire session. Never had a mage say no. You should definitely start asking mages for water.
---
Did you forget your original comment?  Yes, rerolling on a PvE server is technically possible, but you're treating it like it's some easy and convenient process when it isn't.  It's a shit sandwich and you're calling people "butt-hurt" for not wanting to eat it.
---
And go back and look at all the pre-launch blue posts, the Blizzcon talks, etc.  Blizzard made their intent for Classic WoW as a faithful Vanilla recreation absolutely clear, it's not some dream that players just made up.
---
It's a vanilla feature.
---
"Battle groups" were implemented in vanilla, and consisted of multiple servers.
---
Well, twink are more of a bgs thing.
---
Small tip: If you are in spirit form you will automatically revive when the boat "does the loading screen" thingy.
---
I absolutely understand that, thanks for your comment
---
My one big question though...  Does someone really find it fun to 10v1 someone?  I rode around in a PVP raid the first night honor came out and literally had time to dismount, throw a dot on someone and they were dead.  That was not enjoyable at all and frankly I got super bored with it after about 10 minutes and hearthed out to go do something else.
---
I get that you are farming honor but do people really find 5v1 or 10v1 fun or remotely challenging?  ... and even worse - is that fun to do for 5-10 hours a day?  Because unless you are doing it that long you aren't going to get anything other than some blues that are probably worse than MC/Ony epics for actual PVP anyways.  I guess I just don't get it.
---
It’s quite risky. There are always 2 anti stealth elites roaming in each city, so it’s quite a risk to avoid them. 
---
Attacking in the city has chances to instantly spawn a normal guard, which mean the rogue has to use vanish to quickly run off battle. And the vanish has chances to failed, I’ve met this situation in Undercity I can confirm that, I used a second vanish to escape in the end. And if my vanish was in cd I’d be fucked.
---
If the rogue gets a dot on him, he’s also in danger as a lot players will notice him.
---
And pvp flags are off after 5 mins in friendly zone so rogues have to make the decision to attack fast.
---
Any reason why deleting the GPU cache folder fixed my flickering issue? I'll test with Bagnon later but I'm guessing it's the addon open up all the bags at once.
---
Why are they camping this boat? Like nobody uses it.
---
I just attained Private Investigator
---
Loot. The fire elementals in ungoro can drop essence of fire all the way down to elemental fire. The burning pitch sells ok as well. The downside for a warrior is that they don't bleed.
---
If a lot of people are leveling mining, silver ore can sell up to 1g+ per single ore
---
I dont really know what the solution to this problem is, but.. People from alliance are being told to reroll PvE or to horde if they dont like getting camped. I guess the same could apply if they were to implent faction based queues, and they got tired of waiting.
---
Not saying its the solution, but people say some weird stuff here
---
For a hardcore guild yes, but if they're struggling to kill rag, flasks aren't the issue.
---
You're right, I should have added /s for the uninitiated
---
Yes, you can just spam the ability and once you got rid of everything it just fizzles saying "there is nothing to dispel".
---
It's a bit more common Horde-side because you have to run it for Only attunement but in general it doesn't have much in the way of must-have loot and most people are lazy about getting UBRS key and just rely on others to get it.
---
no, overall there is 60% horde and 40% alliance on pvp servers, this alone will solve nothing.
---
they need both faction specific queue, and free in server faction change so that the players will swap sides.
---
but at the end of the day, this is just history re-playing it self, since tbh this happened before and will happen again and again. people want easy, they want to win in video games, and faction imbalance helps with that.
---
Wtf kind of keyboard has a 1/2 key???
---
&gt;struggled to kill rag due to low dps 
---
Lolwut? With modern knowledge of pre-raid BiS items, DPS should never be an issue.
---
Rag is a survival fight. It's a fire protection potion check fight.
---
Have literally everyone in the raid pre-pot with a Greater Fire Prot Pot, then re-pot twice during the fight.
---
It's basically impossible to wipe with each person absorbing an extra 6k-10k fire damage. 
---
Again, the fight is entirely a fire potion check.
---
Did he not try to blink?
---
/u/Smutpeddler101 was definitely not being serious.  I think his comment was more to the attacking Activision-Blizzard's new ideas and ability to deliver quality games.  I personally would love a Classic+ **IF IT IS DONE RIGHT**.  As it stands I don't trust A-Blizz enough to deliver something that isn't a convoluted micro-transaction trap on top of an inferior game.  They've had their paws in the retail cookie jar too long for my tastes.
---
That's not a limitation of the unit frames, that is by design of WoW Classic.
---
Think most Danish keyboards have actually!
---
Gm support in vanilla was amazing. They need to bring it back with all the sub money they're getting.
---
No that's far too obvious... raid hks bad, small groups good.
---
TLDR: I have a job and I'm salty about it. All these people with no lives need to go one.
---
2 months in and not a single mageblade, ring of spell power or mana igniting cord has dropped. Also no weapons off Ony yet either...
---
Take a look at the Rogue vs Mage matchups at the CDL. Rogues have to use **everything** to beat a mage. And it's still close.
---
Mom, bathroom!!
---
that guild should be catapulted onto one of the moons of mar
---
I don't understand why you think I'm lying.  Don't call me a doe, a sickly doe.
---
Your group, your rules.
---
As long as you’re up-front about it, and people join anyway, then no, you are not a jerk.
---
Some people will give you shit for it, but they can make their own groups.
---
There's no such thing as a good DKP system.
---
It’s interesting to see just how much it can differ by realm and faction. I was on 6.7k last week which put me at 1.5k standing on Horde Shazzrah EU
---
What about hearthstone
---
I got 600 HKs, mostly solo and 23000 honor.
---
Solo is the way to go, if you have a class you can.
---
Right... you don't beat the fight because everyone flasked. You beat the fight because everyone has Greater Fire Prot Pots.
---
Everything which doesn't cost mana. For us that is only the case when we use Inner Focus to cast our next skill for free.
---
I jus want you to know that *starting* ony at 845 and then starting mc 25 mins later is exceptionally organized/disciplined and not indicative of the vast majority of guilds.

its a pvp topic but  if take a note a ele shaman can last long as you need and still be close to the top dmg with downrank lightning bolt and good points in spell dmg.
---
How do you see Rank x And the percent?
---
whooosh??
---
I think so.
---
afk = a free kill
---
I moved the GPU cache folder and it didn't seem to hurt performance. It fixed my flickering issue when in fullscreen mode though. What would have caused that to fix it?
---
Lol which of them are 800g?
---
Not a jerk but I just don't join groups with things reserved, it always seems to cause drama. Doesn't matter if it's something I can use or not, avoid them at all costs.
---
You shouldn't be flasking MC/Ony EVER.
---
Leave the guild and find a group that knows what they're doing if they honestly expect that weekly.
---
You really only need Fire Resist Gear and Fire Protection Potions (Greater is preferred) for most of MC. Buff food and world buffs are nice (Flowers in felwood and Tribute buffs, Ony Head, etc) but not necessary at all.
---
Save flasks for BWL+
---
"successful in other MMOs"
---
yeah and how are they doing now? guess he didnt say the mmos were successful KEKW
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, because this knowledge comes from private server players,  but i was told battle shout actually generates more threat than demo shout as long as your party is in range to get the buff.   The warrior i used to run with on those servers had amazingly good aoe threat,  and so im inclined to believe them.   Not sure if the classic servers operate the same way.
---
Yea that or the blade. But also depends on the Auction House prices. My point is also hold on to them when they start selling
---
Will push majority players away, which frankly is only healthy for the game. Unfair? Maybe. Healthy for classic? Definitely.
---
That's how racism works!
---
They aren’t 800g though...
---
Honestly, that is left to the discretion of your guild. If you're unable or unwilling to meet the criteria put forth by the guild, then it is not the place for you. The guild is not at fault here.
---
I am a GOLDEN GOD!
---
The chances of earning that is not big but my point is that it is possible to earn that. Specifically in Shadowfang Keep
---
Ive been using Joanas as a horde warrior, it can be pretty tough at times as the guide was made using a hunter, but I always try to stay 1-2 levels higher than the guide says and its been pretty smooth sailing. Some times I use 2 monitors sometimes 1 (if im just using my laptop) and alt-tabbing is as bad as it seems, a little slower than 2 monitors but really nothing to worry about. 
---
The amount of details that is in that guide is well worth the money I spent. I can tell this dude spent ALOT of time writing this up. Overall I like the guide... is it the fastest? I wouldn't be able to tell you as I have no tried other guides, but I would count myself satisfied of the money I spent for what I got.
---
500g IN 10 MINUTES (NO CLICKBAIT)
---
Just make sure you get shadowfang or assassins blade every run
---
That's too many globals though
---
I've played PVP servers for 10 years.  If you knew me or could read into things better, you'd know anger has nothing to do with anything.  I was high all day and ran 25 corpse runs more baffled than anything, sometimes I laughed because 60 are really wasting their time on me, pretty sure after killing me 4 times my honor value is 0.
---
You were NEVER going to get the Vanilla experience EVER AGAIN. NEVER.
---
The classic launch saw people metagaming and rushing to 60. Hardly ANYBODY was doing that back in the day.
---
Now people are metagaming PvP to get the biggest reward and this is what you get.
---
What you want is a shift to the mindset of everything being new and wonderful where there weren’t guides on how to play your character 100% perfect.
---
Also Spy was an addon in Vanilla but hardly anybody knew about it and back in the day the coolest addon I remember was Titan Panel.
---
This is a culture shift thing, not Vanilla Vs Classic thing.
---
Yea in the video I also pointed out that you have to be lucky to get any of the drops. I also mentioned the gold per hour if it wouldn't have dropped.
---
Ouch. 
---
Time for another alt?
---
building was too big to blink through and I would start running the moment he began blink animation. He tried for sure lol
---
Lol idk man not sure u can get the cast off
---
You cant be good in a world that only allows good actions
---
You can't enact a faction balance change the punished the lower side and not expect anything be done to encourage the dominating faction yo transfer. There are to many people on the server and the fact is your faction needs to be the one transferring.
---
This might sound dumb but how do you know how far into a rank you are?
---
I assume you didn't watch the video where I explained it and soely comment on the thumbnail ?
---
You can find melee groups rather easily since you won’t really be rolling on the same equips as others.
---
Only when they are bait for high lvl guild mates
---
I really like Guidelime Sage for alliance. 
---
GL is better imo than Zygor because you can see the next 4-5 steps on the map and do them more efficiently. 
---
That's really my one gripe with Zygor. You can only see 1 step at a time on the map at least. 
---
Also there are Classicwow.live Guidelime guides that someone created and not hard to find. They are still testing, but I've tried one and it worked well. They are class/race specific and Classicwow.live also has really good pathing it seems.
---
I'm okay with you getting free transfers off to another server.
---
It's one item, you communicated ahead of time, everyone but the problem child heard you, it's fine.
---
If he was a hard carry DPS only there for a couple items that would earn him the chance to roll in my mind, but especially if he's being carried - well there's a lot of other upgrades for Mr. Rogue in there.
---
It's pretty crazy how big the server cap is now. I mean, 4-7k people just for the horde side, not counting people who didn't rank and all the alliance as well.
---
Crazy.
---
as far as finding a guild, run a bunch of 5 mans with pug groups.  Remember which players are good, you got along with, or otherwise suited you interest.  Message those players to run more 5 mans, build a relationship with them and ask them about their guild.
---
Consumables etc will greatly depend on the guild's desires.  If the guild has a goal to be server best or just clear or clear while the ony buff is still active, can all change what you are expected to bring and what you are expected to do in off time, its best to ask about these things before you join the guild.
---
For me, my guild is probably a step below try hard and a step above casual.  I fall more on the casual side so I know that once the guild gets big enough to form an A and B team, i will be on the B team and i'm ok with that because i dont have the time or desire to spend a lot of time farming consumable and im ok with "sub optimal" composition etc.
---
Also joining a guild is a good way to find ways to spend time.  Leveling guildies alts, finding a guilding a recipe or item, helping them get attuned etc.
---
Nahh, they wouldnt have known I'm there if it wasnt for spy. They ran along the street.
---
I see that you are a mage, but it seems you are really a dive instructor. You teach them how to become one with the water.
---
Why do you lie?
---
Warrior tank rotation for 3+ elite mobs, lvls 55 and up? 
---
Having trouble holding higher lvl packs in BRD, curious what a recommended threat rotation might look like.
---
Why do horde have guards and alliance do not?
---
'Demos lost in a fire'
---
But honestly I enjoyed most of the videos because of the edit. Ofc the frags mattered but not as much as the edit.
---
23000/600 = 38.3
---
So 38 honor per kill? doesn't seem super solo
---
That same laptop would do a lot better if still new. Failure rate of hardware components follows the “bathtub curve,” and that laptop has long since reached the other lip.
---
I dont use them. Havent used one in 3 weeks.
---
Same with alliance who don't get to play from this overpopulated mess, at least with faction queue it will be somewhat more equal.
---
Honestly, yes you should. You chose the more popular faction and all the benefits that brings.
---
There are ones that fix/alleviate the problems with dkp.
---
&gt; Alliance players seem to be more "vocal" about any discomfort.
---
Classiest way I've seen of calling someone a crybaby
---
Yes it's okay, in fact I recommend deleting the Cache weekly since it lowers load time.
---
Impressive. My battlegroup  large scale wpvp even when an assault is going is a rollercoaster of emotions.
---
It certainly contributes to it
---
Rather the opposite. If you do not delete your Cache on a weekly basis you get increased load times.
---
Never underestimate peoples inability to make gold
---
I'm a sub-60 alliance on a horde dominated server so levelling outside of dungeons is almost impossible at the moment. If you like BGs and not world PvP then staying off a PvP server is a no brainer. I'd say that normal servers usually (I don't have any data for Classic) have more alliance than horde, though, so bg queues might be a bit higher than PvP servers alliance queues.
---
Thistle Tea quest, after that there is no other rogue quest until P5
---
They’re horde. It’s what they do.
---
I'm not sure what the point of your post it?
---
It's pretty obvious that literally every horde player would be fine with every alliance fleeing their server if the other option is just not getting to play at all.
---
Lmao even 1 flask for MC is a joke
---
Roll alliance. My friend got 27 standing from 2 days of solo/duo pvping
---
Thanks bro I’ll take a look and for your comment about 53. Wanted to see if I could grind epic mount at 49 lol
---
On our server it's 210k for first place and 80k cutoff for r4..
---
Did anyone else see the Tauren Druid come out of stealth at the end? 
---
Like “hey good job I knew you had it.”
---
Are you looking for Warcraftlogs.com?
---
It's fire damage so most likely you've been using it on mobs that are fire immune. Not sure about dynamite tho, that's supposed to be fire damage aswell
---
Always planned for later phase, 5 I think?
---
Close
---
Lol, it's like you're a caricature of a toxic gamer. Enjoy your garbage life you fucking loser.
---
As a player I'm super excited for BGs to come out, but blizzard is really selling Classic short by continuing the trend of releasing content early. Naxx 2020?
---
I am curious where you are getting "many" OH swords with better dps than Mirah's Song.  Mirah's song adds 9 str/agi, which is 18 AP (I am going to do base because I don't want to do this twice to deal with kings).  18AP is equal to about 1.28dps for your MH and about .96 for your OH.  This is something you have to take into account when looking at the OH.  Taking this into account, Mirah's Song's DPS is 40.00+1.28+.96 (It's actually higher due to weapon strikes and shit but I want to make this easier) = 42.24.  If you are looking strictly at DPS/stats/proc, you need to beat that number to be "better".  The only possible OH which comes close is Cho'Rush's Blade which is also 40DPS, but has 28AP.  This moves it from 40 -&gt;43.5 using this crude method.  I also didn't factor in the value of the ~.33 crit from Mirah's agi because I am trying to make this close, but let's just say there is about a 1dps difference in favor of Cho'Rush at this point.
---
This is where everything gets a bit complicated, especially due to my crude ass method of just adding MH dmg to the OH instead of anything more advanced, but Mirah's vs ChoRush ends up coming down to poison and sword spec procs.  Poisons and sword spec are both going to favor Mirah's slightly.  I am not going to do the math to find out which one ends up being super better because I'd already hid of shortcut my way through here, but the reality is these two swords are very close.  Any advantage one has over the other is going to be extremely minimal.  The reason you see Mirah's song over ChoRush is probably because the lists were built around Phase 1, Mirah's is very easy to obtain and it's possible it also have a very minor advantage.
---
Awesome, now we get to see if AV's will be day long battles or rush battles that maximize rep/honor.
---
&gt;There's no reason another human who pays the same sub as you should be in a punitive queue because of their choices 2 months ago on a character screen.
---
Sorry buddy our server is overpopulated. If the alliance are being  punished and not able to transfer, the horde should be punished with even a longer que.
---
I eXpEcT pVp To BE fAIR iN wArCrAfT

Priest and rogue offers most solo versatility, but priest can both dps and heal. Rogue got lockpicking and stuff.
---
Druid is fun for groups and has a great leveling experience. Also able to fulfil a dual role. Less solo abilities than priests and rogues. 
---
I would pick priest as the objectively most strong and versatile of the three.
---
I'll take the needle for yikes if you take the chaor for using the World of *War*craft dad joke.

Your guild looks shitty, ahow them this thread before leaving.

I don't know if this somehow didn't come across, but that was the point of my post. Also the fact that despite fully realizing this, reserving still feels worse to me.
---
The authors used it and did like a 5ish day run. The more you know.
---
Why is it bad?  it's as good a system as the people who are implementing it.
---
Rogue has everything you are looking for and then some, not to mention the tier sets all look amazing and you actually use them unlike other melee dps.
---
&gt; I'm a paying customer who forks over the same subscription as everyone else and I deserve to be allowed to play the game.

How is being chain ganked not 'playing the game'? It's just a version of the game you (nobody tbh) enjoys.

Lol you sound mad, champ.

All I could think as this guy walked around clicking the addon.

On some bosses such as Shazzrah, it's very useful. Also useful in PvP to dispel various buffs.

I'd love to see a guide for using mind vision to check for all the locations possible, step by step instructions

Awesome possum. Now the honor grind can begin in earnest. Should cut down on the rampant 10-15 man deathballs too. Good shit, Blizz.

Shame, all you need to do apparently is whine

Lol for real tho. Anyone who has been there even once will know this is click bait

Haha can't wait to die

This strategy is Sun Tzu approved.

Mobs always had dynamic reapawning. This isn't the case with ores and herbs. I have already tested this with black lotus and it is consistent with a 30 minute window of potential spawning regardless of the amount of players in the region.

I did BRD at 54 and continued til 57 making sure all quests including ony done. At 57 I started LBRS to get my UBRS key done but also the ubrs quest from the last boss. Got in an UBRS clear for quests and did other dungeons at 59 for prebis. You're going to be farming all these places for gear might as well do it while leveling as much as you can.
---
AB is coming in Phase 4.
---
well i was on other side, just feel bad for greys that just trying leveling.
---
In before "thats way too early" from the lot on here
---
An important thing to note is that 600 honor kills in Hillsbrad (left photo) barely takes any time at all. Couple hours. While 600 kills in a small scale setting takes 3x4 times that.
---
Well as everyone knew ,Activision is again rushing with phases..lol fuck this.Phase 2 is one week and already Bg's coming ?? Are they just listening to streamers who cry about lack of content or pve players complaining about getting ganked ?
---
World pvp lasted way longer in vanilla and it was a blast just like now ,this is deff gonna make lots of ppl just sit in towns and afk shame...But when they rushed phase 2 it was expected ,i mean this are same people who screwed up retail...
---
Yeah, but your comment was implying "there is this 2k each 2 sec aura in naxx that you have to outheal it so insane duuude".
---
Really don't give a shit how your honor kills turned out.
---
Raid leaders when a Ret wants to join group
---
Haha! You're joking right?
---
I don't play retail that often but I'm 99% sure your method has never worked in any version of wow. If anyone could chime in to verify that would be great.
---
Ive heard you can right click enemy portrait and add bnet friend and chat in whispers, I haven't tried it personally. But you definitely cannot just add spaces to your text and they will be able to read it in classic.
---
Devilsaur mafias have always colluded mostly in 3rd party programs, not in game.
---
There has been groups camping the flight master in IF on Fairbanks on raid days as well. Pretty sure they are horde 2nd accounts preventing us from flying out. They all respond with shit like kek or git gud when we tell them to move. Super annoying.
---
Ele and enhancer are excellent dps in dungeons. In raids you're either healer or enhancer for support
---
Camera is positioned a little too high for it to be a selfie, unless he used Dynamic Cam to adjust the camera, which is a lot of effort for a simple screenshot
---
No, it wasn't. Vanilla had 2-4k players max per server. We the current max is much higher than that, per Blizzard.
---
You didn't experience several thousand more players opposite faction camping and honor farming literally everywhere.
---
I don't doubt you experienced a ton of wpvp...but on this scale?
---
If I had made a bet on this, I would have lost that bet. Really thought they'd let the world PvP phase play out since it's such a unique part of the game's history.
---
Not a surprise. They should release them even sooner, but that works.
---
It’s always a good time to start
---
Now Alliance Premades will stomp Horde PuGs in BG's, can't wait..
---
I've already leveled a mage to 60 on Horde, and am thinking about creating an Alliance alt, and possibly new main.
---
Based on factors like class fantasy, not wanting something which is too much like what I already have, etc, I think I've pretty much narrowed it down to warrior and druid.
---
What I'm mainly asking myself is: What will be most rewarding to play? With the warrior I see the potential for the best dps and it's not insignificant that you're the favored tank by far. With the druid I really like the potential of being able to do everything, which for me creates a sort of ultimacy (the only class you ever need to play to do whatever you want), and I think the high investment in making it work well can be very rewarding as well. However, I see a big risk in the fact that druids don't seem to be good at anything really, and are basically just wanted for their unique buffs, debuffs and raid cooldowns; how rewarding can it be to never be really good? I don't know.
---
Furthermore I do appreciate a lack of annoyances: Not being absolutely necessary to change specs all the time if you want to go from PvE to PvP or solo content for example.
---
I recognize this is a rather open question and perhaps the criterion of being rewarding is a bit too personal to be able to comment on but nonetheless I would like to hear your advice and relevant experiences.
---
They want to rush it all before the new retail xpack is released, so everyone can migrate over with their wallets open.
---
I'm sorry you're like this. If you wanna talk about it with someone, PM me. :)
---
This will just shift the rage from "Wpvp sucks" to "Premades Suck" but atleast we can get AV offhands yay.
---
One of them has a choice to transfer away. The other does not.
---
This triggered memories of my thirteen years old self getting _destroyed_ by that ranger half elf for daring to attack a bear outside of Qeynos.
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just like, your opinion man.
---
Can't expect much from the instant gratification generation. Whine and complain about everything until they get what they want.
---
Where can I learn to use swords as a warlock?
---
I hope that ocean water quenched their thirst...
---
Sweet I can log into my PvP server that weekend and not have to worry about being killed every minute. Then it will only be every 5 or so minutes
---
You can complain about bitching all you want, but this was the best move.  This isn't even the best move because of the bitching or the world pvp situation, but because it was fucking stupid to separate BGs and the Honor System anyway.  The only reason BGs weren't in the game at launch was because they weren't ready yet not some progression system or desire to create world pvp.  There were always intended to be in the game.
---
I've been playing classic since launch and I have recognized zero alliance name. It doesn't matter, servers are massive af you rarely see anybody twice
---
Option 2, this is the era of the min/maxer
---
Like how you legion you did WQ and AP too? Wow it's a stupid argument.

How exactly do bgs work in a sever with 82% ally and 18% horde when your ally?
---
For comparison sake, on Herod Horde i'm 456 in the standing and 50% into Rank 3, and I got 21,000 honor. Crazy how much it differs from realm to realm
---
I doubt it. Probably because of Shadowlands.
---
That's how bad the camping is on some servers.
---
Yeah you're totally right! 😂 it's crazy tho, it was my first experience of being ganked this way just thought it was funny! I still have a lot to learn about the game!
---
Got my own appartment and I live one elevator ride down from the store. A lot of the time has been spent avoiding queues with remote access or just literally afking doing other shit. I could probably have afk'd on something that wasn't my main but eh.
---
Unless its coke.
---
Awesome... so we wpvp'ers get less than a month of no bgs because of cry babies on forums that cant handle a pvp server when they signed up for it.
---
Because they publicly released their original plan and it included BGs and BWL in the same patch together.
---
Imo yes. You're a jerk.
---
But this is coming from an old school community orientated mmorpg gamer who prides/prided himself in being apart of a gaming community.
---
This"**help me kill this but only I get the loot**" mentality is 100 only native in WoW. Other mmorpgs, the gamers are well, gamers, a community of like minded people, not the *N word of gamers*.
---
WoW is I'm famous in other mmorpgs for having the most toxic players and it's true. The WoW gaming community mostly exist of trolls, jerks, and douches and now the twitch community promotes this behavior making it even worse. Most mmorpgs you can't even say WoW without getting shit on by the entire chat box because WoW gamers have such a bad reputation *because* of shit like "**help me kill this but only I get the loot**" - amongst other non-community mentalities.
---
HaLf A yEaR
---
Warrior or the mage. Or play all your alts to level 25-30 and at that point you'll have a good idea of what each class entails. Before 20 you really are working with the bare bones
---
OmGeH hE cLiKd HiS fOoD nUb!
---
To be fair, it was always presented as a roadmap and not a hard schedule.
---
theres a phase between bwl and aq
---
Can’t wait to see a graveyard camp to harvest honor. Mmmm.
---
lol you’re telling me this isn’t staged...
---
I wonder what the server stats looked like for Blizzard to move them up this much earlier.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha yeah i know! shame on me right? 😂
---
Ahh I see now. Updating comment.
---
LOLZ guyz he spelt rogue wrong look at how smart I am lololol
---
That wording is extremely confusing. More people are in BG's somehow equals more people outside BG's?
---
I’m so excited for 10 minute AVs and premades dominating WSG.
---
It’s the rush av
---
people in this subreddit will complain about bgs too, remember this
---
Caving to whiny casuals is the only thing Blizzard is consistent about
---
hahaha i already knew where this was goign before watching the video
---
A team that listens to the community?? This is new to me
---
Yes, that was something I greatly disliked about Legion as well. Honestly I'm not sure why people praise Legion as much as they do, but again my point is that it's not as bad as BFA.
---
Hooray, now we can actually do pvp instead of just pve with extra steps.
---
Our guild has five ingots and no drops yet on the eye.  So... It's RNG man.
---
Yeah, that is fair.  But even then I’m still going to give it to my warrior tank friend I’m probably running with.
---
Backpeddling myself? When he was stunned and I needed to go 2 steps for charge range? Yeah great catch you're a real pro.
---
Lmao he had walk on, that guy laughing was hilarious
---
Yeah that's a hard dick that guild lol. My guild has many DPs underperforming (specifically warriors) we don't flask and clear Mc in 2 1/2 hours. That guild sounds really bad.
---
Finally, hopefullt the world will be less of a hellhole soon  then :D
---
The Classic lover in me hates this bullshit Blizz is pulling trying to speed things up to get a bigger conversion over to RS3.. uh I mean Shadowlands but in the end I will save loads of hours of my life that I can do other shit with after Naxx has been farmed for after next christmas.
---
Yeah people are gonna get sick of AV and premades in WSG.
---
Haha this is why I immediately stun/blind my target(s) when I realize I’m about to get ganked and there’s no hope escaping (outnumbered, caught off guard, situations my rogue kit may not get me out of, which have spiked since P2, lol).
---
Usually spares me the repair bill.
---
Oh ok
---
Queue the "I'm a single father raising 6 children and only have 12 minutes a week to play wow. Premades are ruining the game for me blah blah" posts
---
Trust me I know. If we’re lucky we’ll get a couple weeks of content in the sub though
---
they said it was just a roadmap and explicitly said things might change based on community feedback re phases.. it’s also more accurate to vanilla which had BGs before BWL
---
That's about where I landed on Whitemane Horde. 552 standing, 23k honor, 50% into Rank 3
---
If you're Horde, the sword weapon master is in Undercity. For Alliance, it's in Stormwind. Ask a guard for weaponmaster directions, and ask a weaponmaster where to learn specific weqpons.
---
I switched sub/hemo for the pvp at 56.
---
My dungeon dps went waaaaay down, but the pickpocket farming is now (easily) possible.
---
Going to farm up mount money and get my lockpicking maxed out and probably swap back to combat daggers once I hit 60 for my raid deeps, we will see how dalrend farming goes.
---
As someone who has never done the av exalted grind, how long should I expect it to take?
---
**Warning : Counterpoint is that twink items are already over-saturated** 
---
I'm a big gold speculator, and it's my belief that twink item market is already over-saturated.  In 2006, the twink market formed out of necessity.  A small percentage of the populating started making twinks.  Until that time, BOE twink items were being equipped, vendored, or disenchanted.  They had 0 value until the twink battlegrounds became a thing.  Twink items were a market that developed with 0 supply.
---
Fast forward to today.  The twink item market is the #1 most common speculated market that every Tom, Dick and Harry know about, along with their brothers and sisters.  Every jabroni who fails to even sell their own farmed materials at market price, knows about twink items. 
---
So we have million of players leveling their mains through the level twink level ranges.  Thats 100-1000 times more people normally farming/naturally experiencing these drops just through natural progression.
---
And they are being stockpiled.
---
There are probably 10 times the amount of shadowfangs sitting in inventories then people planning to actually twink.  
---
My theory is price plummets when Phase 3 starts.  The market won't recover for at least a year, depending on the popularity and longevity of classic.
---
You've been warning, proceed at your own risk.
---
Indeed, ppl will say they need arenas because battlegrounds are unbalanced.
---
.eciN
---
I think it would of been better for BGs to have their own separate releases dates.
---
It really boggles the mind that people like you still repeat this even though a large part of the problem is that Blizzard now allows 3x the amount of players per server.
---
Sapper is like 700 damage while arcane has no real cap, AFAIK.
---
Ok buddy :)
---
Agreed 100%.
---
Also, BWL in early 2020? Wayyyy too fucking fast.
---
Who's got the copy/paste text?
---
I honestly believe they're shooting themselves in the foot with this. They're bringing out patches way too soon to appease the loud majority and a month or two after naxx comes out those people will only post stuff like "now what". I'd say ignore the loud majority and set a more moderate pace to lengthen the lifespan of the game. I could also be completely wrong though
---
it used to work in the long long ago - you could purge pull dungeons and kite things with it.  it's 'fixed' though and you can't cast the spell on a target with no buffs now.
---
Happy birthday to me! Thanks blizz
---
I might be crazy, but I actually would not mind if they waited a little bit with BWL. Once BGs are in, everything will have stabilized a lot - it is definitely needed because the world is a **mess** on some servers right now. But BWL? No need to rush everything. 
---
I'd enjoy late February/early March, personally.
---
poggas..
---
The zerg was great for me. I stay solo, and toss the chain lightnings around. Profit.
---
Removed?
---
2 resets from now would have been even better to release bgs. The game is a mess right now.
---
People are calling me out for clicking a random food drop I remembered I had in my bag lol
---
As others have said, if that was the cause of the issues then it's likely there were some corrupted files in there, otherwise I have no clue.
---
If it is Bagnon then all I can suggest is to update it or try reinstalling it, and if none of those work, maybe raise it with the publisher of the addon to see if they can help.
---
If I remember correctly from vanilla block value also increases damage from shield slam.
---
Yep, have fun while you can. wPvP will be dead very soon. At least got a few weeks of fun.
---
I also like to have X labeled as well, and I make it clear from the start of the group that X is going to be the next skull. Helps to focus dps onto the second target right away.
---
What's it say, and what's it do?
---
i would if i could, lol im a minor.
---
That’s literally every generation, ya boomer.
---
Sounds like you should do some more quests first.
---
Or, if the problem is that too many people on your server have put you on their ignore list, maybe you should reroll on a new server.
---
Blizzard most likely made this decision based on their own data and not complaints on forums/reddit.
---
Which means that in all likelyhood theres been some serious play hour reduction for them to actually react.
---
No, i tried the suggestions made here but i couldn't seem to fix it.
---
The rose tinted goggles are wearing off
---
Lets be real. Content progression will slow down as it gets harder and less of the community can complete it. Also p2 added no content ouside of two wpvp bosses that will continue to be farmed every 4ish days for the rest of classic. The lack of content in phase 2 along with incentivizing things like fp camping forced them to release bgs ahead of phase 3. It was poor planning that forced them to release it early. The rest of the phases should actually take some time to progress through for the majority.
---
Horde brains work a bit slower. Give them some time.
---
Could be solo attacking in hillbrad, honor depends on damage delt, maybe they just only tagged people?
---
Why are you even here? Why are you even posting? This has so much dumb-fueled rage that it makes my head hurt. If you're this mad at a reddit post, maybe you should take a break and do something not as stressful with your time. Despite the fact that he's just pointing out how stupid people in general are, he's on the same side of the coin as you but you're just sick of him talking about it cause you're tired of hearing the other side rant. 
---
Truth is people are people and everybody is doing the same shit on either side of the faction somewhere else. Deathballs exist on every side and people blind to that logic are the ones that never group and are the lone targets so they only think about themselves and their perspective, which at that moment is being ganked and outnumbered.
---
Can you actually derank to 0? I thought you could only get down to Private.
---
ZG &amp; AB?
---
I mark mobs - I’m looking for other player’s specific rotation. Typically I’ll charge - rage - ss- ww - and tab sunder/revenge. 
---
Curious as to what other tanks do...and curious if it’s time (at lvl 55) to go deep Prot.
---
Sorry if it has been stated before, but will they be intra-server only, or within battlegroups (like at the end of vanilla) ?
---
And am I the only one who thinks it's too early?
---
Eh I'm someone who is pretty harsh on people whining but this is a good compromise imo. ~4 weeks of wPvP is fine, and BGs are good for hardcore and casual alike, for the most part.
---
No issues with this
---
Literal lol
---
That's almost the same time frame as classic. Relax. 4 weeks vs 6 weeks in vanilla.
---
No shit. They make BGs **FUCKEN 10 v 10** FOR A FUCKEN REASON YOU FUCKEN NUMBSKULL. Why the fuck do you think they ever balance anything? To make it more fair. Not 100% fair, but not overwhelming numbers.
---
Crossrealm BG's
---
It's kind of long and a bit unforgiving, while also being not quite endgame, especially with DM out now.
---
Being unique isn't neccessarily good.
---
I'll go ahead and say it, maybe classic wow isn't for you if your expectations are that high.
---
Lmao fist constant bitching about world pvp now Blizzard finally bend over and announced BG and people already start crying about short AV's. Bringing Classic at the end of BFA when there is nothing to do so all the retail crybabies can come over to play their complain game was the biggest mistake ever.
---
Nah, that's when Shadowlands releases.  The last earnings call they sounded *really really* happy that they got a revenue spike from WoW in a year when they didn't release an expansion.  Since Retail gets an expansion next year, I'd guess 2021 for whatever they're going to do to continue Classic.
---
A level 60 ran by and spooked me. And I started running away. I saw they weren't attacking me and returned to my grind.
---
**Bogh**
---
And my Spy addon kept filling and filling.
---
I get sapped.
---
I get attacked all at once.
---
I was level 58 and they were so desperate to split the honour. It's a such shitty way to get sod all honour. Only benefit is that at least it'll be easy getting ranks if players are being inefficient.
---
World pvp has been a thing since launch.
---
I actually don't know for sure. Sustaining rank 3 is quite easy though, especially once BGs are out.
---
Is there a  reason for not ganking low level players? Killing low level players is one of the best way to get higher level players to come and help. I'm on  a huge horde dominated server and i'm on alliance. It is suicide to attempt to fight on the front lines with out a 40 man raid. The only way I can get a fair fight is if I am able to lure people away from major populations. 
---
The easiest way to do that? gank low levels and kill town gaurds. You don't need to camp them, just enough to make them cry to their high levels and get some fair action going. 
---
Ganking with bugs is something i'm highly against. People that have zero chance of defending themselves is no fun. Standing on top of buildings where the gaurds can't attack you is a cowards move. 
---
There is nothing wrong with killing low level players. You won't be able to do it forever and you will eventually be met with a force that will try and stop you. If the only reason to not kill lowbies, is cuz you "feel bad" then that's your own issue. I don't play first person shooters to go around and not shoot people. This is the same exact thing.  I play on a pvp server to be able to kill other people, and for other people to have the chance to kill me. I survived the gankfest that happened from 1-60, and I don't see why some people automatically become off limits because they are no longer within 10 levels of me. Everybody is free game, regardless of their level. 
---
This is war....
---
I think it depends which AV is being released.  Release AV it took god damn forever because the PUG games would last 1-3 days, literally.  You basically completed the grind by doing rep grind turnins and not actually winning the game.
---
I'm not going to participate in these min maxing premade groups where everything is about getting as much honor as possible. Vanilla pvp was all about having fun out in the open world where fights started organically.
---
My /played is under a week for each of my characters... unfortunately, I have about 20 characters.....
---
Clearing mc in 3 hrs is not "steamrolling" that's probably 4 or 5 times longer than a solid guild would take
---
I've gotten four pieces of MC gear since launch and another hunter in the guild has gotten 12.  I'm a 95% parser and he's the worst parser in the guild when sorted by ILVL 
---
this has happened mainly as a result of how the gear has dropped - I got a bunch first with some rng rolls and then he got all the same pieces later uncontested and now no gear i need is dropping + one horrible loot council choice  + on top of it and then winning misc roles on items like onyxia neck. 
---
It's pretty tilting hes decked out 7/8 with bis rings, rok delar and bis neck and i'm still out dpsing him in blues and 4 epics +rok.  He's also silent and I mark + do all of the pulls for our guild
---
The boosted 100hp didn't give him any extra room though, that's the thing. The rogue started attacking him the instant the enchant was applied, not allowing him to regen even a single HP into his new boosted health pool.  
---
SL healed him during combat but it didn't heal more HP because his max HP was higher. If Siphon Life healed  percentage of his max HP rather than a flat amount, then I'd see your point. 
---
If I have a max health pool of 5000 but I start a fight at 2500, my effective HP is 2500 unless I'm able to regen past that threshold at any point in the fight. If the locks HP was 3500 before the enchant, his HP was still 3500 after applying it because he wasn't given the time to regen past that.
---
Maybe I'm misinterpreting you, Idk.
---
Can some please tell Blizzard to SLOW THE FUCK DOWN with releasing content?
---
Yeah, they can take the transfer off and help us all out if they don't like sitting the queue. It's either that or, like crybaby North said, "Blizzards gunna kill muh server" by allowing alliance to actually go somewhere where they are more than just glorified rare spawns.
---
This happened to me crafting a Hide of the Wild for someone. It was really stressful. Ultimately, relogging made the item appear in my inventory.
---
lmao imagine the guy who is in charge of reading classic wow reddit and reporting it to the higher ups
---
Can someone explain this? When do you get a discount and how?
---
My running theory is that server cap is somewhere between 5-10k players simultaneously.
---
I had a wipeless 30man guild run of MC. Only me, the tank and maybe 1-2 others had any sort of consumes
---
I’m good there’s just no reason to keep releasing stuff early. Let people complain. Shit man I want to get to a point where maybe I am able to play another game once in awhile but I can’t because they keep releasing shit fucking early so I don’t feel behind and I’m sure most others feel the same way.
---
Bro you were taunting people to grief them. You are garbage. But this is exactly what I was talking about: you are trying to make your habit of tormenting other people a problem with anyone but yourself.
---
Sorry I clearly hit so close to home though lmao.
---
I found this to be a problem to get the charms I needed for the warrior quest as well which are dropped from the same mobs in Arathi. Fortunately, Alliance had it for long enough, and they were nice enough to give me the charms since they were only interested in the elemental fires. 
---
I imagine you will need to try to find those on the AH.
---
As an aside, I find it incredibly annoying when quest items are dropped by highly farmed mobs. I had trouble getting quest drops from rock elementals in Badlands too. I cannot imagine any way around it, but it bothers me.
---
What’s the deal with the elementals added to Winterspring, UnGoro, etc?
---
maybe but it should help alleviate the major wpvp problems currently.
---
I don't know what you aren't understanding...
---
If I reroll I won't reach 60 until phase 4/5. Nobody will be doing entry level content anymore. There will be no game for me to play at that point.
---
I only got as far as I did as quickly as i did this time because I used vacation days in September. I can't do that again. 
---
I had a lot of fun leveling up, I just don't want to do it again. I only have 5 hours a week to play for the next several months. If we assume it takes 120 hours or five days played to reach level 60 (which is a pretty fast pace) it will take me 5+ months to get there - assuming I do nothing but level up. 
---
How do you not understand the difficulty in walking away from the character I've poured every free hour ive had for three months into? It should be an easy concept to understand - I don't want to lose everything I invested all that time in. 
---
I can't justify doing it again. I have too many responsibilities in my real life that I really should prioritize over leveling up again. It's just not something I can bring myself to do. I love this game, but the time required to play it is prohibitive to people with adult lives. 
---
The world PvP is not what it was in vanilla. Of I realized the server populations would be this large when honor went live I would have been on a normal realm. I trusted blizzard to get realm population right and they failed, now I can't enjoy the only thing I've had fun with for a long time. 
---
&gt;I couldn't care less about it being ruined for you
---
Honestly that's kind of a big admission. You really should care if it's being ruined for a fellow player. That's just basic empathy. 
---
&gt;an argument I hear so often that does not seem any logical to me
---
Ah, now the lack of empathy makes sense.
---
Next offense is a ban
---
I love playing alliance and being outnumbered, just means more action for me!!
---
If BWL breaks your guild then you might as well find out sooner rather than later.
---
Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley will open in WoW Classic simultaneously on all realms the week of December 10. At the same time, Elemental Invasions will occur in Kalimdor, with Blazing, Thundering, Watery, and Whirling Invaders appearing in Un’goro Crater, Azshara, Winterspring, and Silithus respectively.
---
We’ve been following the deadly deeds of the Classic community closely over the last week as the Honor system sparked an impressive amount of World PvP on PvP realms, and we’re excited to see what might transpire over the next three weeks. Nonetheless, like many of you, we can’t wait to charge into some battlegrounds, so we’ve detached this content unlock from the plan we previously announced. Blackwing Lair and Darkmoon Faire are coming in early 2020.
---
We’ll have an exact timestamp for this content unlock to share with you in early December.
---
See you there!
---
I hate it that quality content like this is restricted from being posted here in any way, this is some of the best stuff on here, I really enjoy your comics (not just because I play an undead mage with a mohawk)
---
I've often thought this will be the outcome on my server, Arugal.
---
I've witnessed many players already unsub entirely. And others reroll to the horde which is 80/20 Horde way already.
---
soo kind of like retail?
---
Boom, roasted.
---
Faction?
---
The soloqueue war is one that has been going for a looooong time, look up savix :p
---
Yeah. It's pretty bad. I try to limit my interactions to saving my faction, and 1v1s.
---
Best part is, is the people pvping on a pvp server are griefers.. this shit happens in every game, RDR2 had to have a whole update because of these pansies.  Why roll a pvp server?
---
I feel bad for you questers..
---
You're all just a bunch of PvE toons stuck in a PvP world...
---
Doesn't sound like you grinded any honor if you're only rank 2 lol
---
The allies trying to run into BRD aren't queuing up for BGs. Right now they run through a gauntlet of at least 40 level 60s. They must die 5-10 times. If you take out half of the horde level 60s, all you're doing is giving the other half double honor.
---
BRM is still going to be camped from Thorium Point to the BRD portal by 60s because it will be equal or more honor than trying to join BGs with any queue and having the potential of running up against premades, which many alliance will do.
---
You heard it here first.
---
ok zoomer
---
Clickbait refers to the thumbnail/title getting you to click on it. Has no regard to if they watched it or not. It shows 300-900g in thumbnail, ergo clickbait, regardless of what you explain in the video.
---
Im not joking, Ive done this for years when doing world pvp.
---
Does the gold from lasher farm come from selling to the vendor or are there some items you will put up on the AH?
---
Total strawman.. these aren't "reactions to pvp", these are reactions to many players being unable to play the game, clearly you're horde or on the winning faction of your server. I've played through and gotten to mid 50's on two toons now as an alliance on a relatively horde dominated server (there's worse than mine) and I've taken in stride plenty of unfair fights corpse camps and ganking because I'm fine with pvp and I know what I signed up for. What some people just don't seem to understand right now is the game on most servers for ally is the game in UNPLAYABLE, you cannot do anything without being killed within 10 seconds to a minute of stepping outside of a capital city. You can't even simply dungeon grind, as it takes 30-60 min to even get to BRM since you start corpsewalking as soon as you land from the FP. Even if you manage to get there with a group, as soon as someone leaves you're stuck sitting for over a half an hour to replace your one member. Good luck keeping your group together.
---
On Pagle, there are almost constant alliance raids on Orgrimmar. So if you want to throw down with them you can. I'll bump into someone flagged every now and then too.
---
Non troll question here. Isn’t there no point of doing WSG because AV is much higher honor per hour? Especially with the AV Zerg strat?
---
Second to "quest to level", instanced dungeons, IMO, was the biggest win for WoW over what other MMOs were offering.  You could have a vibrant overworld full of people and then party up with your band of adventurers and have your own experience in a dungeon.  It really changed the pace of MMOs from the likes of DAoC at the time where even in dungeon areas you were competing for mob tags, respawns and camps.
---
Because it's about him looking around and seeing people geared out from BWL that he won't be.
---
heheh just kidding. But more seriously, when BWL comes out, let's not pretend that that this won't affect and impact guilds. The guilds that don't already have an A-team(den dun deeeen, dun dan dunnn) and a B-team for raids will have some very real splits. They'll only take the geared-out players or core raiders to BWL(with of course some people assigned to standby) but the rest of the non-raiders will be forced to pug it.
---
MC pugs absolutely happen now with no problem, the same way that Onyxia pugs do too. It's kinda mirroring what we all saw 15 years ago again. But will BWL pugs sprout up?
---
Maybe so, but I think of that guy's concerns come from a place of where he's going to be. It also brings up future concerns with AQ40, Naxx and so on. Right now if you are a fresh player, it's not totally awful to gear up from 5-mans and catch up. But as more and more raid tiers get introduced, the more and more behind some players will feel.
---
It's one of those things where, if someone had no idea and looked at the world through wide-eyes, everything's fine, there's just so much to explore. But for the rest of us we're like, enjoy that feeling while it lasts, because once you start seeing how things really are - it's not so wondrous anymore.
---
Thanks for sharing, OP. I can't imagine going through what you've gone through. I think it would break me. I fear I would become the most cynical and angry kind of person. The fact that you haven't just shows what you're truly made of. You're the best kind of person. I hope that you find the comfort and strength to go back into the world and find happiness again, because you really deserve it. It's kind of a cliché thing to say these days, but if you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me.
---
Average age is around 30.
---
You don't need to make a poll for this.
---
not only that he compared an FPS that focuses purely around blasting other humans players. Not a massive game that has tons of content and players doing lots of other stuff not involved with blasting other human players. Shit comparison on OPs part.
---
I always lie about it to my friends too. Like how many girls have you slept with, kind of question lmao.
---
"How much play time do you have?"
---
\*Played: 7 days 14 hours\*
---
Uhh 6 days 7 hours
---
Oh one guild huh? Nice, guess that completely demolishes my point and we can ignore the data and the posts on this sub of people worried their servers will die because Alliance are fleeing pvp servers in droves.
---
Spy doesn't bother me that much, but i wouldn't mind it's removal.  It would piss me off if I was playing rogue and everyone I tried to gank had an alarm sound when I'm close by in stealth.
---
Anyone who says that this is "impossible without breaking other addons" can never seem to name an addon besides spy that leverages the **enemy** broadcasts from your combat log.
---
made me laugh XD
---
&gt; And am I the only one who thinks it's too early? 
---
If they were releasing all of phase 3 I would definitely agree.
---
BGs adds a replayability value and gives whole new goals for players (twinks, structured pvp) without totally ruining new content and still allowing for viable WPvP, so I personally think it's great.
---
And then what? You clear BWL in another 2 hours and still only raid one day per week. Do you cry for AQ the next week?
---
Yes it will. Don’t even bother running out of the group next time, just immediately ice block.
---
“This crashes the server” - comedy genius
---
Rank 2 for trinket.
---
I think it's more spreading content out rather than rushing it.  Or were you expecting BWL to release later than "early 2020"?
---
&gt;ITT: world PvP gank squads complaining that they won't be able to gank as hard, and content is being rushed yet the time line is barely any different than OG release because this exact same overpopulation and FP kill camping  scenario played out 15 years ago 
---
All you do is "everyone not happt with this are *these* type of dickheads that everyone hates".
---
It's not true. Just because people don't want content rushed, as it will probably be a trent till AQ at least. Doesn't mean they are crying because they can't gank people.
---
Very fucky and cherry picked "argument".
---
People like you is what causes this community to be a warzone instead of allowing people to give their opinion.
---
I don't really get the too fast sentiment on this one either. People have been fighting in WSG for 15 years
---
Why? We've waited so long for classic, why rush through it? I'm not  full BIS yet and won't be for a while
---
&gt; Blackburrow
---
Absolutely loved that place
---
I am much more likely to use consumables in open world pvp.
---
Battleground fights have much smaller consequences for dying.
---
You have a bigger chance that the Queen of England sucks you dry than submitting a ticket in 2019
---
Just because the raids tiers are released doesn't meant people stop playing.
---
And it's hardly early, WoW Vanilla released in November, Patch 1.6.0 (BWL) released in July. 6 months.
---
Wow Classic released in August, if Phase 3 is say Feburary, that's 6 months.
---
They're literally on pace with Vanilla, in terms of BWL.
---
I don't mind the pvp, but I can see the effect it has on my server. fewer alliance logs in, ironforge is a horde zone at night, and menethil is a constant horde zone, the server was already horde dominated and now alliance lose members each day.
---
guilds will die.
---
1v1 dueling or small group pvp with comparably skilled/geared people is complex. 
---
Getting steamrolled by a gank squad while you're farming is not. 
---
All about context.
---
Are they there the whole time? or only after bosses die? I started doing tributes and feel like I might be blind when I backtrack to reset and see a book under the ramp.
---
Unfortunately true.
---
Wait... right... duh. Scout is Rank 1. For some reason I was thinking it was Grunt.
---
Prepare for the posts complaining about being gy camped and premades.
---
The bitching won't stop, it'll get louder.
---
In a group of friends, sure. In a pug? Hell no
---
Imagine rolling on a PvP server only to cry about PvP.
---
You can still enjoy your wpvp just the same
---
If you were doing it for pleasure of fighting equally skilled and numbered opponents, well that's unchanged, go ahead
---
If you were doing it for honor, then you should be happy knowing you can do it much more efficiently in bgs
---
If you were doing it to grief lowbies or smaller groups than you well then that is also entirely possible
---
You lose nothing with bgs, but the honor farmers get a place to do that instead of ruining the world
---
Engineering is the min-max profession. There are very few BoP crafted items from other profs (exception: tailoring, but you can drop it after getting your items), so you can simply buy what you need.
---
Engineering is the exception to that. Bombs are really useful in both PvP and PvE, and the trinkets have a ton of utility if you rotate them in and out, but you can only use these toys if you are an engineer.
---
This. Reserving is unsportsmanlike, but if you clearly called it earlier when the whole party was assembled, then it's legit.
---
Yo! How did you make it so you can see your used abilities above their health bar with the timer? 
---
You forgot the mandatory "I am also super busy because of my incredibly important, definitely not typical white collar office job".
---
I remember this quest and I counted that it took me 72 yeti kills to get it. I counted all the leather I skinned from them to get that number lol.
---
Well it worked before, so...
---
Ah yes, three servers.  How many servers do Blizzard have online?
---
That sucks...
---
I like world PvP.
---
HAHAHHAHA ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ROLLED ON PVE SERVERS WASTED THEIR TIME XDD
---
There’s many options for a mage. Fire eles just not a good one.
---
I'm looking at shadowpanther.net
---
He has a big ol' list of swords, but doesn't differentiate between mh and oh.
---
for example, these 3 are all ranked much higher than Mirah's:
---
Ebon Hilt of Marduk
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14576
---
Skullforge Reaver
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13361
---
Assassination Blade
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13036
---
Yes, I know Mirah's is much faster and applies poisons more often than these. Is that dmg enough to put it in the lead somehow?
---
You could do whatever is necessary to bring down that raid time.  That would be an interesting goal.
---
nobody is asking them to "break" the combat log lol.  Just remove extraneous data that doesn't seem to be used by anything but this Spy addon.
---
If the combat log didn't broadcast enemy actions, then spy would cease to work.  What other addons do we know of that leverage **enemy** combat broadcasts from the combat log?
---
Depends on mana per cast and cast time.
---
AH has 100% drop rate.
---
And there it is, like clockwork, "haha vanilla is so easy though haha you can take meme specs just fine haha"
---
Just because you CAN do something does not mean you SHOULD. It's possible to kill Ony with 40 shadow priests, but that doesn't mean it's a "viable" strat that you should do every week.
---
Is that shadowed unit frames? Mine broke last week when I updated it and haven’t found a good alternative yet
---
Dude your complaint makes no sense. MC locks you in to one raid per week. That’s 4ish hours, one night a week, with a competent guild. PvP is the total grind for nolifers but once you’re in the swing of things raiding is not that crazy in classic.
---
*when a Paladin whispers you when you post lf tank*
---
I doubt Naxx will even be out by then
---
Did you forget to switch accounts?
---
Yea i agree, as a single dad raising 14 children i can only play 15-20 mins per day. They really need to slow down the content releases to fit my personal needs. I expect to hit 60 by august of next year. I suspect releasing BWL a couple months after that will suffice
---
That's the number one reason why I can't understand why people are complaining. The servers are 5-10x more populated than OG, 90% of people are veterans who at least somewhat what they're doing, a good majority of people have completely run out of level 50+ quests, but releasing BGs two weeks early (in accordance with the rest of the early updates that no one complains about) is a cardinal sin. Whatever, I can't wait to use a FP without getting ganked the moment I land because those dudes have nothing better to do than grind 5v1
---
And there wasn't a strong community like Reddit to complain about it.  Or know there is anything different out there
---
Is this a phase, patch or update? Because I want to know when they finally haven't fulfilled their keyring promise.
---
It comes out the WEEK OF December 10th, not necessarily ON December 10th. Let’s not make that mistake again
---
Shamans can dual wield bro - my friend on his level 20+ shaman alt
---
Classic duels are mostly not extremely complex lol. It depends on the matchup ofc
---
As imnewest said you really underestimate players back then lol..They werent stupid everyone knew Eng is pvp spec . There was chaos ,there were deathballs and no place in world was safe plenty of players to spread around.BRM was lag fest ,5-10 raids fighting each other
---
I tried to do the EQ progression thing but the game is just too arcane now for me to get into it.  I'll have the memories but they're better served as rose tinted nostalgia.
---
It's only the biggest timesink for people who are remotely interested in it. I'm not because WoW wPvP is shit. 
---
And yes, the reason normal servers are called normal is because wPvP is basically a half-assed afterthought they added late in development.
---
I think Earthfury has more Alliance too but it's not as imbalanced as Heartseeker.
---
Lol they are not sending their best. I thoroughly enjoyed this.
---
It's obviously not going to die. What aspects of it being "alive" do you predict will go away?
---
Is an uneven zerg fest alive to you? Camping lowbies?
---
Not that those are going away
---
It never did before.   Winning all the time and waiting in queue is generally considered better than losing all the time and having instant queue
---
Perfection.
---
Why make these raids obsolete so quickly? That seems silly.
---
i did not get a title, 67k honor earned, 1 day not calculated and no title,

Welcome to blizzard-activison
---
Of all the classic rep grinds it absolutely the easiest especially during AV weekend.
---
&gt;We could have couple of months of wpvp witch alot of the ppl like and probably wont see again.
---
Yea, no one will WPvP anymore! Definetely
---
https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-unlocking-in-december/106144
---
🤣
---
There is no 'suppposed to happen'. It happens when Blizzard and or the community says its time. Just because you're not ready doesn't mean others aren't. I don't even know what the big deal is, does BWL come with catch up gear? Even going at a comparably slow pace I'll be fully geared from MC soon, let alone in 3 to 4 MONTHS.
---
It should be changed if they wont fix it for us via ticket.
---
AV will be heaven.  But only if they are 59.  IIRC, the bracket is 50-59 and 60.  A 59 in bis will be a hot knife in butter.
---
They don't care because people will pay anyway. That's very important way to manage your testing spending: why bother if people still bring you money?
---
I'm glad you've been farming MC for months, most of the player base hasn't been 60 more than a few weeks.  and even more so haven't downed Rag.  Glad you got there first, but don't rush content just because a fraction of the player base is bored.
---
You're right I think and we've seen it before. There were big roster changes in vanilla for BWL as well. Many stronger guilds were formed out of the wreckage of guilds that couldn't beat Razorgore or Vael. There's such a noticeable change between MC and BWL in difficulty.
---
We've already gotten quite a few Horde to transfer to Heartseeker. It use to be 80/20 now it's getting close to 60/40. Many of them were looking for more world PvP as they couldn't find enough Alliance to kill on their previous realms.
---
So much pvp whine here lmfao. Do yall whine like this for every game you lose at
---
sounds about right. I'm 300 alch and actually got lucky enough to find the recipe myself but If I hadn't I'd definitely consider it at around 400g. (particularly bc on my server EoW is around 20g so its ~18g profit after AH cut)
---
This makes me so mad. I play to win every game. I hate when random player is like "its a premade, don't bother" and then we have to prove them wrong while they do nothing afk on the GY.
---
Anything you can do I can do better!
---
**WHY ARE THERE NO GUARDS**
---
Zug zug exposed. Hordes are also like this on server
---
If you have the key and are starting the group then no, there’s nothing wrong with that. If you were reserving like 3-5 different items it might be. Having Jed in there as an incentive for casters or not reserving TS Shoulders is totally fine IMO
---
That's more the "real vanilla" experience.
---
"Real classic" is defined by the "Guile of the Raptor" quest, where you're asked to get 12 raptor hearts...
---
...only to find out there are only about 10 raptors...
---
...and their spawn points are each camped...
---
...and the drop rate is about 10%.
---
**Watch out for that group of allia**—oh nvm. Just go to the next zone.
---
MC wasn't even cleared until almost 6 months after vanilla release, not 11 days or whatever like in Classic.
---
In vanilla terms, guilds would just not be making MC progress.
---
We're going too fast.
---
devs all played horde in 2005 
---
there is your answer
---
I use a potion of invulnerability on ony. Drops my threat for the six second duration while the tank picks up agro for phase 3. Essentially works like a priest's fade.
---
6 week gap between honor and BGs in OG vanilla.  
---
4 week gap for classic; with the holidays coming up this makes sense....Following hte 6 week gap from vanilla would've meat releasing BGs on Christmas eve....Which is not realistic so this is by far the best compromise.  
---
Also horde flair checks out complaining about BGs coming too soon lol  
---
BWL Early 2020 probably means mid/late february - marking 6+ months before the first new raid tier comes out - which does NOT invalidate any of the T1 raids.
---
Programming requires testing, some things cannot be sussed out until they're in production.   
---
I would say thus far its been substantially better than almost any other launch in recent memory.
---
1. I think you're over inflating this, did some do it yes... This was patched ages ago.
---
2. Marginal really
---
3. See #2
---
4. for 1 week, and if I'm not mistaken a number of those "ill gotten gains" were removed
---
5. this is an example of "chicken little syndrome" layers helped us ***not*** spend 3 days @ &lt;lvl 10 because of all the peoples, it was bad enough WITH layers....
---
6. again.....  Make a point instead of copy/pasta
---
7. out of a list of 9 things you have one that is legit.....  This is an issue!  \\0/
---
8. ROFL - I was happy for Diremaul, most of us have already seen all of this content...  How early was it maybe 2 weeks?
---
9. this is a minor hiccup....
---
It used to be. I definitely remember the eye/leaf getting stolen by rogues (yes fucking rogues) who were planning on quitting the guild multiple times in vanilla. It was just like, why the fuck would you do that!?!
---
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o
---
WOW THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
My guild does a loot council. But the general rule is people who show up every week and donate to the guild get gear first.
---
I'm pretty sure I'm last man on the totem pole when it comes to loot. I joined the guild late and was one of the last people to fill the raid group. I donate fire/flame sacs everyday but feel like it doesn't help.
---
I've only gotten lock specific gear so far, and only when the other locks already have it.
---
If your goal is questing, you are always better off not attacking any other players. You will get your kills eventually and you minimize the risk of starting an ongoing fight that might escalate.
---
That's questing minmax for you. Anything else is just emotional
---
It will still be there. Aint going anywhere.
---
I'd would walk away.
---
Curious about any guides / materials you may have or use for this. Really interested playing this for PvE when I get 60 (58 currently) but am having some trouble finding a lot of info about it. Is this really only viable on Horde?
---
Aaaahhh XD

---
In vanilla we had 2 months of honor system before they added battlegrounds.  This is 3 1/2 weeks, it's less than 50%.
---
Literally false, tons of people complain about BG's ruining their wpvp, while wpvp will still exist.
---
Its too fast. Address the problems with the overcrowded servers first.
---
What timer does ZG have? If anything the 3 day reset will make it even quicker to get on farm.
---
That's, like, your opinion man. Which brings us all the way back to OP. You cry because of something you do not like that others enjoy. Cya.
---
I always found it slightly difficult to get into dungeon groups easily being a DPS warrior, but as soon as I offered to tank I would get whispered by 10 people immediately. Druids are a good class but in my opinion aren’t really the best at anything. Correct me if I’m wrong though. On a warrior you can tank and dps within the same spec (arms for me for example) and have two sets of gear which gives me the option to dps and tank, but you must keep in mind that tanking a dungeon where mobs are more than 2+ levels above you is a huge pain, especially if you don’t have any points in Prot. Hope this gave you a little insight!
---
I like this.
---
Just in time for kids to be out for summer after they hit cap
---
Tbh there are so many incredible activated trinkets that if you're using BHB or HoJ in PvP, it means one of two things - you aren't an engineer or you haven't farmed for some of the good ones.
---
They're great passive trinks but are so far down my queues.
---
Because they gave beta access to streamers and players who had active retail subscriptions for a long time instead of established pserver players/guilds who would have been a much better resource for testing and finding these flaws.
---
Most of the books arent worth much and can probably be free rolled--even the priest book, which is likely the most expensive. The foror book really should be res'ed by a tank, and if they didnt for some reason (I literally only ran in guild groups or groups that agreed to res foror) somehow split by the group--though really, if its a PUG, more than likely, one guy will just get a super lucky roll.
---
Depends on the patch they release AV under.  Rush battles were not a thing until the final bits of vanilla.  You had to take towers and kill the Warmasters.  Otherwise, the boss is too tough for the group.  You could rush but even a token resistance would wipe you and possibly make you lose entirely.
---
This is a two week difference with the Vanilla release schedule. It really isn't a huge difference.
---
You sound like the kid here.
---
HEH HEH HEH HEH
---
Dope. I'm not adverse to grinding it, just curious if it was a long one. Need that offhand with my mageblade :p
---
Given the comment chain and response, it’s like the dude is already salty about premades before BGs even launch.
---
Oh so **you're** the arbiter of what was fun 15 years ago and what should be fun today. This sub has been waiting for you.
---
Between your hearth being set to Kargath like it should be, and warlock summons on stragglers, why would it take more than 5 minutes from Onyxia dying to people zoning into MC and getting (re)buffed and ready to start pulling trash?
---
Selfish and greedy is what YOU are being. You are saying that if a BoE drops that you can wear, it's yours regardless of the potential for the rest of the group to get the BiS they can use.
---
All rolling need is the only fair way to handle BoEs in a pug.
---
This has been debated ad nauseum in this subreddit for the past few months and you are absolutely in the minority opinion.
---
Ok zoomer
---
Fuck off with TBC. People wanted vanilla for a reason. TBC was the beginning of the end for wow.

"Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley will open in WoW Classic simultaneously on all realms the week of December 10. At the same time, Elemental Invasions will occur in Kalimdor, with Blazing, Thundering, Watery, and Whirling Invaders appearing in Un’goro Crater, Azshara, Winterspring, and Silithus respectively.
---
See you there!"
---
-Kaivax
---
Try rolling horde next time its way better!
---
&gt; Right now they run through a gauntlet of at least 40 level 60s. They must die 5-10 times. 
---
This is literally what is happening right now even without battlegrounds.  Horde won't get "equal or more honor" than from bgs because these players are just quitting instead of having to deal with it and farming the occasional player who steps out of a city without a raid group isn't going to be a good honor yield.  There's a reason why the majority of rank 4 players this week are rogues who camped capital city teleport destinations.  Fighting for scraps in the wild when you have twice as many players to compete in honor points against is not the winning play.
---
People are saying that about BWL, not BGs. I think.
---
Oh my god, this is two weeks earlier than it was released in Vanilla. Calm the heck down, buddy.
---
GMs are expensive to pay. They make better margins without them and it's not like many of the classic players are going to leave because of it :(. Straight up Activision bullshit.
---
Thanks a bunch. Agree on the small chance, most of my tribute runs don't have any, then half of them are the gray pat nagles book!
---
that's awful. it took me 72 yetis for that rod, and over 100 gorillas for the sinew!
---
You can use AE if you want an instant cast spell but Fire blast is on CD. It actually does decent damage in ST
---
they had two servers to choose from 1 pve and 1 pvp, and now you have an entire region on 2 servers, then they released yojamba, another pvp server. 3! days later, they released the second pve server. And now we are being blamed for rolling on a pvp server? it was out only option.
---
&gt;Jesus i cant tell if youre trolling or being serious. This is a tough one
---
Replace "polite" with "smug" and you're spot on.
---
1 month of zerg fests is more than enough.
---
paladins tanks 5 man with ease.
---
It's more complicated in raids, but doable.
---
You can get it in a single weekend.
---
Correct, they are BoE. Same with blue mounts. I haven't tested trading them myself; but you could easily find a level 40 and ask if you could test it out with them; you'd only risk 80g vs. 800g.
---
I am 100% sure that it gives you the "this will soulbind the item" popup when you use it for the first time.
---
If you're the only one supplying to the market, I'd just keep raising prices until you can't sell.  It depends on whether or not the items are BiS for a class and how many classes.  I was buying pre-raid BiS crafted and BoE items for my druid for ~15-35g.
---
Lol at people actually considering that releasing BGs is the beginning of the end just because it's releasing some content earlier than what was presented. The game feels lacking *because it's lacking*. Everyones idea of the game involves at least a couple more phases. Personally I don't consider WoW Classic true wow classic till at least phase 3 or maybe even 4, due to having WS, AV, and Arathi released and raids up to ZG able to be played. 
---
I think they've been on pace for the current phases. Once they hit phase 3 it will slow down a lot, with maybe possible Arathi 3.5 release. Other than that, i would expect it to slow down a bit here. At the very latest phase 4 will REALLY slow the game down in terms of content progression with patches. I can't imagine there being any reason at that point to push further on schedule than planned.
---
It's going to be rush AV.
---
It's not far too sped up at all. Vanilla lasted 2 years and 4 months. If phase 6 comes out 1 year 2 months after phase 1 then that's absolutely fine.
---
It's absolute nonsense to expect a release schedule similar to vanilla. Vanilla was constantly adding new players at an increasing rate from 2004-2006. It was necessary to give newcomes a chance to level. Classic won't be adding a lot of new players in phase 3-6 so there's no need to wait so long. 
---
Also... we've played the game before. It takes less time to replay something than to play it the first time. Especially with the online resources available now.
---
They arent obsolete, you have alts/new people to gear and legionaries to farm.
---
Yes  
---
YYYeesss  
---
YYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!  
---
I might be excited for AV ... Maybe.   
---
Kinda.   
---
As for world PVP, tbh on EU its not that bad.   
---
Got facerolled by ally every now and then, but nothing too bad.
---
I dont kill lowbies, just minor bullying like root/poly/fear.
---
BWL does not make MC obsolete.
---
NTA - you were upfront about it.
---
Do I join a group where something is reserved, even if I dont need it?  Never.  Just doesnt fit with the spirit of the game for me personally, but folks are free to do whatever they want.
---
There's plenty of space in the ranks below 11 I guess. It will take hours, but not 14
---
Putting up a fight 4 lvls short of 60 is kinda hard, y'know
---
I petty those roaming around in 20+ raids so trust me I understand how you feel. I've seen both Alliance and Horde do this. It's not honor effective and it doesn't allow room to show case your skills.
---
As I said I'm glad BGs are coming out.
---
I'm mainly talking about BWL. I don't know a single Herod who's full bis'd out. We just got Phase 2 and BGs are coming soon, so why are we also releasing BWL early too? And yes I do know it doesn't invalidate any T1 raids. It still feels rushed.
---
You are part of the rebal alliance and a traitor. Take it away.
---
Ok so for all of classic wow's existence there will only be this small window when people are forced to world pvp instead of sitting inside town and queuing for battlegrounds.  Initially we (we being people on who rolled on pvp servers because we actually like world pvp) hoped this period would last 2-3 months, instead it's going to last 3 1/2 weeks.
---
I'm so sorry friend xD worst case I've had is getting a tumor from the murlocs. Killed 40 for one tumor.
---
Grinding is way more safe due to being able to pick your spot and being off the normal path. A good idea is to grind mobs that drop more valuable items. Certain mobs have a much higher value per kill then others. Also, skinning is a very good profession to just purely grind.  Good examples of this are rock/fire elementals for elemental fire/ore. Dragons/whelps for pets/high value Grey's/flame sacs. Cats(jaguars/cougars/Panthers usually drop some good Grey items.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Find your server's discord. Sulfuras has a channel for spamming the guilds, they seem to be fairly active.
---
wPvP is my favorite thing but I'm definitely camping bg's all day long until I get r14.  -1 person out in the world.
---
Yes, it's only 3 days, but that's still a massive roadblock compared to being able to run UBRS/Strat/Scholo multiple times daily depending on how much time you have. ZG will easily keep the casual crowd occupied for at least 2 months.
---
It’s not even close, the honor gain per hour solo was right around 1k and in a raid it was right around 250-300. You get a ton more HKs in a raid but the honor isn’t worth it.
---
Just remember my post in 3 weeks.
---
Are we not playing the same game?  Both factions do this shit.  There's nothing inherently different about the people that roll horde vs. alliance.
---
Remember seeing someone say "horde are garbage and just camp flight paths" the day phase 2 came out.  I hopped on my server and, lo and behold, alliance was camping the flight path in Sen'jin.
---
Alliance dominate population but as a lvl 54 lock on alliance I'm still getting murdered out there by horde gank squads. I think for a 60 horde rogue there should be plenty of easy honor to farm. I also think the most recent realm transferred helped a little with the pop imbalance although horde still seems outnumbered.
---
What does a person being a YouTuber have to do with their ideas?
---
Brilliant
---
In BC there were 3 chests in the mechanar that rogues could stealth to and pull the mobs up a staircase, jump off the stairs and vanish and pick the chest in time before the mobs returned to the chest.  They always had a blue gem + a chance at some BOEs in it.  You could do it 5 times an hour and average roughly 200g/hour doing it.  That's how I made my epic flyer gold in less than a week.  It was a pretty well kept secret for a few months but eventually the word got out and blizz and they patched it in 2.2.  I made enough gold from it to sustain me for the entirety of BC though.

Short-sighted buffoons prefer to run into BRM one at a time then complain they’re getting yanked. 
---
When I suggest we meet up at Thorium, Kargath or Steppes, THEN ride, the suggestion is ignored.
---
what difference does it make for you? You can consume content at your own pace in this game.
---
The book on the left side of the garden doesn't require any clearing.
---
This is the right move, and clearly they are responding to the needs of the community. On many servers one faction is getting squashed in wpvp and that leads to canceled subs. Knowing it'll only be a few more weeks until its safe to roam again, should help quite a bit. BG honor is vastly superior to anything you can do in wpvp. Rest assured though, ANY time you find a rich thorium vein and begin to mine, a rogue will show up and steal it. That part won't change.
---
Be nice to each other. Some people have more free time than others, some people have families.
---
Horde
---
Every time I see a skull player while leveling: "dont you do it, dont you fucking do it"
---
If Blizzard would let us switch Factions to help balance out the server I would. (Horde player on Skeram)
---
I am factually right, you are wrong. You have not addressed any of my arguments argument. You lose. Nya. Nya. Nya. 
---
I understand that you enjoy WoW's shoddy-ass wPvP but then again, there are people who get off on licking clean toilet bowls in public restrooms, so to each his own, I guess.
---
Completely agree. On top of that you also have a lot of posts complaining about ninja looters and people in their pug group acting a certain way. Both of which can be solved if you have guldies/friends to play with.
---
ZG will be more or less a catchup here too, though community in general is much more skilled and used to mmos, addons definitely ease a lot of gameplay as well.
---
I expect every raid aside from Naxx maybe to be cleared in 1st week after release and I expect to clear them at least on the 2nd week myself (I am on casual level of play now).
---
They released BG's 6 weeks after phase 2 launch in Vanilla. Now it's 4 weeks after, which I think is a good initiative from their end.
---
You're giving reddit wayyyyy too much credit. Have you seen their forum which they actually read and are a part of?
---
I never understood what he meant when he said wpvp died the minute BGs came out. That was never the case on my server at least. Plenty of wpvp will still happen in classic. BRM will always be a hot spot, EPL will always have wpvp, silithus when the AQ events start, etc. Wpvp is still gonna be around for all of vanilla. Obviously it'll be to a lesser degree than when BGs aren't out but we're still going to all be in the same world with no layers so wpvp won't be dead by any means.
---
No I meant that it was cleared in the first week of the game and for even casual players who didn’t level quickly it’s still very easy.
---
yeah
---
This is just cruel
---
I was tempted! But no. Definitely got the sense that I had completed a 12 year long quest chain, though :-)
---
Which it's exactly why I was so disappointed in DM out so soon. But man, did I get so much "no, it's fine" shit when I say that 😅
---
It's an issue because it creates more queue overall. They get less active players, overall less happy subscribers and that's bad for money. It's really that simple. 
---
You could then argue that they should just transfer, but not everyone is actively participating in pvp, so why would they transfer off due to some issue they are not experiencing.
---
I don't think I can solo her.
---
Yeah, I had maybe one negative layering experience. Now there are no layers on a server that has a small queue sometimes.. which means more massive community than vanilla servers. The economy is fine, and the impact of layering on the community was insignificant.
---
Not surprised the account is deleted, shame!
---
was wondering why I never heard of it
---
This
---
You miseed the point they dont kill you for the 10g loss
---
I think i'm going to roll on mankrik. I'm in a similar boat with you, and i know i'll be playing at extremely odd hours so a queue won't be much of an issue. Therefore, I chose mankrik because it's slightly skewed towards horde (i want to roll alliance) but is pretty even and also have 70k plus populationg so it won't feel empty if I happen to play at normal hours.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dz64hs/what_classrace_do_you_wish_you_would_have_leveled/). 
---
Yeah true bro I take it back you’re probably making an absolute killing off of it 🔥🔥
---
yeah they are fucking rushing things..Can't get to enjoy current phases enough . Activision has no idea how to do phases,its like they listening to streams crying about lack of content ..?? Meanwhile servers are full on queue so plenty of people enjoying it atm
---
LOLOLOL neither of those reasons I just listed has anything to do with what you just said. A shaman getting a choker over a mage/lock is a total joke and hurts the guild badly. DKP cartels is something you probably don’t even know what it is.
---
So because of a vocal minority crying about wpvp they're releasing BGs early. I hope from here on out they don't bend over so easily.
---
Hey dude I recommend questing just a bit to supplement your grind. Only pick up quests that make you kill x amount of mobs, that way it will lead you to good grind spots for your level as well as providing supplementary experience and some drops.
---
Truth is you can get by without questing, but even if you aren't in a rush it really helps getting over some leveling "humps".
---
Because if Blizzard released the raids right after people cleared the previous one, Classic's content cycle would be over in &lt;2 months and everyone would unsub.
---
I'm at the point where the only items I can get for upgrades are 5% drop chance immensely contested MC items, and I wouldn't finish bis for a year. Why not release the next tier of content to fill some of the void when there is no downside?
---
No one wants that to be what they are aiming for. The point is no one will finish BiS unless they are being hand-fed everything before everyone else in their guild. We could have MC as the current tier for 2 years and most guilds raiding since month 1 still wouldn't be close to finish bis. No one wants to try because there is no point.
---
To all the people complaining for bgs because you don’t like getting camped in the open world, I don’t wanna hear it when you get GY camped in WSG
---
I would absolutely be okay with this being done in a year. I didn't sign up to give years of my life away to this game again, I came back to revisit some memories and accomplish some stuff I didn't get through the first time around. I'm not even in that great of a guild and we will be ready for BWL in 2-3 months, easily.  this isn't vanilla, things are moving much faster than normal, people are more efficient, and it's decades-old content. It only makes sense that people would want to move it faster than the first time around.
---
Classic is going to be done eventually, I don't think it's such a bad thing if it's done sooner rather than later.
---
Rag had been downed for the first time 1 month prior to BGs being released.
---
Does this mean Warriors can get that awesome AV quest Polearm at Lv51 then?
---
Better than constant complaining.
---
I see it like this. Imagine having to farm 10 raptor heads (probably good condition?) as a warrior. You will probably crush mosts heads in combat. Imagine being a mage. Your fireball will burn his head away if you can’t aim right. Wna get murloc eyes? Good luck as a hunter with a pet that’s going to scrape his face into a lasagna
---
I've wiped in AQ40 and Naxx enough times to know that they are much harder than MC.
---
no.
---
I leveled skinning to 300.  I vendored 90% of what I skinned.  The only skins that had any value on the AH are Thick Leather, and even then it's not that great.
---
If you are aoe-farming the dogs in DM N then it can be kind of ok.
---
I dropped it for herbalism and have been farming DM E instead and it's been a lot more profitable
---
https://imgur.com/a/C7jze3K That website. It's probably not very accurate but it's the best thing that we have at the moment. I also play on Heartseeker and have definitely noticed more Horde around lately.
---
Holy shit the drop off after the honor release.  No wonder they are pushing out BG's
---

---
The issue is you lose Sword Specialization on your OH swings (which is one of the best talents in the game, about 7% offhand dps) if you put a dagger on and gain [slowspeed]\[fastspeed] % poison damage. 
---
Please correct me if I’m wrong here about SS OH proccing offhand swings, I play warrior.
---
How? You can't force people to transfer
---
Not really. Premades suck but I'll just take the 15 minute leaver penalty if I'm being GY camped and do something else. 
---
It's not like WPvP where I can't leave. 
---
The only thing about premades that I really hate is how they always try to dodge other premades instead of relishing in the challenge. Its obvious that they;re just pvping for rewards and not for the pride / joy of PvP. 
---
The next time I see a team of 5 guys at the basketball court deliberately avoid running against another good team will be the first. Only gamers avoid competition like that - its why esports will never hold the place in our society that sports do.
---
They released the BG's 6 week after phase 2 launch in vanilla. Now they are doing it 4 weeks after phase 2... Relax.
---
Lol yea classic wow is dead. A bit dramatic bud
---
Probably because you're looking at either the wrong sheet or reading the list wrong.
---
https://shadowpanther.net/swords-pve.htm
---
This has a list in, in order, of the best MH swords at the top of the list ranked. Then if you scroll down there is a section called OH swords that rank the best OH swords. This list is under the assumption that the rend weapons are NOT in a set which is why each individual rend sword is ranked lower than they would be if they were in a set. That being said sword of zeal is a decent weapon as your MH only if you do not have the rends in a set. I suggest you avoid skullforge reaver if you intend to raid because it takes up a damage over time slot on mobs which might anger your guild. Assassination blade is also a decent choice as a replacement for thrash blade as your main hand if you do not have any epics or rends set.
---
Now scroll down to the offhand section. As you can see assassination blade, and skullforge reaver are both ranked BELOW mirahs song as an offhand. Mirahs song is the single best blue offhand NOT including the rends swords which are only the best blue swords AS A SET.
---
So in general, Krols+mirahs is the best combo, that is NOT the rend set that is pre raid. If you cant afford krols then assassination blade, sword of zeal, or thrash blade are decent MH replacements.
---
For offhands, Mirahs song is easy to obtain and pretty much the best OH available pre raid, again NOT including the rends swords as a set.
---
Increase your hit rating then.
---
I feel bad for all the whiners. I'm having a great time. I'm glad more content will be readily available :)
---
Do you play on a pvp server? If so then yes. None of the rest matters
---
it updated today
---
poe is like 2021 bud
---
not for me and many more players
---
Pagle and Westfall are both good options.  Both classes are pretty desirable in dungeons and raids, so it's really a personal preference.  Maybe I would slightly lean toward pally, since you can fill all 3 rolls while leveling. LFG is always looking for tanks, if you're not averse to tanking. It will help you get through dungeons a bit faster at the expense of slightly slower questing.
---
Oh I misspoke lol. I love Wpvp and have no complaints. I’m terrible at making gold lol.
---
This is correct. They would have had to still farm DM to a large degree = less shit fest
---
Think you have to be exalted to get the vendor option on the NPC.  Otherwise they basically tell you to pound sand.
---
Me: Explaining to my wife how awesome I am in video games.
---
Wife: Grats on being king of the dorks.  Now go fix the washing machine.
---
Well you did make a video about it and posted it on the internet. I’d say yes.
---
Consumables for a BG?  Try harder?
---
I will spam BGs with the best of them but no way am I stocking up on potions, etc... just to run BGs.  That's like flasking to do MC right now... complete overkill.
---
PVP content =/= PVE content. Pushing out things that engage the player base on a daily basis (PVP content) does not mean they're going to rush out the raids.
---
Just fyi: That's not true for EU and even in NA there were only 6 weeks between the honor system and BGs. The reason for the delay was because BGs weren't ready, not because of a design decision, and yet we're still getting 4 weeks of this. How is that worrying at all.
---
What are you even talking about?  I'm just saying classic is going to end sooner than I thought.
---
I'm on a pve server so this world pvp shit hasn't affected me at all.
---
People want a vanilla experience?  I played vanilla and world pvp was not super common except the occasional attempt at a faction leader and TM/SS.  These roving gank squads weren't a long term thing, and they won't be a long term thing anyway.  This shit is going to die down in the next week or two, which conveniently fits in with BGs being released.
---
But let's go into something else, and that's the idea of community because I hear this a lot and I find it amazing.  I get told people want a great sense of community, and yet these people flock to mega servers where they hardly know anyone outside their circle of people.  Smaller servers have a dramatically better "community" because you HAVE to have a community.  Actually pissing off an entire guild or two can block you from them running pugs or world bosses or organizing world pvp/bgs.  If you do this on a huge server you can drown back into the masses.
---
You want to blame this on people farming DM and having nothing to do?  This has nothing to do with DM.  People would be doing this exact same thing regardless of when DM was launched.  The only difference would be these bands of pvpers also being in Feralas.
---
4 kill 25%
---
&gt;I just wouldn’t take a rogue, hunter or warrior DPS who may roll in the MH! 😂👍
---
How is that any different than just reserving?
---
&gt;It all feels far too sped up.
---
It does but I feel like they're in a no win situation here.  There's *really* not enough content for people to consume in vanilla when people are clearing raids in the first week of release.
---
It's all afk time I swear
---
So wait just to be very clear here. You fuck up and get downvoted in another thread for seemingly talking down to someone, then you get confused and ask why, so I explain it to you, you start an argument with me over it and I tell you I’m done arguing and then you go through my other comments to chime in? Bud, you’re a fucking loser. Get a life.
---
A LONG time ago... Like months before classic released they said in a video announcement that they would be cross realm BGS.
---
Same, bgs and world pvp are the reason I cared about getting gear. Raiding was time spent hopefully with friends... to procure more pvp gear!
---
Also, as long as dungeon finder doesnt exist, world will be populated with players outside cities, and the world pvp will continue. Maybe not as choatic and grand, but it will remain. :)
---
Excited!
---
Just announced this morning.
---
It’s Blizzard’s fault that there’s faction imbalance, not the community’s.
---
At least you choose whether to face premades when you queue up. Right now logging in is the choice.
---
As a mage the only class I truly fear are Spriests
---
It does proc from OH, but the miss rate for OH is so damn high that i don't think the dps increase is that high... Wish we had Target Dummies to test it better...
---
It’s a pvp patch WHY IS THERE SO MUCH PVP GOING ON??
---
Great answer, but quick question.. which horde dominated server do you play on?
---
I played alliance for years on private servers. NA timezone was extremely horde dominated due to overlap with CN times. 
---
It is frustrating. But I found it a more wholesome kind of frustrating than it is to just hunt unfortunate alliance as horde has to.
---
BWL will be cleared day 1, AQ40 (nerfed C'thun) day 1 after portals opening and Naxx within the first week.
---
For most guilds, anywhere between 1 and 3 weeks for BWL/AQ40 and probably within a month or maybe 2 months without the pots for Naxx. Classic isn't hard.
---
Currently playing a ret paladin and feeling the stigma when trying to get into raids. I have a LVL 20 shaman alt that I'm playing with friends but not sure if I want to continue or just reroll. Will a enhancement or elemental shaman face the same problems with raiding?
---
What is your goal here, what are you trying to achieve with this reply.
---
Oh for sure, I play accordingly. I am quite opinionated on the boe topic lol.
---
Yeah lets rush classic because morons have burned through everything too fast and are now bored
---
"i raided Nax"
---
I’m here playing so we can get TBC lol
---
wat. there's a finite amount of content. it'll run out.
---
Cross Faction Collusion
---
Retail still makes more money than Classic because it has "micro" (read: huge) transactions and tokens. It's highly likely they get more money from whales who buy tokens and other stuff than they get from subs alone.
---
Seriously though, the prices for character services are absolutely nuts. A single server + faction transfer costs more than an entire expansion. Name change $8, level boost $50. And people actually pay for that. If you think Classic is the real golden goose right now, you're delusional.
---
The pinnacle of Vanilla was was in 2006, before TBC launched.  Anything on a private server is not vanilla and can never be vanilla.
---
IDGAF about how many players Nost could handle simultaneously.  A server is not a discrete physical unit in 2019.  Each realm is hosted across multiple servers, just like every other massive data organization out there.  Saying that a single realm (Nost) has better performance than a single classic realm is not making a fair comparison.  In order to handle millions of players, Blizzard did not go out and buy new server hardware.  They spun up new virtual machines to handle each new realm.  I buy server hardware as part of my job.  You cannot get a new server delivered to you within days of ordering.  Especially not a highly customized one, even if you have bought it before.  It can take over a month to get a server and that's fast.
---
I'm not seething.  I played vanilla in 2005 and 2006.  I enjoyed my time then.  I have played Classic since launch and have enjoyed my time now.  Rolling on a private server means you have jack shit protections against anything.  GMs can dupe items.  Cliques and in groups get better drops.  The aggro value of a spell is changed because the owner doesn't like the old version.
---
Nost is not and will never be viewed as the 'pinnacle' of WoW.  That was back in 2006/7.  Anyone trying to claim it is being salty that their progress on a non licensed server was shutdown.
---
I meant more the whole corpse camping by an entire raid group thing.
---
It was our first, which makes this sting a little but more. That sounds like a different bug entirely.
---
I personally just use wolf with max rank furious howl. If the raid moves fast enough you won’t have time to rez between pulls. Healing pet mid fight is also frowned upon. Just park him next to you on passive and macro the furious howl with aimed shot.
---
I get tons of thanks and whispers and gifts for all the random stuff I do. But I go way above and beyond. I'm a mage with mageblade, grimoire, t2 pants, talisman, gloves of hypnotic flame, and entirely preraid bis. I run random  low levels through dungeons and stuff all the time. People enjoy it a lot. What good is all my gear if I don't help my fellow horde with it :p
---
&gt;comming
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Considering original Vanilla was 2 years in 2004 an 18 months plan for the re-release in 2019 seems very reasonable with how much people know now and rush the content.
---
Can you explain to this here noob what an AV weekend is?
---
After a few days, I finally got my answere in mail. I stated in my answere that I was more focused on the huge abuse of line of sight to kill all players in gadgetzan.
---
&gt;Developers’ note: We’re seeing some players attack others by abusing line-of-sight rules in Gadgetzan. **This disruption is against our Terms of Service (as it was in 2006) and we’re taking action against players who exploit this game mechanic.** While this new range differs slightly from orginal WoW 1.12, it better enforces the authentically intended consequence of PvPing in a goblin city by challenging the attacker to fight, die, or escape the guards.
---
He told me that he read through my ticket again, checked the state.. and then said that he can't do anything about PvP Events and killing. Proving to me that he didn't make it past my first line of my answer, which points out that the first GM Answer was ignoring half of my Ticket to shit out copy pasta to tell me to ask for a friend to help me against corpse camping by a raid. I clearly said that it wasn't all about camping, but about the abuse of a mechanic, that was stated as highly punishable in the patch notes, but doesn't seem to be of any interest on EU Servers or German Servers specifically, because of the lack of personal to support such a big community. 
---
I am still mad for the countless of hours I was camping Botter in Winterspring to give more time for GM to actually see those at work. And checking those cheaters would be easy. Put down a person with a functional brain in Wintersprings lake for a few minutes. 3 Botter caught. But now I have to raid with those, even after weeks of reporting. Thats why I wrote a ticket, so I will get an actual answer to the never ending question "do they actually take care". But it is exactly as useless as reporting cheaters. (One of the many botter didn't come online for a while at least..)
---
I didnt gank lowbies, that's shameful.
---
Now hiding and sending your pet Tiger to go mercilessly torture a leveling gnome mage? That's proper mannerisms.
---
It seems that both  CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_PERIODIC\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_BUFFS and CHAT\_MSG\_SPELL\_HOSTILEPLAYER\_BUFF only registers a hostile player that is *casting* within rendering distance, as you can see in the comments [here](https://www.wowinterface.com/portal.php?id=156&amp;a=viewfeature&amp;featureid=2497). You can see in [this list](https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/WoW_constants) there is no event that seems to register anything but hostile player's casting or applying spells/buffs. It's some evidence that the current client has it wrong.
---
I've been doing this all week, but never seen a juicy pile like this before.
---
Equip shadow reflector to stop death coils, pop fire ward ahead of time for extra HP against fire blasts, invis in, shatter a blastwave, immediately use sapper charge .... as much as 2500 instant aoe damage.
---
&gt;Great, glad we're in agreement. Lets not base decisions on platforms we know the be nothing but biased and not representative.
---
I agree only under the assumption we also aren't making decisions based on the assumption everyone is slow.
---
&gt;That's just ridiculous, there's no grand conspiracy going on with every single big business reviewer and every single indie reviewer. Show me proof that every critic has been influenced to give good reviews for Pokemon.
---
People have known critics to be unreliable for years and years, basically the better part of a decade. Every single AAA game released in the past 10 years receives grand praise despite many of them not only being hated by users but also flopping massively. There is a reason critic reviews and user reviews pretty much only line up in games that are praised by the public. You want me to effectively deliver unto you what would essentially be the biggest gaming journalistic pieces in history if I could 'prove' it? I mean you're welcome to believe what you want, but don't expect anyone to give you a second glance when you mention critic reviews when it comes to video games.
---
&gt;A connection between demographics, of course. People outraged on here are going to spread their outrage to other places. The casual players that aren't part of that outrage aren't going to head to metacritic nearly as much.
---
Vocal minority has some basis in reality, but people often play it up way too much. It would be vocal minority if it was even remotely controversial, but people who have been praising even the 'controversial' games in the series have been hating this release. It isn't vocal minority at that point. Vocal minority could be something like Star Wars Battlefront which is debatable actually, people hated it because of its P2W systems and loot box whoring. But people playing it actually liked the game, and it **showed**, as in there were entire subs dedicated to people who liked the game enough to look past those issues. Even the ratings on sites tended to stay within reason rather than 'bombarded', and need I remind you that game was so controversial it got hundreds of thousands of downvotes for a single comment and sparked a meme that still lives to this day? THAT game managed to maintain decent ratings on websites, yet you're saying that pokemon which has the biggest 'fanboyism' culture ever is somehow only bombarded by a vocal minority?
---
Know another game that shattered records? MW3, absolutely decimated sales records for on release. Yet it also flooded used game stores within weeks and to this day everyone hates it. Want to wager a guess what critics gave it? An 88/100. This isn't some isolated incident and I struggle to understand how a person could reach the age to know how to use the internet and not have understood this by now.
---
&gt;I don't know how long you've been on reddit, but after 10+ years I can tell you this place reaches delusions above and beyond anything I've seen almost anywhere else.
---
Compared to where exactly? I've definitely seen some crazy subs filled with nutty shit. But I think you're reaching to act like it is some unique place in being delusional and honestly don't see any point you've made to make that believable either.
---
Dungeons.
---
Nowhere will be safe in P2.
---
It's just incredible isn't it? I do not understand how or why blizzard support has gone down the drain so much. Must be that its now "activision-blizzard"
---
They said this months ago, and as far as I know never said the opposite.
---
Yes, yes you do lol
---
problem is that one of the solutions presented in the thread fucks over the majority by adding a 2 hour artificial queue and people are reacting to that.
---
the solution to allow you to play on the alliance shouldn't be to not allow the horde to play. that doesn't make sense and only switches who is pissed off from the minority faction to the majority.
---
My go to is sapping lowbies. 
---
Saw a mage and warrior together. Walked up to sap the warrior and he started smacking me. I didn't fight back just jumped in circles as he fought for his life. 
---
Got a parry and was just going to disarm him and then move along. Whoops. Everything procced and crit all at once and I one shotted the dude. :(
---
&gt; I don't play first person shooters to go around and not shoot people.
---
I don't know about you, but I would find it pretty boring if I was playing an FPS were my opponents only had 50% of my HP and did markedly less damage.
---
Well pvp behavior will change. The efficient rankers who form big groups will form wsg premades instead of camping flight paths.
---
Seems to be some personal issue where you don't pay attention?  I recognize tons of people and the server I'm on is far larger than any vanilla server was.
---
Cooming
---
Someone told me they died in real life
---
Hahahahahaha wat
---
That's hilarious.
---
Big true
---
Very nice!
---
Scarab lord was added after vanilla.
---
Perhaps I didn't come off sarcastic enough, but honestly this is the 3rd spot I've tried within the hour. Best of luck to ya
---
Server pooling or any form of cross server anything is a bad idea. If that becomes a thing, I’d rather just go play a private server.
---
It only has the pvp ranks.  Scarab Lord title was not implemented until the TBC 2.0 pre-patch which is also when the option of removing your pvp rank title was implemented.
---
&gt;"most people"
---
&gt;"majority of people"

[Citation needed]
---
Or Heroin Hero
---
This is my new favorite
---
AV till you get sick of it. Which will happen way faster than you think.
---
Those typically take hours depending on groups so idk if that's best for the casual player
---
Shoulda rolled on a PvE server, if you did that you could control when you wanted to PvP! What a concept!
---
Well,  I think you just answered my question. If you imagine a city; does it make no difference if there are 10 million or 50 million people living in it? As per your logic, it doesn't.
---
I belly lol'd
---
I despise the idea of faction queues. What about the people logging on that won't be doing any PvP? People who aren't level 60 or just want to quest or run dungeons. Give them an artificial 2 hour wait just because? I don't have a solution to imbalance but that's an awful one - punish an entire faction for the actions of a handful of people.
---
I think there's a movie that opens with a quote about that which does not kill us.
---
It activates mount animation. In case of goat, rears up and "baaah"
---
&gt; no game dev company is going to release major content literally the week of Christmas. 
---
Blizzard has done this throughout their history - an example is the staggered ICC content release schedule in Wrath
---
We'll see I think the imbalance is so huge even with cross realm you'll be seeing ques on horde side of at least 5-10 minutes and maybe much more.
---
That makes no sense. DM is a one or two day thing at max. It wouldn’t have changed the wPvP at all.
---
This sub’s survey had the majority of responders at 60 and having cleared MC, it didn’t ask how many raid nights it took.
---
How much cheaper?
---
Not everyone plays for pvp, and that's OK.
---
also server size, which is really prob the main issue 
---
server imbalnace would not be that bad if there were only 3k max players on a server like in vanilla
---
&gt;  it's kinda like a paladin healer taking mageblade first over mages and locks.
---
Sounds totally reasonable to me
---
It depends. If PvP servers only get placed against other PvP servers than Horde will definitely have queues because PvP servers have a 60:40 Horde bias. 
---
I’m not sure if they they group battle groups that way though. There’s a theory that people who are really into PvP prefer horde, which would imply more Horde queueing in general than Alliance. That would also result in longer queues for Horde.
---
&gt; The majority of this sub is 60 and has cleared MC
---
Got a source on that? Because there's nearly half a million people here and I doubt all or most of them have gotten to 60, geared, found a guild, got attuned, and killed Rag already. 
---
&gt; Classic released in August, January is 5 months.
---
4 months of playing time. Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec. It released with less than 5 days left of August.
---
Not OP, but who finds weekly work meetings appealing?
---
Well, depends how long the winning side decides to graveyard camp.
---
Mine did too. I just deleted and reinstalled the previous version and it’s working fine.
---
what will take hours ? AV ? well if ppl turtle but we are getting 1.12 av ppl will just rush for enemy base
---
Well right off the bat dps meters to see who the biggest threat is. 
---
Literally off the top of my head.
---
true LOL
---
I don't really see an issue with content being released sooner than it was in Vanilla. I mean, Classic was released with a bunch of stuff that wasn't in the game when Vanilla launched. MC and Ony are a hell of a lot easier with the 1.12 talents and balancing, so people have been done with that content for some time already. What else is there to do when you're not raiding and you already have your gear? 
---
To be fair, this is like 3 months sooner than it was in Vanilla. I don't see it as rushing content, as it's just something to give an incentive to PvP. Yes, it's faster than Vanilla, but people have been reaching max level and getting shit done faster than in Vanilla, too.
---
If you're using a bear, both.
---
But why use a bear? They're not high DPS. Your best raid pet is a wolf for the Furious Howl. It can attack with decent DPS, Bite and buff the melee. Or it can also just sit next to you buffing you if the boss is an AoEer.
---
I don’t know if you realized but people are stupid
---
1-2 AV weekends
---
You should head to Runescape after the "u".
---
How do you get your UI removed for shots like this?
---
It's literally one of the least common drops in all of WoW.
---
Because giving up Sword Spec for slightly more poison procs is just not worth it. You also lose sword skill if you’re human.
---
High Warlord material.
---
How it works: whoever is in the #1 bracket on each side gets X rating points, #2 bracket gets Y (some number smaller than X), etc for however many brackets there are.
---
That means that if there was theoretically a single Alliance player on your server who got his 25 HKs for the week then logged off, he would rank up at the exact same pace as the Horde no-lifer who grinded 2 million honor to get in the top bracket (through crossrealm BGs or whatever), because both of these players would be #1 on their respective factions' ladders.
---
So no, one faction can't really "gate" the other.  As long as whoever wants to participate gets the required minimum HKs to be on the ladder (I think it's 25), they'll get whatever rank points they'd get in the exact same bracket as a wildly active PvP server, because it's percentile-based.
---
I'm late to the party; what's this meme about?
---
I got no problems on my PvE server where you can control when you want to PvP...
---
My NE Warrior was Lv41 when I unsubcribed a month ago, thinking of returning and I'm debating on rerolling a Human Warrior instead (same server).  I don't think making gold will be an issue (I got my mount at 40 with some to spare), but is it *worth* the reroll just for the Sword Spec?
---
How does Shadowmeld compare to Sword Specialization at 60?  I'm playing on a PvE FWIW
---
Used to be completely white
---
&gt; I have a job and I'm salty about it. All these people with no lives need to go get one.
---
Sounds reasonable to me
---
Giving up Sword Spec for slightly more poison procs is just not worth it.
---
The guy trying to wipe the group is always in the wrong.
---
Been clearing mc since week 2 of launch, my guild has not seen one vis, brute blade or mage blade, our dps are going insane lol
---
the Razorgore discord
---
Of course it’s not a bear, it’s a cat
---
"this sub" is just a small fraction of the playerbase.
---
Fuck now I gotta level my twink asap. Got a zealot blade for 5g. Didn't have time to stockpile items to sell either ugh.
---
&gt; I would also that it is in fact worse than open world camping because your faction cities are supposed to be safe havens.
---
Fair point, I guess I was coming more from the camp that it's easier to get help. Although, tbh, despite all the bullshit with deathgangs, I don't even think they have intentionally camped/griefed me. SO I can understand getting killed once in a capital being more frustrating than getting killed once in the open world.
---
It doesn't matter that it exists.
---
Seriously, for 15g they can save one well over 100k of raid damage.
---
Greater Flasks won’t add 100k spell damage
---
This meme has been around for like a day. Jeez.
---
I mean early BGs makes sense since people literally can't quest in high level areas, and that is what most people were complaining about.
---
There is a solution on the net, clear cache and some other folder, i dont remember exactly. Fixed it for a guildmate.
---
the stats and damage on BB are so good it negates any peanility you get for it being slow
---
Everything except the last line is true. I agree.
---
Could you explain that to me? Bgs will be queued by battlemasters in cities. Alliance can sit inside IF and do bgs one after the other. Horde will queue maybe in UC and fly to epl while in queue to try to find allies? How's that help horde?
---
Oh man, remember when this guy SirioSnow laughed thinking phase 3 with BGS is months away? See you in WSG in 3 weeks ;)
---
Nobody is downvoting you for being in an efficient guild, they are downvoting you for assuming that every guild runs or can run like that - and being an ass when people tell you this isn't the average experience.
---
Obviously having 40 people be organized enough to do what you do would be great, but it isn't reality for most players.
---
Just go check the sub survey. It had like 65% of people being 60.
---
Double honor from the specific battleground.
---
I did this exact thing as Fury Warrior for my Epic mount. Depending on server prices I actually found it better to just auction off most things (for less then 1g). Like if a green turns into 2 vision dust that's only around 40s when you could get 65s from the AH.
---
Requiring flasks in MC? Turn and run as fast as you can, OP.
---
Honestly I’ve been having loads of fun running around hillsbrad. I’ll hop in a pack of horde so I can get escorted halfway across the zone, only to have to run away when they eventually meet the wall of ally near Southshore, having to run around the edge of the area because the entire middle is a war zone. Definitely livens things up lol
---
I'll take it if it stops all the whining.
---
Not every single BG is going to have a premade since it’s cross-realm.
---
wew lad. Imagine not realizing how strong Stoneform is in PvP.
---
it's not being a hero, it's acting in your own interest
---
you could sit in queue for hours on your 70 30 gangrape deathball camping simuliator server as the dominant side, or you could switch to a balanced/unfavorable server, or switch teams, and have no queues at a
---
everyone wins
---
it did not, but thank you very much for trying to offer a solution
---
No. I’ve bubbled out of it before. But you’re prolly gonna get the debug again right after, that’s my experience with it
---
Question is, is this the original AV that took days?  Or will it be the 15 minute race-able version?
---
I know most players will disagree with me but that sounds great. AV on those PServers was just... pain....
---
For them it does.
---
Even outside of raiding, isn't it really nice for dungeons?
---
Sword is 3% Hit IIRC, which is a minmax sort of idea. I would argue that NE is superior to PVP for the Shadowmeld if you were hiding in Warsong Gulch or Arathi Basin. Human is clearly superior in PVE, whether tanking or DPS-ing.
---
Re-levelling a Warrior to 40 should not take too long, and if your level 40 has any gold at all that will help semi-gear him to make levelling 100x easier (having greens from level 1, non BOE boots with +run speed, infinite bandages / engineering bombs, etc).
---
If you want to PVE, reroll a Human. If you want to PVP, stick to NE. If you care about looks of gear, pick whatever.
---
Still is a very large sample of the playerbase we can argue how accurately it represents the population but only blizzard knows that. Ultimately we can’t wait for everyone.
---
Good. Maybe it'll be an incentive for people to actually balance factions.
---
&gt; the incorrect data of a 3rd party website who doesn't have a clue disagrees with you"  
---
FROM A WEBSITE DRAWN IN CRAYOLA CRAYON NO LESS.   This is like going in to a business meeting and plopping down a report your five year old made after watching Boss Baby
---
&gt;I think faction queues combined with free transfers for majority faction players would be a good compromise
---
But where would they transfer to, since almost every server is horde dominated?
---
Good lord, I made it clear that "I have no interest in talking about Pokemon." - I'm not going wade my way through that essay vomit. I'll just pick the first sentence, which is the only thing relevant to the core discussion:
---
&gt; I agree only under the assumption we also aren't making decisions based on the assumption everyone is slow.
---
We don't need to make any assumptions, Blizzard has that data, and we should allow them to decide based on that.
---
I'm going to guess you've provided no proof of your claim, though correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm not interest in once again arguing against a strawman on this website.
---
To be fair. I'm glad we got to experience this degradation even for a little bit. Its a very unique time and we won't see anything like it ever again
---
It will be after since 8.3 is in Jan probably end of Feb
---
Dang, I'd do it too
---
this seems like flawed logic on Blizzard’s part no?
---
I agree with you but I use the YouTube filter to sort by upload date. I’ve been looking for rogue videos be it pvp, macros, tips, gearing, etc and I just use “rogue pvp” and filter the search or “rogue bis” to try and keep up with anyone talking about rogues. But I agree it’s not good
---
Dude my server is 50s swiftness, 1.5g faps, I sell faps for days. Swiftness will go up as more people realize how great they are in pvp
---
Imagine reading the Bible some little bitch writes about being mad.
---
Wsg premade that can 3 cap efficiently
---
They could have an impact on flying into LHC and instantly dying from enemies that haven’t even appeared on your screen, and the flightmaster killed so you can’t escape.
---
Those are really good ideas. Keeping a separate set of challenge gear in storage will be a challenge in itself so I might have to make an alt specifically for that purpose.
---
Setting aside the sample bias that comes from only polling the more dedicated WoW fans, that post only confirms my point that less than half of people have cleared MC. If they release in January that means more than half of people will only have ~a month or less of MC before moving on. At that rate Naxx will be cleared by Thanksgiving 2020
---
In 1.12 AV they nerfed the elites and removed all the mines. Private servers used the pre-nerf version and they also make the elites way too hard. Classic AVs will last 12 minutes at best.
---
And likewise, pandering to the minority of no-lifers isn't the way to go either.
---
as someone who has never played classic how long is that exactly?
---
that is likely why Mark Jacobs is taking his sweet ass time on CU.
---
\&gt; people in this subreddit will complain
---
Coulda stop there
---
yep
---
I kind of like it.  BWL will open up the world bosses and other content simply by spreading the player base out.  In vanilla there wasn't this idea that everyone had to be on the cutting edge, and clearing the most recent content.  In fact, most people weren't.  
---
I think as the game settles in it will turn back into that.  Oh, you guys are working on AQ20?  That's cool.  We're still on 2nd boss of BWL, although we're starting AQ20 as well.  Etc.  I think progression will return, especially as the more casual players start getting more involved in raid content.  And hopefully, there won't be 500 people setting around waiting for a dragon to spawn.  Instead, they'll be in one of the raid instances they haven't finished yet.
---
Does win / lose give exp in BGS? Is it possible to level there?
---
Nah they just have the more easily defended side of the map.
---
You can only get the SM quest one at level 34 if you have a group to carry you as well.
---
That's because they are shit players and don't want to admit it.
---
I actually added this point to my most recent edit to the main post before I read this response... but yeah 100% agreed.
---
I'm curious to see what the honor requirements become once BGs come out.
---
the queues are the issue they're experiencing
---
transfer or switch sides, it's that simple
---
I've only seen early 2020.  Which would be feb march...
---
Cool, thank you! :)
---
I honestly hope people will shut the fuck up about wpvp now.
---
Actually, you're just further demonstrating your lack of intelligence. It makes a difference that there now are enough horde to cover every part of a contested zone. It makes a difference that instead of being ganked by 1 horde, you're being ganked by 5-6. And it makes a difference that this is 2019, and players are points &amp; numbers-oriented.
---
yea any time the mobs you are gonna be fighting are higher level than you, you are gonna want it. i don’t know the exact theory behind it (every time i think i do someone comes along and corrects me), i just know it’s important
---
Wait a week. Should sort itself out.
---
It was an everquest thing. Everquest only did it because their boats were extremely buggy and they didnt want to add npcs that people could potentially exploit for exp or something else
---
Im sure wow has the engine to put guards on boats but the design aspect probably stems from everquest.
---
My decision is no problem. It's the subreddit reaction on phase 2. My idea is silly anyway
---
They will complain about anything really
---
That's true and TBH I did get both of them at Lv30 and Lv34 respectively but I think SM was the easier one to get carried through by strangers since there's always a few 60s farming or carrying their friends through it
---
what.the.actual.fuck?
---
They always did this back in the day. There were several fights that were bugged in vanilla that could cause a boss to not drop loot.
---
IIRC the old battlegroups were not segregated by realm type.
---
“Blizzard did something along these lines once before so let’s make them release a major patch on Christmas Eve because of it” k
---
That they finished WoW! Hahahah this shit is all consuming and never ending. I emphasized that they will reach a point and come to this realization.
---
They wont transfer either way. The bigger the population on a server the easier it is to rank.
---
Can't tell you how hard I loled at 20+ minutes.
---
The only item specific bags i see listed on classic.wowhead are Enchanting and Herb bags. Is there any plan to release other ones like Mining or Gem etc?
---
100% this.
---
I think ganking lowbies is a sign of weakness and insecurity. The fun i have is fearing them or their pet and continuing on my merry way.
---
The raids never become obsolete.  Anyone who played vanilla will tell you that.  For cutting edge guilds, it may eventually become optional, where you can jump in an alt run if, for example, you're still trying to get toep from MC, while the guild is progressing on AQ, or whatever raid.  There's gear in MC that will never expire, and that holds true for most of the raid content.
---
It takes roughly 250 hours for the average person to level on private servers.
---
At 3 hours a day, that's 3 months. People who leveled in under 2 months aren't casual.
---
No, classic released in august, so the endgame of pve has been MC+Ony, and it will be 6+ months before bwl releases
---
It's pretty close to 50/50 in the US. I think in the EU it's more horde-dominated.
---
And all the randoms who join those raids to WPvP will still being doing WPvP, reddit commentators make up a small percentage of people playing wow classic, flight paths will still be camped. People roll a PvP server to always be PvPing not just in BGs. If they wanted just BGs they woulda rolled on a PvE server where you can control when you PvP in the open world.
---
So this Jokerd guy was the first to 60 in classic wow, He made a MC group with open loot and ninajed the Staff of Dominance and went on a huge sociopathic rant after.

No reply? too easy, another idiot down.

Blizz Its the nerfed version and I doubt it’ll last 15 minutes.
---
QQ
---
Never experienced a queue in the 14 days played on high population NA Thunderfury
---
You think this sub is all no lifers? I don’t think it takes being a no lifer to have cleared MC at this point in time. Not even close really. Either way I’d rather cater to the no lifers than the tourist who aren’t going to reach 60 or ever raid.
---
3 1/2 weeks, for the entire duration of classic wow that's how long we will have actual world pvp.   3 1/2 weeks, not even a month.
---
YouTuber meme.
---
No queue on my server. Feels great.
---
Must be nice to have not need to have a job, other people like us need to you know? Pay to eat?
---
Isn't the guy who does hardly any DPS, doesn't have key, doesn't scout for Jed, and doesn't form the party also entitled for thinking he deserves ALL the loot?
---
Yeah, because a lopsided fight in a bg is as bad as trying to run into BRD by rezzing and being installed sapped, stun locked, then mind controlled away from the dungeon so you only gain 5 feet per life for an hour+.
---
&gt;Sword is 3% Hit IIRC
---
Doesn't it also reduce the effect of Glancing Blows?  That's the bigger deal to me compared thans the +Hit
---
So how long until they add dungeon finder?  If you can sit in town and queue for pvp I should be able to sit in town and queue for pve.
---
Blizzard is partly at fault, and so are the players. Your server didn't use to be like this.
---
sadly it is not a joke
---
Probably because many of the pvp servers are overwhelmingly horde. My server is easily 2:1 if not worse. Every zone is a death trap, especially 40+. All flight paths and boats are free HKs. Sure you might see the occasional swing in the other direction where alliance return the favor, but those are noteworthy only for their rarity.
---
I’m sure you understand that just because you feel that way about BC classic that others don’t.
---
Just as excited as you were/are with classic; people feel the same way about BC. I don’t know what their plans are but god damn I hope there is a BC Classic server coming somewhere. Ultimately this just seems like you want them to do things exactly as you wish with no chance of variation which just is not realistic.
---
ZG was honestly my favorite vanilla raid.  I never made it into Naxx, and never got far into AQ40.  I started a bit late.  But the 3 day lockout, with interesting mechanics, is just a lot of fun.  That's right around the time you can really start putting more effort into your character, and get ahead of the pack.  If you choose to.
---
They can disagree all they want, they will still need to beat my need roll
---
Speedran his streaming career. How can he be stopped?
---
I can’t wait until people complain they’re getting camped in bg’s or why they can never win. This sub will never be happy.
---
Just dont play to win (going into their flag room). Just turtle with 10 men and waste their time. It will make premades mad to pop sappers for such teams to get through. 
---
It can be great fun.
---
Our priests are foaming because we had like 6 leafs in a row :p
---
I think in later phases content will be much harder to clear and we will need more time. MC is and was always a pretty easy raid. When it comes to AQ things get a little bit more hardcore
---
&gt; Shorter queue times means more potential honor which will eventually translate to a better geared Alliance.
---
PvP ranking is based on % of population, so the greater honor gain doesn't mean anything in terms of gear gain.  Horde players in the top bracket will rank up just as quickly as those on Alliance, and since they outnumber Alliance on most servers, they will actually have more PvP-geared players than Alliance.
---
It's all about the mind games. Bonus of a rogue and go stealth. 
---
Theyll be shitting themselves waiting...and waiting. And waiting never knowing when theyll die. Maybe let their guard down but bam, rogue laughs at them to make sure they know you are still near.
---
Ion Hazzikostas, Game Director, World of Warcraft had this to say about the recent patch:
---
"World PvP has always been a core function of the game"
---
It is very clear to me that you did not play on the kind of server I played on in Vanilla. In nearly every way, you could simply subtract about 40-75% of the number of people in the fight and the same exact thing is happening. Classic not following _your_ prior experience does not mean it is not vaguely consistent with reality.
---
I had a 1 minute queue on Westfall once
---
Yes, pandering to the crybabies surely didnt turn retail into what it has become. Have some respect for yourselves and stick to your decisions.
---
I personally do not want anything from current wow to enter into classic.
---
The (closer) to original AV is the current 'event' on retail (except with massively over-inflated stats) and contains the various NPC's and stuff. If it's treated as a PvE game then the difference between (closer to original) and (zerg) AV is only +5 minutes. It's only when people try to actively defend (and it's a lot easier to Defend in unnerfed AV) that the games draw out.
---
***
---
Given the fact that HK's are of zero value after 4xHK on the same person it'll really depend on whether the BG's 'auto-group' people or we have to form raids individually.
---
+ No auto-raid means BG's are insanely good honor farm for high burst damage classes
---
+ Auto-raid means the values of BG's diminish for HK's, but better based on win/lose performance.
---
[AV will never look like this again](https://i.imgur.com/MKu1o2v.jpg)
---
Cool, thank you for the answer!  I’ve been excited to be a 2h fury raid main.  But I haven’t tried fury at all yet since I’ve been Arms all this way to 58, so far.
---
I always did my rogue farming in one of the Terrokar dungeons. Mana Tombs I wanna say? You got a chest, though not as good as the Mech chest, but you also had 2 guaranteed adamantite veins which was awesome as a miner/JC.
---
I *truly* can't remember how it worked in actual vanilla even though I did an insane amount of bgs back then, but I do know that on northdale you could queue as a 5man group for WSG and AB, but could *only* solo queue for AV.  I'm not sure if that is a change they made or faithful to actual vanilla.
---
By your ratio logic 10% = 2%. Math is hard.
---
I didnt knew there was a zg farming as a mage! I think you convinced me
---
OP legit thinks that the total of what Paladins bring to PvP is "bubble which is nice"
---
I dont care for fotm, i just play what i played since  back in the vanilla beta...
---
Depends on what you plan to do. Casually rank to 8? No problem.
---
Wanting to push rank in the #1 premade dictating the brackets, outfarming everyone, punished bracket breakers? Good luck going in there without ingi + consumes.
---
Warriors are just paladins who can't read good
---
Does it count if you're cycling between 2 targets?
---
Gotta click harder
---
Same here with mind flay -- not sure what people are talking about...
---
There must always be...a ~~Lich king~~  mad playerbase
---
This is great copypasta material
---
We need target dummies.  I need to know how much DPS you lose from using a dagger vs a sword in the MH &amp; OH when talented.
---
This is where your low IQ is really showing: you're fixated on the fact that there were large open battles going on in vanilla, but completely ignoring the bigger issue, which is horde covering every part of the contested map. No matter where you go to Q, there is a death squad of horde there. This has only been made possible by the increased player numbers. Also, another thing you keep ignoring, despite it being brought up already, is the 2019 meta. This isn't the new and mysterious game it once was. People rushed to 60, and are now mercilessly farming honor points.
---
Also, my response is to OTHER people, not you, because I can tell nothing is going to get through your thick skull. The game has been completely been turned on its head since honor points was introduced.
---
But what is the fix that doesnt change classic?
---
He's right. There is no comparison
---
It's almost like this community has 400,000+ people with differing opinions on things.
---
Imagine that.
---
Where did I say it was an exploit or something I wanted to quit over? I just said I didn't like it. You guys seem to have more fun acting tough on this sub than actually playing the game.
---
&gt; You made it clear and then also made a comment on plus I largely based my argument upon critic reviews but okay.
---
It seemed polite to reply at the time. I don't mean to be rude, but when someone tells you they're not interested in talking about a subject, and then you write paragraphs about that subject, you can't really expect them to then read it all and reply.
---
&gt; Which I assume they are doing, yet are still releasing content early, and yet people are still complaining about it.
---
Yes, that's my point. People will always complain. If Blizzard feels the need to release content early, fine, but make it based on real data, and not because of the weekly outrage on social media.
---
&gt; I'm going to guess you're going to prove how I've made a strawman?
---
I don't want to keep going on about this. I simply want you to prove your claim, if you can't, I'm not going to argue against a feel. But as you've said, that would be the scoop of the year - proof doesn't exist, as such I'm not going to waste my time arguing against a fallacy.
---
Want some French cries to go with that whineburger?
---
2+ hours on whitemane-NA
---
It’s going to be activated on the fly just like Dire Maul. Not a phase, not a patch
---
&gt; How many were Chinese.
---
Lmao. Chinese aren't a WoW faction. They still play the game just like anybody else. Whether there's a 10k pop server with Chinese or without Chinese doesn't matter for how populated it is.
---
I would ask in this discord in the pvp chat:
---
https://discord.gg/SMUXhyR
---
Yeah no I get that people want BC Classic and I myself thoroughly enjoyed BC... but where does it end?  By going backwards to Classic, it either ends somewhere or it literally just repeats through every single expansion, which is the crazy part, not the BC Classic part.
---
Sigh blizz giving in to complainers
---
I'm only level 37 so far and majority of people I play with are same just because others rushed in content doesn't mean blizz should push out more content
---
I work 50 hours a week and have 13 children I can only play for 15 minutes a day
---
I’ve had like a 3 hours que on Herod but recently I’ve been pretty good at logging on before que starts but I do happened to get que’d the average time is about 60-90 minutes
---
I tank spammed pretty much 15-60 and to me what makes Druids OP leveling tanks is speccing into Furor then pre-hotting every pull and going bear for mass AOE threat and temporary lack of need for heals. Makes the entire dungeon love you. DPS can go mindless mode since they can zerg to their hearts content and heals can abuse the hell out of the 5 second rule since nobody is gaining Aggro and you don’t need heals for a while into fights. By the time you leave bear each pull you’re usually full mana again so there’s no downtime either
---
do you know how well this would sync between two computers? I'm currently using Allyroute, but play at work and home and that addon doesn't sync up so it's annoying.
---
The technology is just not there yet
---
There are rotating bonus events for one of the battlegrounds each weekend, granting additional honor and reputation. These used to start thursday evening and lasted until monday evening. Four days of farming AV during the event can get you to exalted.
---
I’ve heard of the stone talon bug before but way back in vanilla when the servers would lag on zeppelin/boat travel
---
Never heard of that realm so that’s probably why
---
I loved TBC but flyers killed World PvP and resilience was a terrible addition. 
---
Raids were amazingly though.
---
Players are consuming the content at a fast pace so yeah it wouldn't make sense to replicate the same timeframe as Vanilla
---
I think the idea is that if a server's wpvp imbalance is 3000 Alliance vs 6000 Horde Lv60's, then when BG's come out it will be 3000 Alliance vs 3000 Horde in BG's and then there will be 3000 BG queue'd Horde out ganking uncontested because all the Alliance PvP'ers will be inside BGs.
---
My issue is the disparity of loot.. been clearing  mc for 6 weeks now and only seen 3 paladin pieces drop. And theres 5 holy pal lies so at this pace I'll be in full epics in like a year
---
Griefing by nature is intended to torment. That's the entire point of it.
---
See how you yet again make your shittiness anyone's problem but your own?
---
Seems likely. I dont have precise information, but logic dictates that if there's a ton of these things to kill, there will be more loot on the market and prices will likely drop temporarily.
---
There used to be multiple bg queues back in classic. When you would que for a bg, you could select all as ques or select a specific number. And when the bg would pop it would say something like “join battle for alterac valley 7”. So to do this we would all get an add on called “premade AV enabler” you would be in 4 raid groups of 10 and the leader would sign up on a countdown in vent/TS and everyone would confirm if they got the same AV number. If not we would cancel and reque. I always enjoyed being part of the rogue/Druid tower recap team after 1st GY.
---
This does not match my experience in vanilla. You keep doing bindings runs forever and you clear BWL both for world buffs and trinkets.
---
You and everyone else.
---
Not in classic.
---
Felcoth also exists for Warlock Soul Shards.
---
There will likely be no mining or gem bags.
---
Kinda wanna be able to use my insignia you know??
---
I have a feeling that we will get BC classic 2021(no retail wow expansion year) and LK classic 2023(no retail expansion year)
---
At that point they will likely restart the process on new servers. Infinite cash flow for them for minimal cost.
---
Bgs wouldn't be so bad if it was single server. Cross realm bgs do nothing but breed mass afkers through anonymity, something blizzard will do nothing about.
---
If you sic your pet and start shooting at max range, everything should die easy enough with just arcane shot on cooldown and concussive if you pull aggro. You can Viper Sting off the bat, but I feel like that chews through mana.
---
Alliance sucks.
---
In 15 days in unsubing.
---
What kind of argument is this? "Oh man look at all those 60s afking by the mailbox the majority of players must clearly be 60 by now"?
---
What about Paly bubble? Assuming the same thing
---
it's not a 95% horde server yet, but it might end up like that.
---
There we go, I see it now.
---
Sure, sure, Ion.
---
It mirrors...what? How things were in 2005? I am sorry, but in 2005, the most populated Vanilla servers had around 3k concurrent players, at peak hours, and most Vanilla servers under 2k concurrent players. Today, most Classic servers have 6-7k+ players at peak hours, with a good part of those servers (the most popular ones) with upwards to 10k concurrent players on peak hours.
---
Thank God BGs are coming in 3 weeks or so, because Classic WPvP is not even close to what Vanilla WPvP was....simply because with 2-3 or even 4 times the population, Classic WPvP is a totally different thing.
---
Where exactly does it say "can't play the game"? I literally haven't wrote that
---
ZG farming is extremely hard, but yes it can be done. Good luck on your adventures!
---
I didn't time it. It there was a 2800 person queue on Whitemane last night. I just put on some videos and checked back every half hour, so I'm not sure when I got in, but was ~1.5-2 hours.
---
Man, he sounds like a narcissistic asshole. Like congrats you had the most viewers ever once, but where are his viewers at now?
---
But will there be a ton of these and will they have a good drop rate? That is what I am asking. Everything is so vague on them. Some places mention the event lasts just a few days and they stop spawning when some boss dies, some dont and so on.
---
Word for word.
---
I mean, the people who were clearing MC in the first week are in no way representative of the overall playerbase.  I guarantee every raid in the rest of Classic will be cleared within a few hours of launch.  But I don't think the overall release schedule should be based on a tiny fraction of the active players.
---
It's similar to DKP in that if you are at the top of the list(most DKP) and want an item that's applicable for you, you win. We have 2 lists so if an upgrade drops but it's not the best item available(t1 helm/legs vs t2 for example) you aren't screwing yourself out of your spot on the other list. However, it gets complicated when you bring in purely pvp items, or people not carrying their weight.
---
&gt;Don't backcap SHGY and no turtle happens.
---
This is why as horde I always backcap SHGY.
---
:)
---
Bro we've gotten shadowstrike 3 times what is this shit. No aurastone hammer yet or mageblade
---
I approach my PvP with the intentions of the other player.
---
 If they're on a mission, kill once, let em know what's up, move on cause I got my honor and reminded them it's a PvP server. 
---
If they're out for PvP, anything goes. Tanking, camping, calling in backup. Fighting over farming territory same. Kill and if they come back for a fight, all is fair in love and war.
---
How long do you want Classic to be stretched?
---
I /lick lowbies when I pass them.
---
I can't buy my insignia and actually play the game
---
Yeah you sort of did
---
Right like I could be one of those dicks that just goes around killing everyone I see to troll them or enact petty revenge for when that was done to me but I dont, often time when I see someone struggling with a more or even just mid fight while I'm already uncounted I'll still and drop some dots and help them kill it, doesnt matter if they are Horde or Alliance, and I hope that the horde I assist will think twice about ganking someone because someone else helped them out even tho they didnt have to
---
Have a nice day and see you at your flight master :)
---
we've gotten vendorstrike i think 5 or 6 times.
---
I have no idea as i play horde but if you remove debuffs when you cast it then i would assume so
---
I’ve been easily pvp’ing with kids abusing it lol. 
---
If You need an addon to tell you where, what level and how many in order to pvp? You can’t randomly have an encounter and win? Jesus. Just get better. 
---
vanilla wasn’t filled with this cancer mindset everyone has now. Pvp is great. Spy is not.
---
Oh that link helps a lot, thanks again.
---
Case in point.
---
I guess IQ lowers when they zerg
---
meanwhile, my warrior ass struggles to hold threat against 3+ mobs unless dps follows specified kill order
---
i played vanilla for like a year. i played a private server for 4 years. and private had non cross realm bgs. 
---
i think private did it better.
---
&gt; (Horde player on Skeram)  
---
Are you sure? (Horde player on Skeram)
---
There why are the opinions that I posted about the only ones that get upvoted and are always on the front page?
---
&gt; Just as valid as transferring.
---
No it isn't? You lose any progress on that character. Both factions suffer the same queues, only one has the option to deal with that without rerolling and losing that character. That's not a fair solution to the problem.
---
I'm sorry I don't know. I play on a laptop so I just take it with me. You could try using the twitch app's sync feature but i'm not sure if it will sync up personal settings/progress.
---
Do you have concept of how long it takes to get the rep you need for the mount?
---
Honestly, anyone still bitching about queues has only themselves to blame.
---
Maybe 15 minutes on Incendius
---
That quest was removed in later AV so you cant get it when this AV is 1.12 I think.
---
I'd rather it not exist too lol, I pop up on the 300 alliance sitting in IF everytime I unstealth or rez, certainly would rather not.
---
Jokerd was on his way to being a successful streamer and gave it all up for Staff of Dominance.
---
Maybe in another 15 years when Classic Shadowlands drop...
---
&gt;What are you going to do about it?
---
Ask Blizzard to help out after their top menbers set in motion the chain of events that resulted in our current situation.
---
Much like how South Korea asked the U.N. for assistance in the Korean War.
---
i don't think any of the solutions present are ideal and i don't think there is a real solution only bandaids.
---
1-2 hour artificial queues would be just the worst i don't think that nees to be explained other people talked about that. 
---
people talk about transfers like they would fix the problem but they are a bandaid at best. horde outnumber ally in general so they would still be transferring to horde dominated servers and make those servers even more horde dominated which isn't great either. also expecting transfers sucks given people are attached to their guilds/communities.
---
i think easiest and most realistic band-aid solution is what they announced earlier today in battlegrounds. it will get the hardcore pvp'ers out of the world and into instanced and fair (or more fair) pvp environments. still will probably be annoying given there will be more of the opposite faction running around still but you should have the 20-40 main squads roaming around or camping dungeon entrances. on top of that ally will have those juicy insta BG queues.
---
Player wise yes, map (terrain) wise no (then again, if you're smart enough to make the most of the terrain advantages you're pretty much one of the elites anyway)
---
We had our 2nd binding and the eye both drop [last night](https://trafficguild.us/guild-data/raid/3ba2df95-00c1-459f-9591-fc26a5419803).
---
You'll need Exalted rep, so while it only costs 10g you'll still need to grind AV for weeks/months to get the necessary level.
---
worth 100%
---
/castsequence Vampiric Embrace, Shadow Word: Pain
---
That easy, just requires two key presses and it’ll cycle back once you cast both. You can add reset=X as a fail safe in the event that you don’t end up casting both and want to make sure it also cycles back to VE eventually.
---
I'd say if your a hardcore ranker the best would be like 5-10 min queues. Instant queues means you never get a break without "missing" honor. 30 min queues mean you have to go to EPL in between games to look for kills or "miss" honor.
---
5-10 min queues you don't really have time to do anything so you just get a break every BG which is great
---
Hate aoe tanking on a warrior. It’s such a pain.
---
Anyone roll up to a group of lowbies and /point at one and just kill them and leave the rest?
---
&gt; You could argue that there haven't been Metroidvanias that are clearly better than Super or SotN, but the genre definitely hasn't stagnated.
---
&gt; Ori is gorgeous and really emphasized the platforming element in a way classic Metroidvanias don't. Dead Cells applied the roguelite template to the genre. Hollow Knight was a huge hit; I'm sure it has been played by far more people than Super or SotN ever were.
---
&gt; Most importantly, each of these games have been very successful. In that way, the Metroidvania scene is not at all like the MMO scene where most games flop, some games do okay, and the actually successful ones flopped on release before requiring major overhauls. "What's the big new Metroidvania?" Hollow Knight. "What's the big new MMO?" Uh... WoW again...
---
That is a really well thought out response!
---
I haven't really thought about it like that.  And I actually play Hollow Knight as well (but still think Super Metroid is the best MetroidVania but maybe I am just an old fart).
---
Have you ever watched a gnome mage make food/water?  That's the reason.
---
Well I have zero problems getting a group together and have watched people get BiS epics. So I don’t think you’re as important as you seem to think
---
I'd assume the engine is at least similar to how the keep the guards on the zeppelins, so they could implement it quickly.
---
Not really, we're still going to roll over the remaining raids. AQ isn't hard in a modern since. Its hard as in, having to set aside time to do it, plus MC/BWL.
---
If I get attacked by someone and then fall of a ledge and die to fall damage do they still get honor points?
---
Are there any items that someone can throw consistently for small damage that don’t require throw skill? I’m a paladin and in some battles I can’t do anything (like others with guns) so I want to lol with just some small throwing rocks or something for minimal damage
---
queue times skyrocketed throughout the entire week so prolly not man lmao
---
Or... be me.
---
Level, get ganked, realize you don't like it, bite the bullet and reroll.  Understand things might have been done differently and better, but weren't.  Be glad you realized it wasn't for you and got out relatively early.  Enjoy a relatively peaceful, fun game as level 60 on a carebear server.
---
Smile when BG's are announced because PvP is still optional.
---
Please. You dont go looking for equal wpvp and you know it. Quit your bullshit.
---
You can still steamroll 55s going to brd.
---
If you cared about equal pvp you would want bgs.
---
Usually when people say grind, it means they're doing it for an extended period of time nonstop.
---
"Who is Holly Windstalker?, Alex."
---
Nost launched BWL 2 months after the first clear of MC+Ony. ND launched BWL 5 months after releasing MC+Ony. Please, tell me more about your vast knowledge of private servers. Which did you play on?
---
This is fantastic, saving for future use
---
If they are full HP?
---
I've gotten 5 honor for finishing low HP targets off, and I usually just murder people who are either green lvl compared to me, or are fighting mobs.
---
Or does honor scale with lvl?
---
In that case, you log in, go fish or look for black lotus, then bitch at everyone trying to pvp and stalling the bonus honor and rep you get for losing.
---
Or you can go join an honor grind group and avoid other premade while pug stomping.
---
Yep, the "real pvp" has arrived...
---
Thanks, the chance on hit for the Mace got me confused which was better. I guess DPS per second would be more useful for me
---
nah, if you have bad expectations they are usually going to meet. its always need if u need and greed if u wanna sell
---
Good. Phase 2 is a fucking dumpster fire.
---
If you're alliance, southern Deadwind pass (between Duskwood and Swamp of Sorrows) has some 55-58s ogres and undeads out front of Kharazan. 
---
It's almost always empty, at least on my server, and the mobs respawn as fast as you can kill them in a loop. And if you do see somebody enemy faction there killing the ogre warlocks, they're likely just there trying to farm a specific enchanting recipe and will likely leave you alone so long as you aren't contesting them for the warlock kills.
---
I'm sorta failing to see what the point of you quoting that line. By the end of the phase cycles, *those will be released* which is true. That is all you highlighted from my post.
---
I don't think there's anything wrong for the either you can do Naxx or you couldn't. You're framing it with the context and POV of someone in one of the top guilds, but not every guild was the way you painted it to be. MC eventually got forgotten sure, but that makes sense. I still think there'll be groups and guilds that will be at the BWL and AQ phase when Naxx comes out. Not nearly as many guilds were on Naxx as you make it seem. I think of the guilds on my server we only had like 2 that could actually get close if not clear it and then the 3-6 ranked guilds would sometimes join forces to see how they could do.
---
I don't see there being that impossible situation where you just can't get geared at all and there's no way to ever get into the higher raids. You also have to factor that the people already in these guilds and higher raids probably had worked their asses off to put in the time to get that gear. In some ways, if you were new you'd have to play catch up and gear up in a similar way by starting in at least BWL and working your way to progress up. I'd be shocked if you wouldn't be able to find a way into BWL raids in the current environment.
---
When it comes down to it, i dont know. It sounds like your past situation was a very specific situation that made it rough to do late late game content. It sounds like you still got to enjoy a good amount of content though. Not everyone should be able to do the top of the top content unless they can earn it in my opinion. I don't see it being impossible for someone in that position to get to a better guild that does some of the BWL/AQ content to eventually fast-track or build up to Naxx level content in some way. 
---
From my experience there were plenty of guilds *attempting* naxx wings but couldn't and were also still doing a BWL/ Ony raid one night, AQ another night, and dedicating a couple priority nights to Naxx or something.
---
You think I sound MAD? Read back over the entire convo again. Start with YOUR original comment. Look at the words you use. Look at you browsing around strangers on the internet. 
---
Then look at my replies. How I am pointing out the humor, and bluntly mocking you. 
---
And you think I am the angry one? 
---
Lol u funny. 
---
Keep going please.
---
I think the better analogy is refusing to tip because you didn't like the meal.
---
Is a week 1 KT even possible? Don’t you need some critical pieces of gear from Naxx to get you over the jump or is it possible to do in all AQ gear?
---
WoW is basically 3 subgames:
---
1. Leveling to 60
---
2. Playing endgame PvE content
---
3. PvP
---
It's entirely possible for someone to like (2) and/or (3) without particularly liking (1).
---
I like (1), which is why I play on a PvE server, am not yet 60, and have a ton of alts, and I'm perfectly happy with the way the game is.  But I completely understand why someone in u/Grouchy_Bobcat situation would quit.
---
Retail beacons you
---
He made that character before he joined Method, it was just a meme since he and Method have always had a hostile history. Now it fits even more.
---
And soon you'll be able to do it again when the 5-person gank squads disappear!
---
"it's majority in this case" 
---
Can you show us were you get your informations from? I mean you just bashed actuall collected data's by what look to me like impressions. You havent give us any source or facts so far.
---
I dont see this sub as representation of hardcore players and i wonder why you do so.
---
That's about it.
---
You can tank in fury, the most demanded role TANK
---
You're equating phases with raid tiers and that's why it feels sped up. BWL being 6 months after MC means that logically AQ will be out 6 months after that, then Naxx 6 months following AQ. That's not even remotely too fast.
---
Vanilla bgs were cross realm
---
I only play classic for the chance of tbc :)
---
If you're the top 1% of players competing against people who do not take breaks, it makes sense a 10 min queue could help. But I'd imagine the vast majority of players are playing in the evening after work for a chunk of 4ish hours, and instant queues would be much better there. Right?
---
I remember farming those marks for Scryer/Aldor reputation with my Warrior and selling them. Wasn't too bad. Though what the economy will be like this time round is anyone's guess. People will be much more prepared with a lot more gold in their pocket.
---
&gt; sometimes you don't resist a single stun while pvping for hours
---
50 out of 50 of my last concussion blows on orcs have been resisted
---
so youre full of crap
---
"there are a lot of people that agree with this opinion, that means hypocrisy!!!"
---
Still not making a valid point. Reddit is not a hivemind.
---
The logic makes no sense because if it's a total size issue then why aren't both factions everywhere?  Why isn't your faction able to support you unless it's because there simply isn't enough of your faction out there as well?
---
This is where we hit the core of the problem, and it is the "lol pvp happened on a pvp server".  You are on a pvp server.  This was always an option.  If you bitch about they are everywhere and i can't escape them, then I ask where is your faction?  How is it possible your faction is nowhere and they are everywhere unless it is an issue with factional balance?
---
Maybe your faction doesn't want to pvp as much!  That's still a faction balance issue.  Maybe your faction is our there but they are also avoiding the big horde groups and chasing easy kills!  Well that's a structural probably with the pvp system and how players play the game, but not a population issue.  None of the problems are a population issue.  They are a I DONT WANT TO BE ON A PVP SERVER WHERE I GET GANKED issue.  You picked the server where you can be killed and camped everywhere.  This is how it is.
---
Love the class balance hate the flying mounts. Just my two cents.
---
Mark, attack with pet, sting and thats enough. Arcane shot if you want to burn through some mana to speed things up. Buying a good weapon every couple of levels is pretty nice too imho.
---
Ok, that's pretty funny.
---
But I still loathe gnomes.
---
I would’ve death coiled you into oblivion
---
What does that even mean?
---
Grow up.
---
Yup. Closed it out and went to bed.
---
This is reddit dood, this is what it’s here for, ppl bitch on the internet because they can
---
Nah bruh. It will be March for sure.
---
You cared enough to comment tho...
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/AuIvUrZpzBl04/giphy.gif

its funny that i see a couple people in this very thread saying how douchey reserving loot is saying you should just not invite people who will roll on the gear. how is that any different?

EZ-throw dynamite

Wait isnt that wrong? Dwarf, troll, tauren and undead all have awesome pvp racials

Just got dced in MC . 140 min, sulfuron fr ...

Same here.
---
Believe it or not, this run is still going.  5+ hours later.
---
/salute
---
Its not, this guy is dumb.
---
3 capping wsg and 5 capping ab in ~15 min is a ton more honor.
---
Wait, mc and only loot is tradable?
---
Not every person is being grave camped and yet here we are. 
---
Vocal minorities shall be heard.
---
I mean if someone reserves Rends swords and you're a mage then it's whatever.
---
Should have rolled alli
---
happens way to much lmao
---
Go Engineering and throw nades, or there's a trinket from doing the linken quest chain in un'goro that lets you throw a boomerang but it has a cd of like 3 mins i think(i.e. not "consistent"). That boomerang is actually good for pally tanks as they have no long range attacks to pull non-undead mobs. Other than that you might be outta luck :P
---
&gt;Like, what are you doing, man?
---
Sounds like he's having a shit ton of fun tbh
---
you underestimate who the devs were in 2005 and 2006
---
in the words of Tigole Bitties, more known as jeff kaplan
---
"i hate fighting paladins on my shaman"
---
also their offices had horde flags everywhere
---
I started this quest then stopped, had to destroy the one head i had for bag space. Couple days later i come back to finish quest..stuck at 9/10 after killing 15+ i thought destroying the item I had caused a bug and abandon quest and restart...that shit sucked
---
I was looking for this post. I remember it being somewhere in that cost range.
---
90% being veterans is a gross over estimation.  Unless you’re using a a very broad definition of anyone who’s ever played WoW before.
---
Sure, the hardcore boys will do that in Naxx prolly. 
---
Private servers were not slower, tbh.
---
Well... no. There was no incentive to kill people in p1. You know you don’t stop getting honor for wPvP when BGs come out right?
---
You're 100% this dumb irl
---
I mean people still buy Bethesda games on launch day. So yes most players are less triggered by this than you.

He's a perfect example of both '15 minutes of fame' and 'letting it go to your head'
---
He has a negative follower count per hour over the past month and he's not even a Twitch partner or affiliate, his career was over before it started.
---
That's brutal, friend. I've multiboxed that run around 300 times and got it for both of my dps warriors before retiring from it forever.
---
Thanks this is great, do you know anything else with a lower cooldown possibly? Damage can also be non-existant i just want to be involved
---
tbh i think just not inviting people who would roll against you to the group is worse than reserving. at least if you reserve and tell them they have a chance to join the group if they already had the item or don't need it for some reason.
---
Kinda fun to suddenly appear and watch the mice scatter though.
---
Drive them before you, hear their lamentations in yells.
---
Nothing can please you guys lol
---
Druid Flag Carrier.
---
Press Alt+Z if you're using default bindings for that
---
Faerlina as far as I know is Alliance dominant, like 55/45
---
2/6= 0.333333, this content phase is about 33% shorter than it should be if this trend (Biglollol already explained what a trend was) continues classic will reach the end of it's content cycle 33% faster
---
5/5 opportunity = 20% ambush damage  
---
3/3 improved ambush = 45% crit chance on ambush  
---
2/2 Remorseless attacks = 40% crit chance after a kill for 20 second, on your next ambush  
---
= 85% bonus Ambush crit chance + 20% damage
---
Equip a slow dagger, enchant it with the highest weapon damage enchant you can afford and sharpen it with the highest weapon damage you can afford.
---
Remember the multiplier works as follows  
---
Base damage = 80  
---
\* 120% oppertunity talent = 96  
---
\* 250% ambush = 240 + 70 (Ambush base damage modifier rank 1) = 310  
---
\* 200% crit = 620 Damage
---
Sharpening and damage enchant is important. +4 damage adds 24 damage to your ambush crit.
---
Later you get serrated blades for armor penetration, Malice for increased critical strike chance and Murder for 1/2% bonus damage.
---
Im not sure which side you're referring to
---
The hardcore will move on like that, yes.  
---
Tons of guild will take a long time to progress in BWL.
---
i'm new to this game. But why do assholes gank on the transports? like seriously that's just fucked up.
---
hahah
---
Nope, there's no way to easily tell.
---
Even if they have certain items that belong to a profession (e.g. Gnomish Death Ray, Green Lens, Truefaith Vestments, Robe of the Void, Smoking Heart of the Mountain etc), they could still have two completely different items.
---
"Oh no, someone disagrees with me! Better tell them to go to retail!"
---
if you're in a squad of dwarves/gnomes, you are not at a disadvantage racials wise. The problem is that pretty much all wow players are gamer dads
---
Mmmm yes, predicting who will be the target of living bomb.
---
Try the gorilla island directly east of Booty bay - iirc they are all level 50
---
A fraction queue after servers have already been established is quite possibly the worst idea I've ever heard. "Hey sorry you rolled the superior faction, here's a 1hr wait to log in"
---
I have no secret grind spots left to try at 52, looks like I'm stuck dungeon grinding like everyone else
---
Mate, you literally tried to use a topic to discredit something and then said 'I don't wanna talk about it'. You think that defense works anywhere outside family gatherings worried about you ruining the atmosphere?
---
Peak hypocrisy to try and bring up high school when you are 'opting out' of a topic **you** started. If you don't know anything about the topic that is fine to be like 'I realize I don't know anything about this topic therefore I don't want to talk about it'. Why are you getting offended that that is blatantly the issue.
---
&gt;I never said they did; just that they shouldn't in response to the original guy I replied to that wanted them to.
---
Then it looks like that topic is over.
---
&gt;It's rather unfortunate that you then do go the dishonest route by claiming I 'opted out' of a conversation that I asked not and then claim I must therefor know nothing about said subject.
---
Except that is literally the situation. You don't opt out of discussing a topic that **you** brought up to discredit **someone else** for no reason. There is only one reason that you've made blatantly obvious and that is the fact you don't know enough about it to have brought it up in the first place. Especially as a person who engages so heavily in cherry picking, or rather attempting to.
---
"incentive" more like "extortion".
---
For raiding, yes. Classic has several different specs for the different activities as well. You're literally talking out of your ass.
---
yeah okay buddy, keep thinking that
---
I assure you that with ~8-10k people on these servers, there will be no shortage of world PvP.
---
This is the best thread I’ve ever seen lol
---
It took me 2 weeks playing 14-16 hour days in vanilla after release
---
Raiding mc on a Monday with a list of standbys is kind of a dick move. They will not have enough time before reset to try and pug if there isn’t room for them.
---
&gt; Band of accuria drops? Goes to tanks who are already hit capped
---
How are the tanks hit capped without sacrificing mitigation gear?
---
He’s full bm, scatter is a mm talent
---
Damn. Wicked job at confidently spreading misinformation. It still works just doesn’t auto /who a million times a second. You should learn more about which you speak.
---
I actually dont think you're correct. They specifically had people meant to "champion" each class so that they could be the voice of the community, specifically because it's hard to see beyond your own perspectives. Also, another fun fact - not a single designer had a paladin above 50something in the early states of wow/beta.
---
No, it's cross-server.  I do not believe they have indicated what the groups will be.
---
I would quite enjoy that. I wonder if they'd let you "copy" your characters onto the TBC servers or if you'd have to transfer it, or start anew. Either way, I'm having a lot more fun with Classic at the moment than I've had with retail in a long time (even with the current PvP clusterfuck going on)
---
If you scale down the numbers it doesn't matter if you don't change the ratios.
---
Having a 9k vs 1k is still the same as a 900 vs 100.  Why don't you think Horde would be able to have the amount of groups running around only with a scaled down amount of people in each group?
---
The only solution that should be considered is PvP to PvE transfers, and even that is kind of ridiculous. Everyone know what this was getting into it. Faction imbalance was a thing then and of course is a thing now.
---
Everything else is not only NOT a solution, but just going to cause more problems in the future. Blizzard listening to people making unreasonable complaints is how the game got to be unpopular with the core base to begin with.
---
Downvote if you'd like, I'm sorry if your leveling experience is frustrating but it's supposed to signify an active warzone, not every server is going to be balanced.
---
Dude I play a mage
---
This boat goes between mainland Feralas and the Feathermoon Stronghold island. It doesn't "zone" you like the other Alliance boats from Menethil or the BB/Ratchet boat.
---
I am going to be the person that disagrees with everyone else, I was arms and I switched to deep prot to level in BRD. Getting rage from every block is awesome, reducing sunder cost from 15 to 12 is great. The additional 15% threat is fantastic and getting 10% more damage from your 1 hand weapon means 10% more threat there also. 1 point in improved shield block allows you to take on harder bosses without being crit, concussion blow is awesome, with reduced taunt time I can taunt 1 mob and then stun the other and when it comes around my taunt is ready to go again. If you are doing a lot of dungeons then deep prot is not necessary but it makes everything a lot easier
---
Its better for everyone, WPvP is going to go back to only slightly more than phase one. People who want to PvP are going to be doing it in BGs.
---
I don't get what you are apologizing for.
---
The show is available. We could watch if it sounded interesting to us.
---
People will do anything to make it your problem they can't/dont read.
---
Formed a gnomer group for a workshop run. Made it clear that's what we were doing since me and another guy didn't have time for full run.
---
The other three just ignored us and tried to run full, then blamed me when they got kicked. I sister I didn't say it was a workshop run. One guy lied to my face and said he went back and checked. I pointed out that was clearly a lie because those messages had been pushed out of logs by then and got put on ignore.
---
As an example,  I wanted to play on an east coast rp pvp server. But for some reason blizzard only offered a west coast rp pvp server on launch. Realizing their mistake,  they added one, but after launch.
---
But he was making a statement for other people as if it’s getting better... you clearly didn’t read it.
---
This is the game's first big divide. It was gonna happen eventually.
---
Herod is complete cancer.  Moreso for the stupid queue times, but not being able to do anything once you are on just adds to the aggravation.  I'll probably give it another week to see if things level out otherwise I'm likely transferring to Earthfury.
---
their reasoning for the DM early launch was people were pretty much farming MC/ony with ease at that time,it gave them something extra to do,and since phase 2 didnt really launch till after blizzcon,they were decently spot on since that was what....3 extra weeks?
---
You’re beginning to understand now! That’s great! Yes, I was mocking you. Acting in a similar manner as yourself in attempt to highlight the absurdity of your behavior. 
---
THIS.
---
I also have a ton of screenshots of Full Guild on Guild BGs.  WSG and AB.
---
MAYBE back when you had to actually queue at the instance portal it was Party Only, but I honestly don't remember that restriction.
---
What they did implement at some point, was forcing everyone to be in the same raid.  I don't think that was there when the BGs first came out, but they were quick to add it.  
---
BGleader was random though (it should have been highest PvP Rank) I know its not, because I've had Rank 13's with me, and some schmuck lower level put us all in individual raid groups (which makes heal botting more annoying.)
---
If EVERY server is favored toward Horde, it means that there are more people who want to play Horde. Which means that you're just going to piss off the majority of players, no matter what you do.
---
Aren't HKs meaningless anyway?  It's all about Honor I thought
---
Pvp could go to other pvp servers or rp pvp servers, but pve could not go to pvp.
---
for some reason choker of the firelord was open for both healers and caster dps, because we can totally compete with healer dkp smile
---
Why exactly are you sick of them? I know not everyone can continue to run the same raid for MONTHS but most people i've talked to about the burn (and myself being 9 weeks into raiding) are still excited about the potential for getting those good epics. 
---
The few people that i've seen really feel the burn are doing too much outside of the raiding, such as leveling alts for alt-raids (which usually causes you to want the leveling to be over with), or constantly grinding gold to afford those crazy BiS BoEs.
---
BGs are the main thing I'm looking forward to in Classic, but they're rushing the hell out of these phases. I was hoping they would spread things out more and give us more of a sense of progression, but instead we're getting half of P3 less than 4 months in with DM pushed out early and P2 only releasing last week? I don't quite understand their strategy.
---
I leveled to 60 within a month and I'm decently geared now, but I'm hardly ready for BGs and I play a LOT. I feel sorry for anyone that plays more casually and recently hit 60, they won't have any time to get MC gear before BWL releases and they get to feel left behind again.
---
Frank, for the 10th time, I can't sheep Ragnaros.
---
and as you can see, the reddit mob is already frothing at the mouth reading your post lol
---
So I tried my best to prove this wrong and show that furyprot was better than depe prot. Eventually, I gave in and realized I was wrong and specced deep prot.
---
It will take less time to farm 900g than to farm the reputation.
---
We do a signup bot in discord for our attendance. We are casual so attendance isn't mandatory, but everyone was recruited knowing the times so they are expected to make a vast majority of them.
---
Loot is highly subjective. I let my guild vote on rules. Gave them a few options and threw up a poll.
---
Thunderfury is a tanking weapon. Full stop. The first one should go to the main tank. The second one should go to the off tank. The third one should go to the second OT/backup tank. After that, sure go nuts and give them out to whoever. And also go play the lottery. Hand of Rag is a diff story, it has very little PvE value. Our plan is to give it to someone who is relatively close to crafting the hammer or just let whoever wants it to roll on it.
---
You need 1 of each profession, generally. Your skinner needs the UBRS knife and +5 skinning to gloves. Your miner needs +5 mining (for AQ). Plans should be prioritized to raiders you are confident are in it for the long haul. You don't want recipes leaving the guild.
---
All mats gained in a guild raid should go to the guild bank. You can prio mats how you want, the MC mats aren't terribly useful. Ony scales should go to an Ony cloak for each tank.
---
Officers and setup is highly subjective as well. Entirely depends on the type of players you  have.
---
No because Reddit isn’t a group of just 12 people. 
---
There’s tens of thousands of people here each with their own desires, wants and needs, etc. and therefor there will always be people that want something different
---
Lol uh huh. Sure, kiddo. You're so angry that your only argument is "no u". hahahaha
---
Your memory of north dale is pretty questionable then \:P
---
True, but if you add them now it takes content away from phases down the road. You don't want Phase 3 to be barren with BWL being the only piece of major content.
---
Those are peoples alts, anyone that has any interest in raiding has been in MC for weeks
---
What? Lmao. My guy, you’re delusional.
---
Hmm thanks for the info I was also wondering this.
---
Maybe if you read the comment that I answered, you would have figured it out. But guess not, given how braindead you are it is to be expected. The question is how the fuck are you still breathing? You shouldnt be able to with that IQ.
---
How is it not a valid point? Reddit upvotes the opinions they agree with and downvotes the ones that they don't. When the dust settles, this subreddit is filled with posts echoing the opinions I outlined in the OP and the opposing opinions are downvoted and not seen. That surely sounds like a hivemind to me.
---
Unfortunately that is the issue, but forcing half of the server population to be unable to play (even if they weren't doing any pvp) is just malicious.
---
I haven’t had a queu since week 2 of launch on skeram
---
&gt;We currently have three Officers, 2 Main Tanks and a Rogue, who most appropriately qualify for TF.
---
As a rogue, do not fucking give TF to a rogue. It's not that great for us, it's a meme weapon for the lulz "haha I have thunderfury guys." It's far better for tanks.
---
The last set of data we had showed almost 50:50 across all servers for total numbers.
---
Casuals is blizzards target audience, always has been always will. WoW was built for casuals.
---
PvP existed before phase 2 but nobody did it.  If you called enemy positions you were ignored.  If you attacked the opposing faction while fighting over mobs you would get shunned by the players around you.  Right now people help, they jump at the opportunity to pvp.  Once BGs open it will be back to open world is for pve only where everyone keeps their heads down and acts like carebears.
---
"100% if I was choosing a faction literally only for the strongest PvP advantage, I would pick alliance." then you'd be wrong.
---
Escape artist is legit good, and stone form is nice, but nothing compares to orc/undead racials. Completely bonkers. How often would you live if you resisted a stun, or could break out of (and be immune!) to a fear/charm? Now how often would you win if you got rid of poisons/bleeds vs a rogue/warrior which can cc you regardless?
---
CC wins pvp, and horde have way better ways of dealing with the strongest forms of it.
---
any decent hunter already has rhok delar

---
A great point, I am considering flipping the Mon/Wed raids once the raid group solidifies. We actually chose Mondays because we are only 8/10 since we lack the quints right now. We thought it would be easier to pug people with that in mind and anybody in the guild who logs in and is attuned gets a spot 100% of the time. Very good point though.
---
People don't usually ask for things that are bad to play out.
---
This isn't rocket surgery
---
Since they are progressively speeding up the timeline it would be nice to play on a server with more longevity.
---
Yes and you can’t stop replying though. So you must be enjoying this too. Good. I’m sure you see the humor in it then. The whole thread has been hilarious back to your original ironic reply.
---
Probably grinding in a 40man raid and didn't know that it dramatically reduces the honor gained per kill
---
Should have asked to see his philosophers stone.
---
I don't know if I agree with this one. You definitely see the same people from time to time if you play enough. Even if you only see their name in trade chat it's enough to establish a sense of familiarity.
---
yeah,now agree with you. This game will be dead before the summer comes.
---
ok so vanilla is basically the worst version of wow that has ever and will ever exist, it is not time for Nost 2.0 nor will it ever be
---
I’ll buy one on bigglesworth for 450 gold tonight if anyone wants to sell!
---
Or the earliest of early of 2020 ... January, which I think is a bit too soon.
---
Ehh I received plenty of whispers like that on normal PvP servers.
---
paladins ARE priests who want to learn combay AND warriors wanting to learn the light, so shut up idiot dwarf.

---
I mean you just said you hated it, it being the game as it was designed.
---
My head canon for why certain items didn't drop was because you bashed the ever living fuck out of their faces that that raptor head didn't look like a raptor head anymore once you got through with it.
---
private servers never fully went away,they still exist to this day. classic didn't completely nip them in  bud,impossible  since most are manned overseas.
---
&gt;One of the World First Alliance Kazzak kills? 
---
We killed him about 2 or 3 hours after the patch was out on herod, so late by over a week my dude.
---
Loot list is an insanely book-keepy way to do loot allocation IMO. It's even worse than EPGP, while being far more convoluted and harder for players to understand. I wouldn't run LL, and I'd only be in a guild using LL if they *really* were on top of their game.
---
Just use EP/GP IMO. If that's too accounting heavy, then suicide kings. If you don't trust yourself well enough to set up GP costs, and don't like the ones online, then use standard bid DKP.
---
Attendance gets a DKP or EP reward; that helps enforce it pretty well. If you've already cleared Rag, pretty quickly you'll be able to have a person or two not show and still be able to clear (so long as it isn't the MT). You should have a handful of "I can raid occasionally" type people floating in and out if possible, to fill vacancies. Relying on PUGs sucks.
---
Recipes/mats should either go to a dedicated elected officer, or go to the guild for a DKP/GP cost. I'd set up rules that elected officers can't charge guildies for crafting and the benefit is crafting for non-guildies, but that's up to you. BS/LW aren't the big ones (unless you get lionheart or something)... Enchanting is.
---
Bindings go to MT first, you'd have to be high on peyote to give it to a rogue over MT. Second set of bindings is more flexible but generally goes to OT. Rag... is more flexible, and IMO more honorary; as it isn't nearly as big of a deal as thunderfury is for tanks.
---
Battlegrounds exist on PvE servers, right?
---
So in the overworld, you're safe, and when you do want to queue up to fight other players, you play the BGs. That's what PvE servers are for.
---
&gt;Buddy, it's a WoW forum where - shock - I'm here to talk about WoW, and don't particularly care to talk about Pokemon. I don't see why this should come as a surprise.
---
&gt;The point was originally to showcase the differing views based on this website compared to real life.
---
I'm well aware of what your point was, but your 'back up logic' was severely flawed and I was pointing out how flawed comparing it to Pokemon was. If you don't want to discuss X topic, here is a tip for that: Don't bring up X topic.
---
I don't know how much clearer I can make that for you.
---
&gt;I mistakenly thought people might be able to extrapolate what I'd said, but I admit I need to spoon-feed the point on this website. I apologize. Next time I'll keep in mind you're unable to read between the lines and understand the point being made.
---
Extrapolate what? That your point that you brought up with flawed logic to back it up is what...? Flawed? Yeah it was. I figured you'd be able to understand that people get irritated when others bring up flawed reasoning and then back out of it while still attempting to maintain it was reasonable.
---
&gt;And then summarily ended, and was forced back in to after saying countless times I don't want to talk about damn Pokemon.
---
I wasn't talking about just the Pokemon topic with that comment.
---
&gt;The issue isn't 'I don't know anything', the issue is 'can't be bothered to exchange essays with you'. But hey, if you do find proof of your claims I'm happy to see it - did you find any?
---
The issue is definitely that you don't know anything, hence why you've spent more time saying 'I don't want to talk about it' than actually addressing it.
---
But yeah I'm definitely open for you to provide proof of your claims that reddit is a bad reference and is worse than other social media communities. Did you find any?
---
&gt;I can opt out of any discussion I please.
---
And I can call you out for it as I please.
---
&gt;If you can't see the point being made, that's really not my problem. People outside of this website like games that you don't like. Get over it. You're talking such senseless nonsense that I'm less inclined to have any sort of discussion with you as time goes on.
---
You say this as though I'm hung up on speaking to you, people disagree with you and will call you out for talking about things you don't know about. Get over it.
---
&gt;If you have infinite time to waste sitting here arguing about Pokemon, be my guest. Do so. I personally do not. Don't be shocked that other people have different priorities than you do. Don't be mad that people don't want to sit here talking about issues they don't care enough about.
---
Funny considering how much time you've spent arguing against having to defend your logic. What are you prioritizing right now? Seems like you're prioritizing avoiding the subject all together, quite extensively. Don't be mad when people call you out for BSing.
---
if this happens allies will just move out making even less ally population, this is not the right way or addressing the problem
---
I'm 5 comments deep on this subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dz4ypf/battlegrounds_comming_december_10th/f85ol1v/) with sources on the current state of the population so I'll direct you there to avoid typing out the same arguments
---
I don't know why but someone being afraid when seeing my name makes me feel a little happy. That literally never happens in games for me lol
---
Good news! Your friends/community could transfer with you thus helping balance another server much more!
---
What are people like me supposed to do? We listened to blizzard and didn't play on faerlina. The server we ended up on was stupid popular, and had queues. They implemented free transfers with no restrictions, and alliance on my server left in droves. We are massively outnumbered. We have no options. I would happily server transfer to any server that has a better ratio than 60/40. 
---
It doesn't make sense to let one faction outnumber the other on that kind of scale. You chose to play on the majority faction right? Why shouldn't you have to wait in a queue until the server needs more of that faction?
---
I mean a world where horde camp all high lvl zone flight points, roam around all high level zones and camp every single chokepoint and instance enterance.
---
I am actually happy about this, WPvP is boring. One side camps the other with no diffuculty. Pre-made vs Pre-made is tge best part of this game.
---
There will still be people questing and farming after bg's. If roaming gank squads is what's fun for you then you'll still be able to do that after bg's.
---
One of the easiest ways to know someone is mad is that they keep insisting that they're actually having fun unprompted. Pathetic.
---
No I’m actually not angry. I’ve been trying to tell you that and explain it to you but I’ll try again. 
---
I am NOT angry. I’m not sure why you would think that. 
---
I’m in a pleasant mood. Just got home from work. 
---
Engaging in intellectual and witty banter with a fellow jokester on the internet. I’m in a great mood.
---
Good grief, I'm not going to once again wade through that. What an utter waste of time.
---
This is the perfect way to put it
---
"shut up, you ultra-casual shit-eating troglodyte" - me, speaking to your dumb ass
---
Rule 4 mate.
---
&gt;If I reroll I won't reach 60 until phase 4/5. Nobody will be doing entry level content anymore. There will be no game for me to play at that point.  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt;\[If\] I realized the server populations would be this large when honor went live I would have been on a normal realm. 
---
As someone who plays on a normal realm, why don't you check out playing on one before you quit?  You can play at your own pace. If you don't play for a week because responsibilities no one's going to care. If you join a good guild they'll be happy to play their alts with you or join you with their mains for difficult content.  (In my guild half the players are couples with kids or grandkids. Running people through dungeons to help them catch up with where most of the guild are is definitely a thing.)  Even with normal content, you'll level faster because no PvP.
---
Why would Alliance camp their own boat?
---
I agree 100%, and to be clear, I'm not against gating of content like raids precisely for the reasons you've stated.
---
I just don't understand why they have the phase release timeline in blocks instead of having overlapping time periods for things.
---
It made a lot of sense to outline it before classic released, but now... they should retool it to be more accurate (or really be open about how flexible they need to be with it) because exact dates of release for Phase 6 being March 24th, *2021* is such a ridiculous claim for them to make they should just say Spring 2021.
---
I can't answer all your questions, but I cann tell you this: if Bindings of the Windseeker drop, give it to whichever of your main tanks has more consistent attendance.
---
Thunderfury is absolutely a tank priority item. A rogue Thunderfury it is going to be threat-limited, meaning you won't get the most out of it. A tank with Thunderfury has better aggro, which is good for everyone in the raid .
---
Giving bindings to someone with good attendance is essential. You'll be kicking yourself if the second bindings drop and your flaky tank who got the first binding drop isn't there.
---
Do lower level healers make more threat faster? I find it incredibly easy to generate more threat than the healer when they're the same level as I am. A lot of the time though, healers will LFG for dungeons they're ~2 levels lower than recommended for. I don't mind this, but it seems like I have to make waaaaaay more threat to stop mobs from breaking off to go attack my underlevelled healers. 
---
What gives?
---
1
---
9
---
8
---
Lmao
---
But edgy one word replies to a serious question are meta....
---
Never
---
Im gonna miss the 20 man gang bang squads at all my flight paths
---
No chance . That’s never worth it time wise
---
It was 8 weeks.
---
On the flip side my Alliance guild likes to camp zeppelins even though we are outnumbered on the server as well.
---
Wilhem scream
---
This is interesting. For those who don’t bother with PvP and don’t have rank 3, you could buy a mount for them at 800g with your own discount and sell it to them for, say 850g. They save 50g and you profit 50g. I wonder how practical this might be.
---
Notice everyone loves to pile on about the Horde-dominated servers, even before the numbers were officially out it was the Horde's fault.
---
You could make 10g way faster from running SM and then just buy the mats you need.
---
Azshara is out of the way with fewer quests, seems to be better on my server at least
---
My guild seems to think mages are absolute gods and locks suck. So mageblade, SP ringed and choker are getting funneled to the mages
---
are you serious?
---
that is the whole point in a 15 year old game, that is the meta
---
do you play it for the raid challenge?
---
Not even DR. If you're in control, you're better off just winning the game quickly and hopping into another one.
---
The people still trying to level or leveling alts.
---
Everything is faster because that's what the shareholders like.  By releasing content faster they appear to be meeting deadlines ahead of schedule instead of just fast tracking existing content.
---
BGs are cross server. Server balance has nothing to do with it.
---
Shoulda rolled Engineering.
---
He's so f'ing cute and I can't take it.
---
To be fair your while team should be needing all items of value in AH
---
TIL rogues masturbate in wpvp.
---
Yeah it's a real bummer that none of the devs leveled Paladins early in WoW so for all of Vanilla they were stuck being by far the most durable healer in the game, with a 10-second immunity on top of their native durability, with healing throughput only rivaled by Priest, and the strongest buffs of any class.
---
There are semi-reasonable arguments for Horde favoritism in Classic's design -- for example, racials make Undead and Orc superior to any Alliance race in most 1v1 PvP situations or small group skirmishes -- but I don't think Paladin balance is the hill you want to die on.
---
Mark targets with an order so dps doesn't blow up separate targets, but even then you need to hold aggro on them due to healer and aoe skills. Sunder armor each target once or twice, use taunt if any escape as a chance to reaggro them. Use aoe shouts (battle shout causes aggro too) to establish right at start of fight. Hope that helps.
---
Badlands. Do the whole zone, do Uldaman. Then Tanaris after and zul'farrak.
---
Next week.
---
My uncle works at Nintendo and he told me so.
---
Ah well that was my misunderstanding then.
---
Damn. :( That's insane.
---
10k honor on Remulos gave top 10 standing
---
I only attack people +/- ~5 levels of the character I’m on. I don’t attack when I’m sure to lose (I.e. 1 v 3). I’m not interested in ganking someone 10 v 1, as there is no fun when victory is 100% guaranteed. I typically only attack when I’m passing through an area, and not staying there, as id rather not have them rezzing on me while o try to quest. 
---
All that said, I do love attacking when I know I’m 90% likely to win the 1 v 1 because I’ve caught them by surprise.
---
Probably would work okay, but warriors have little mobility like druids and can be locked down and kited quite easy.
---
Thank you!!
---
Not entirely true.. hunters absolutely blast most classes &lt;19, no matter the gear
---
As a horde player, I salute your effort. I would have left you alone after the first guy fell off the boat for the sheer brilliance and entertainment factor
---
I got 177 with ~30K.
---
Truthfully, I would recommend using a guide and picking up a level or two behind you and going from there. 
---
Classic can be a very confusing place to level. You'll frequently find yourself underleveled within a zone because they all have such large level ranges and not enough quests to sustain you. Furthermore, Pre-BC questing hubs are very poorly setup.
---
Otherwise IIRC, Badlands, Swamp of Sorrow, and Dustwallow should all have some level appropriate content for you.
---
It's different though.  The Honor drop influenced every part of the game:  You can't farm, you can't quest, you can't get to any dungeon or raid instance without massive hassle and delay, etc.
---
Yeah, BGs have their problems and will receive complaints, but they don't disrupt the entire game the same way that the Honor drop has.  Even trying to compare the two is so unbelievably out of touch and idiotic.  It just reeks of someone trying to pretend to be holier than thou.
---
Yeah, the census site (which no longer works and was providing ballpark data to begin with) hasn't been updated to account for realm transfers. 
---
The data is entirely bogus at this point and needs to stop being referenced. Odds are the server does not follow the trends.
---
No well this conversation is over since you clearly have no idea wtf you are talking about, have never touched wow addon development, and have never touched client-server hand offs. Good luck being a whinny little kid on Reddit though, I’m sure you’re parents are proud.
---
this may be too late but:
---
either take SoC or SoR. both is kinda waste of point.
---
I am running pretty simila build since I hit lvl 52, to level. SoC and talents in %70 interruption resist.
---
I respec'd prot to tank BRD as I want to level to 60 in dungeons and the QoL is so much better
---
jesus christ are you stupid
---
And if the horde are so spread out to cover literally the entirety of everything, why don't the alliance just mass and smash them?
---
I enjoyed your story!
---
&gt;Add 1-2h queues to the dominant faction.
---
You're wanting blizzard to punish people for picking an over-populated faction?  You sound like a reasonable person.
---
Bingo.  I can't leave the capital cities to do anything right now.  Even running to get an Aqual in Azshara was a total mess.
---
Good going, zeb.
---
If your still struggling to get 40 consistent raiders,what option do you even have? Gkick them?
---
I got a new keyboard a year back and hadn't played wow with it til ckassic. It has a very small enter key and I bound rp walk to the key above it. I often find myself unexpectedly RP walking due to a previous fat finger. Thankfully it hasnt happened on Geddon. Yet.
---
&gt; WoW Classic Honor System release date: November 12 2019
---
It was the 14th, right?
---
Not that it changes your point, of course.
---
Fair enough. Can you imagine they would not like having to transfer to fix a problem they are not part of?
---
And in that case, can you imagine they would be reluctant to do so, which would then result in maintaining the state of increased overall queue times?
---
Just trying to see it from blizzards point of view. You are limiting the server capacity to the minority faction size plus some margin. Overall that means less active players per server, which means more servers required per player, and that leads to I creased costs per player, in other words less revenue
---
That's by implementing a change that is not even guaranteed to fix a problem that not even all the players experience atm.
---
I can tell you right away no one wants to be the person who caused that revenue drop
---
80-20 means your server is imbalanced by 300%. You can see where the difference in those statements lies.
---
Not a problem, just a challenge.
---
You finish all of MC in 1-1.5 hours?  You're in the 99th percentile then.  Most guilds aren't.
---
What is the point of the event? Is it a precursor to something?
---
I'm going to be rolling nothing soon enough.  I didn't come to classic to relive shitty vanilla pve progression or spend all day in town waiting for pvp queues to pop.  I came here specifically to enjoy world pvp before it gets ruined by all the crybabies.
---
Do you play it for the unbalanced dogshit grindfest that is pvp? 
---
Check the poll on the sub. Like 80% of ppl on pvp server said their end goal is pve not pvp.
---
You don't speak for all Alliance at all and you're unwilling to respect and adapt to the ecosystem that we're all thrown into. Blizzard is pressured into rushing out the limited classic content we have because Alliance are outnumbered and getting owned in PVP, for literally no reason. Alliance have awesome PVP racials and paladins are exclusive to their faction, yet here we are addressing an imbalance that is unrelated to any faction specific ability. There are PVP and RPPVP servers that are Alliance favored, and there are RPPVP and PVP servers that are balanced and fun. 
---
People have been asking for WPVP for years now, and now we finally have pure unadulterated PVP experience and the casual audience are still getting catered to. You should’ve asked for Wrath or BC because this is a replication of the" wild-west" era of MMOs and it feels great. I'm sure there are Alliance brothers on here who feel the same, but they're too busy forming stronger guilds and finding new play styles to adapt instead of complaining on reddit
---
&gt; I would tell those 48s to either quit or take break for the time being.
---
And that's why you aren't a community manager for Blizzard.
---
&gt; People that are not 60 at this point are incredibly casual. Like people in my guild with kids and jobs have been killing rag for weeks.
---
Exactly. They have little time to play. To waste most of it corpse running obviously isn't fun.
---
&gt; So what does it matter if they take a break?
---
Well I'm paying monthly for this shit! I'm paying that I can play and not to just wait a few weeks to play again.
---
It's really funny how you are so close to understand the situation for casual players but then fail to make the final conclusion.
---
&gt; Sit it out and wait for BGs to come placate you until you realize you're still not going to win anything meaningful because you're just plain bad at pvp.
---
And you still try to push the idea that only bad player complain about it. Despite that I've explained to you conclusively that skill doesn't matter at all in the current PvP.
---
So, first of all...yes, it's a great build.  However, it can be changed slightly.
---
This is my build:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05500302501](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05500302501) 
---
You'll see I only differ in one point, shifting my point from swarm to threat reduction.  You could shift armor to threat in feral...arguably, and you could go 4 and 4 too.  I'd argue that if you're stacking armor appropriately through gear, then 6% threat is better than 4% armor.
---
As for enrage, I've heard Skarm talk about that before favorably, I wouldn't bother with improved mark myself.  I'd say for enrage vs threat reduction, the question is probably just about whether you want to tank or heal more...neither is game breaking.
---
duels are supposed to be mimic wPvP 1v1 encounters for most people. Thats why people let warriors charge, rogue open etc.
---
I often could've kicked myself to have wasted my reck on a rather easy composition just to roflstomp them to then lose to a 1v3 I couldve won with FAP + reck for juicy 600 honor. I got better and judge if I really need to blow my CDs for this fight or if I can save them for an encounter 6minutes later where I actually need my ingi net.
---
Google wow classic zones by level map and it should give you an idea of possible zones to grind. Also questie add on  should show you zones that have a bunch of quests waiting for you
---
Switch to retail and you can transfer servers.
---
ZG has some really good gear, though. Doesn't the Bloodvine set outdo anything from even BWL?
---
But I hate retail.
---
that is just recorded characters in total, that has nothing to do with the online player cap.
---
caps are about 5-6k now, down from 12k or so.
---
I think it's kinda lame BUT if it's the only incentive for you to run the dungeon I get it, especially if you tell people while building the group.
---
I mean, the alternative is ninja'ing it right? Because otherwise you're not gonna build the group.
---
If it's clearly stated I think it's fine.
---
That's an inefficient way to farm honour, any good premade will just 3-0 and move on.
---
I recognize this but can’t remember what it’s from
---
We're not telling you to reroll to Horde.
---
It's clear you can't handle the PvP concept at all. So pick a PvE server. Then your race doesn't matter.
---
Ignore these people saying it’s “wrong” to ever reserve anything. We all have limited playtime and lots of us would prefer to find people to run dungeons with who don’t want the same loot. As long as you state clearly what the loot rules are everybody involved wins. You can get your sword, other people can get their loot. A lot of us only need one item from a dungeon and don’t want to run it with 3 other people who need it when we could find people who don’t.
---
DnD rules! You harvest what you can. If you fuck up, the materials are destroyed.
---
There's a team working on Pantheon, and it's already multiple millions of dollars into development. Just because one developer died means nothing.
---
Personally no I have grown to enjoy classic and I’d hate to put time in a server that isn’t guaranteed.
---
I came from blackrock horde where 1-2 hour AV queues were considered "quick" on a good day. It honestly was fun until you realized what was happening. So Horde would win 90% of the games, you want to know why? Because they wanted it more. They just spent 2 hours waiting to get 1 game of AV. Alliance? Well they instant queued, they have less of an incentive to win. If they see any sign of losing, they just throw their game so they can get into another one instantly as soon as the game is over which made the games boring because we just rolled them every time. 
---
Eventually we got to the point where we wouldn't even instantly win. We would capture all the tower first, maximize as much honor as possible in a game by completing objectives before we killed the leader because we knew we would be stuck in a 2 hr game.
---
Haven't played in 2 months myself. The amount of horde ganks were annoying even before phase 2. My warlock will forever be stuck at lvl 47
---
He's saying is it really cheaper if he all already got one
---
Alliance racials are stronger for PvP and it's not really that close.
---
That's why we need faction specific population caps and faction specific queues.
---
It a really varies if you decide to go Hemo.  
---
Nobody talks about that anymore, but Hemo spam bis drops poisons entirely for sharpening/weight stones and therefore doesn’t gaf about a fast oh, it’s dps oh, which is audial you somewhat fast, but not always. 
---
God I miss elietestjerks.
---
Eh there’s an add on that allows you to group as a raid. Everyone who has the add on opens the bg guy, and then the raid leader queues the group. It queues everyone simultaneously and then you just deny it if not enough people get to the same av. If you get 33–40 all in the same av, your group takes it. It’s whatever tho because it actually requires people to pay attention enough and care enough to get the addon.
---
I'd rather have a queue and then actually have some Alliance to fight than running around and seeing 1 alliance per hour. And if you don't lie queues play Alliance. Thats the point.
---
Didn't think we could make a character on the opposite faction?
---
When they released DM early that's how they spun it in their quarterly earnings report.
---
Lock complaining that you didn't 1v1 him... 
---
No one in their right mind really wants to 1v1 a lock in the open world. It's just asking to get feared 100-0.
---
World War Z I think
---
It's almost never worth taking the boat either way.   Unless it's sitting at the end of the dock going towards shore and you hop out and get on it, you might as well swim.
---
Considering how your understanding of the game is so bad that you think PvE and PvP and Dungeon and farming speccs are the same ones, you can't really comment on it.
---
Poor thing
---
This is a horribly stupid arguement, let's see how you recover in the following comments.
---
But all the private server #$@%ers who aren't actually good at the game 
---
Thank you for not arguing in bad faith, seriously I appreciate that, you maybe right about a good amount of that. It just worries me because we have no indication for how soon they will release raid tiers specifically, all we have to go off of is how quick they release content in general and they've certainly been rushing that out. Either way you're probably right about retention and they probably didnt have much of a choice with this specifically.
---
Some one else in this thread said that at this rate we'll have TBC by April, that's obviously hyperbole but I think it describes the anxiety that some of us are feeling I'm just scared blizzard is gonna rush through the content cycle and then it'll be post nax and they'll just abandon us.
---
Oh wow. Nope you're actually just that stupid.
---
r/thathappened
---
Horde grinding that 0 honor/hour vs lowbies, no surprising they are this thick
---
Really depends on how interactive you want your classic hunter leveling experience to be.  You can literally just send your pet at the mob and autoshot each and every one and they will die.  (Provided you don't let your pet die, you don't die, you get the idea.)
---
You can't even get Aimed Shot until level 20 so for your question that is out.  And that also assumes that you even want to go down the MM tree because leveling as BM is both valid and honestly IMO better.
---
I say that after leveling my vanilla hunter way back in the day as BM.  And then in classic leveling a hunter as MM and if I had to level another hunter now in classic I'd likely go BM again for leveling and then respec MM for DPS at 60.
---
So if you do go BM early you pet will be tougher, do more DPS, and as a result have more threat on things.  Which makes it a pretty simple matter of putting your max rank Serpent Sting on the target once for the DOT and then autoshot down the mob until it dies.  Repeat over and over and over.  You won't have super interactive gameplay, not that vanilla/classic WoW has a lot of that anyway, but  you won't have mana issues really and you will be able to just level away.
---
I've been blacklisting people like you.
---
I've run things hundreds of times too. That doesn't mean anything. RNG is part of the game and we're all subjected to it's cruel winds of fate. Deal with it like a fucking man, roll on it. Quit adding to the toxicity of Classic, please.
---
That all being said, do what you want. I'd never group with you out of principle but if other people are dumb enough join a group like yours that's up to them.
---
On my server we have an asshole on Alliance side called "Storm" on Deviate Delight with the o having a special character because of course someone reserving Righteous Orbs would have that in their name. The worst thing about this dipshit is that they not only reserve orbs but they then turn around and try to sell them to in trade chat. Once again, hey, if that's how he wants to play, that's fine. These people eventually earn themselves enough of a reputation that they fuck themselves over in the end but it's still shitty to see people reserve stuff. It's why I almost never pug.
---
Making alts is fun and a beneficial learning experience for new players. I remember when I was 14 and I went thru the alt-a-holic phase for months. But as a veteran I must recommend that you eventually make a decision and stick with it. Maybe get 3 or 4 classes to level 20ish see what fits your fancy.
---
And yes, things certainly get better after Desolace.
---
Is there just one battlegroup for each region?
---
I do really wish they didn't do cross-realm to start. It was nice seeing all the regular names in BGs.
---
Ok awesome, I have like 5 quests for Uldaman, but finding a group has been a challenge (been told by a few groups they want their DPS higher leveled). But I’ll keep trying!
---
I do not think that level matters for threat generation, it is a simple .5 multiplier to healing done, then split between the mobs engaged. My only thought would be that lower level healers feel they have to put out their first heal on you earlier in the fight before you have generated threat on all the mobs in the pull.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
No, I don't play on grob. It would be the server I would go to once they offer paid transfers.
---
And what’s the problem with that? A remastered game that offers a year of solid playtime is great. Not sure how you can ask for more.
---
They have smaller heals, so they're healing sooner, putting them closer to you on the threat list.
---
Maybe dont blow every single CD in every duel? You dont *have* to blind a warrior twice to finish him off, you know.
---
For the love of god turn off error speech lol.
---
Vanilla, on the other hand, is super balanced.
---
Join LFG channel and try to run some dungeons. Join a guild and try to find some leveling buddies.
---
The game is more fun once you have some consistent companions.
---
Prefaced statement: I am not attacking you.
---
Is it really fair to allow those 5,000 players to be held hostage by the 15,000? Regardless of faction? 
---
We're at a point on my server (Stallag) where it is a 3:1 imbalance. The entire world is held hostage by Horde, and it takes 30 minutes to 1 hour to reach anything you want to do in the world after stepping out of a major city. Every flight point/boat/method of travel is camped. Every known run to an instance is camped. Every gathering profession spot is camped. Even the gates of IF are camped.
---
I struggle to find the difference between "it takes 30 minutes to 1 hour to do anything in the world" and a "30 minute to 1 hour faction-based queue time." 
---
And this isn't a PVP server problem, or a QQ git gud problem, it's a problem Blizzard created by allowing the non-faction specific transfers up until about a week ago.
---
Playing Alliance is the equivalent of having a queue time to do anything, for no other reason than you chose the wrong faction and Blizzard allowed the true weenies to transfer off early and en masse.
---
Also most bows, ironically. I (warrior) lost the roll on Satyr's Bow last night to a hunter. He was so happy. He had Carapace Spine Crossbow.
---
This.   Our raid guild clears ony and mc in 2 hours and then has nothing to raid the rest of the week.   We originally had a two day raid schedule now we have a 1 day schedule that usually finishes early.
---
And battlegrounds. Which apparently we are now getting the first week of december.
---
Duels almost never have devilsaurs and monstrous plaguebats to fear people into so idk where or why people are making this comparison
---
Close discord and try again
---
December 10th is a Tuesday though. Just a thought.
---
You had to mention the keyring.
---
Left gehennas to earthshaker. No queue.
---
Well it's not like [rogue are the most OP class in pvp 1v1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1t0A1cqGcw) in vanilla/classic.
---
Oh no, [some of your abilities are on cooldown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUVNOI9rI5U) ?
---
[How will you ever win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL--teiBbzQ) ?
---
Lol hey look. Another person telling me not to use spells in a duel.
---
There's a spot between between no pvp and incessant ganking that inhibits normal play. I played in vanilla wow, even back when there were only auction houses in Orgrimmar and Ironforge. You'd get ganked now and then, and pvp hotspots outside of blackrock was the norm. But it wasn't anything close to what we have now.
---
I blame the server pop. Vanilla high is classic low or med apparently. Player density is just too high. That plus the fact that no BG means world pvp is the only way to get honor. Let's hope BG will change this situation otherwise I'm looking at spending months redoing my progress on a pve server.
---
You'll see.
---
Bind your keys, wtf.
---
You may have queued simultaneously, or you may be talking about WSG or AB, but you could not group queue for AV.  My wife and I played there for nearly a year, it annoyed us constantly b/c AV is one of our favorite things to do in game.  We did *many* of them.  We were never once able to group queue, we had to try to queue simultaneously and hope we got in the same one.
---
I see! A lot of the guides I’ve been looking at recommend locations that I’ve already completed, but I’ll give Badlands and Uldaman a try! Swamp of sorrow is a nice, small zone, and I read you can farm the jaguars there? But then some people say that is only a private server thing. Thanks!
---
My issue with Raiding on Monday was already mentioned since it is the start of the week and kind of dumb.  Not only because of standby, but also because if you ever decide you want to raid again the instance is reset.  If you do end up raiding multiple days it doesn't matter too much, but even then it would be ideal to have all raids finished by the weekend.
---
Thunderfury should go to the tanking warrior you trust the most.  As much as rogues want it to be cool, we can replace it and get around it.  The proc is amazing for threat and even multiple targets.  There simply isn't another comparable item for tanks.
---
Eye of Sulfuras is mainly a pvp weapon, but it should still go to someone who is "important".  Whether they person is just incredibly reliable or does a lot for the guild that part is up to you.
---
How to do loot is always a problem because every system has strengths and flaws.  Do you want to encourage people to figure it out among themselves?  Use a DKP system.  Do you think you have a group of people who are smart enough to be able to adequately determine what is best for everyone without pissing people off?  Use a loot Council.  Do you believe in Anarchy?  Just leave it on FFA and see what happens.
---
and the same way some poor random kills a streamer, OMFG STREAM SNIPE BLACKLIST THE GUY KILL HIS FAMILY
---
You’re complaining about a 2 week window for a content release. Don’t talk to me about extremes.
---
Battlegroups, same as vanilla
---
The highway doors are normally open. When you use the key on the lock, it closes the highway door which grants access to the path over the door towards angerforge.
---
Good idea! I was actually looking for a map overlay add on that would show me this, but couldn’t find one!
---
I get so triggered on my shaman when stuns land on me.

I go full jokerd mode. DO you think I’m some random fucking player? I am a 60 orc shaman, I can resist stuns all I fucking want. Me, not you.

If the boat arrives at the same time you leave for a swim you'll arrive at nearly the same time. If the boat is anywhere but at the dock when you want to leave, then it is slower.

Making an alt can sometimes refresh the game for you, maybe the class isn’t for you and you’ll find more suited to another one! My first play through I got to about 30 with a Druid re rolled a warrior and haven’t looked back, just do what’s fun maybe try hillsbrad/alterac or play with friends is a lot more fun playing solo can be lonely
---
How do you know already?
---
Nobody is saying that is elitist, they are saying that is not a normal situation to be in.
---
The estimated honor in chat isn't the actual calculated honor.
---
Level 55 guards spawn in droves if you get too near any other NPC in the whole area.
---
Nah, BGs will be cross realm, queue times will be fine. Maybe 5-10 mins longer on Horde side if they’re longer at all.
---
The bigger the population the more people are in each ranking bracket which makes it easier to rank.
---
Wait, are you from the future? Because I’ve got questions.
---
AV queue will be near instant for horde since it's the only BG alliance ever queue for. Most likely because it is a pve-focused BG with an asymmetrical map that gives them key advantages.
---
In raid fights your pet is more than likely to die if you send them into attack.  The popular thing to do is use a wolf and buff your aim shots with furious howl.   But i recommend the lvl 51 wind serpent from ST that pats the lower ring.  Highest rank of Lightning breath that's available currently.   Put pet on stay and make a macro that casts lightning breath and aim shot.  Your pet will run to max range on the mob,  cast lightning breath,  and sit there.   This will be higher personal dps than furious howl and avoid having to res your pet all the time.
---
No, what that person is describing is actually working as intended.
---
When you beat Majordomo you only get his loot on the first kill but he will respawn after (iirc) 2 hours if Ragnaros is not dead yet. If Majordomo respawns then the raid will need to defeat him again to be able to fight Rag.
---
It's time to be patient and let things play out. BGs are being rushed out to help people who can't leave their capital cities. There was a trend of faction switching back then so that queues would be better. It will happen again. 
---
Paid transfers will end up with even worse balance on some already lopsided servers, and create problems where they might not exist yet.
---
Colonel 100: You got a shit bucket?
---
Sniper and Medic: Uh... no.
---
Colonel 100: Wrong answer.
---
How do you keybind skull and x marks??
---
It takes like a week.
---
Except, if you notice from the current server queues, they retain your position for a few minutes to safeguard against connectivity issues.  So your lost queue issue is not likely to occur en masse.
---
If you fancy a read and to understand all of the high level stuff, this seems accurate. Short answer is that there is a priority that actions happen, and + hit / crit / skill will push certain actions off the table. It is the same way with tanking and crushing blows.
---

---
What addon? Asking for a friend
---
Yeah I think I'll basically go this exact build. Only thing I'm not sure about is insect swarm vs subtlety vs improved enrage.
---
Does the threat reduction actually help when healing? I do plan on healing more than tanking so I'll likely go insect swarm and 1 point threat reduction just like skarms build.
---
Trash guild is trash.
---
My guild clears Ony (sometimes split run with 2 groups of 20) and MC in less than 3 hours. No one flasks except for one guy who does it just to try to top the damage meters.
---
It is expected to have some consumables like food and pots, but that is it.
---
The guild you are in is bad and you can do better.
---
Where is the navy seal jokerd pasta at?
---
Ohhhhh. Thank you
---
&gt; Yes I want to talk about why horde camp every flight path, the boats
---
Because the allies in the wild are already dead and people need HK.
---
I think you’re right. I believe in this version of zombie apocalypse, they are only stimulated by movement. When he crouches down and stays still, they seemingly ignore him altogether and pass by as though he is an inanimate object.
---
Exactly this. People who regret rolling pvp and having plenty of time to level confuse me.
---
Well its normal for 20 ppl to carry the other half of the raid.
---
Ahh, I'm thinking of retail then with the vendors and stuff on the zeppelin.
---
Mograine is like 40-60 horde
---
&gt; It's almost never worth taking the boat either way.
---
Well, no. It's a pretty straight shot from the island to the mainland. You could beat it more regularly if you have water walking or aquatic form, but for most players, they're better off taking the boat, unless you know that is recently left (maybe you saw it on the FP in).
---
Happened to me when crafting an epic item for someone, made me go into a panic. What happens is 2 items somehow got put in the same slot in your bags. A relog fixed it, no need to restart the game or disable addons.
---
xrealm BGs are happening, has been said since the start. Also horde will be inside the BGs meaning less in the open world. If you are leveling it's irrelevant how many of your faction there is as you are killed on sight by other faction regardless and it's not like your faction gives a shit to protect you.
---
But you don't understand how that isn't a faction imbalance problem rather than server pop?
---
If it was simply a server pop issue, hen your people could go out and handle them and whatever happens happens.  The reason it's a faction imbalance is because the horde has no reason to congregate until enough alliance show themselves.  If it wasn't an issue due to faction imbalance, horde couldn't just stand out everywhere without running the risk of being counter mobbed.  There is no fear of them every being outnumbered so they do this.
---
The only thing lowering the pop does is lower the size of the groups of horde who would be doing this.  There would be less alliance so why would they care about being in smaller groups since there is less chance of an alliance group that size as well?
---
Unfortunately has a dude with a rat tail running the place. That pretty much sums it up.
---
Class was already mentioned when he said he soloed and achieved more than rank 2
---
How much is an insane amount? And how have you made it all? Just curious.
---
I kill everything, and bubble-hearth while /laughing when things don’t shake out in my favor.
---
Naxx will be cleared within 2 hours after launch.
---
This comment was so unnecessarily condescending lol

This is just objectively false (going TO the mainland). Except maybe if you have aquatic form or some other speed boost while swimming.

Arms?

Charge&gt;ss&gt;zerk rage&gt;bloodrage&gt;ww&gt;def stance&gt;demoshout&gt;tab revenge/sunder
---
Make macros for taunt/mocking blow and get used to using them quickly if you drop aggro on a mob. Switching to battle stance and pooling rage before the end of a mob pack will make your next opener a lot smoother.
---
This is what we all wanted from classic WoW I thought XD

Suicide kings destroy guilds.  Ive seen it so many times.  Leave now

---
Thunder claps is around 170 threat per mob hit, demo whilst in defensive is about 56 but touches every mob. Thunder is more for mitigation as others have mentioned. 
---
I see a lot of people mentioning sweeping strikes plus WW. That sounds some what inefficient for me, having enough rage to drop 30 on SS, switching to berserker and having to use 25 to WW, then you hit 4 mobs twice for weapon damage. Lets say you have Mirah's song which is BiS for a lot of people before ironfoe or Quel'serrar. Mirah has damage of  57 - 87  so average is 72. Two hits would be 144 total damage however you are in berserker stance so threat is reduced by 20%. This means all that work and you only manage to drop 115 threat on 4 mobs.
---
If you just use battle shout whilst in defensive and only you and 1 other person gets buff then the threat generated would be 143 total. If entire party gets buff then threat generated is 358 on all mobs. It is a lot less work and a lot more rage.
---
EZ thro dynamite 2 which you do not need to be an engineer to use will put 325 threat on every mob if used whilst in defensive without using any rage. If an engineer then you can use dense dynamite.
---
Nobody complained about the other early updates? Everyone was bitching about DM and made it out like they'd release Naxx by December or something like that.
---
Would I be wrong in saying the majority of players still don’t have a level 60? It’s weird coming places like this and everyone acts like everyone was 60 by the end of the first month. Meanwhile I feel like I play a lot and I’m still not 60...
---
I cleared every mc with our guild so far. Mageblade never drops, it's insane. 2 times the staff tho, didn't have enough dkp for it.
---
Yo nothing specific as others have and will mention which zones to go to, but just a heads up that the higher you get the more you *should-ish* be moving between several different zones. This is because the level discrepancy can make a big difference and you'll notice some you'll get a few quests around your level but some 3+ levels higher - which especially as a rogue you should be doing quests and mobs your level or lower.
---
Edit: I should add that around your level I bounced around between STV, Tanaris, arathi(?), Badlands, and I think feralas has a few early 40 quests. Point being, one area doesn't always equate to x amount of levels
---
why does coming have two m's?
---
I believe you can set it in the Target Markers tab of the keybinds menu.
---
Yep and this is the point I'm trying to illustrate.  Hillsbrad PVP in a raid is great for farming HKs, but terrible for honor.
---
&gt; The queue times for the dominant faction will be *tremendous*
---
What is that saying that the dominant factions are fond of saying as they zerg the less popular factions in the open world, *”they signed up for it”*? 
---
Yeah, that seems like it should be a thing here as well.
---
Horde always have faction control in PvP, nothing you can do about that. You can however control the size of the servers to not reach critical density, as we have now.
---
Yes, less overall people means less camped areas.
---
You don't have to believe me though, just wait for BGs to drop in three weeks and nothing changed with wPvP. Remember my post.
---
Right on the movie, not on the lore, they only go after healthy people in WWZ, hence why protagonist man gives himself the flu or whatever near the end to escape
---
Edit: kid in gif has the cancer, so he’s safe
---
You dont need plaguebats in your duels to become better.
---
Most people do duels to get better at their class without dying and running for 5minutes.
---
In areas like BRM oder Burning Steppes you almost never have mobs interferring in your fights.
---
I also can demoshout a rogue out of combat, pop blood rage, intercept them and crit them with 1500damage autoattacks with my big 2hander. I can do this a thousand times and I wont get better at my class one bit. On the contrary rogues will simply stop duelling me, so I lost my partner I can train with to get better.
---
If you fullforce KO your sparring partners in boxing without a care in the world, guess what? They will stop sparring with you.
---
i know that, im just asking for the 5-6 times, thats all.  
---
Thanks for the link btw, good to know.
---
This idiotic mentality that absolutely anything goes is exactly why I stopped playing with all you 14-year-olds on PvP servers. "haha, I'm an asshole" tends to stop being funny once you mentally mature past your 20s.
---
Yes, now everybody wants to be that sociopath that camps lowbies in Redridge for 18 hours a day for their 20 minutes of notoriety.
---
Confirmed - was a gnome lock. We have the same friend :)
---
First tip is to hotkey a few of the symbol icons.  Skull, X, Square, Moon, etc. etc.  Personally, I use the F1-F8 keys for them.  At the very least mark the skull and X to establish priority on kills.  This allows you to establish priority on your targets and abilities as well.  Mark them during the downtime of the healer/caster mana.
---
For the actual pull if you can charge, start with berserker rage, charge, sweeping strikes, berserker stance, bloodrage, whirlwind, defensive stance, then sunder away.
---
If you can't charge, you'll probably LoS pull so start in berserker stance, ranged pull, wait til mobs get close, then berserker rage, bloodrage, whirlwind, defensive stance.
---
You can also pool your rage towards the end of a pull in battle stance to get enough to activate sweeping strikes before the next pull.
---
Theirs meters that show how you die too, god knows what else other obscure add on's as well.
---
Blizzard giving into vocal minorities and ruining WoW.  Where have I heard this one before?

I had a frostwolf on my first account which I no longer have access to, I cannot WAIT to get it again :)

Advanced meme technology
---
So I have 2 friends with horde tattoo who are die hard PVP fans. They have to choose between switching to ally or playing pve cause your mad to many people are killing you?
---
My plan is the slow grind to rank 7, which can be done without too much effort, then push for r9 or r10 and never step foot in there again after i've goten my blues.
---
Nah they just need them on the dock near the entrance like the boats in BB/Ratchet.

I never kill lowbies even though i got gankes by 60s countless times when i was 40. I usually just tease them and have fun with em. Before p2 i was farming some turtles at tanaris for leather. There was this 46 hunter doing the same. I didint mind but when he stole my mob  I didint still want to kill him. I just wore my gnomish mc cap and took him as a buddy. Then we went swimming underwater and I started using my entangling roots until he drowned.
---
Tldr: i dont kill lowbies, but I make them suffer
---
I used to have a blog. I posted something similar there one day, and I woke up to a dozen messages from people who said they had lost someone and one person said they were probably mere hours from killing themselves after losing their child and that reading my story gave them courage to live another day. That's all we ever have, one day at a time. I'm glad today was another day for you &lt;3
---
It would be awesome if Blizz introduce it.
---
It's only 800g after the honor discount anyways.
---
I agree. The people acting superior over a made up number (6 weeks when it was actually 61 days) are indeed stupid. Grats!
---
I personally hoped it would! 
---
Guess it’s not to be. I stopped playing in 2012 A’s retail sucked. No issue stopping Subbing again if classic is rushed and dies within a year.
---
The warlocks and mages in your raid probably won't be very happy, that's all I'll say.
---
Pro tip: you can turn off channel invites in settings.
---
Yea it s bad. They need to fill up the raid. Pug it if you have to, doesn t matter if the loot goes to outsiders. People come and go.
---
I'd prob change the guild, unless I have close friends inside.
---
Stating  clearly beforehand that items are reserved isn’t toxic, you weirdo
---
To be fair, even Naxx on private servers was extremely difficult. And you need a certain amount of warrior tanks with 4 piece set bonus to kill 4 horsemen.
---
Yes, I did know this but have yet to sort it out. Thanks for the reminder 👍
---
There are also plenty of "hardcore" guilds on smaller servers. There is no evidence to suggest that a larger percentage of the players on bigger servers play more hours relative to the server's size. If you have any evidence that suggests that though, please share it.
---
What’s sad marketing?
---
How and why is horde FOTM? Alliance have pallys which are fucking broken in PVP and racials that are arguably the best pvp racials in the game. Honestly I'm more dissapointed than anything, step up your game ally
---
Actually, people were saying Naxx would be released by summer, which isn't far fetched at all.
---
Why wouldn't they add 10 more people to the raid instead if they're struggling with 30? That would add a hell of a lot more dps than some SP flasks. Not to mention you don't need the flasks at all, just some half decent gear. If the GM doesn't understand that, I would run.
---
The queues definitely increased after the most recent layer removal. Also, with regards to this:
---
&gt; Server now is HUGE, there are maybe 100 guilds doing full MC and ONY, and there are about 10 Ony and MC pugs A DAY. Jesus christ, on my vanilla server there was only 2-4 big guilds who even had the people to run MC, and yes it was a full server.
---
In mid-late Vanilla (2006-ish) I remember most people in-game were not 60 yet. In Classic, it seems that's almost reversed completely. I wouldn't be surprised if that's what's generating this "feeling" of the larger server. Again, there is no solid proof that layers today have larger concurrent player caps than servers in 2006.
---
Prob about 5 or 6 and had help the final time. Cleared it while dead 😂😂💀💀
---
Utah has some amazing landscapes used in movies and video games. Thousand Needles is also likely based on Grand Canyon / red rock cliffs around the American southwest, with Lake Powell inspiring the filling it up with water after Cataclysm.
---
And I'm asking what the heck people are doing that it takes anything more than 10-15 minutes from dropping Onyxia to being inside MC ready to pull trash, and more importantly, why people are okay with that kind of time management.
---
Wait till you're 48+ and actually worth honor to 60s.
---
lolol thanks for emphasizing you aren't attacking me. :P 
---
That's honestly just a shitty situation to be in. But like I read on another comment in this thread, is it fair to punish an entire faction of 10,000 horde with a 3-4hr queue time just for wanting to log on and level your 15 toon? Not everyone is camping. In the end either way someone loses is my point. The only solution is to reroll, or for Blizz to balance servers like they did on live servers which people also don't want.
---
At the end of the day there's an argument for both sides and we're asking Blizz to make everything a perfect world, with no changes, except some, when we don't even ask that of ourselves in our real lives.
---
Sure, but the problem people are referring to is games where they get camped well beyond being worth honour. A couple of GY wipes isn't really noticeable when it can just be done in the time it takes their 9k hp tank to walk across the map
---
It's not the old version.  It's the new, zerg version.
---
-Conserve rage between pulls so that you can open up with plenty of threat generators. If the mob(s) are almost dead, you really don't need to worry about keeping aggro on them
---
-If there's only 1 mob up, you can just autoattack it to build rage and keep your finger on the taunt button for if/when dps pulls aggro
---
-Druid can start a pull with starfire / moonfire for extra threat if you don't have any rage
---
-Don't use swipe, just tab-maul. Swipe's threat is garbage.
---
-Feral Faerie Fire generates a decent amount of threat, so macro it to Maul and use it on cooldown. Often times I found that I could hold threat with just autoattacks + FF, very good for building rage
---
No consequences for dying in WSG? It's a small bg, every death means a lot, especially if you're fcing or helping to fc.
---
"I'm going to play PVP because I'm a *real gamer*!"
---
"I keep getting killed by the enemy! This game is unplayable and it's all Blizzard's fault!"
---
They won't be, especially AV. Enjoy getting your AV rep ;&gt;
---
Duels are about getting good in wPvP for most people. You can be a one-trick-pony able to take out a warrior every 10mins or you hone your skills in duels.The world isnt black and white. Sitting ontop of you and casting AE or demoshout is shitty and unsportsmanlike.
---
Blowing every single CD on one person is like popping recklessness as warrior. Yes, you will win every single duel with this combo, but you wont get good at the game by doing so.
---
Any half decent rogue can kill a warrior in a sap/stun/blind rotation with 2 sprints, 2blinds, 2 everything.
---
A good rogue will try to use as few big CD abilities as possible to preserve them for a future fight. This is also part of becoming good. Not using every ability you have in every fight.
---
The duel tournament is the best example. These duelers can't win duel number 2 and 3 in a best of 5 if they blow their CDs immedaitely in the first duel.
---
That's why I prefer doing best of 5 against rogues when I'm practicing to see if they can nuke me even in duel 2, 3, 4 and 5 and then get advise by them if they still reck me without or very little CDs.
---
Because you don't have blind, gouge or vanish or any engineering tools.  
---
    
---
Pls.
---
Leave druids alone
---
Dance with moonkins
---
Kill all gnomes on sight
---
The raid HKs took less time though. This isn't a comparison of time spent, so its not a good one.
---
A rogue wearing plate with Mortal Strike? Sounds pretty awesome to me. Quite good for Arathi Basin.
---
On the beta when we were locked to level 58 games were finishing in 20-25mins.
---
Being 60 with MC gear fast games will be the norm.
---
Got to 43 last night!
---
and its those same "vocal minorites" who you would 100% lose subs with inaction,hell i wouldnt be surprised if you'd lose subs on people who arent complaining. my point is still relevant.
---
as i said above,blizzard is a business first and fortmost,if it keeps the money flow they'd have phase 6 by new years eve!...mind u this is just sarcasm because blizzard will be on holiday break in about 3-4 weeks for the remainder of 2019 but u get the point im trying to make.
---
Until we all cry on the forums and they change things to suit us.
---
Really the only thing you'll ever make any decent cash off of is devilsaur or skinning The Beast and getting a pristine hide.
---
God willing.
---
 The horde aren’t too bright on Deviate Delight either. Spent the better part of last night going back and forth between the two entrances of Kargath to kill the same three zugs.
---
&gt; I never kill lowbies
---
&gt; *Proceeds to tell story of killing a lowbie*
---
I have it and it’s great! I guess I got too used to the lowbie zones having a million level appropriate quests available at the same time. Now that I’m starting to bounce around, I feel lost only having one or two quests per zone!
---
People still play classic? I remember liking it in 2004 lmao
---
Because otherwise Horde are camping it 24/7 (at least on Grobb). Would you prefer the term counter-camp, or defend? It's all the same thing - you sit in the same area for extended periods of time and kill any enemies you see there.
---
Yeah, most of my groups fail to make it to the dungeon, and there’s been a noticeable reduction in instance attempts Particularly the BRM instances. 
---
I don’t know how much longer I’ll do it either.
---
And not a mention of keyrings :(
---
&gt; I've never had a problem getting my lvl 40 mount due to skinning.
---
Sounds more like you're just good at managing your gold, then. Skinning is not a significant amount of gold at all. Even things like Heavy Leather only vendor for like 30s / stack. 30 silver for killing ~25 mobs (not 100% drop rate) is really low around that level.
---
&gt; Faction balance isn't an option so your argument is invalid.
---
We weren't discussing solutions, we were discussing the problem.  Faction Balance is absolutely the problem.  The fact that there isn't a good solution does no make the point invalid.
---
&gt;Imbalance also existed in Vanilla and the issue wasn't this bad so that defeats your point.
---
The issue wasn't as bad in Vanilla because there weren't people gung ho about trying to reach rank 14 on the absolute first day the honor system released.  There also wasn't this high of a percentage of server populations sitting in Cities with fuck all else to do 3 months into the game.  The part is once again, not a server size issue but a player base issue.  Players approach the game dramatically different than they did when vanilla was live.
---
&gt;A valid argument is that the population size is the problem, as servers are 4-10x larger than they were in Vanilla. And when you add more players with limited supply you create scarcity and overpopulation. Which is why Ally are camped everywhere now compared to 2005.
---
Alliance are camped across the board because they do not have the numbers to fight back and prevent their deaths and being camped.  The server population does not matter.  you can't camp 50k alliance in Stormwind with 50k Horde if they are equal in gear/level/skill.  You can camp 10k Alliance with 50k Horde even if they are equal.  You can also camp 100 Alliance with 500 Horde.
---
If you took the time to actually understand the issue instead of parroting the crap you've read because you want someone to blame who isn't the playerbase then you would understand.
---
I never mentioned balance, I meant that they aren’t well designed.
---
To do what you want they'd have to majorly tweak the entire system all over again which is what they did in what? Wotlk? 
---
Programming isn't as simple as ppl think, just like ppl who ask for 2v2 on magic arena online, maybe the infrastructure wasnt designed that way, idk it can be a million things usually though it comes down to infrastructure. 
---
What I do know is it's never something so simple as split the logs for alliance and horde, maybe thatd mean they have to have a whole another server dedicated just for faction logs instead of 1 for all. Or it could be spaghetti code, or it could be a hundred different other things on how they designed the damn thing, idk I haven't looked at it.
---
The same reason we dont care about ppl bitching about an addon that a fraction of a fraction of the population uses.
---
There is no book spawn near zevrim, From what i've found is some private servers have a zevrim book, but that is not the case in classic.
---
It's better than p5 loot for many specs as well.
---
Mmh, you may be right. For some reason I remember the 12th, probably due to it being a tuesday and those are usually when things are released.
---
I'd start clearing without them, you don't need 40 people to do MC or Onyxia.  Unless it's your MT who's consistently late, in which case I'd sit down and have a talk with him about why he has no respect for 39 other people's time.  Then yeah, probably kick him if he just can't get his shit together and find a tank who actually respects my guildmates time and is capable of consistently showing up on time.
---
You should not have any problems taking Wetlands boat. Get on the one to ashenvale or ghost walk from dustwallow to rez off the boat. 
---
Blasted Lands is a great zone. Low competition there.
---
Between elemental shaman and hunter, what would be the better choice for someone that wants to focus solely on PvP and does not have the time to commit to a consistent raid schedule? I'm not sure how gear dependent either class ends up being. I'm mainly interested in BG's but also roaming around for wPVP and duels for fun. Realistically, I could see myself grinding out the blue PvP set but probably won't rank much higher than that, so not sure where that would put me in terms of competitiveness with raiders in a PvP setting for either class.
---
Any advice is appreciated!
---
A raid struggling to kill Rag is usually due to one of these reasons:
---
1. Too many melee dps died because of not running away during Wrath of Ragnaros before they are hit, resulting in overall lower raid dps.
---
2. Not enough people using GFPP/pots/damage absorbing abilities to survive Hand of Ragnaros, or poor stacking positions causing too many to take damage from it
---
3. Not collapsing into a single spot when Rag submerges, causing Sons of Flame to scatter around killing people or making them go OOM (which will result in a wipe anyways).
---
My guild's first Rag clear took 5min30s because most of us were wearing a mix of blue/green items. It should be expected that Rag will submerge at least once when most of the raid are poorly geared. A proper collapse + frost nova can easily allow the Sons to be cleaned up with AOEs within 10 seconds. Then mana users can use pots to get back into the fight when Rag emerges.
---
Requiring flasks to down Rag is absolutely ridiculous and a guild that does this isn't worth committing to. They need to first fill the entire 40-man roster and have everyone do some dungeon grinds to collect better gear. Elixirs can be a substitute if some extra damage is needed.
---
Awesome. Hope lunch was ok. But what's that got to do with anything..
---
Fair
---
Im pretty sure water took the honor
---
Transmog by spring
---
Threat reduction is useful when healing for offspec tanks, any main tank should be able to keep aggro off you. I would definitely grab insect swarm, it's very nice to have for pvp and it costs very little Mana so you can throw it up in dungeons.
---
I have a friend who lost both her parents by the time we were 22. She once told me recently she's surprised I'm still alive and somehow not on drugs (she's prescription dependent and drinks often). I told her... "Escapism comes in differen't forms... And mine only costs $15 bucks a month!"  
---
Seriously though, having friends to talk to/play with everyday helps, a lot, whether you're an escapist or not! :)
---
Once again a result of the community asking for something and not really knowing what is best for itself.
---
Google is crazy powerful
---
Thanks for taking the time to learn to tank well. Appreciate that bro. Keep it up.
---
Sincerely,
---
Your healer :)
---
I think it's a fine practice if you are building the group yourself.  But it's just really HARD to find people that are willing to go.
---
Mostly everyone doing a jed/rend run is looking for either Reed, or Dal'Rend MH.  So go ahead and reserve something like Reed, but good luck finding a healer that's gonna come along for the run.
---
Players who tryhard get punished.  There is no incentive to use consumables or get better because joeschmo can just walk in next week and pickup loot if its his turn.  Tryhard player sees  joeschmos get loot over him week by week.  Tryhard player leaves.  Your guild is now populated with bad players with good gear.  New players have to wait weeks for upgrades.  More apathy, no reason to help guildies, imo.
---
I mean yeah Warriors can still be good in 1v1 situation, but that MS effect is put to better use trying to kill a flag carrier or the healers in a skirmish.
---
Yeah it does, should keep that up on mobs but they patched the spamming thing people did right when classic released so it’s not as OP.
---
You can't get way better honor in BGs.
---
* You run into Premades
---
* You share honor with your entire team
---
* You face heavy diminishing returns because you're playing vs the same people.
---
Nothing is going to change in wPvP one bit, except there will be even less Alliance death squads because they will all now be in premade BGs, as it will be easier for them than getting wiped every few minutes and having to reform.
---
Reroll, it's literally all you can do, they won't allow you to transfer off dead realms, only transfer to in hope that it fixes the population.
---
unless your a horde char right now(current faction transfers on high pop realms are making alliance stuck) either reroll or wait for paid server transfers hopefully early next year. cause right now,thats all u get.
---
Rules? - Rogue
---
Hahahahahahaha LEAVE
---
Only in the short term.  If these tactics worked long term then BFA would have been the most popular expansion ever instead of least popular ever.  Until classic they've been bleeding subs since wrath.  Now they are going down the same path.
---
It's funny because on my server grobb, ally was bragging about killing thrall and cairne and saying "step it up horde" and how they were coordinated huge pvp raids, etc then P2 hit... oh how the cat became the mouse.
---
Only idiots mindblast in dungeons.
---
The data is showing that theres literally noone playing right now, and that horde and alliance population is similar.
---
This is why it will get worse. The 60s will stay in BGs for alliance. The horde won't. The non-60s still need to level.
---
Good luck.
---
There's a connection fucking retail is souless where everyone might as well be an NPC.
---
Nice 11380 crit on that thumbnail.
---
:) Thank you for reading and appreciating. I figured I was going out on a limb putting this here, but I didn't know where else to put it, until someone shared  [r/WholesomeWoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WholesomeWoW/) ... I figured someone out there would resonate with this! &lt;3
---
Its going to back to be phase one levels of WPvP, ganking randoms and not fighting groups.
---
I'm assuming this is for a new character you are starting. For the 3 servers that I play on while leveling it seems as though DPS are the hardest to find in my opinion. I believe this is because of everyone's alts being a tank or healer to fill in the lack of. Obviously druid can play all 3 of these and is a very fun class to play as.
---
I wonder if you have source on that.
---
With that mentality, your faction will suddenly have 0 competition and you lose on PVP since you'll be in a dead server, with 100% Horde and 0% Alliance. You need to empower the Alliance so you actually have PVP to look forward to, instead of nobody left.
---
Just hit 40 on my warlock, leveling affliction/drain tank. Picked up Dark Pact. Are there any must have talents from Destruction or Demo I should go for? 
---
I had planned to grab 5/5 demonic embrace next.
---
Thanks for the advice, 24/76 server now btw
---
I dont know guys if you ever feel what is like to be in orgrimmar  looking for mage and put /who mage and find out there is none for you to make water.
---
There is no fp in senjin though.....why do you lie?
---
lol read my other comment
---
But I'm full tier 1 already! Why the fuck isn't BWL coming out sooner?!?! This is bullshit. Stupid broken dead game.
---
You regretting naming your character "Parts" ?
---
Reeee
---
You don't have to fight orcs if you play as an orc!
---
IMO me rolling on Rend with a Rogue like the one I mentioned is similar to you joining a guild as a trial with green gear and zero knowledge of boss fights then demanding to be able to roll on loot against all the veteran members.  
---
The party reserving orbs to sell them though is kind of shitty. I would only ever reserve an item i really need
---
Oh to be back in the era where people knew nothing...
---
Can you share instructions on how to do a solo Mol'dar run? I'm about to hit 60 and that sounds like a good way to get the Sublime Wristguards.
---
Yeah  if I'm running with an actual tank specd class it's usually fine. But when you  get an arms warrior that just tanks because no one else wants to, it can be a struggle.
---
Yeah well people on reddit have been pretty much 100% consistently wrong about everything since time began including everything about WoW classic.
---
You can check my posts I told people wPvP would be a disaster before it happened. I'm not asking you to believe me though I'm explaining logically why it's not going to get better. You can come to your own conclusions and I suggest that you do.
---
It’s an instance entrance... You can’t kill a portal
---
I have the name Jenkins on my server. Waiting to run into Leeroy.
---
Everyone in my guild said no way they would release it that early
---
Look at that, already 0.5 sec after ressing the Horde has him pinned down. Spy needs to go, man. Such a bs AddOn.
---
We can't even sell the damn leafs
---
Having a paladin on your side is the strongest way to deal with CC.  A healer that can't be focused down, and has 12 seconds of free time to cure CC and spam mana efficient fast heals to your group.
---
I'm out of the loop...how did Blizzard balance the live (retail?) servers?
---
Agree that queue won't fix anything except create outrage for those stuck in an artificial queue. It cannot be fixed with transfers either unless they break with the restriction of pvp -&gt; pvp only. Pve Alliance needs to be allowed to move to pvp alliance. Or allow Horde PvP -&gt; Alliance PvP.
---
That’s going to be the fun part :)
---
But then people who rolled on a PVP server and wanted to do World PVP are now not able to do it. You only have to be steamrolled so many times trying to get into BRM before you "toggle off" PVP on a PVE server and avoid the chaos.
---
Maybe once Phase 6 has been out for 2 months they'll grace us with a patch
---
Alliance should have no queue on Skeram. 
---
To think that I have to sit a fucking queue to get into a server where i'm getting ran down by a raid everywhere I go is insane and will cause people to leave.
---
Kind of hard to play the game for 2 years when all content is released in 1 and then everyone calls it there.  It's not about the pace I'm doing things, it's about the pace of the game ending.  Ever play Monopoly?  Ever play the short version of Monopoly where you pass out all of the deeds randomly at the start?  You still move around the board at the same pace, except the game time is way shorter.  I would prefer if that was not the case.
---
There is no evidence that it works like you suggest either, this is purely theory. So either share some of your own "evidence" or discuss like a normal person
---
My comment is based on my own experience, it's much easier and more tempting to no life when you have other no lifers to play with . I would be very surprised to see anyone say different to this.
---
I saw 3 flagged horde on the way to 60, and so far I’ve witnessed one failed raid on Ironforge.  Pagle horde are just too outnumbered I think.  They don’t want to fight.
---
It's great for an initial burst of threat or for aoe tanking. It's worth crafting if you want to optimize your character. You won't have it on the whole time.
---
Do we get the Key Ring before TBC?!?
---
Alliance can't run ulda? It's just a drop from one of the Vikings.
---
But it's not decent honor though. You share it with a load of people and with the honor decay per subsequent kills, it's not even worth the effort, honor-wise
---
While leveling up as a feral tank Druid I went for the ZF helm a solid 50 times, that's 50 times fully running ZF, when it finally did drop it lasted until well into my 60.
---
Umm, so did I.  It's fucking easy.
---
I remember back in 2007 it was very rare to run into a premade, because it required teamspeak or vent etc, and took a lot of work. Fast forward and everyone has discord, I think you will see a lot of premades vs premades and the games will actually be amazing.
---
i expected at a minimum enough time for people to just hit rank 14 before bwl
---
so like at least 3 or 4 months of p2
---
tbh i can see why they are doing it early but i hope they leave it p3 for a very extended period
---
there is a lot of great gear in bwl and it will take fucking ages to bwl gear 40 people
---
not to mentiom tier 2 and the gear in bwl stays good until the end of wow, i pretty much want every slow on my character bwl gear and a good chunk of people will want that same gear
---
Hey, my name is dany on your server. I’m a 60 lock and I can probably help you with some things or come to your defense bc you’re about to get to the get fucked zones. You’re about to be a target worth killing. Good luck!! Feel free to whisper me.
---
Thanks everyone I don’t know how I missed the throw ability!!!
---
Alts are fun, I have several, but like others have stated, pick one as your main. I have my alts basically for when I need a break from my main and to let him get some rested xp to make the slog less time consuming. Also suggest traveling to other areas. Arathi and Alterac are much more fun and pleasant to be in than Desolace.
---
bUt tHaTs nOt ThE aUtHeNtIc cLaSsIc ExPErIeNcE!
---
How dare you roll a PvE server and ruin the Classic experience for yourself. Sure the servers are 4x the capacity of vanilla and faction imbalanced  - but the experience!
---
So Classic has been pretty fun while it lasted, but I find it a bit harder to play with all of my other hobbies and obligations. I'm probably going to take a break come resub time against better judgment.
---
But before going I wanted to draw my troll shaman Lazurite. I really liked the trolls as a race and I think they're pretty cool. I still don't quite understand their anatomy, but I had fun drawing this regardless.
---
I also rolled on a PVP server to play PVP. But here I am playing walking simulator across zones. My point is that there are going to be problems no matter the solution. Transfers aren't necessarily the right fix. But doing nothing and telling people with 20+ days invested in one server to roll on another server is not anywhere near a solution; that's my point.
---
Yeah. "Scout Parts" just sounds stupid.
---
My alt warrior is in Bunnings Warehouse on Yojamba
---
Maybe. But it definitely made them salty!
---
That is by design and not a bug.
---
schadenfreude ? Are you blaming horde players for this? This sucks for us too. Faction imbalance is awful for both sides. I'm not saying its worse for Horde because its not. But I am really sad that my server isn't 50/50.
---
have the alliance tried not sucking ass
---
They'll continue to rush out content to cater for the crybabies...
---
No, I don't think it's fair, but providing the majority faction with the ability to transfer off to another realm while they are queued (while still not fair) is better for the overall health of the server in the long run. 
---
What is currently going on with servers right now is only going to lead to a mass exodus which will kill the "pvp" even further. 
---
According to wowclassicpopulation.com, there's actually more Alliance players than Horde players, so it shouldn't be completely impossible to allocate players to other servers with free transfers. 
---
Granted, the website likely isn't 100% accurate, but it's the only numbers we have to go off at this point.
---
Yep. From what I hear an Alliance Pug killed Azuregos 2nd on Herod because it spawned on like 5:30AM. IDK if it was Alliance but it was for sure a pug
---
I know how complicated systems can be.  I help maintain an entire tech stack of client web applications, mobile applications, node server applications, grpc microservices, authentication servers, etc.
---
I never once said it was a simple thing to do.  I'm simply pushing back against the people that seem to think there is absolutely no way to break Spy without breaking other add-ons.  If you remove the data that spy leverages, in this case, the broadcast messages of enemy players within a certain distance, then you can effectively break Spy and keep damage/threat meters working.
---
I'm not saying it's simple, as I don't know their codebase. But I do know Spy obviously runs off of information from their game client logs.  And it that information isn't there anymore, then Spy very clearly wouldn't function. I'm just pushing back against those that seem to think it's an impossible task.
---
Most learning tanks fall into the rend trap
---
Rend is your worst tanking ability, take it off your bars
---
Your most powerful tanking ability is marking a skull, an x, and a moon.  Skull tells dps kill this first.  X is second.  Moon gets cc'ed. 
---
Now your job is to put some big threat on skull, and mild threat on all.  Start from there and it'll get way easier.
---
Also try to keep as much rage as possible.  Don't be afraid of bloodrage selfharm.  Don't be afraid to stance dance into berserk for a second to pop off your berserker rage.
---
After not getting a hoj drop in BRD our tank said, "Sorry guys, my guild lost their tank for brd and I gotta help them."
---
I then warned my guildy also looking for a tank for BRD so they don't get abandoned too.
---
After we made it clear we were trying to get deeper in the dungeon.
---
Well we ended up 4-manning with my shammy tank up to the key and getting MC attuned. I also managed 2 pieces of mail gear
---
On my server (Earthfury) Alliance camp the zeppelins too. It’s pretty even.
---
However what’s annoying is that Wetlands is a contested zone so all Alliance players traveling via Menethil Harbor are automatically flagged. Durotar and Tirisfal are Horde-controlled zones and thus players aren’t automatically flagged. Pretty lame loophole.
---
However at least Grom’gol is in a contested zone. Alliance raids Grom’gol with some frequency.
---
Horde definitely love to hang out in Menethil but there’s always a healthy Alliance presence there to keep them in check. I personally have yet to die on a boat on any of my toons.
---
I'm on a lower pop realm and I see herbs (without herbalism) pretty frequently.
---
Yes.
---
Or the converse of PvE to PvP with both options restricted by faction. Alliance PvE to Alliance PvP for example.
---
No we didn't know it would be like this. I played Vanilla extensively pvp and there were some rough nights especially around new patches or known raid nights. I never played private servers and didn't know the server population difference between Vanilla and Classic was going to be so pronounced. Seeing, even on the alliance side multiple huge guilds was a rare thing in Vanilla.
---
Little late to this, but wanted to ask this quest before making my own thread. 
---
I have two healers above level 40, and with BG's coming soon, I wanted to try and fast track one of them to level 60 to be my dedicated BG/PvP healer.
---
Taking away anything that can be seen as subjective, like how fun a play style is, is there a clear winner between Holy Paladin and Priest (be it holy or disc) when it comes to overall general performance and ability to adapt to situations?
---
I have zero Classic/Vanilla BG experience aside from after TBC pre-patch, which well, of course does not count.
---
Why click the portrait when you can make a macro?
---
lul
---
Yes but not much.  It's very useful for putting yourself on every mobs threat table though.
---
eh between kidney shot, cheap shot, gouge, prep, vanish, there is no a reason a clothe or leather wearer should outlast like 12-15 seconds. 
---
Mail and plate get a bit more challenging.
---
What's a quint?
---
Does that actually LOS rdps?
---
lmao tru
---
I literally dont know why people are surprised that people who play WoW dont know about EQ. As someone who joined WoW in fucking legion in 2017 I have no idea what the game was like back then, and considering I was 3-4 when EQ came out and around 7-8 (I think) when WoW came out you can see why some people wont know some things from it
---
I went 31/20 disc/holy at around lvl 56. Its a fun spec that allows both good healing and decent single target damage. Its good for pvp too. You will miss some healing power from the holy tree though.
---
Could this also have to do with the queues coming back?
---
I had to do strat 6-7 times for stitchings to make the chest piece for warriors that sucked. Took me 17 times for lbrs key. I run dungeons daily but I’m usually chasing others gear as I’m a prot warrior with way to much /played.
---
Sure, except that the other people joining the group are now more likely to be clothies who don’t need rends swords, indirectly giving you as a mage more competition for your own loot.
---
this drawing says DIO all over
---
Sapphiron is a roadblock
---
Demo roar is your friend. Also, using enrage and waiting for it to run out = no debuff and a bunch of rage, use when applicable.
---
Tell that to all the earthbiter earthshockin shammies too plz
---
What's the older logitech software called?
---
Currently a level 53 priest spec’d shadow. When is a good time to switch to holy and start spamming BRD for leveling purposes? Then what level to heal other 5 mans as holy spec?
---
You will get a warning first. If you continue then you can get banned. It's called safespotting.
---
I rerolled on a new server, so essentially we're in the same boat.
---
Plus, I would roll on pservers when they were in the ZG patch, it didn't mean much. I caught up in gear super fast because there's more raids and everyone already has some gear, so you get funnelled a lot of stuff people don't need anymore.
---
As alliance on a PVP server, I agree with you. Perhaps something could be done to make alliance easier, to encourage more numbers on their side. This is a bad idea, but if say every raid boss dropped one extra piece of gear, people would clamour over. Horde can brag they aren't playing EZ mode and there will be more alliance to balance the fold.
---
Maybe a modifier so that if you are outnumbered 2:1 on your server you get an exp gain bonus or gold / coins drops. Therlse are all bad ideas but that may help the situation.
---
Honestly, I just dont care much about winning or losing a bg. Its just quick and convenient to take a loss and move on to the next one. Especially in AB or AV where you still get some honor if you lose.
---
With open world content, losing means getting farmed when you rez and having to find another place to fight. That takes much more time and effort.
---
Bangthok sash took probably 50 runs, i know noob numbers. Hands of power are gaining on that though.
---
Hmm. Orbitals? It’s been awhile lol
---
Alliance is really outnumbered on Firemaw
---
Might be 60/40
---
&gt; flight path in Sen'jin.
---
What?
---
That's why I'm running brd so much my warrior tanked all my prebis gear up runs.
---
RestPlus, friend :)
---
Umm, Classic came out?  What else is there to count down?
---
It was originally going to be the 12th, to coincide with collapsing all the layers down to one. They decided to separate those two events and release honor on the 14th instead, presumably to help them prepare for the large world pvp battles that would ensue.
---
Kind of shows you the state of the gaming industry in 2019 hey?
---
Don’t you have to visit a battlemaster NPC in your city to queue? So horde will have to do that, then travel to X zone to camp. 
---
Queue could pop for them at any time in between that, I think it will alleviate the issue a lot.
---
Nearly every single one of my friends who haven't reached lvl60 yet has stopped logging in since day 2 of honor system release. Day 1 mayhem was fun, and by day 2 it already became a hassle if not just unplayable.
---
quit then
---
Because people who claim it is bad, also claim to be in a "good" guild and think they know better than the members on how they should itemize their gear. We cleared through Naxx using a modified DKP system 15 years ago. I'm pretty sure our members and leaders were at least 51% competent.
---
It’s the same time from when honor was introduced is my point though.
---
Solo dm east drop runs, invis pot strat to save extra 5 mins. I do 1 run every 12 mins, 100-300 gold per hr depending on arcane crystal drops (55g each on my server).
---
Your “never-played-in-10hour-long-AV-battles” is showing!
---
Yeh knew I was gonna get shown this on Reddit when I saw the post. Guess blizzard was losing players
---
Premades are always going to be a problem even in cross realm.  I did the grind back in vanilla, your premade is for PUG stomping, if you get matched against another premade group you dodge.  We usually sent 1 person in first (lowest rank) to check if it was a PUG or a premade, then the rest of us would accept the que.  You cannot efficiently get rank 14 any other way, time and efficiency is very important in the grind.  If you aren't que dodging people on your faction will be and will outrank you.
---
&gt;and that if you play the game ~~2+~~ 6+ hours a night, there's no content  left to do anymore. I *really, honestly* took my time, played at my own *frenetic* pace, took a lot of *5 minute* breaks, and still hit level cap in a month of the game being out, much slower than a *proper* nolifer
---
fixed that for you
---
We're on like 10 weeks of MC clears and we've seen zero mageblades, zero talismans, zero rings of spellpower.
---
Meanwhile some of our raiders with alts do pug MCs and they've seen/won all of those items. One of our hunters won a Staff of Dom AND a Talisman last week in a pug on his Boomkin alt... LOL
---
Training
---
Lol what? Nah dude the horde are just trash quit making shit up.
---
Yeah you'll see the same honor pop up in game because it doesn't into account DR's until it's calculated. You'll have a much different number than your estimated honor.
---
Yeah it was actually:
---
2432 HKs
---
27469 Honor
---
225 Standing
---
Alliance Bigglesworth
---
Harder to fill pug spots on Monday also because a lot of pugs already filled in for other raids that went early week right after reset.  Leaving you with fresh 60's in greens on Monday, people's alts or just the super casual.
---
Teebus. Killed thousands of 61+ elites now. Sooner or later I shall find it
---
Under these conditions I believe this add on is breaking these rules.
---
What do you mean? I'm suggesting that instead of ending up in Tanaan Jungle as we'd expect to be, Blizzard spices up the storyline and the jungle has been burned down.
---
And that's fair too, but I never said it was a simple fix.
---
And that annoys me too...but what annoys me more is people that claim "impossible to do" when they have no idea of how the code functions.  And to be fair I don't know either.  But I know it's sure as shit blizzard is within the capabilities of breaking a simple addon that reads from log data events.
---
$25 IIRC, and it was definitely a thing in vanilla, but I’m not sure how long into vanilla they became available
---
They're fucking it all up again LUL
---
Aqua Quintessence, its an item you get after you finish the quest chain from a Water Elemental in Aszhara. You use them to douse the 8(?) runes in Molten Core to unlock Major Domo and Ragnaros. Honestly its pretty big being able to even just get Domo since he drops either the leaf for the hunter bow or the priest staff Benediction.
---
Prove it!
---
Yep prots rage economy is awesome.  11/x/3x for life
---
I played mage/lock @60 in vanilla. I didnt like mages bc I felt I was playing more or less the same thing. I thought about healer but then just decided I wanted a class without mana and lots of white damage to try.
---
Because they are a company and can do what ever the fuck they want?
---
2 mins for login screen queue since 2nd day after release of wow classic.  Rattlegore alliance.
---
My bad, I meant Shadowprey
---
I meant Shadowprey
---
I'd be down
---
For keeping Rage between trash pulls it's useful to kill the critters running around between the packs. For bosses you can do the pre-HoT as others have said and/or pre-Barkskin and even pre-armor potion as best fits the pull. 
---
Get a macro to put a skull on the main target. I haven't tested it but this one might work:
---
/script SetRaidTarget("target",8);
---
/cast Faerie Fire (Feral)
---
It should put up the Skull and also cast faerie fire. You want to cast FF pretty often. It's free threat. 
---
My other advice is to level Enchanting so you can get the Smoking Heart trinket ASAP. And in general when in bear form you don't have hands so gear with "on use" are extra valuable since you can actually use them in combat like everyone else. So items like the Gem-studded Leather Belt or the Gauntlets of the Sea have survivability gains that might be more important to you since you can't just drink a potion. (Though at those levels threat is likely much more of an issue.) This is something to keep in mind with trinkets. A lot of them have "on use" threat increases.
---
Really the other trinket you should get while leveling is the Mark of the Chosen from the Mauradon quest which is great for survivability *and* threat. Use that one full time and switch Smoking Heart out for threat trinkets in the other slot.
---
There’s been reddit post about it. Heavily downvoted of course because making the addon even easier lol
---
Didnt get a 2h yet. On the positive side it only took me 5 ubrs runs to get double dalrends
---
People like me ubsubbing en masse due to their servers being 5:1. Can't do a single thing in a single location. No reason to pay Blizz for that.
---
6 v 1 isn’t PvP you mongoloid.
---
Portal leads to Hellfire Peninsula lol, not Tanaan
---
It is
---
I made more running to dungeons and 1v1ing everyone I saw, than sitting in SS for hours. The big pvp battles are fun, but very inefficient for honor
---
Because they’re horde.
---
So you know what might be considered a bad time to try to run UBRS? The first week of P2 on a horde dominated server.
---
You are the minority, the idea that hundreds of people should have to watch the login screen for 2 hours just so you can do one specific dungeon is absurd. 
---
Here's an idea maybe roll out with a group of 10 and don't try to funnel in 1 by 1 to the single most popular pvp spot in the whole game. Also it takes 30 minutes top even getting camped I would know my group just did it 2 days ago.
---
... Prove it! :)
---
I love riding at a lowbie and watch them crap themselves before riding past laughing and ignoring them.
---
However, Alliance are quickly making me want to kill everyone on sight, especially the losers that engage when my life/mana is below 50% while I'm attacking a mob.
---
Well hopefully your guild is wise enough to have a seperate dkp table set up for bwl,  where mc dkp does not carry over.
---
I just think it would make an interesting plot twist :)
---
When do you think the prices will rise again? Cause i don't wanna sell my stuff now when everything is so cheap..
---
STV
---
I DON'T think my time is worth more than theirs. That's the simple concept you aren't getting still. My time is just as valuable as anyone else's which is why when a BoE drops, EVERYONE who put in the same amount of time gets a shot at it. Again you call my logic dumb, but it's at least internally consistent. Your logic is absolutely not, because you claim it's greedy to all split the winnings yet that's the opposite of what greed is.
---
Edit: Every single time I've run LBRS and the mage chest pattern has dropped, EVERYONE NEEDED. Why? Because regardless of how many mages are in the group, everyone's time is equal.
---
Pretty sure it's more than 5%
---
One of his irl friends who is in this run said that he was offered gold for raid wipe and its possible that other people got the same offer, that’s all.
---
Yeah, same here. The 60s are naturally much more vocal though.
---
To grind honor if you're into that. 
---
A lot of my friends that are in a similar spot to you (though you sound even a bit ahead of them) are being pulled in 10 directions right now. Farm gold? Farm prebis? Try to find an MC Pug? grind honor? And they don't have a lot of time to play..
---
I respecced away from SP recently and man do I hate it.
---
Lol then why was he even angry!!
---
Personally, I think not the asshole. Gave fair warning, (assuming) didn't bully the rest of the PUG with premade friends, productive team member, etc. Especially in this case it's a BOP item, not even a valuable BOP. I would say slightly rude expectation if it's a BOE, maybe someone would like to need it for an alt, but for BOP I feel like it matters very little.
---
Horde VERY rarely won BGs in vanilla, and you can’t have full premades for WSG. You’re about to experience the blessing of freedom effect.
---
I see no reason why Alliance would choose to stay on any of those larger shithole servers, personally.
---
Let the tryhards suffer with no one to kill in wpvp.
---
You have to over hire expensive staff for rollouts.... might as well get them out quickly
---
So why would they care lol. BWL being out means nothing for you.
---
25%
---
Mind linking your build? How’s the speed compare to shadow?
---
just stfu, nonne is complaining about some ganks, its the literal train from the FP to dungeon entrance and you know it. 
---
DoNt roLL Pvp GuIZe.....
---
Right.  My point is that there's nothing about the people that *play* horde that makes them more likely to do this type of behavior.   Alliance camp/grief just as much as horde, it just doesn't appear that way because PVP servers have more horde.
---
For what it's worth, this is all based on my experience too.  I've had to start leveling an alt because my 37 hunter is unplayable right now.  Max level alliance have been camping STV/Arathi/Badlands/Desolace on my server (and the ratio is still in favor of horde there)
---
Final note - I *love* when players my level(ish) engage in PVP.  That's fun.  That's why I joined a PVP server.  I also do not like max levels camping lower levels that don't give honor.
---
It's an addon that identifies healers in pvp and labels their nameplate with a huge '+' symbol that allows even the most inept of PuGs to tunnel-vision healers faster than anyone on their side can do anything about it. Regardless of what people think about fairness and optimal gameplay, the addon single-handedly made pvp very unpalateable for a large number of healer mains including myself.
---
That's a pretty good name suggestion!
---
Same here, I got like 2-3 hours tops a night to play. After p2 every FP and dungeon is camped. Just stopped playing this shit sucks so much
---
What is this a dlc playlist?
---
Nah people would hate it. The drop chance is a subtle and addictive form of gambling that is what this game is built upon. It's called intermittent reinforcement.
---
A more obvious example of this the random world blues and purples that can drop. I can still remember getting an epic sword in the thirties bracket and equipping it on my paladin. I was like 12. That's a strong connection being made.
---
25%+ depending on the spec. Orc warrior can get pretty silly.
---
I'd definitely go 26/5/x for tanking dungeons, with sweeping strikes + axe/sword spec if you're human/orc.
---
At this point it has no effect but making people happy.  Some are like oo pvers will leave pvp servers. Big whoop they already are to low pop dead servers. Wasn't until recently that they made transfers faction specific but they are so disconnected from the game it took them months. 
---
If your server doesn't have enough pvp, just move to one that has more. It's so simple. It's just retail refugees holding us up.
---
r/woosh
---
Had BGs been ready when the honor system was added they would have released em then. People forget content wasnt intentionally released when it was for a reason, it was simply released when it was done.
---
That graphic is wrong 1.4 released April 19th. The 8th wasn't even a tuesday, the day patches were released.
---
I did the whole “don’t attack lowbies” thing for a bit. Constantly ganked on my 28 alt by level ???’s, so I kill all now. No remorse.
---
Are any other mages having issues with mobs not slowing when hit by blizzard? I'm trying to farm ZF, and it's really unusual the last few runs I've made.
---
Mobs either run straight through blizzard without being slowed, or they are initially slowed by blizzard, then break free. At lvl 60, they should have little chance of resisting my spells, but it's happening to several of them at once and has made farming ZF impossible.
---
40% if you're an orc warrior specced for it. 40%.
---
Raptor ate Zehvra's legs.
---
Lion bite Raptor's head off.
---
Zehvra kicked Lion's teeth out.
---
That's the cycle of life.
---
Damn, almost like exactly the people bitching will still get fucked
---
Well it's wsg or faction ques. Take your pick. I personally was hoping for the latter but this is a nice compromise.
---
Considering we are in 1.13 the pre bc patch. It's safe to assume they were in.
---
You got us.  [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dyyow4/serene_morning_view_of_the_horde_town_of_menethil/) is all part of a [massive conspiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grobbulus/comments/dywvej/overrated_has_been_pirating_the_boat_from/) designed to trick you, and just you, that pvp is happening in a place where it is not.
---
in a few weeks it will be these idiots complaining all day because a 20v20 is UNFAIR
---
Yep and maybe we will not be prepared for a boss that we fight in a black temple. So many mysteries and plot twists could be had.
---
Sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server.
---
This subreddit is not representative of the general playerbase
---
Just give people who bring quints one free reroll.
---
Skinning is great get that devilsaur money
---
People = Horde. Horde are playing. Alliance is quitting in droves. My friend group has unsubbed. May resub for BG's or I may be done entirely. It's just not fun. It's not simply a matter of "lol pvp server" it's a matter of "I literally can't do a single thing at any single location on the entire map."
---
And for fighting groups - there's Battlegrounds. I don't see the problem.
---
Lmao no.
---
I won't end. It'll just be fully released. 
---
I too have that xmute. Great money maker.
---
This entire statement is wrong
---
just report this guy for spam if u havent already,after seeing his response thats pretty much what i did
---
How many alliance are going to suicide 5 times just to queue.
---
What other dude said. Keep spirit tap, wand spec, get improved smite, then fill out holy / disc as you please.
---
If you enjoy a challenge and ONLY want to play horde then you shouldn't mind waiting in a queue until your faction no longer has an absurd advantage. 
---
I agree it's blizzards fault. They should never have allowed Alliance to transfer off of my server in the quantities they did. Horde should have been forced to transfer to balance the server or they can wait in the queue.
---
It's the best solution, I understand it isn't ideal. The only options people like me have is to quit or reroll. Those are both worse than possibly breaking up some raiding groups.
---
That's rough I've seen the set drop in the same run 2 times
---
If you’re looking to be more of the typical healing role in Bg’s then Paladin is the better choice as the commenter above mentioned. 
---
Priests focus more on dispelling enemies and really need to be careful with their positioning due to their lack of defensive abilities. 
---
There isn’t a clear winner - every BG group will want both due to how they bring different things (freedom/etc vs dispels). It has more to do with your play style than either’s viability.
---
Nothing wrong with reserving an item. Its takes time, patience and a little bit of effort to form groups. If your the one doing the leg work you should get to reserve the item you are looking for.
---
With current gear, I don't think a rush will be plausible as the buffs and adds from the bunkers/towers plus mid-bosses make the faction leaders really fucking hard to take down. A coordinated raid group could manage to pull it off, but Stormpike with his adds and buffed health pool is no joke.
---
Great feedback thank you, what is the signup bot that you use?
---
Both sides do it...
---
It never occurred to me until this relaunch of classic that you're intended to do these quests while you're doing all of the other quests in The Barrens.
---
No it doesnt. If you stealth within combat log range then it does.
---
I agree 100%. This addon is destroying an important mechanic in the game. Rogue/druid without ability to stealth unnoticed is playing impaired.
---
This would be a point if there was a mixture of horde dominated realms and alliance dominated realms as they would balance each other out, but since literally every realm is a heavily horde dominated realm then cross realm wouldn't change a thing.
---
Lol this is amazing
---
Not on Kromkrush
---
Being ganked/dying in BG's by those in MC raid gear is one thing when you're in blues. Being ganked by full T2 players is another.
---
It's a gear balance thing.
---
there are dozens of us! DOZENS
---
I’ve certainly found flagged players running around looking for fights. Mostly tho, if you wanna pvp in my server you go to hillsbrad.
---
Dude is either extremely overconfident while being ignorant, or hes just a strait up liar. Either way, I doubt he will even read what I wrote.  Definitely won't answer any of it
---
I'm salty because as a shadow priest, and for the good of the guild, I get punted down the ladder when distributing gear. I completely understand why, but it comes with a side of salt.
---
That sounds like a great system
---
Picked up any other epic boe's?
---
We knew like 4 hours ago.
---
Yeah I know.  I was trying to get him to explain why he believed this was infallible.
---
Except you're not waiting your logged in playing. That's life on a pvp server maybe choose more carefully next time.
---
No, it didn't.
---
true but it's harder to make memes complaining about perception
---
Actual numbers for reference:
---
Vanilla EU launch to BWL was 21 weeks 4 days.  
---
Vanilla first Ony kill to BWL was 19 weeks even.  
---
Vanilla first Rag kill to BWL was 11 weeks 1 day.  
---
Classic launch to 1/1/2020, minimum time from launch to p3: 18 weeks 1 day.  
---
Same time as EU launch -&gt; BWL would put phase 3 at Jan. 25.  
---
Same time farming MC before BWL would have been a release a week ago.  
---
Same time farming Ony before BWL would put phase 3 at Feb 6.
---
Early 2020 is right on schedule for p3.  I don't expect them to shorten the 9 weeks between BWL and ZG, but the real question will be whether they shorten the 16 weeks between ZG and AQ, the 24 weeks between AQ and Naxx, or the 30 weeks between Naxx and BC/whatever's next.
---
Meanwhile i'm sitting here with my 3k honor from 30 kills.
---
Hear me out, hear me out: What if in addition to all of that, you could flag yourself as "ready" or "available" for PVP. AND! AND!! When you do, you can be attacked by players of the opposite faction, but as soon as anyone interacts with you via buffing, healing, or debuffing and damaging you, they're also "readied" or maybe one could even say "flagged" for PVP.
---
its really hard to FD + trap a smart warrior, if they save their WW for the second you feign you're basically screwed
---
They can't. You literally don't know how the addon works. I'm a Rogue, I use it myself.
---
Oh cool, another reply complaining about someone else's complaint.
---
Yeah I just posted a complaint against your complaint about his complaint.
---
We run dkp, get dkp bonus for on time and prepared.  If you listed yourself as a raider and you can not make it just have at least 1 hr notice or dkp penalty.  Dkp also incentive to show up so you are not behind.
---
For loot we have a priority list so for certain items, e.g.  it will be optional for main tank first, if tank doesn't need then it may be released to dps to spend dkp, then offspec then disenchant.  Everyone can see the list so it is transparent enough and mostly done to benefit everyone best as possible. 
---
Legendaries kind of similar.  First bindings will go to main tank and then any additional will be open to other tanks as well as dps.  Hand will go to someone that has the means to craft as it is very expensive to craft so anyone going for it needs to have good income of their own as the guild will handle ingots but other items will be on that player.   Ret pally or warriors.
---
Not sure any of that helps but that is what we do.   We have a list for professions and make sure everything we need is covered.  We have multiple bank chars between a few of the officers.  I have a alchemist alt for example as I am a prime alchemist for us so I try to stockpile potions to help with raiding.  
---
Good luck making it work bro.  If you got good people just have fun.
---
If you actually read this thread. You will see the dozens of different ways that it affects the game. 
---
My biggest beef with it is the spell cast detection. It can detect and display the spell that the person is casting. Which is total bullshit. An opposing player should not know whether I am casting pyroblast, vs a rank 5 fireball. Except by seeing with their own eyes, how long I am actually casting it.
---
Most people on PvP servers want to feel like the world is actually an Alliance versus Horde conflict which could result in them dying at some point, but at the same time aren't trying to actively engage in killing other people all the time.
---
I dont really remember the grind in vanilla or bc but I bought my epic mount on my rogue recently in classic after 2 days of farming uld, 650g saturday and 250g the next morning so it's not that bad right now
---
If we have trouble downing rag in phase 1, with 35+ ppl we need everyone we can get
---
That’s why I’m still on my server with 2.5 hour ques.
---
What’s happening then?
---
This argument is just flawed.  I'm either going to reroll on a pve server or quit until paid transfers are out. The ally population is going to suffer anyway.  They might as well make 15 bucks and save me another 7 days played.
---
Rules? No rules here mate. If it's red, it's dead.
---
&gt; it's getting close to 60/40
---
lmao

they fixed that https://www.wowhead.com/news=295293/hunter-feign-death-trap-bugfix-progress
---
When you consider that you will be killing thousands of mobs on your way to lvl 40,  that silver starts adding up.  I also play a grind-heavy style in which i skip many quests and zones and spend a large amount of my time grinding xp.  There are many skinnable beasts that drop great vendor trash that I grind in my 30s such as basilisks and cats.  I tend to hit lvl 40 with around 125-150 gold using this method.

Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley coming on December 10th https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-unlocking-in-december/368940
---
This. I've been thinking the same thing this entire time and wondering if I was missing something. Very little will change in the out world. Ganking will continue
---
I mean that was pretty predictable given the faction imbalance and the time that they released honor. In fact I'm pretty sure Blizz likely knew it would happen since word was floating around they considered dropping WSG with the honor patch. I am surprised they pushed it out 3 more weeks as the qq is just going to keep occurring and people will stop playing and likely some will not renew their subs as they come up towards the end of the month. 
---
Although I'm also surprised they haven't really fixed any bugs that they've acknowledged so who knows what their plan is. I'm starting to think their actually plan is to have all contain in classic out before Shadowlands drops so the streamers are focused on Shadowlands and they hope it'll draw the classic crowd back or some of us. Then when Shadowlands has a thdyll release TBC servers. Rinse and repeat, then Wotlk.
---
Here’s my advice: put your first 11 points in resto for the increased totem range and 3% hit. 
---
This makes a HUGE difference.
---
Then, dump points into enhance until you have Flurry, finally bounce back to resto to pick Nature’s Swiftness. 
---
This is the 0/30/21 leveling spec, it’s the best imo
---
Further imbalance is a downside.  It needs to be controlled still.
---
...grats?
---
it works for me all the time on fairbanks, and i have lots of video evidence as well
---
I manually put my pet on follow with ctrl+2 then feign and trap. All on seperate keybindings. Zero issues
---
My guild has had 1 leaf and something like 9 eyes.  You can't sell the leaf because you have to lock yourself into an MC before even knowing if it will drop.
---
Yep! If they need flasks to clear MC you should move on.
---
Well that’s how it’s supposed to work, but with 1.12 tuning it’s not really the case unfortunately speaking from private server experience
---
No it wasn't.
---
The last source I saw is 56:43 for horde which is an advantage for sure... but not on the level that other servers are struggling with.  Like I said it’s just interesting giving the horde have only a slight pop advantage ( which in this case imo is negated by pally heals) that horde would be dominating so horde on white mane. Like I said I just think alliance are very effective or interested in this game pvp, I know it’s not good to generalize but it’s the vibe I’m getting.
---
That’s all fine and dandy,  but then why roll on pvp server
---
Edit not effective/interested *
---
I disagree that most people on PvP servers want to pick and choose when to PvP. If they do, then that's not very smart. Because there's a server like that which is called a PvE server.
---
The only people whining about this are on reddit.
---
(Except those whining about faction balance, that is a very fair complaint and blizzard truly screwed those people over and I feel for them)
---
It didn't exist in Vanilla.
---
boyish giggles.
---
Must be hard playing an invisible murder machine that stunlocks every target longer than necessary to kill them
---
Why just repeat the title and copy the link in the post? 
---
Does redundancy add anything for you?
---
The addon has existed for over a decade now. It isn't going anywhere.
---
Yeah, those BGs are just horribly balanced matches full of try hards. Zero interest here.
---
They actually fixed it within a week or two of it being broken.
---
You say all sites but that's in relation to levelling, not dungeons. Look at the dps of your top rogues in your guild for raids on classic.warcraftlogs.com and see that most realms have a dagger rogue number one.
---
I’d def stick to that 30/0/21 shammy. You can heal all current content (most of our shammy healers in raid are this spec, and they put up numbers indistinguishable from full resto shammy). You can find dungeon groups insanely easily as either dps or heals (surprisingly easier as the former), and when it comes to PvP you still have insane burst. Sure, no auto crit from EM, but instead you can have instant heal or surprise chain lightnings!
---
I don't mind healing in pre 60 5mans. Thanks for the response.
---
Grats!
---
As others have said core hound tooth main and felstriker offhand. I’m in a spot where I have perd main and gutgore offhand. I need the CHT.. we’ve seen 1 perd and 2 gutgore in 3 full MC clears with an additional 1 clear up  to rag. Haven’t seen core hound tooth yet
---
On my paladin I have about 14 days, or 336 hours, played, and Classic has been out for 92 days. I average 3.6\~ hr/day, which really isn't a lot for Classic. If your average work day is 8 hours, dining/food is 1 hour, grooming is 30 minutes, commute is 1 hour, and waking time is 16 hours a day, any given person has about 5 and a half hours for their own devices. For a single dude with just a couple close friends, 3.6 hours a day avg really isn't much. I still had time for fitness, single player games, and chores, on top of keeping my social life active. Most of the days of heavy play were on weekends too, so I was probably playing like 3 hours a night, and 6-7 hours avg on weekends.
---
I had everything on farm in the middle of October, playing 3.6hr/day average since launch.
---
You know that WSG is a small map, right?  And that your class and name are known from the second you enter?  Your element of surprise is gone from the moment the gates open.
---
Stealth stealing flags isn't going to be impossible.  Hell, running into the enemy base and dismounting is recorded in the combat log.  The number of times someone has grabbed the flag in a full base and no one was watching the flag are zero.
---
Nothing can see through stealth, only the existence of it.  If it 'spotted' you, they would immediately run to you and knock you out, not spam flare/AE.
---
Ninjaing caps in AV isn't going to be an issue either.  So much is happening that you'll be fine.  Also, if you really want to ninja an AV flag, stealthing just outside the tower is bad idea.  Not only can the archers see you and shoot, the other faction can watch you run up.  So if you really want to ninja a tower, you have to stealth from a fairly far distance and that will avoid stealth detects already.
---
Spy does not detect stealth.  It detects spells and abilities being used.  If you put a poison on or hit a critter with your bow, it would have the same effect as going into stealth.
---
Don't care about your question. Glad your dog didn't wonder off! What a grown man morning, I resonate with that on so many levels. Except my dog goes on a full sprint 1 mile to the left and we have to go on a fuckin journey to find her or we give up and she's finally chilling on the porch later that afternoon.
---
Go to EarthFury where the faction imbalance is the other way.
---
2-3 hours on Herod during the evening.
---
Naxx was in 1.13 doesn't mean we need everything that was at the end of life of vanilla.  Dual spec also showed up.
---
Thank you.
---
At a certain point though, you play BGs casually to have fun trying to beat the other team / kill enemy players. Certain consumables like at least FAP /LIP greatly increase your ability to do that - that can be a fun MMO dynamic even for casual players where you play the game, use some of the money you made playing the game to buy consumables, and then use those consumables to win 1v1s in a BG just for the fun of it
---
That’s why I get precision on my rogue when leveling. Increases the chance of getting quest loot drops
---
I just went holy then.  Its almost impossible to level in the world right now anyway.
---
Warlocks eat mages man. I would know because my main is a mage.
---
Sorry, were you there watching my screen? First time it detected him was in stealth.
---
&gt; However, at the end of the day this addon is just a combat log parser.
---
Quite, and I've put both spy and HHTD into my list of addons despite my objections to the former. 
---
&gt;if enemy spells should show up on the combat log. 
---
I think the more nuanced discussion here is whether enemy players should only appear in the combat log if you are in combat with them, if you have them targeted, or they are doing something that targets you/a party or raid member/another enemy that your party or raid is in combat with.
---
Yes there is solid proof. You're just in denial for some reason. Very strange. Queues went up because there was a new phase released, so more people logged in. Queues on my server have been the same all along. From 4 layers to 3, then 2 last few weeks until zero. Still no increase in queue when they shut down to 1 layer. You noticed soooo  many more players even going down to only 2, we had 3 packed layers. Ur telling me the queue doesn't go up when going from 3 to 1 in your scenario? Queue was the same on my. Gehennas EU. One of the biggest servers.
---
I'm a mage that has begun to acquire my pre-bis raid items but I never got this far in vanilla so I'm practically a noob here. Do I really need to get two Freezing Bands before I can raid? They seem outrageously expensive.
---
This sounds like it's coming from someone playing the dominant faction on their server.
---
Nope, just tired of getting farmed on a 75/25 horde/ally server.
---
My guild can’t beat rag
---
That was me before phase 2 came out.  No body pvp'ing, nothing to do, only log in for raid night.  So if I bitch enough will Blizzard change the game to cater to me?
---
Everything they've released so far doesn't conflict or compete with itself, it's all complementary. If they release BWL early then yes we will know.
---
Me and my wife have pretty much have cut our losses.  I'm holding my breath for a little while longer hoping they will allow PVP&gt;PVE server transfers, but with them choosing to push BG's out early instead, I have a feeling it's not happening anytime soon.
---
oh well!  Was fun while it lasted.
---
come on dude, queues are fucking annoying as shit of course people are going to mind and bitch.
---
and people aren't always on to pvp, lots just want to get on to farm DM, or use the AH and now they have to wait in a queue. 
---
just because its a great solution for you doesnt make it the best solution. imo the best solution is bg's because the pvp'ers will be doing bgs instead of camping in the world
---
Nope, I was there. I played on 4 different pvp servers on both factions across 2 continents for years.  One more thing - people always seem to think they’re on the losing side. I played undead plenty of times!  What you said doesn’t even make sense. Undead play with other Horde races all the time so why would undead suffer from being camped more?
---
The first contested zone an undead comes across is Hillsbrad and by that level other races have also made their way there.
---
One took 3 hours. Guess which one
---
Trying to ding 60 so I can be a part of it! You horde or alliance?
---
You'll have to find a guild to make you "the raiding shadow priest" essentially.  It's a one of class in classic basically just there to buff warlocks and use dispel magic.  We don't even get to use SW:P unless the raid is short on warlocks :(.
---
Then he was in stealth in front of you and you were able to see him, and if you were able to see him... *gasp*... You could... See him?!
---
Spy. Cannot. See. Through. Stealth. It also cannot tell you where they are. 
---
It sees things you cast, or things cast on you via the Combat log. It also sees what you target/mouse over. That is it.
---
I would totally be down if you were stripped of possessions and gold.   That would be a good tradeoff.  Everyone on a high pop server had to fight for resources.  I don't want some low pop transfers to come in that have bought 200 black lotus dirt cheap on their server to ruin the economy of my server.  Come naked and afraid so no advantages, you get to skip the leveling just fpp get your prebis again.  Otherwise im against paid transfers personally.
---
Being a casual carebear who won't touch PvP with a ten foot pole, why is an automatic queue and team maker for cross-realm BGs considered A-OK but LFG/dungeon finder so demonized? Both hardcore raiders and PvPers will always seek out others like them to ensure success instead of pugging, so why is it okay for the system to find partners for PvP but not PvE?
---
Week of December 10th*
---
Yeah, I know. I just wish they never raised the server pops in the first place. Forcing people to transfer is a lot less painful when you do it in the first week.
---
They were banking *hard* on the populations declining much faster than they have been.
---
Any details such as cross-realm, is AV in its original form, etc?
---
Meh, no point then.. 
---
Why isn't gear based on 1.12?
---
I didn’t
---
Blizzard clearly stated a medium pop server in classic would have more people than even the fullest servers back in vanilla. It's in the quote. You're the only one claiming it's only because of layers and that they would decrease the server cap(they never said they would, you're making shit up). Blizzard had spoken, you're making your own weird conclusions.
---
You wont even deny it :) shitty trolls are shitty.
---
No? No other game you play changes your settings every time you close it? 
---
So you're just an idiot who had a stupid thought, and posted without thinking first? Gotcha. Don't forget your helmet little man.
---
Honestly it wont matter in wsg/ab.  
---
AV it might
---
I, in my humble opinion, think that is the wrong direction.
---
Have no alliance on the "big" servers and let these players effectively quarantine themselves.
---
I've done pvp on the way to dungeons, just flag yourself and /chicken and /flex at the other guys trying to get them to attack. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Alot of the PVP complaints though are about wanting PVP only when they want to, so the same goes for your enemy if those guys don't want to have a little PVP that's their choice.
---
I do.  It means they equate a sped up release schedule with increased earnings.  We'll be out of classic content in 6 months at this rate.
---
Fuk u rogue, but yeah get rid of it. But fuk u.
---
Shame on you
---
hes low level prot, he would lose all his rage from swapping stances. Didn't really need to tbh
---
Can you please directly quote the ad hominem attack I used against you?

---
I didn't say delete entire characters. I said if Blizzard is kind, let people transfer.
---
I do think its your fault if you rolled a PvP server without understanding what that meant, but fine.
---
Horde blockaded SM for weeks on rattlegore. They'd start killing ya as soon as you entered tirisfall and corpse camp as many of your group as they could all the way to the dungeon where you'd be met by an absolute shit show of skeletons inside the monastery.
---
And remember this guy's a rogue with engineering.
---
Horde, good luck man hope you hit it soon
---
How?  People can’t make a toon on the opposite faction on pvp servers.
---
By sitting in town and queuing?  If that's vanilla then why not just add dungeon finder?
---
I mean thats fine, but WPvP in phase one was rather non existence.
---
I used to play pretty hard core in vanilla. I was 14 when the game launched.
---
I’m now 29 with many more life obligations. I don’t think I’m an unusual case.
---
I hit 60 a couple of weeks ago. I’ve managed to do MC once. I still have some greens and 0 epics.
---
My /played is 9 days. That’s an average of 2.5 hours per day. That is a lot. I’ve not played this much of any game since I was in my early 20s. I will need to tone it back, I’m only really playing one evening a week right now.
---
I really want to experience all the raid content in order, have time to gear up in between content patches and relive the old experience.
---
They might be vocal, and popular, but I highly doubt the majority of people are playing significantly more than I am. To me, it feels like this is lightning fast.
---
Why would I, I'm having fun in game right now, you lot aren't, apparently.
---
Can't wait for BGs when you start to cry about premades griefing you as well :^)
---
The general community here, doesn't like the idea of reserving gear. So you can kinda expect a certain type of feedback based on that. Moving on:
---
- Since you clearly communicated your intentions before, and even during the run(at least at the beginning), then the raid cannot claim ignorance. I remember the first time I reserved a piece of gear was indeed not during WoW Classic, but weirdly enough during Wrath of the Lich King for a Naxx-25 pug group. It was a long time ago, but it was a trinket for my warrior(I believe it affected shield slam damage...it's been a while). I stated it in every single invite to make absolutely sure that every single member understood what I'm out for. I remember that a few gracefully declined, and that was totally cool. But the majority shrugged, and didn't care. It was likewise no big deal when luckily the trinket dropped, the raid all assumed I wasn't sticking around after that. I hearthed out, and they continued their merry way within.
---
- I wonder if that rogue was likewise communicated to(but then, surely he saw your broadcast and **read through the whole message**, which led to him messaging you, thus implying his consent?)
---
People are reserving gear and having various conditions on runs all the time. We are seeing everything from Briarwood to HOJ, to anything we can name on the list. And if the playerbase does not wish to play ball, then they speak with their silence(if that makes any sense). And then you would be left waiting for a very long time and maybe not even make the run happen at all as a consequence.
---
But your runs are still happening for that weapon. So then I can't say that you're in the wrong, and not when you're being communicative to the group before, and during. You didn't spring a trap for them that they got screwed on.
---
"maybe even people with social anxiety and stuff can learn some transferable skills in terms of trying to talk to people in real life if they are encouraged to group up, be social, etc to tackle in-game challenges"
---
That's exactly what this game did for me. It's not embarrassing at all, btw. Many of the games I played before were solitary and I went through a period where I didn't have much of a social life at all because of the sinking depression and grief. WoW was almost like a step back into being social compared to where I was. I'm grateful I gave it a try, because I never thought I would play and it ended up being my favorite game.
---
DAE horde rogue xDD
---
But why would you want to laugh at yourself?
---
I have been having trouble with Jujus, full stop - the strength and fire resist ones do not apply even when I am unbuffed. Anyone else seeing this?
---
Yup the same BS canned response, queue is unfair reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  
---
Show me where the faction balance was posted when it launched, until then stfu.
---
This is basically what became of retail servers, even once the honor incentive was removed
---
20 runs isn't to bad for a 7% drop rate I probably got it after 15 runs but at least you can get righteous orbs AD rep and greens worth DEing while running for it.
---
yeah dude I leveled holy till 40, then went shadow 40-55 and it went unbelievably fast. I did holy again till 60 then after a week of being 60 I just couldn't take not being able to kill things quickly so I went back to shadow and never looked back.
---
33 has a lot of zone options.  Alterac Mountains, STV, Thousand Needles, etc.  Desolace is rather barren and gray.
---
Undead priests are a blast, one myself.  Playing a different way, caster vs melee, or healer vs dps can open your eyes to styles of gameplay you never knew about.  I have a lot of alts but 60 is calling me and I'm so close.
---
&gt;I had duels vs mages where I refilled my healthbar twice over in TBC.
---
that's what polymorph does when mages are resetting the fight.
---
There should be a rule in this sub where if you rolled on a PvP server you will get banned for bitching about people doing PvP on a PvP server.
---
Stop whining
---
Explain?
---
Where are you getting this information in regards to faction imbalance on my server. Of everything I have read regarding this, we are one of the more even servers. On Rattlegore, I have a friend that is now leveling alts because he can't level anywhere due to alliance ganking. I, myself, get ganked constantly by packs of alliance. I realize that is what comes with a PVP server and all, but I just don't see the imbalance you are talking about?
---
can the alliance not fight those dudes?
---
Oh shit, might be time for me to re-sub.
---
Soon.
---
That's what gets me, it's been 1 week with honor. Let it play out. On the flip side to these people complaining there's a portion of the playerbase who were really excited for this phase and enjoy what is going on now so let them have this moment for a couple more weeks.
---
Kargoz and Defcamp were just talking about how great the wPvP is in Skeram. "Epic to see".
---
&gt;Can't pay for a transfer at all?
---
I'd be mad if they allowed this TBH, this what happened with vanilla and it basically exacerbated the issue.
---
The nerfed version is the 1.12 version.
---
You may be confused about version numbering - 1.7 and 1.12 are not decimals, they mean "release 1, patch 7" and "release 1, patch 12." 1.7 is five patches earlier than 1.12.
---
Theres a few ways to effectively farm lotus's
---
Have alts planted in all lotus areas, hoping between them constantly, with timers on the last time you picked them, then have your main herb accounts/alts in the area with epic mounts. 
---
Or have timers, and no life the shit out of running around while replacing 1 hour timers, you need to play a lot to be on top of the other neck beards.
---
Lotus's only spawn once an hour in each area they spawn, and only have few locations and are random each time. You need to spend a lot of time playing with timers and hunting them efficiently in order to even attempt to farm them in the amount he has. 
---
If you dont spend a lot of time and happen to get one, consider your self very lucky.
---
Beyond this there is no real secret strategy.
---
I don't believe the census data whatsoever, but I'll agree we're better than many other servers. I think the biggest thing is how much of a difference high-pop has made: Even a small imbalance is profoundly felt, because each new participant in a fight makes a huge difference, and there are people *fucking everywhere you go.* 
---
&gt; Like I said I just think alliance are[n't] very effective or interested in this game pvp
---
I've heard the same, and while I haven't organized much stuff for pvp, I'd agree that they're less eager. I do know I've passed up a lot of fights I could've won because the odds of another horde player walking by and jumping in were high enough that it simply stopped being worth the effort.
---
It’s a challenge to see if you can finish before you can’t stunlock anymore.
---
Well we had a 2 month window 15 years ago.  Maybe in another 15 years we'll get another week of world pvp.
---
Might be part of the issue some had, alot of people don't seem to have realized normal servers also have PVP. They saw PVE and thought you couldn't PVP at all outside BGs.
---
You're lucky man. I have 97 children and can only play for 20 seconds a night. Looking to hit 60 next century.
---
I will never feel bad about my server again. Thank you for bringing this to light lol
---
No, it can't.  Been using it for weeks.  Never seen this once.
---
Ah ok, makes sense then.
---
Join a Guild, best way to meet new people and socialize
---
Horde - Ashbringer EU

218 HK's (70 in a group of 10)  
---
22163 honor  
---
303 standing
---
Mostly killed people when farming in Azshara for Dreamfoil but some in Felwood, EPL and WPL. Can add that I'm a Shadow Priest which is pretty good for solo farming :)
---
Fucking saved. Look at those lemmings
---
Hi do I have the health and Mana bar like this one ?
---
They win the presidential election, yes of course that's what happens with BREXIT, it's just six seasons and no movie.
---
This is called a thorns set. Lots of list out there
---
Love zg as well, really looking forward to that release
---
*sigh* Some people just see what they wanna see...
---
...I also see it.
---
They were at 1.12 or around then, towards the end before tbc. For most of vanilla they were not.
---
The only voice blizzard is paying attention to is $$$
---
I'll look into it for sure. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
So only 2/3 of the normal time... imagine cutting 2 months off an expected 6... yikes Blizzard catering to cry babies.
---
Just so you're aware no one is pvp flagged at level 10 or 11.  The target is also tapped once the lower level person attacks it so the higher level can only help kill it at that point.  I assume you play on a pve  server and didn't know this.
---
In dungeons this should not really matter, if your groups focusing down targets even if you crit and aggro the mob should be dead pretty quickly regardless. Only really an issue if you aren't hitting the same target as everyone else.
---
Can you please tell me what unitframe addon that is?
---
we just cleared mc with 20 people last night to get double the gear.  definitely need new raid content.
---
Enough.  The add-on is here to stay.  Accept it and move on.
---
That’s why I open up on shamans by killing grounding and fire totem first then blind and do a proper opener
---
Immunity to spell knockback for 6(?) seconds after being the victim of a critical strike
---
Why would anyone subject themselves to this?  Does anyone actually find it fun?
---
I'm glad I rolled on a PvE server this time around
---
Find a guild that suits you. Don't be afraid to ask questions before you join and don't be afraid to leave if you find it's not what you are looking for. I'm a GM and I'm happy to admit that my guild isn't for everyone and people leave every so often. One thing I'm sure of: there will be plenty of guilds out there where you will feel at home.
---
Battle groups shouldn't exist until late classic, as they weren't implemented until late Vanilla. Shouldn't be rewarding faction imbalance. 
---
But, I do believe they are doing battle groups.
---
Under 300hk, over 20k honor.  Get on my level.
---
farming..uldaman? like pick pocketing or what? O.o
---
I mean they already banned the add on that emulated it.
---
So when does bc come out?
---
U mad bro?  Sound pretty butt hurt to me....
---
Now we just need AB and I'll have a reason to come back.
---
Actually I cant wait, the wait times for you will be massive and the fact none of you morons can win an even fight will be icing on the cake.
---
Well likewise Horde didn't choose to vastly outnumber Ally either so making them wait in a queue would be pretty ridiculous.
---
Again though this could all be fixed if you would just get gud but I know that can be hard for some.
---
Just saying, it's our BIS. We're people too.
---
Isn't that a hunter weapon?
---
After years of “#nochanges” and “PvE carebear” and “imagine only playing half the game” I am laughing my arse off at all these PvP snowflakes who suddenly can’t handle the world PvP and are demanding changes.
---
And that is all it is. They think world PvP sucks now and are crying for mummy Blizzard to fix it. It’s hilarious.
---
Oh yeah, of all the classes, I think feral gets the maximum usage out of Mark Of The Chosen.   That trinket is straight up broken good.   Even great while soloing where it will buff your spirit and int so much you probably won't need to self innervate any more.
---
Robes of the Void is marginally BiS for PvE pre-raid, but it's rather meh. Robes of Winter Night are almost as good (only 6 SP less) and you can get better robes (Robes of Volatile Power) from MC pretty early on. You'll do fine without it for now.
---
Tailoring will be very nice to have once P4 comes. The new Bloodvine set is BiS and requires 300 tailoring to wear.
---
This was my experience a few nights ago. I can't play outside of my raid group right now on Rattlegore.
---
Join a guild, but also talk and be friendly in dungeon group. Don't be annoying though, feel the room.
---
Just check their name and make a macro
---
    /tar &lt;name&gt;
---
    /cast Mind Vison
---
And spam it. Once they rez it should catch them and give you vision, then you tell your party where they're going, preferably through voice. Pinging the map unfortunately doesn't work because it pings relative to your coordinates instead of your target's.
---
I bought pubg early beta and that shit still doesnt work...
---
No argument there, I was just saying the weapons are pretty much good for the rest of the game.
---
The slippery slope fallacy is only the assumption without evidence that everything will always escalate.  In this instance we have demonstrable evidence of how this plays out, it ends with BFA.
---
Whats the addon called please
---
No this is a terrible idea. I remember playing WSG on a heavy Ally server in vanilla. Used to have to wait 30 min to well over an hour for a game. There is no benefit to not having cross-realm that supercedes that amount of wait time.
---
Because the loot in MC doesnt all drop in one raid.
---
I mean he's not. If you're fighting 3 mobs in a contested area on a PvP server you get what you ask for..
---
Shit I get nervous on my second life tap as I'm officially one shottable. Lots of rogues lurking in the shadows, it comes with... You know... The game taking place in a warzone.
---
Yes confirmed.
---
if someone talked to me like this i would deliberately kill them when they were fighting mobs
---
Because cross-realm PvP was in Vanilla but LFG wasn't.
---
As simple as that.
---
Yeah, exactly my reasoning. They gave Ony head and bloodfang pants to a rogue who just plain does not understand the game at all, and my guys were pretty upset about it, but it was his turn on the list. I'm going to end up dealing with 2 fury warriors who just plain do 1/3 the damage they should getting a weapon before me when I'm constantly shitting on them.
---
I mean sure it's too late now but if implemented from the start it  would have been beautiful for balances sake. Hmm, Everytime I try to log onto my lvl 22 undead rogue named Griefer, I get a 40 minute queue that says "there are too many horde on this server, in the interest of server health it is recommended that you create an alliance character and accept these tokens for bonus xp equivalent to to Griefers current total xp.
---
If you are talented in ruin i’ve heard it’s roughly equal to 8 spell dmg, if not it’s worth 4.
---
Hey so attack power - 14 attack power = 1 dps yeah? How does that distribute between 2 weapons. Say I have 2 swords each with 30 dps. If I get 14 attack power, does each individual sword now do 31 dps? Or is it split 50/50, so 30.5 and 30.5 dps
---
it's not punitive, the game is less fun for both sides when there is a massive faction imbalance
---
Wait, did you actually think classic would go on for years from now? 
---
Yeah all the phases will be released over the course of this year and end around the time Shadowlands is released a year from now
---
Everybody knows this lol
---
imagine drinking the 'faction kool-aid' so much you actually believe they define people IRL. Horde? Alliance? We're all the same.
---
I've been slacking with my great because I rather just get PvP gear.
---
I can say my experience as a warrior is vastly different. I tend to go in from burning steppes and die maybe 5-10 times before I make it to the door then pop nifty stopwatch and noggenfoggers to slowfall to the BRD entrance so I can die in the lava and res up top. Then another 5 or so deaths I'm in. I can't wait until I get HoJ. Fuck SGC, that shit never drops anyway
---
Flamelash is 24/76 you passive aggressive troll minge munchers
---
One time I spent 20 mins helping a rogue with a quest (I was like a level or two above him) and he wouldn’t split the Dark Iron, so I killed him. Stabbed him in the back in cold blood. Then he killed me and corpse camped me for a personal record of three and a half hours. Wholesome PvP, really.
---
Theyre a problem for pugs because they doing even want to play other premades.
---
Because I’m playin Ret in Classic
---
That you answered incorrectly garbage baby.
---
At this point, you won't really need to min/max to that degree. Just get the "easy" pre-BiS. Don't aim for the most expensive stuff.

If you find yourself swapping between PVP and PVE specs, the following ...may... work, and save you a macro slot.

Pretty mild compared to horde on Heartseeker. Getting a bit better since the xfer. Kargath is always under attack by 10 people + camping the Fly path. You die at least 3 time before entering BRM
---
except when you cant find a queue because your 8th 9th and 10th alliance players dont exist
---
First of all PvP matches are much shorter. If there wasn't a queue-system you would spend a ton of time for a 15 min BG. Bigger BG's like AV would almost be impossible to organize and find groups for. Secondly, BG's don't require a specific group composition to do well. Sure, having an ideal group composition helps, but it's not like you HAVE to have a specific amount of healers, tanks and dps in a BG, so it makes sense for a system to just haphazardly throw people together. Finally, BG's are cross-realm (within certain battlegroups) so it would be difficult if there wasn't an automatic system.
---
I do not, that is a friend in the clip.

If you're still fighting queues at this point you're a moron. It's not blizzards fault. Queues are how blizz is letting you know to transfer.
---
Poison meat
---
Nobody expects you to have full pre-raid BiS to raid. They're just suggestions.
---
It's not about picking and choosing when you fight other players, it's about occasional world PvP or dying to a random 60 now and then. In reality what's happening is a bunch of servers crammed with \~5x more players than vanilla had are becoming unplayable because of nonstop ganking. I don't think you understand the difference that a massively increased population makes in a game like this. This is not what vanilla was like at all. I'm not even subbed right now because of shit like this.
---
Pre-BiS is the absolute min/max gear before MC. You don't need it. You can craft your own list of desirable gear.

That is becasue you are gaining the 25 agi from the mongoose, but not the flat 2% crit.

Get good.
---
Hello, I'm starting today on wow classic and I was wondering if there is cross realm play (for pve activities). Thank you.
---
Never go 31 in holy. That's not good advice. First of all, you're taking spirit of redeption and lightwell, both of which are absolutely awful talents. One only activates when you die, the other requires other people to click something to heal themselves; which they won't. Next, you're missing out on divine spirit. Lastly, mental strength is just a better talent than spiritual healing.
---
Talk to people as you're questing and in dungeons. If you post in general chat of the zone, "anyone wanna quest together" you'll probably get a few people message you and be interested in being social and talking as they go. Similarly if you're doing dungeon runs, most people are pretty social as long as you're not too cringey and aren't trying to rush through the dungeon. If you start a conversation in a group, most groups have people talk back and continue the conversation. This is especially true if you're on a RP server.
---
Great move, glad they are fast tracking this 
---
IMO there’s way too many bored lvl 60s riding around farming people who are trying to quest and it’s making the game un fun. 
---
BG gives those who want to fight all the time something healthier to do.
---
&gt;and the raptors
---
&gt;exactly like the English countryside.
---
wat.
---
It's not that bad.  For questing, use a 2h and battle stance.  If you're in over your head, swap to sword &amp; board and defensive stance.  I die so much less his way and with using a 2h while questing, it isnt too much slower.  Then, when I do an instance,  my life as a tank is so much easier.
---
To a lot of people the appeal of world PvP is the power trip they get from rolling over people who can't fight back. It really is that simple.
---
gDKP pleb
---
Apparently me and every Alliance who left this hell dimension are pussies, according to the Alliance too dumb to xfer off with us.
---
That's also a fair point, it's important to remember this raiding experience is VASTLY different for everybody. After reading a lot of comments and replies, i'm starting to realize there is no good answer. In fact, there's not really even an "okay" answer to this problem. No matter what, someone is gonna be upset about it, which is usually what happens anyways.
---
Personally, although its a bit selfish, i'd like more time to get gear. BWL will be cleared week one absolutely, but 9 weeks of raiding so far and i'm only wearing 3 epics, one of which was crafted. (I have 3 more epics I wear in only PvP, however one replaces my crafted epic robe) I am a little worried about how geared i'll be when BWL comes out, but again that's really not a game problem just a luck problem.
---
&gt; We are yet to see a significant amount of complaints "I am tired of roaming in my death gank squad since we need to spend 10 minutes to find a victim". 
---
I think because nobody sympathises with the death squad beating up the disabled child. The people that have rocked up going "It's a PvP server cry more" have been downvoted to hell when they do comment
---
Slow down ? ye enjoy your 5min AV rush games for 7 days a week
---
Much respect, still though you'll somehow have players defending this as valid and fulfilling world pvp. Sure...
---
Fun Fact:
---
Just a few hours ago, I managed to finally get this stupid Zhevra quest done.   
---
Like...really....I love to take their leather (am a rogue)...but for hecks sake, I just want a goddamn hoof!
---
You’re in the over populated faction, which isn’t even normal pvp
---
My man, keeping the retail mentality alive
---
53 is good enough.
---
Came here to say this as a Tauren from whitemane. 
---
It looks busy cause you all hiding in IF and I don’t blame you.
---
They did in vanilla, dont see why they wouldnt
---
&gt;I can't wait until I get HoJ.
---
You'll still be spending a massive amount of time corpse running to BRS / MC / BWL
---
They need the casuals’ money too, and they won’t sub if they are perma-dead. World PvP was too successful.
---
Protip, if one member of q group gets it, everyone gets it.
---
So get together a 5 man and it's not bad.
---
What are you even on about now.
---
probably space dust...its all over the place here right now too!
---
On a lot of servers actual world pvp doesn't even exist.
---
I know right? It's like these guys don't even know how to invite 10 level 60's to a group!
---
They were laughing though, no one was mad...
---
It was server based in Vanilla... battlegroup was introduced in TBC and removed in Cata.
---
We are getting full cross server BGs which means it's against any server from your region.
---
Not that i'm aware of, there's the HonorSpy addon but it currently has more bugs than features and the author is struggling a bit with the API
---
We use a Loot Council system. We're also cognizant of how corrupt those can be. To combat that and for our own sanity's sake we have two public excel sheets. The first is a prioritization document showing the priority for classes on specific loot. The 2nd is a loot log showing a total history of who has won what.
---
We also default to rolling more often than not. Generally we eliminate individuals from rolling based on their loot won thus far, and the remainder roll against one another.
---
Here is the biggest advice I can give about loot. Pick a system that you believe is fair, thoroughly explain said system to raiders, and then (no matter what) **stand your ground in the future.**
---
Some people are like children and will agree to a system that is working for them, and complain the first time they think it no longer is.
---
Are you kidding me? If you're stealthed unless you break stealth or get really close in front of your target you're not supposed to be detected at all. Anyone with spy now could just run away as soon as they see a rogue stealth warning. Also the addon detects up to your maximum draw range meaning you'll know if there's any rogue stealth around you within 50 yards even. Do you even understand how devastating this is for rogue and druid in the battle ground? Imagine a flag carrier in WSG who has a stealth warning whenever there's a rogue within 40 yards. WTF was the rogue supposed to do? The proof is there you're just blatantly denying the facts now.
---
'But it doesn't "see" them...' give me a break.
---
nope.
---
I agree with you but the logical end point would be wrath.  Wrath private servers were very popular and the changes that came with Cata are what drove a lot of players away.
---

Typing /1 will open up the zone chat. You can ask if others will help with group / elite / high level stuff.

You can't emote while casting hs
---
&gt; My choice would have been to release vanilla population servers, toss the idiotic layering idea in the garbage, and work on population balance from day 1.
---
The best way to do that would be to cap the number of people who could install the game and connect. Would you prefer not being able to play the game at all to benefit the experience of the few?
---
I went the destro route after ingot dark pact but regretted it, bc i didnt cast shadow bolt while soloing, so talents in imp sb and bane weren’t doing much. Dem. Embrace is awesome, and you’ll orob get more use out of imp. Healthstone. Shadowburn is kinda cool but the destro talents are better when you hit 60 and start becoming a shadowbolt spammer IMO
---
No, using elevated terrain to avoid the aggro of guards is indeed an exploit/cheat as defined by Blizzard's EULA and TOS. Thus the GM telling the player to get down. Thanks.
---
I'm a MC geared hunter, ony helm/neck, rhok, everything enchanted, you name it. My cloak however, is still green. I've been running Strat UD 1 to 3 times a day for the last 7 weeks to try to get the Baron cloak (Rag cloak will be won by warriors for a long time due to dkp). I'm nearly exalted with AD, I know every pull off by heart, and I NEED THIS TORMENT TO END
---
I can't remember that being the case for Planetside 2, but for WoW it would certainly be true. In Planetside it was normal for many people to play on multiple factions and it is easier due to it being a shooter. In WoW you wouldn't be able to convince a guild to skip the queue and start leveling something from 1 because most people play it for the endgame. Faction specific queues would be a terrible implementation indeed.
---
PvE will not be cross realm. The only cross realm activity that I know of will be battlegrounds.
---
True, but where i take issue is with the kind of people that burnt out the raids in the first weeks. Most of us have real lives and jobs and families, let alone the time to constantly bitch at Blizz to do something. It's unfair that just because some people are no-lifing the fuck out of this game and applying pressure to Blizz to release more and more at faster rates is warranting Blizz to do so. Classic will be done in a years time almost at this rate, and it's a shame that the people who are literally not working and living off whoever the fuck knows is making it so. The Twitch atmosphere is completely ruining it too.
---
Dark Pact is useless.
---
Usually you'd go 30/0/21 or 30/21/0 while leveling. Raiding specs are a different story.
---
This isn't rushed... idk where people get that idea at all.
---
That was legit the experience on some servers, on mine twinking was huge so low level BGs were known to be unplayable as a non-twink leading to them being 9/10 twinks aside 90% of the time. 
---
Even with battle groups it was still over half and the bulk were hunters and rogues.
---
pVp HaPpEneD oN a PvP sErVeR
---
&gt;I beat it from the mainland to feathermoon
---
So the opposite direction I was talking about?
---
Then stay on your server and don't come mess the economy up on mine.  For paid transfers it should be this way or it can and will be abused ruining economies of servers.  For fraction balance they do the free transfers faction specific you get to keep your junk.  Why is it a terrible idea?  Because you want to profit?
---
Ooooo, I'm at like 750g. I'm usually pvping while I herb so rank 3 shouldn't be too hard to hit next reset. I wanted to have it by the end of this week, but I can wait a few days to save 90g.
---
No. Classic runs on the modern game client, not the old vanilla client. Almost all of the modern graphics settings are available.
---
Any news on what version of AV we'll be getting?
---
I don't play the game so I can go afk.
---
Disrespecting the 1v1... that's low as fuck. Let the fight end and then kill him if he's alive by then.
---
&gt;. The only difference with more people is that you're more likely to find someone on YOUR side in the same zone as you to help you.
---
It doesn't work like that. People who are leveling are going to naturally disperse so that they don't exhaust the mobs in their area.
---
And regardless, when one side does things like camp flight masters there's nothing you can really do.
---
I'm on the fence about finishing my leveling (currently at 55) and seeing how BG's are. I've always loved BG's but I suspect based on how players are tending to approach all other aspects of the game that premades on voice chat are going to be very prevalent this time around, and that's not something I'm interested in. I'm not going to keep putting time into the game if I'm basically fodder for premade-farming, and I'm thinking about whether I want to even put the time to get to 60 and find out.
---
Why should I have to re-buy my mount, or did you not realize thats an item.
---
Are you serious with 16 hours daily? Who has that kind of time?
---
Bgs are cross realm in your region. AV is in the nerfed 1.11 form so it wont be infinite like pre-1.11 vanilla.
---
Yeah the sub numbers must have really plummeted after five days of pvp...
---
Yup :(
---
Can make that gold multiple times over by that time
---
Some pugs (read: groups of random lifers) are clearing MC and Ony.  Conversely, my anecdotal evidence would say that there are plenty of PUGS and even guild runs still working on even dousing runes.
---
So glad I transfered off that shithole when I had the chance
---
Here's a crazy idea: prot pally.
---
One of the most enjoyable alts when spoiled. I got him full gear upgrades every 10 levels, and leveled as Ret until 38, then I got Ardent Crusader and the Green Tower (with enchants and spikes) and respecced holy/prot, then hit SM for AoE grind.
---
It's super enjoyable tanking 5-mans with him. And you get a proper chance to raid if you tank a shit ton for your guild and they like you enough (you might have to bring healing gear though).
---
Consider going deep disc for power infusion if you want to be able to lasher farm at that level, it’s decent gold especially if you’re a herbalist. It’s very mindless because all you do is drink and spam holy nova so you can catch up on a lot of TV/YouTube.

Yeah, and people get *reeally* mad if you kill the boss elemental. They don't drop much (if any) loot, and then all the other elementals despawn. If people leave the boss up, you can farm the lesser elementals for their essence of air/fire/water/earth for ages.
---
On northdale where horde ques were 30 minutes or more, you queue up, use RFC to ghetto hearth to Kargath, and use the rest of your 28 minutes to gank Burning Steppes until your que pops.

I mean i didn’t go into blacksmithing just for my shaman, it was just a thought. I am doing herbalism alchemy on my shaman, is that a good idea?

What state are rogues in right now? I have a 60 lock and can probably get a spot if I level a rogue once we go to two groups or so alt raids. Is it worth it to do a rogue? I want something to farm with and to PvP with. My lock is solid but I'm in raid spec most of the time.
---
I’m a hunter... the addon is pretty cheap I can hunters mark in 1 click as they rez. 
---
Idc either way too passionately but I think it’s not the intended gameplay. 
---
Auction house addons are more of my hatred. Congrats you stay logged in scanning AH 24/7 on an alt account and auto buy &amp; spam repost items. Should 100% make people have to manually do that and waste all their time scrolling through each page.
---
Why do rogues only want to duel when their cooldowns are up?  What do you do in battlegrounds, afk for 5 minutes after every fight cuz it wouldn't be fair?
---
I don't like the faction based queues. If they had done this from the start then it's a good system. Now you are soft forcing people who have played on their servers to ether move or wait for even longer to log on. Despite the current uproar, people play Classic for more than WPvP.
---
just pvp happening on a pvp server, shoulda rolled pve care bear, spend your entire night getting a raid together to kill them instead of accomplishing anything, go back to retail
---
Jesus that Standing with such low honor..... Poor fucking alliance
---
Obviously?
---
I'm a lvl 52 alliance on Grobbulus and I feel like the game is unplayable. It takes 35-40 minutes to corpse walk my way from thorium point to BRD. Roving bands of horde constantly control the mountain and I am yet to see an alliance raid punish them for it.
---
No.  NAXX will be open for exactly 4.7 days, then the servers will be patched to 4.0 and Deathwing will wreck Azeroth.  Then we get flying mount licenses so we don’t have to rely on the flight paths in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdom.  We are implementing this change due to overwhelming positive feedback from the community.
---
It will probably be even worse than before. If Horde vastly outnumbers alliance and they have 30-40 minute queues they will still be out in the world getting honor whilst waiting. Meanwhile, there will be no lvl 60 alliance out in the world since they are just in cities instaqueueing bg's so the only prey left are the levelers and a few ppl farming.
---
And when their dental conditions reach that point, they come after softer targets. Such as humans.
---
So wouldnt it make sense to add guards to ships now?
---
If you like gear with no stamina on it.
---
I went leatherworking to make myself gear and later on you can make a little bit of cash off of devilsaur stuff or resist gear for raiding. Herbalism is a good choice for making money though
---
MC on 1.0 was impossible as well.  It only got cleared after it was nerfed.  We started on 1.12 so yeah, it's not going to be the same exact pace, but we're not going to fast based on the patch we started on.
---
that might depend on how they go around this,there's a lot of US servers that have Spanish speakers in them already(thalnos,sorry for spelling) is one such example here so u really cant avoid the language barrier issue.
---
till cata there was a battle group for each set of realms before they started more wider by region. so your either looking at 4-5 battle grounds per region,or at best...pure region wide cross realm.
---
Beautiful
---
According to the links from that page, they are dropping “ace of” Darkmoon cards.  I can understand why you wouldn’t want to kill them as the elementals only spawn while the boss is there.
---
Everything below AQ40 can easily be done without flasks.
---
Raiding since week 3, still haven't seen a single perdition drop.
---
For me it was around 625g. I did it pretty early and bought the 250g final mats though, I've since used those to help some guildies and a random lock get their mount as well.
---
You can sell runs or sell people just zoning in to talk to the spirit to get some cash back if you have the mats but I haven't bothered, if a lock joins a DMW run i'm forming he can get it for free.
---
I also bought all the required trade items from the AH vs farming them as well, if you can skin your scales/mine your bars/make your elixirs price might come down a bit there too.
---
That’s what I would do, but people are in different situations where if it took them this long to not yet be 60, maybe they don’t want to start 100% fresh again on a new server.  
---
I was simply replying to someone asking “why would anyone ever want to transfer from pvp to pve?”  There’s nothing lost or gained from transferring pvp to pve.  The reverse would not really be fair to anyone who leveled on a pvp server though.
---
its quite simple with a bit of head-canon:  you just assume that when they don't drop, your character bashed them/burned them to the point where they were no good.  its an RPG after all folks!
---
I just prefer the content be helpful, funny, original, or at least move the conversation forward in some way. You know, compelling. Guess I should have moved on when the title didn’t fit my narrative? Perhaps the value in repeating stuff like this is in letting other people who feel the game is unfair know they’re not alone? That’s fair.
---
Everything you noted is also why social media is becoming a mouthpiece for “disgruntled minorities” who may have an opinion that is not widely shared, but becomes loud when echoed and amplified thanks to the internet being internetty... I’m not enraged, I just think this “original post” helping make OPs feelings known could be one of the replies in the half dozen daily “this just aint right” threads.
---
Call me naive, but I’d hope a community like this would encourage more people to play rather than encourage complaining about the game, and reward that kind of content. I don’t think it’s realistic to assume venting on reddit will lead to an actual change from Blizzard, so I don’t see the value.
---
I guess that’s both our problem!
---
Speaking from my own account -- 
---
I have a 60 war and a 60 pal on Stallag. Before P2, it wasn't this bad. The faction imbalance was obvious, but you'd take at most 3-4 deaths to get into your BRM instance of choice. While annoying, not game breaking or overly oppressive.
---
Now that you can get a minuscule amount of honor for doing what is shown in the video, everyone is doing it. It's become a nightmare and 50% of the BRM groups I join end up disbanding before we even get started. 
---
Let me put it you this way: I joined a UBRS group and we got 9 people there in about 45 minutes. We finally found a 10th once we were all in and told them to come to the instance, the 10th was in IF. 
---
The 10th immediately flew to TP and started their migration. By the time our 10th got inside to the instance and to our group, we were at Drakkisath.
---
I like pie.
---
You got like 100+ pieces of tier plus not tier epics and your casters are still in blues? Yeah, sure
---
Yeah it's been five whole days of pvp and many server have increased queue times.  Totally bleeding subs...
---
The boat is lazy. It requires less effort to use and is easier to use.
---
DM was pushed out to add more content for the players who were clearing MC already and raid logging. Basically giving them something to farm between phases.
---
It has the affect of also adding content for casuals as well so it could be considered a win/win, but that was NOT the intent or result.
---
What is did was increase the gear and gold levels which is felt greatly by the casuals in world pvp and on the AH.
---
Maybe they can do something outside of wow for a bit then
---
Low effort meme.

54 is a solid time to respec to healing. You need to decide if you want a spec that is "good enough" at healing and can do solo, or if you want to go straight heals though. Straight heals will skip talents like spirit tap, wand spec, searing light and force of will; a hybrid spec will not.
---
[Here's your guide to priest BiS](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-gear-bis-classic-wow), there's also a ton of good near-bis in BRD so I highly recommend farming the hell out of it for a few levels. Make sure you complete "The princess saved?" questline as it lets you kill the princess for the BiS gloves (literally better than anything from MC/Ony).
---
There are several raid-quality specs. There's PI/Shadow weaving, PI/holy, and several holy specs. [This is the one I recommend to new 60's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5002311305001-233051030300055). It has spiritual healing. Once you start getting a lot of your pre-raid BiS and raid BiS, around say 500 healing or so, I'd recommend dropping spiritual healing for mental strength. This is because the added healing from spiritual healing is applied *before* +healing is added, so it has no scaling with gear. While yes, it makes spells more efficient, mental strength scales with better HP/mana off spells (aka +healing), as well as your int. So far better returns in terms of total healing output. 
---
Alternatively, if you are doing more solo content/farming, you can change around a few points like searing light, PI, and more holy crit. This will make non-raid content much easier, at the cost of total healing output and HPS. It's really up to you and what you plan on doing. I exclusively raid heal on my priest, so my gear and spec is designed accordingly.
---
Dungeon healing is extremely different than raid healing. Dungeon healing is all about uptime, and maximizing your healing efficiency with the 5 second rule of mana regen. So you want to frontload your spells with big greater heal casts and renews, followed by as-long-as-possible periods of not casting to regen mana. You don't do that in raids, because there's so much more burst damage and because big heals will get sniped by other healers meaning you end up doing a ton of overhealing.
---
25% plus base 6%
---
I mean, flip this around on its head: If you want to be involved in vanilla-style world pvp, you'll get a chance at it for, what, 4-6 weeks per decade? If I miss this PvP period, how long until something similar comes around again, if ever?
---
Holy shit, those guys are fucking stupid.
---
Goes hand in hand with 5v1 and killing lowbies xD
---
Paranoia did basically the same thing. You are an idiot for assuming spy had to exist and not realizing other add ons did similar things in the later stages of vanilla.
---
Scan your hardware, you likely have some bad RAM. There's lots of great, free tools and resources for testing hardware. Here's a great one which has been around for a long time: [https://www.memtest86.com/](https://www.memtest86.com/)
---
I don’t see the issue with reserving. Those people usually take responsibility for putting the group together, which is annoying in itself. 
---
It’s almost no different from getting your guildies to run the instance with you for that specific item.
---
I didn't know that was an option thanks
---
Yes. It also works on Vaelastraszszszszszs in BWL.
---
Most servers are vastly horde dominated and the racials and hubs of Horde are objectively better. Also, if you only include PvP in your comparison, you're getting a skewed view. It is quite apparent that the above factors (ie. also PvE) play quite a big part in what factions are being chosen by players.
---
Salt
---
Haha, that did not cross my mind honestly, totally forgot that it isn't unique
---
Thank you. Finally someone understands
---
By you?
---
Or by one other group of people  out of millions and millions?
---
If you're EU, I strongly recommend Nethergarde Keep for Alliance.
---
65% population. Crazy amount of people. And healthy communities.
---
November 12th was a tuesday too.
---
Yeah I understand that and it’s probably because it’s a really close zone, but that’s just 1 zone.     
---
I’m sure a lot of the horde won’t be queuing up and then flying to all the further zones as often as they currently are like the plaguelands, feralas, ongoro they’re all also prime leveling zones that are pretty brutal right now for 48-60.
---
even then, it's only faster if you're swimming. not sure about aquatic form but you're definitely quicker water walking
---
I don't gank, unless someone is being ganked by the person. If I get ganked, I seek revenge. 
---
If someone is looking frosty I prepare for their attack.
---
 If I see someone getting ganked I help them out if it seems like an unfair fight, like if they are attacked while low health. 
---
I love pvp, but I straight up feel bad attacking someone when they are at a clear disadvantage, unless they are on my kill on sight list.
---
They really didn’t do anything close.  I don’t like the addon but everyone has it so.... 
---
But don’t pretend ANYTHING similar existed. Cause it didn’t.
---
What server?
---
Thank you much.
---
But that attack power - so it goes towards both weapons the same, right? That 50 attack power also goes towards the OH, before the 50% or whatever default dmg reduction?
---
No it's definitely a reddit problem. Apex, Pubg, Fortnite, Hearthstone, Starcraft, Diablo, Overwatch, Destiny, the list goes on and on. Large, faceless communities provide a great megaphone for bitching.
---
They did help our guild clear 8/10 our first week of raids, with 22 people.
---
Rogues are complete ass compared to hunters/mages at leveling and doing brd stealth runs is almost a complete waste of time on most runs.  In one “ten minute” run you could get  six resists.  So you either have to go prep, or get lucky, or wait out your vanish cool down.  And from my experience I’ll usually (at level 60) get a resist every 20 mobs.
---
Make a mage or a hunter
---
try rolling a better faction next time, zug zug
---
give the guy some cheap mats and have him craft a low level potion/elixir in front of you.
---
Honestly I mostly ignore people that reserve items. Depending on how much they spam about it and how much they whine - they might also end up on the ignore list.
---
If you want to reserve an item - just compose a group of those that do not need it. 
---
Need Dal'Rends? Make a 5 man. Find a Jed instance. Invite casters. Profit.
---
Welcome to classic.
---
Thers over 100 guilds on whitemane that LOG their full clear MC kills, so its probably a considerable amount more that have full clears. Compared to this time period after original vanilla where people hadn't even killed rag yet ever. Content releases should be sped up a little bit because there is no progression anymore. Guilds arent going to be spending months working on progress outside of mostly naxx, some in AQ. If content is cleared on the first raid night and many guilds are clearing it then that isnt the classic experience anymore,  its too much time spent farming the content and too many people who have cleared the content. Content needs to be sped up so that we can have it be more like original vanilla, where only a very few people were cutting edge,  and the rest were far behind
---
They probably deleted their character, made a character with the same name, restored their character and were forced to name change, then deleted the lvl 1.
---
Free name change and a clean slate? Yes pls.
---
Any form if punishment beyond having to pay for it is silly and wasn't in classic. If people cared about economies they should be pushing blizzard to crack down on gold selling, it's rampant and out of control.
---
Food thing, indeed. Food thing, indeed.
---
PvP happened on PvP server, herp, derp.
---
We deserve to be broken after the agony of leveling a warrior.
---
I feel like there's a big difference between reserving BOE and BOP.  If you reserve BOE it's like forcing the others to make you gold.  If you reserve BOP's you are helping other people by forming a group where they can get the loot they are after and making it clear the loot that you are after so no one joins that needs the same thing.
---
I'm on this server and got SGC at lvl 54, I'm now lvl 57 but I can't put up with this crap so I re rolled to Westfall.
---
No I didn't.  The addon is slow and few use it after the changes.  Those websites are horribly inaccurate, especially if you're trying to make a point about short-term trends.
---
This is Luna unitframes from memory :) haven't updated it since release and doesn't seem to be a problem, really should though 😅
---
Its 100% blizzard fault. Cannot comprehend why they didnt enforce 50/50 servers.
---
Gotta keep it realistic
---
They released a server with everything unlocked and only up for 2 months before classic released.
---
People got 5-6 bosses into Naxx in that 2 months.
---
Bliz already fucked the server balance so 'wpvp' was largely lame camping/zergfests.
---
I'd rather have BGs and then wpvp is because people want to, not because 'muh honor'.
---
If they released BWL with this, then I'd say they're rushing it.
---
I envy you rogues. As a support class (priest) I have almost the same amount of HKs but only like 4k honor..
---
Already found a way to complain before it's even released.
---
Impressive.
---
I was lucky enough to get a foror’s two weeks ago. Before that all i got was druid books &gt;_&gt;
---
Hey, this actually gives me hope that BGs will come out in a month.  Thx.
---
That may be true, but I wouldn't be surprised if 90% of players use the wiki's or watch youtube guides to level.
---
If you don't like the Desolace quests just go somewhere else. Arathi Highlands, Thousand Needles, Stranglethorn Vale, and maybe even some of the earlier Badlands/Blasted Lands quests. These are all zones that are suitable for your level. Otherwise as others have suggested go do a few dungeons.
---
Eve definitely is the kind of game where even though the vast majority of it sucks and is boring as hell, the highs are so high the rest doesn't matter. I'll honestly never forget some things from eve. 
---
A random Saturday night roam through an end of life wormhole turned into the first combat death of one of the most expensive ships in the game(Komodo). Definitely my most "I was there" eve moment. Never had any clue my dictor alt dropping a bubble on a nyx would turn into such an epic night, but fuck me was it worth the seven hours I spent scanning down wormholes for content that day for the fight (and this dope ass video that got made from the fight https://youtu.be/0c5vkbwU8cI ).
---
We had to get off grid cause we were just in kikis+scalpel and were getting pinged by myrms that showed up and found out after the fact it died lol. https://youtu.be/IZf_L47XEHA?t=828
---
Yep, he is providing a service - a well run UBRS group that someone else did all the work getting together.
---
In that situation it is fine to ask for compensation/reserve.
---
&gt;Horde VERY rarely won BGs in vanilla, and you can’t have full premades for WSG.
---
Nothing about that is true.  Amazing.
---
Haha fuck, mistakes were made 😂
---
What language is pepega?
---
Now the people can see that not everyone has that wpvp problems... thank you
---
&gt; there will be even less Alliance death squads
---
Thus, fewer horde. It definitely will change and be alleviated considerably, anyone trying to rank will make PvP premades and queue up. That's simply the best way to get honor due to consistency in honor/hr, which even with the problems you listed is more consistent than in WPvP. I would guess that about 5% of people will be in a legitimately good premades, 30% in bad PUG premades, 65% solo queueing. WPvP will only significantly occur when waiting for queue times.
---
Luna :)
---
Nope, but I definitely won't join your group.
---
So now world pvp is going to die? I'm level 30 now. I wanted to reach max level and see all the awesome battles before battlegrounds came out :(
---
Called it the moment Phase 2 was announced, BGs will be here in less than a month because the servers are shit and Blizzard doesnt realize how unpopular their infrastructure is
---
it really isnt 25% its fuckin 99%
---
Well considering that Alliance boats are protected by shitty guards which means Horde can do this with a much small group than Alliance can because Zeppelins are protected with much stronger guards. Also if you've been paying attention many many PvP servers are 60/40 favoring horde which means that horde outnumber Alliance by 50% or more so even if Alliance can do it they are much more easily overpowered.
---
Super cool. Nice job. :)
---
You choose a small server where it was easier to get said items.  That is your fault not blizzard's.  You can choose any server you want because you pay.  Make a new character.  You do not need the right to mess with healthy economies by going low pop and bring a bunch of easy to gain items on one of those servers to a server where people had to fight for it non stop.
---
I just did it for chaotic fun during few evenings, net like 9k honor which was bare minimum for rank 3 in my server/faction.
---
You are a good wife lol. At least you took vows to support him I'm just doing it for my random internet friend who helped me get my gear.
---
everyone rerolling to escape the sub 30 percent ally concentration camp servers has had to lose all their progress due to factors outside their control. Some of them did it.
---
Most just took transfers, which these poor disadvantaged 70 percent horde can do as well
---
It's not that hard unless you are going for BIS everything.  I log in exclusively for raid nights. Made sure to spec dagger rogue to avoid competition for swords. I now have perditions blade and CHT as of last night. Definitely lucky (as the other 2 daggers rogues spent their points on GGR, and one who could've won perditions did not raid last night), but the point is you will get some purples if you literally only raid on Tuesdays. I don't even play the rest of the week.
---
It's harder. Horde zeppelins are guarded by 55 elite goblins with knockback. Menethil boat is guarded by ordinary lvl 40 Menethil Sentries.
---
Plus, Org-UC is done entirely within Horde territory. If you want to hop continents as Alliance - tough luck, Wetlands is a contested zone so you're gonna get flagged anyway.
---
Most servers are full and have free transfers
---
No it didn't.
---
So they're doing it for the honor.
---
Lmao. It takes roughly 14 days of in-game to reach 60 for most people. It's called having a life.
---
Wile E. Coyote! Haha I laughed at your comment. Good old times.
---
Elemental invasions. I think they stopped spawning if you killed the boss/elite one.
---
Not in Vanilla.
---
Congrats whiners, you got what you wanted again. Retail 2.0 here we go!
---
Shouldn't you be hanging out at a instance entrance with a group of 5 ganking solo people?
---
HoJ, I just stopped looking for it, never needed it in vanilla and bis lists are suggestions, who cares, I'm having fun
---
I feel like it just highlights how out of touch the clowns running the show are.
---
Content is already kinda being sped up. Diremaul and BG's released earlier than Vanilla. 
---
There's 92 guilds on your server that have logged Full Clears, which is still crazy high. I think content will be sped up a little bit, but not nearly as much as the more serious gamers may want. And that's probably a good thing.
---
Kinda pathetic what they did, hope blizzard removes the items they stole

Another one to add to the collection!
---
During vanilla I was really indecisive.  Making alts was a lot of fun, I eventually ended up with a 60 tauren warrior and a 60 dwarf hunter. Also desolace is kind of a crappy zone imo (I level there though to avoid ganking).
---
Hit 60 on my druid and respecced to heart of the wild druid.  Does this mean I can tank/heal effectively in dungeons or should I stick to healing in dungeons?  I levelled as feral up until now (DPS or tanking but mostly tanking).  I have some healing gear though it’s def not BIS stuff so I’m trying to figure out what my next steps are.
---
I'm talking more about guild constructs and how they're al trying to rush through content, and how demanding everyone is about everything.
---
It's a 15 year old game. Who gives a fuck about server/world first.
---
Remember that Locks also run Improved Shadowbolt and most/all of your damage in raids comes from your Shadowbolts.
---
Don't comment or open the post then
---
You can stay 31/20 and tank 5 mans just fine as long as you have a shield and decent 1h. I'd do that for a while to build up pre-raid gear.
---
Fury/prot is cool losing tactical mastery is a total pain in the ass for 5 mans/open world content. That and you'll have to rely on your healer more, and if you're pugging that's not always gonna work out.
---
Run!
---
I was a "first gorilla" guy for my sinew this time around. The giblets took me far longer.
---
Lol I should have specified as my intentions were really just to predict what the complainers will complain about now that blizzard 'caved' and is putting out BG's. I take what life gives me I do not complain about this game if it stopped being fun I would stop playing but so far it's been everything I had hoped for. I honestly think they've done a pretty good job with everything which doesn't seem to be the majority opinion but w/e
---
they transfered, prolly knew they were gonna leave gehennas and made the pug to ninja some loot before leaving
---
Damn dude, we need more people like you. A beacon in the sky. I appreciate the time it took you to write this, and how you have improved my day. Your words will last with me.
---
No mercy for mages.
---
...? they definitely wouldn't have had all of vanilla's content ready when vanilla launched. pretty sure you didn't understand what that comment meant
---
December 10. It's been announced.
---
It’s Classic, never!
---
Yeah it is! WoW Classic is the best. I never got one during vanilla. Oddly enough I have way more time to play now than I did as a teenager. Even with a wife and kids, I'm miles ahead of where I was 15 years ago. Feels great.
---
The Org to UC zep has been camped by Alliance on my server pretty constantly. No guards spawned at all. Also the insane knockback has been removed from goblin guards already.
---
Well less that you’d get into another one, and more like you could leave that one and come back 2 hours later to it, maybe they finally capped sh gy , but horde still held off and stuck by the bunker.
---
This is a big reason, I was a huge proponent of them re balancing the raids to make all of them harder and MC/BWL much harder, if we actually had to work our way through MC I'd be all for it being up for 6 months or so, but in this case I'll probably start getting bored if BWL is held past mid Jan, and honestly I'd be happy to have it sooner.
---
Even gizzle? That dude hits pretty hard. :p
---
Yes it did. It read your combat log and displayed nearby enemy players which is all spy is doing.
---
It doesn't matter because you still need to get Exalted to get the training. You don't train "Riding", you train "Wolf Riding" and "Raptor Riding", etc.
---
Also that fucking bridge is ridiculous.  This kid has never played AV if he doesn't realize that ally have a large advantage.
---
Had a similar experience with a quest early on. Turned out I had stashed one in my bank and forgot about it.
---
trader
---
That's not even closely related to what I'm talking about.
---
See you say that but you clearly havent tried to camp Horde zeppelins because there are literally no guards once you get on there and not many on the way.
---
&gt; It’s almost no different from getting your guildies to run the instance with you for that specific item.
---
Except for the very minor difference of helping out your own guild vs. helping a guild you don't raid with.
---
You know what this means?!
---
**SNOWBALL FIGHT!**
---
He doesnt even have tier 2 head and legs?
---
&gt; Are you serious with 16 hours daily?
---
&gt;Who has that kind of time?
---
NEETs
---
If you mentioned it, especially multiple times, it is their fault for joining your group.  A lot of reserve groups will specifically exclude competition in general so he shouldn’t have joined you.  It seems like they probably knew what the rules were but planned on need rolling anyways.
---
Were you chat silenced by any chance? That happens if you try to relog immediately after being dc'd for it.
---
&gt; Vanilla was constantly adding new players at an increasing rate from 2004-2006.
---
Not only that, Blizzard themselves were figuring out what the fuck to do. Now, they don't have to design anything, only recreate.
---
Wtf is that baby talk nonsense. Streamers are goo goo ga ga
---
So I watched the video, this is literally nothing compared to Gehennas. If only that many horde was camping we'd be happy.
---
Wow 6 times. Try double digits for Alliance bub.
---
I think populations for fresh servers would be abysmal. I want this to be it, and although TBC is my favorite expansion, I don't want it. It should be an option after Shadowlands gets stale, imo (like a year into its lifespan).
---
Outstanding argumentation, you're truly a mastermind of semantics, bravo.
---
How do people survive without bank alts? I have about 6 alts full off stuff.
---
Lest all the griefing fetishists tell them this is what "WPvP" should be on a PvP server.
---
99% of the time those people play Horde on a 80/20 server.
---
That would end up being a cluster-F, where the musical chairs dance of people migrating to different servers would either shift the balance, or at the very least, have some people miss out on transferring with their friends/guild. Better to just have battlegroup clusters. Guarantees if you have 30 min, you'll at least be able to play a round of WSG.
---
I havent even ran stoackades once I'm classic. All the alliance keep stopping me!
---
Playing with streamers is cancer.
---
Yeah I remember back in classic when players would ninja loot and then use their free server transfers to jump to a different realm... really takes me back.
---
K
---
Make a second SLSL pvp warlock
---
It’s all relative. :)
---
So the addon takes an active skill (which has a big drawback) and completely eradicates it. It's worse than og healbot.
---
its an intended game mechanic - learn to play around jt
---
Try logging in and out on your other character, then try again.
---
&gt;It has a lot more to do with server balance than which faction you play on.
---
Oh so you agree with me then? Great!
---
"Logitech gaming software". 9.02 is the most recent version.
---
It is... Dummy
---
Have you tried getting into the mountain? There is where all your horde buddies are. Getting into brd/brs is really bad right now as alliance.
---
But yeah I do think ashbringer is fairly balanced.
---
It felt bad. I’m not saying what I said to discount how you feel.
---
+1 for a post not related to being an ally and getting ganked the fuck out in world pvp
---
On this server (Razorfen-EU) the alliance has a 2:1 ratio comparing to horde players (at least considering the last data). Its just the fact that nobody does pvp on a pve server. I did this participate one evening for like 2 hours and got those 600 kills and this standing. If you look around in Ironforge, the players with a rank are in the minority (like 1 out of 10) as of today.
---
The very mechanics that define the game cannot be "game-breaking".  You're saying "Hey, lets take the dice out of monopoly and use a 1-6 spinner instead!"
---
He seems like the type of person that would tell you to "leave the country if you don't like it", after mentioning ONE thing you didn't like.
---
Oh I know, I meant as in it's bullshit you not getting the crit
---
It's pretty fuckin bad. Paladins talk about auto attacking to 60. We do the same thing for the first 40 levels and then have a 1 button rotation for the last 20. And we do it all without heals.... it sucked so much ass.
---
haha nice of your raidlead, to let a person who cant even use the items or have farmed prebis to get an item, before raiders
---
Literally everyone who has any shot at getting rank 14 on a highly populated server.  That's the main predicate to this conversation.
---
its around 70-75% since the xfer from stalagg and other servers. Used to be 90% before that. There was at least 20 alliance camping in front of any high level dungeon. It was impossible to gather or mine.
---
Good to know, i still find it hilarious that the dude started eating though
---
Well if you are farming naxx what do you want out of MC anymore, outside of thunderfury?
---
So for me I don't go to the hotzones like tarren mill but instead spend most of my time rn in blasted lands so it's not going to change much here since I don't seek out larger than "natural" (clearly its natural for players to want to PvP but the zones werent designed for high levels for instance) zones and i'm not anticipating much change except for now having another type of PvP I can do.
---
These free transfers barely mitigate the problem. Most players just ignore it. All the layered servers right before P2 never stopped having queues during peak hours. It's ample evidence that optional free transfers don't work.

I am answering why people take the boat. It requires a lot less effort and is right there and already known way to get to the mainland. The same reason people wait for the Theramore boat to reach Theramore before heading to ONY. When they could jump off early and get to ONY way faster. It makes the decision and experience easier.

Outside the speculation, I've seen people who play private servers say they are quite confident they'll have a week 1 KT.  But that's a non-sequiter to the conversation above anyway.
---
I don't make the rules of the game,  a little constructive criticism and additional ideas instead of everyone here just downvoting and saying that's stupid and they want to profit by bringing their junk to a higher economy basically.  The 3 month cd doesn't stop the issue I mentioned though.  Low pop servers lotus be like 15g.  Big server 100g.  Easy money for a transfer and hurts the value on the server you transfer to where people had to farm those spots for hours on end just for 1 lotus because of competition.  What better idea you got than giving up gold and sellables to avoid that issue?  Paid transfers can only go to lower pop?
---
If you go to the bluepost, Blizzard stated the number of *characters* on servers *2 weeks prior to launch* was larger than in Vanilla. They also anticipated massive dropoff of players from each server post-launch (which was also confirmed/alluded to in the October Activision-Blizzard earnings report). I'm not sure it's possible that the number of players on each server in Classic WoW today is the same number as it was at launch.

Same here, for example i as warlock had hard time to get groups for strat if a mage was leader, never any response but as soon as i say i dont need crimson felt hat, just maleki footwraps, i get instant invite. Ofc the mage didnt wanna reserve since he said its douchey but imo its way more of a dick move to not let some1 join who might not even want the item he is looking for..
---
Meaning? I am confused? Is there a plan? What do they do?
---
The guild isn't worth your time or your gold. Ragnaros is *trivial*, along with the rest of Molten Core. You don't need flasks for MC, and if the raid is struggling so hard with taking down Ragnaros then, quite frankly, they are pretty bad at this children's video game.
---
Ya. I meant any downtime. There's just only a couple more between raid tiers.
---
Allow me to bluntly address it then. I don't give a shit about griefing and neither should you, honestly. It's such a small part of this game and walking away for 5 minutes whether in-game or IRL solves most griefing problems.
---
It might have worked with bg release if they hadn't said they were doing cross realm. Horse queues would've been insanely long and some would have left for better quues but since it isn't server specific there's no difference between servers for queue times
---
Drops from Eric "The Swift", an Alliance NPC whom can only be killed by Horde.
---
Who needs friends when you have money for 40 accounts?
---
Yeah good point
---
Do you use the full capacity of your mailbox?
---
I farm lotus myself. While playing a lot is helpful (as it is with anything in wow) there is no minimum amount of playtime necessary beyond a couple hours at a time, certainly no an 8 hour minimum. You have to know the most effective routes and how the timers work exactly.  Especially with layering, I was able to get 3-4 lotus per hour fairly frequently - no 8 hours necessary that number is completely bogus
---
It’s my first time playing WoW and I’m really enjoying it. I’ve gotten my hunter to 60, and have most of my pre-raid BIS gear. Now I’m thinking about making an alt. I was thinking about making a mage as they seem pretty broken to me, however my boyfriend suggests I try priest or shaman so I can get an idea of how the game works outside of a DPS perspective. 
---
Mostly I’m interested in something that isn’t too terrible to level on (hunter was really easy since I had a pet with me) and that is relatively beginner friendly, as I still consider myself to be new. I also plan to do mostly dungeons and raids, so I’m not too concerned with PvP. What would you all suggest?
---
I'm 60, but I was 2 manning with a warrior friend to get him chain and he was 52 at the time. It was a little rough, but doable. Two 60s shouldn't have much of an issue with just arena. Anger is another story though. (Also friend got HoJ at 49 and chain at 52, then saw another chain drop the same day his did. Other warriors in our guild were on suicide watch at the time lol. One guy had over 250 runs before he got his chain)
---
PvE is for pussies
---
I sold mine for 700g just before Dire Maul dropped.
---
It would, but then the nochanges idiots would start crying.
---
I meant 30. Whoops. 21/30/0
---
What you're talking about is a normal consequence of spell batching. What I'm talking about is an unwanted side effect of spell batching, which is devs not taking in account that today's players have better connections than before, and therefore players movements go faster than spells.
---
It's a function in wow that makes your character stroll/walk casually when you move as opposed to the default running.
---
This is mostly used by roleplayers (RPers) to make their characters look more casual in-game since you probably aren't running around all the time.
---
And so it has been dubbed RP walking.
---
I am in a pretty casual guild. We cleared mc with out any wipes for the first time this week after over a month. Every mc run we have been able to improve with a decent feeling of progress. We still are looking forward to being able to split raid and building out a second raid team so we are not out of content at all.
---
Soloing as a hunter just tagging with multishot, arcane and a volley here and there its pretty good honor
---
Oh gotcha, didn't know they weren't able to be killed by alliance
---
Oh so pumped for my level 52 warrior to get that sweet polearm
---
If you are playing classic only for the thrilling raid content I don't know what to tell you.
---
The problem there I think is the lower side of the imbalance would be most the people leaving making the imbalance worse.  Which is why blizzard started doing faction specific transfers to avoid that.  Allowing a paid transfer to circumvent that just causes more balance issues.
---
horde walljump? Care to eli5?
---
Aren’t add ons like spy making this worse though?
---
Furor and most of FoH were entitled assholes, out and out.  The true top guild of EQ was Afterlife (the guys who invented DKP, and one of the coleads made thottbot, if ya'll remember that).
---
Was going to post this. My man.
---
Sorry, not to be rude, but people who think that BGs are going to solve this problem are delusional. 
---
Given how many people are reporting horde dominated servers right now, BG queue times for Horde are going to very long. I played Vanilla and even in those days, most organized pvp groups would go gank in a manner similar to what we are seeing now between queues. It's the only way to maintain your edge in honor. The difference in then vs. now is that there are 2-3x more players on the server. When it's one or two 10 man groups ganking, nbd. When it's 3-6 10-man groups ganking, it's a big deal. 
---
While the introduction of BGs will likely lessen the amount of Horde doing what they are right now, it's not going away.
---
Google overfishing.
---
It is not intended.  
---
There is no way to play around it when it's literally nullifying some abilities that are supposed to be balanced.
---
Too soon™
---
That being said I can't wait to grind AV.
---
The problem is that a bunch of them already left, which left these realms in this state.
---
Yes. But it's only 30 days.
---
In the bigger guilds likely killing bosses with low kill times because their guild is over geared and beating the content faster than the normal fall off happens for dagger rogues meaning you're giving dagger rogues that absolute best case scenario which is the only reason they're performing as well as they are in those hyper specific situations. Theirs a reason the billions of data points collected have all shown that swords perform better than daggers by a wide margin outside of those exact situations which is why I clarified the extremely fast kill times. Maybe pull your head out of your ass and look at the billions of data points collected and not "this one guy this one time under ideal circumstances therefore it's always better!"
---
If you think killing players is meaningless I hope you play on a pve server.
---
If you can’t get into a premade group just chain your favorite bg.  I would play AV all day for rep rewards, then went to AB, then WSG.  I don’t think I was raiding yet so I was just grabbing the upgrades I could, and BG epics were the easiest for me at the time.  I’m not sure how long it takes to hit exalted with all 3 factions but you will be raking in a solid amount of honor over weeks/months.
---
They weren't pre bwl though, right?
---
Damage meters =/= pve balance. It's about what a class can bring to the raid, not how much damage they can do. Any pally can buff, any shaman can drop totems so in the current content they have balance as they fulfill a positive role for the group
---
This made me rofl. I used to do an impression of that intro at random points in our Vault runs XD
---
Early March. Heard it here first
---
Psh, your AVs ended? We fought on until the servers went down!
---
Who farm's essences? I need Elemental Fire's for Greater Fire Pots haha! Pretty funny to me that Essence of Fire goes for 3-5g and Elemental Fire 5-6g on my server.
---
I just got checked by my doctor, it was a scare, but he says I am cancer free after reading this entire thread.
---
Are there any pvp trinkets that can remove blind? Is a disorient, and poison based. I think only dwarves can remove blind early.
---
&gt;2 hours and 5 genocides later
---
Speaking of genocide, how about that Timbermaw Hold grind? Can't wait to hut exalted and have my faction leader yell about my accomplishment in "diplomacy" for slaughtering literally thousands.
---
The graveyard is so close, you must have been slacking then, or died just as the boat came to the harbour
---
It should have been released with the open beta version!
---
Yes, a 40-60 faction balance is less of a deal with smaller servers because there's far less players you can run into. 
---
If you have 20 players total in a zone, 8 of them being Alliance and 12 of them being Horde, PvP is going to be a lot different compared to having 100 players in a zone, 40 of them being Alliance and 60 of them being Horde. 
---
In the first case, you might have a small group hunting for solo players or getting into skirmishes with other small groups. In the second case you just get raids steamrolling over everyone they see until they meet a bigger raid.
---
Think of it like this. A 2 vs 3 skirmish, while obviously in favor of the bigger team, is winnable by both sides. A 20 vs 30 fight is a whole different story, even though the A:H ratio is the same in both cases. Hence why the total population size matters so much.
---
Yeah thats fair, I'd say Mages/Hunters are the 2 classes where it could be as good (possibly even better) than solo.  But for most, it's terrible.
---
Or let people play the way they want. At least it's a fair system with no room for interpretation.
---
 It's one of the few words used to described stupidity that doesn't have any politically incorrect discrimatory connotations.
---
I recently re-read most of the official Blizzard statements revolving the server cap, and every single one of them referred to layers. I haven't made anything up, and I can link you to the sources if you'd like.
---
I'd like to remind you that nobody was up in arms about the *concurrent player count* being higher than in actual Vanilla back when Blizzard announced any of this stuff because it was understood that Blizzard wasn't going to allow megaservers like Nost. It would've raised the biggest #nochanges stink to date if it were true.
---
No changes crowd never would have allowed faction based Queues, or any changes to the racials to balance out the hardcore PvP crowd. So yeah, in a way it was.
---
In my last dungeon there were 2 people who hadn't played in 15 years, they were rediscovering stuff at their own pace. But those arn't loud on forums or forcibly create hype via streaming...
---
I think this is the general consensus. Its just gotten so ridiculous I saw some guys doing it with mid level dungeons now although they seem to be having issues with filling those groups.
---
If you cant flask now, you wont learn to flask at all.
---
Throw all non flask dps in the bin.
---
14 days? Lol maybe for you
---
Play what you enjoy.
---
Hunters are fine right now. Locks are fine right now.
---
With the rushed speed on raid releases yeah you'll spend a few months as subpar but we'll be in BC before the end of 2020 anyway at this pace!
---
But they said they would simluate vanilla and it's kinda what most people want. I want the phases after P3 to slow down cause we will just run out of content..and fun.
---
AB was added much later In the game so it will come eventually
---
Lmao bad.
---
ohh has it?  fuck yah
---
I was responding to your accusation of slippery slope fallacy.  If you have trouble remembering what people are talking about the comments and replies cascade down and to the right so moving up and to the left takes you to a previous comment.  Am I going to fast for you?
---
Annnnnd the honor system wasn't added until 6 months after launch. Which would make it late Feb. 2020 and then BGs late March or early April 2020. 
---
Conclusion: BGs are ~4 months too early.
---
First time (1:17): he moused over her. She wasn't even stealthed.  The stealth warning pops up when she enters stealth.
---
Second time (2:40): it doesn't show her until she breaks stealth to attack. That should clue you in to it not detecting already-stealthed players.  
---
Third and fourth times (3:12, 4:22): It detected her before the clip started so there's no way to know what first triggered it, but she's not stealthed.  
---
Fifth and final time (5:18): We don't have anywhere near enough field of view to know where she was when she entered stealth., but that warning is shown only when the combat log says a user entered stealth (`if event == "SPELL_AURA_APPLIED" and (arg13 == L["Stealth"])`).  So she stealthed somewhere in combat-log range.
---
And what other thrilling content is there at 60? Other than pvp, which we’re getting now.
---
Thanks Asmon!
---
Dont forget fee for putting it up on ah, wich can eat at your profits, meaning you can just repost it at the price you want to forever.
---
You shouldn't have your pvp flag removed for using a flight path. It goes away on it's own after sitting in your factions territory for a set amount of time.
---
It was overcrowded servers [layering], not enough initial servers and slow rollouts of others, server transfers without regard to balance, and here we are.
---
And how classic will be ruined just like retail only this time it will take months instead of years.
---
You know when you move around normally? That's actually your character running. You can bind a key to "run/walk" to toggle between running and walking, kinda like in Diablo 2 when you run out of stamina and have to walk.
---
Yeah, bullshit.  The servers didn't have 50k population caps in vanilla.
---
Saying this "mirrors" vanilla is so far beyond ridiculous as to be asinine.
---
When flask of supreme power is 30% dps increase, yes it does fix bad.
---
I mean on my server you can figure spending 50 to 70g a week, as a healer, on consumes to get raid ready. This includes: GFPP, GAPP, Nightfin Soup, Major Mana Pots and Dark Runes. 
---
If you know what you're doing, or invest the time to figure it out, it's easily manageable (although it certainly slows down the epic mount grind). 
---
Flasks on my server are 100g a pop and don't offer near as much utility as GFPP or even GAPP. 
---
This doesn't even factor in the Blasted Lands consumes, Winterspring E'kos, all the DM Tribute buffs, Ony World Buff or Rend World Buff. 
---
Guild is clown shoes for suggesting mandatory Flasks for healers in MC. OP can leave guild now, or waste time and gold and then leave when BWL ultimately smashes the guild.
---
no you don't. it's inside a chest
---
basic stunlock?
---
CS, Hemo, Hemo, Gouge to 5, Energy tick x3, KS, Hemo, Hemo, Gouge, CS, CB Evis.
---
Im not too sure how well people can solo/kite, but I cant imagine DME can be too friendly to solo'ers. Its seems like itd be either too tight to move packs around or youd have to clear too many packs to make it worthwhile.
---
Na you just go on so many tangents about random shit. Its strawman and slippery slopes all the way down bud.
---
another one bites to dust
---
Dude you can’t complain, I’ve been searching murdering Moonstalker sires and matriarchs and only need 5 of their pelts but I’m stuck at 4 I’ve been doing this quest for the last two days in darkshore. I seriously think it’s bugged and I’m not gonna get that last pelt... gained a level and a half already...
---
i just brought in the client on a USB and slapped it in a computer, bada bing bada boom ya girl was in business
---
The druids.
---
This is actually a week later than I thought they would come out. I was expecting WSG to come out the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. I'm kind of disappointed that WSG and AV aren't being separated. I have a feeling the meta for optimal honor farming will be AV premade rush spams and people won't play WSG very much.
---
Also found 44 Eye of Shadows over in Winterspring, but who's counting. Sadly those are only 59-60 elites
---
What risk? Guards will never catch them in stealth and when they die to other players they just come back a couple mins later and do the same thing. There is no real risk.
---
We wearnt talking about AV we were talking about WSG
---
You realize that you've admitted multiple times now that you cant even tie your shoes without groups doing it for you right? One day youll grow up and realize how much of a tool you are.
---
As an Orc Rogue, I wish I resisted stuns this much.  I don't think I've ever resisted a cheap shot or kidney shot.
---
He can go to https://us.battle.net/support/en/restoration/characters and see where it lists his characters.
---
Holy nova is absolutely awful.
---
Oh I see you are literally just a novelty account based on shit arguments. Woops.
---
Every even lvl your class trainer will have moves for you to purchase, they cost money so save your money for skills primarily.
---
"Art"
---
I for one have a ton of fun.
---
I thought the pvp trinkets removed any type of cc or movement impairing effect.  Am I mistaking the Vanilla trinket for the BC trinket?
---
I mean that's pretty much what I said. Everything is coming too fast. This is vanilla accelerated.
---
classic players like the current iteration of spell batching and blizzard wont change it or else people will start making reddit threads about hong kong again
---
Lol ya i thought he just typo'd the title,  then noticed he said it again...
---
I dunno, I think BGs will fix a lot.  Until Honor dripped, people were all just running around farming and whatnot because there was nothing else to do.  Once BGs drop, lots of people will disappear from the world and occupy BGs instead.
---
Are you new? That's pretty standard.
---
I joined groups with stuff reserved as I wanted other stuff but after a while I just decided I wouldn't.   
---
It's your choice to start groups with your rules. It's my choice not to join.   
---
Play the game anyway you want.
---
Ambush another rogue and they'll just blind you, bandage and go for the cheap shot.
---
Will it help or hurt?
---
if someone paid me 100g i would blow my my guild on this
---
Av was easy as hell, AB however takes forever .. but damn the tabard is so nice!
---
Absolutely not an option for me.  I’m playing on my server, in part, to see the same people.  Seeing xxlegolas-(server name) will be the day I pull the plug.
---
This is depressing.
---
Blue post. Dec 10th...
---
These are BGs dude. Anyone over level 10 can do them.
---
With the average of 1:3 players on servers A:H and the feeling of something between 1:5  a D 1:10 a simple math is telling me this. If Alliance players will pvp less or the same in BGs that means quite a lot of horde pvpers will be in the queue. Considering how aggressive Horde players play this days and how defensive Alliance players play, I honestly believe somewhere between 50%-75% of horde pvpers will stay in the queue while Alliance players will have instant queue! Just pray for one thing dear H players, the frustration of corpse camping is growing and its growing, the frustration of being Honorless Target but still worth Honor is growing, the frustration of corpse camping and instant death becuase you worth full honor is growing, just pray for one thing, that there will be as many Alliance players as it is today on 10th December. That's why the Horde own the servers, because many left and many will leave. There is nothing in the game that can be added to ballance the frustration of the bugs I've listed above. I will see you on the 10th and I will laugh at your queue time threads! 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
---
You should look into elvui.
---
good to know, i’ve been spending on gear upgrades
---
You're assuming. it's pretty much a 45/55 ratio on my server. Both factions are very much alive.
---
Even if you're the overrepresented faction you can still lose hard and vice versa. It's based on how much input you're willing to give. It's like people that never create dungeon groups who always expect to find groups. If you're not also actively engaging in the game content you're damaging it indirectly.
---
And if you're not willing to engage, in this case WPvP, then you shouldn't have gone on a PvP server. But everyone always wants to assume that they are the ones ganking, and never be ganked. But as soon as the "ganker" get's ganked, it suddenly stops being appealing and rather ask everyone around them to change instead of changing themselves.
---
It has always been like this on PvP servers, where people just want easy kills, and never want to see the fact that it goes either way. Not something Blizzard should cater to. Like I said, if you're rolling on a PvP server you shouldn't cry about PvP. You can just as easily find 10 people to gank 2 players. Even if you're the underrepresented faction. But it all depends on the input someone is willing to give themselves to make it relevant, instead of crying about it.
---
PvP servers have not, and never will be fair to anyone playing it. It's something you will have to accept the moment you hop on a PvP server.
---
7 runes to douse, otherwise spot on.
---
Each class’s PVP trinkets can only remove 3 of 6 CCs. Stun, Fear, Charm, Snare, and 2 others I forget. Polymorph and something else probably.
---
I'd drop Anticipation for Improved Sunder and Improved Taunt.  Anticipation is pretty low impact in the grand scheme of things and improved sunder and improved taunt are extremely nice to have when tanking 5mans.
---
no its impossible in all orders
---
I'll have to give that a shot.  I really need to level my pally.
---
$$.  In support, there are people who know what they're doing, and get paid more.  Then there are the ones who answer the tickets, and they have a shit ton of canned responses that they use, including the one I mentioned above, and things like "This is not a known issue," though you can look those things up and they are known issues.  So they pay those people min wage/lower wages to copypasta shit into the ticket window.
---
Especially Gehennas. It's packed real full. Free transfers are indeed available.
---
is that fuckin staff of the blessed seer on all of em
---
Cross server BGs is more okay (in my personal opinion, at least).  I think they meant realms themselves being cross-server.
---
It's baffling how many don't realize this even though the liquid details are clearly identical as post-Catacylsm clients.
---
Sadly the raid bosses didn't get this memo when handing out loot. Shoving phases so quickly down our throats is gonna leave a lot of people unhappy with their gear acquirement. And what is the fun to get gear that is rendered sub optimal so quickly after you got it? Starts to feel like an alternative timeline of titanforging gone wrong.
---
What about quests that only require the proof that you killed something? Not every raptor head has to have both eyes or even an intact skull.
---
Yeah, you seem like a real nice guy. I'm sure everyone else is the problem.
---
That's a bummer on both fronts. The intra-server rivalry helped build active communities. Also disappointed about the AV, it was fun as a lowbie to focus on the quests and contributing other ways.
---
You should add that it's possible to have one way faction transfers too, so you don't get the problem of the other side swapping over.
---
3 to 4 death to START running an instance was considered not oppressive? What the hell is so fun about wow PvP that you guys all choose to endure this, there's literally hundreds of other PvP games out there...
---
Could’ve prob cast blizzard on them too. But nice work.
---
It's class specific, for reference, the druid one is charm, fear, stun.
---
i think it's BRD &gt; ZF &gt; DM N
---
but they're all pretty close to each other.
---
the BRD farm is probably the most difficult, but it can be insanely profitable if you sell the XP.  Just advertise like 20g/hour to be in the group and lvl 50s will pay to leech xp from the mobs you kill.
---
Nope but a lot of redditors ad hominem my user name when they have no actual point.
---
People who live in glass house should not throw stones u/I_Fap_To_Zamasu_2

---
My college has wow firewalled, any work around?
---
Dwarfs can stoneform out of blind.
---
You sure that's a good idea? If someone is away from the keyboard and you kill them, technically that's "Free HK".
---
That's a false dichotomy and you have personally chosen the "best" solution and declared it to be the only alternative solution.  That's not how this works.
---
They should have had more servers to begin with, they should have seen the pvp bias coming, they should have given south America a realm in the first place, they should have gauged how quickly servers were "filling" with name changes and encouraged different servers earlier, there are countless things they should have done differently.
---
"Do you want the game or not?" is a disingenuous, reductive way to approach the problem we are facing
---
I hate people who rather than reserve just don't invite classes that can use whatever item it is they want.
---
Like bruh, I don't need anything besides the Chromatic Carapace and I don't even *need* that, I just want it for reasons.
---
Warlock or Rogue and avoid all the PvP till BGs start. No point wasting down time leveling when you are just bait for the HKers
---
At the beginning a lot of people assumed ~4 months per phase. Giving us 2 years of Classic WoW. Which is a very reasonable timespan.
---
We're 3 months in and already on Phase 2,5. They will have to release the other 3 phases over a year time-frame? I don't know what will happen, but releasing content early because catering players is just wrong imo. Activision antics all over again.
---
Uhhhhhh no. The honor system wasn't added until 6 months after launch. If they stuck to the original release schedule that would have been late Feb 2020 for Classic.
---
They're pushing everything too fast.
---
I suspect they're doing it to keep the no lifers busy so they don't jump ship, which is misguided as the no lifers aren't likely the majority of classic players. Some of us will just keep playing vanilla for years and years after the no lifers head onto the next shiny.
---
Uhm no.
---
No wonder you are lost, he's talking about AV.  WSG is like perfectly symmetrical.
---
Engineering and dynamite
---
what i did for this was set up a client to play on a private server, moved that client to a USB, and then put in the pc and it worked just fine
---
It depends on the class. Only certain classes pvp trinket takes off fear for example.
---
Im not sure which was which but it should read somewhere... its definitely not all CC.

I played Alliance on Jubei'Thos oceanic realm in Vanilla and this sounds very familiar, lots of just rush games once the NPC's were nerfed.
---
You can just refresh the duration though, takes just a few seconds every 4 weeks.
---
You may be able to open a support ticket.  It gets a little bit hairy with raid loot but a guildie of mine had ~200g of enchanting materials stolen and then the person xferred off the server.  Support managed to suspend the offending account and get my guildie his stuff back.
---
True. Rogue main here but my alt is an undead priest and I am super thankful I don't have to deal with WotF. What a nightmare that would be.

Don’t you think a bunch of angry ally would switch so they can be the bully now?
---
Hehe yep. Our dps are finally starting to push our tanks threat, but only because they're starting to push into the 800s. It's making me look at my gear and figure out what a good balance of threat and mitigation is. I dont think I can get enough crit to make furyprot worth it yet, so I have to work with what I have.
---
More than that actually. Honor was added 6 months after launch, BGs ~6 weeks after that.
---
Its not about the speed or the raid, but the amount of loot it drops. Shaving of weeks or even months of the original timeline is gonna leave a lot of people unhappy with their gear acquirement.
---
1.Use spy and detect rogues from across the map. 
---
2. In stealth, rogues are moving 15% to 30% slower than normal walking speed, use this to your advantage and mount up or have swiftness pots available to get you spell in during the batch window.
---
3. Every class has to deal with negative consequences of batching, rogues can get their vanish batched with an AA and have it do absolutely nothing, a sap can be missed on an enemy due to them moving out of range. Heals can go off during the batch where a tick of damage kills a friendly unit, (even though you had a successful cast and used Mana) 
---
4. I highly doubt they'll change batching because it's highly engrained into the vanilla system
---
Enjoy your stay.
---
Noooope.  That came way later
---
Wait what? I thought it was 1k? I have 800g right now on my char!
---
Better kill poison cleansing totem, too.
---
Same on Viskag.  
---
I have become a legend and meme among my guild. They see me log on and say "Looks lile Greenman is signing on to play more World of Rendcraft".

One run I did with guildies and the MH dropped. Rolled and tied with another guildie. He got the weapon. That was round run 40.  
---
Around run 70 I stopped taking other rogues or warriors unless they were orc warriors. Tried resetting to find Jed for the healer. Only reset 3 times, but got locked out. Guild did the run while waiting for my lockout, offering to take me on the next one or if I could get in before Rend died all swords would pass to me. They kill Rend, OH drops, I am still locked out. FML.
---
I have been tempted to give up, grind gold and buy a Krol Blade and run Mirah's song OH until Viskag/Brutality drop. But this many runs in, it seriously has to happen soon and I want to get them just on principle at this point.  
---
At least I got my Truestrike shoulders lol
---
It’s easier to just do a /who lookup before and not invite rogues. “Sorry we have too many rogues already”.  I don’t think anyone else would roll would they?
---
55-45 ratio. Both factions are pretty equally represented at max level.
---
No need to assume to fit some narrative you have pre-set in your head to make your own arguments make sense.
---
- Rank 1 frost nova x 2 = 110 mana
---
- Fire ward = 320 mana  
---
- Arcane Explosion x ~3 = 1170 mana 
---
Blast Wave = 545 mana
---
Ice Block x2 = 30 mana 
---
CoC = 555 mana 
---
Mana Shield = 1140 mana 
---
Total = 3870 mana
---
Average is actually closer to 8
---
I'd love to but the ingame ticket system isn't working for me. How can I go about submitting one?
---
Just stfu about it. Keyring was late in vanilla
---
Wish I could upvote this twice.  They’re so fucking annoying in pvp.
---
This, but with no Perds/CHT either.  We have more Mageblades than melee weapons in total.
---
That’s kinda a weird a mean thing to say.
---
Damn. Feel for ya bro. 😬 Apologies on behalf of my class?
---
I mean, the boss elemental has a pretty good chance to drop the "Ace of Elementals" card, which will probably sell for an absurd amount of gold in classic. Just saying.
---
Not when I play orc
---
Because the 3-4 deaths was only about 15-20 horde. That's something you can actually group up and fight against as something like a UBRS group. Sometimes the Alliance would actually hold onto the mountain Pre-P2...it is right next to our major city after all. 
---
Now that P2 is here, there's literally hundreds of Horde players and there's nothing you can do about it without bringing the entire population of IF over to fight them.
---
Last time I saw a mage blink in a situation like that he accidentally fell from the canyon xD
---
Please post some videos of raids or stream it
---
Or you could just corpse run one time -- which is probably going to be far less time. But anything to avoid PvP on the PvP server you rolled on, right? Darn faction imbalances making me not want to do 1v1s.
---
Did you ever give Vanguard a whirl?  It had the same idea where the dungeons are shared.  The dungeons in that game had some pretty decent design and ambiance.
---
This is why I like watching skarm. When he loses, it's always "I got outplayed. I fucked up. Took a bad match and paid for it." There's little no salt, and the blame goes internal
---
Every multiplayer game dies. It's about the journey and the experience. If you aren't enjoying it, the game isn't for you, and that's perfectly fine. There's a ton of games out there, single player and multiplayer. 
---
I wouldn't trade this experience for anything, cause it only happens once.
---
IIRC If you downrank one of the flamestrikes it’ll stack.
---
Today I spent more time trying to just get into the instance with my party than actually running the entire dungeon after.
---
I’ve seen a queue almost every other day but it’s o my a 20 minute queue during the afternoons.
---
sounds gay
---
But that's exactly the point I'm making, this **isn't** no changes, spell batching back in vanilla wow didn't have this side effect since player movements were also affected by lag. This shitty side-effect is unique to Classic because of the way they poorly implemented spell batching.  
---
Do you even understand what I'm saying ?
---
As hpal my experience is to /sigh and use bubble to continue running as far as I can in the direction I was heading before they kill me. I don't fight back and I don't go looking for PvP. 
---
Occasionally while traveling to an instance my party will kill some one and that's about all.
---
My guild's been unlucky with Band of Accuria and Quick String Ring (and there's a lot of us in the running for it anyway), so Don Julio's will be a nice filler.
---
I hate twitch chat culture
---
Free Hong Kong
---
No. You are the entitled fuck. Not the person making the group and rules.
---
Dying loses buffs for raiding. 
---
The objective is to avoid getting ganked in major cities with buffs so you can raid log for the week. 
---
So no, corpse running isn’t an option
---
If you get Rank 3 IIRC it drops another 10% from the initial cost.
---
Oh shit I'm on Grobbulus. Alliance rogue. See you around
---
So i rolled Shadowburn and love the burst of Shadowbolt, coil, burn!
---
Makes me wanna try SM/Ruin for some big crits!
---
Ty :D
---

Also not a quest drop but you’re telling me coarse gorilla hair can’t be found on every fucking gorilla. And worse still when you find one you only take one single hair!?
---
Does having a pet out make u show up? Trying to figure out what all makes you show up or not.
---
name is reserved for a month after deleting a char so they probably transfered
---
What isn't working?  It appears to be working for me.  Help &gt; Open a Ticket
---
I sure cannot wait to go to a discussion board to have it filled with complainers repeating the same things over and over - said no one ever. 
---
Threatening to quit on a reddit thread is pissing in the wind. No. One. Cares. 
---
Quit the game if you are that mad. 
---
It doesn't need to be reposted every 10 mins and then upvoted so that other complainers can circle jerk together about how discontent they are. 
---
That is toxic behavior. Its a zero sum race to the bottom around who can have the hottest whiner take. 
---
One dude quiting the game (he won't quit he just wants the attention) will not affect the course of classic, or Activision.
---
It's my fault and I really don't want to reroll cause itd be my third reroll with no 60s.. but it's absolutely miserable right now. Oh well I guess.
---
Yup, I’m right there with you. Rogue main here, started in Vanilla. Been playing off and on since. I understand the premise of the add on and whatnot but I just don’t want it. It just kills part of the game. I get that it’s not telling you anything you can’t figure out yourself but like come on.. I’m here to play the game myself. Addons are great but this one adds to the “make it easier for me” bucket.
---
Dude, people make fun of each other over what kind of phone they have, computer they use, car they drive, drinks they drink... it’s just another “vs” in a long, long, long list of things.
---
&gt; They should have had more servers to begin with
---
Vaguely ironic that you call me out for positing a solution and then proceed to do so. If it was economically and technically viable you have to imagine that more servers would have been an obvious mechanism but they’re a business and they didn’t go that route. Economics aside they didn’t have good numbers on how many people were going to continue playing once nostalgia wore off and the leveling curve kicked in, so a bunch of barren servers they’d have to crumble was also a real possibility without any solution.
---
The point of my post was that solutions seem obvious and the more obvious they seem the more you should wonder if you’re missing some detail.
---
&gt; “Do you want the game or not?" is a disingenuous, reductive way to approach the problem we are facing
---
“They should have had 20/20 foresight based on our 20/20 hindsight” isn’t any better:
---
I don't even know how this whole system works and I know for certain. Your post is hot garbage lmao.
---
I've done this quest many times lol, it's never been a 100% drop rate.
---
At this rate were gonna be done with classic sometime next year
---
rank 4 on a pvp server
---
Ok and what happens when you spend DKP on an Obsidian Edge Blade and then Bonereaver's Edge drops right after? The same thing can happen in literally just MC.
---
You see how this guy is enjoying world pvp instead of complaining about it?  Why don't you try to be more like him.

Based on the length of the time that the spell "should" take to cast, your +spell damage will increase the potency of that spell. I say "should" because an ability such as Presence of Mind from the Arcane Tree will Instacast your spell but still apply the full bonus as if it took the whole duration to cast.
---
All spells that take 3.5 seconds to cast or longer will receive 100% of the +spell power, and different cast lengths will provide less, to a %. If I recall, DoTs will do 100% of the spell power, evenly split through every tick of the spell.
---
Example: You have +100 spell damage and +100 fire Damage gear.
---
You cast Fireball for 500 damage. 3.0 second cast, 100% benefit, your spell will do 500 + 100 spell damage + 100 fire damage for 700 Fire damage (not counting enemy fire resist).
---
You cast Mind blast for 500 damage. 1.5 second cast, 42% benefit, your spell will do 500 + 42 spell damage + 0 fire damage for 542 Shadow damage. Since the spell does not do fire damage, you don't benefit from any of that +fire gear you're wearing.
---
Thanks! (:
---
I'm surprised more people don't post this kind of fanart more often. It's not like there's a shortage of talented artists from what I've seen. I'm guessing it has to do with the game being 15 years old lol. Been there done that type of deal.
---
Priest is pretty easy to level, and a lot of fun. It's also really easy to find groups for dungeons if you're willing to heal. You can also heal most dungeons up to level like 50 as a shadow priest with no points in holy. I dont know about dungeons above level 50 because my priest is only level 50. Would highly recommend trying them out.
---
Thabks for the well thought out reply.  Quick question for youthough, so how would i form premades with players from other servers?
---
Got feared 100-0 yesterday by a gnome lock. Couldn't use WotF because I was still on my mount. 
---
I honestly don't know how non-undead handle the frustration.
---
The devils tower in wyoming definitely served as inspiration for Thunderbluff

Ive even seen something about a native american tribe who built a structure on a similar rock or at least a very steep mountain but i couldnt find it
---
That’s how I use to play RuneScape. 4 accounts at once on 1 screen for minimal drag. But knew my main account would be better if I stopped. Today I tagged a multi boxer running into an instance. And the douche kills me with his main. It’s like alright then I’ll kill an alliance for ya
---
Druid is easy to level with or without a group, and gives you some introduction into tanking and healing.  It’s lightweight tanking with only a few things to be concerned with (not too many abilities), and the heals are good.
---
Not if looked and played like Vanilla wow. The moment 100 of people were lining up to kill one random quest mob people would leave, if not earlier. No one would have switched from ESO or F14 to this. You think some 15 year old kid is would chose to start playing this as his main game now? The only ones playing would be like 25 30 year old guys that are lore fans who played Wc3 back in the days. It would be nowhere near the popularity it has now, especially not THE BEST GAME OF 2019.
---
What’s the portrait addon called?
---
So you're one of those.  Roll on pvp, complain about pvp.
---
Fire hot? Maybe even hotter? Fires hot like hell? Haha no hellfire is already the name of an ability
---
My hearth is set there
---
Hey to be fair, we are good at smashing.  Never said we were smart...
---
Alliance has a much easier time rushing nerfed AV you just have to run in and take the GY while Horde need to do that specific wall jump.
---
Blizzard devs all play Horde. It's a known fact. They don't care if there are no Alliance guild able to compete on pvp servers
---
Solid guilds definitely don't clear MC in 40 minutes.  45-minute clears are the top 5% of the guilds right now, which I would classify as a hardcore guild.
---
A 50 percentile clear is around 2hr to 2hr 10m based on what I see on warcraft logs.
---
You can dismount while cced!:)
---
1) You are 100% full of shit, because there's no way for you to actually know what the population statistics really are on your server.
---
2) Even so, you're just confirming my suspicion that you have absolutely no idea what it's like to be overwhelmingly outnumbered.
---
You have never pvp'd then.  It is currently bugged. Orcs have more than a 75% chance to resist ALL stuns.
---
Orcs resist like 30% of stuns and undead are immune to fear. 
---
Luckily, trolls and tauren are the most picked race... right?
---
Apparently he was offered 100g to do it if he got the bomb
---
If you're coming from Theramore or most other places, flying to Thalanaar and running from there to DM is faster.
---
I've also seen this with troubling frequency for the last week or so.  I'm at ~35ms latency.
---
The Death Note mod is kind of breaking the rank 14 grind.
---
&gt; I'm not full BIS yet and won't be for a while
---
You will never be full BIS at any point in vanilla. Vanilla drop rates are way too low for anyone to reasonably expect to have full BIS before the next raid tier unless the guild is literally funneling all gear to them.
---
Yo I never thought of just not playing to solve the pvp problem, everyone should do this then!.. oh wait
---

Should be
---
It wasn't added on top of it.  That's how Vanilla was.  The game mechanics are mirroring what we had in Vanilla as close as they can.  They aren't remastering the game with loads of improvements every place they can.
---
Did you have a stroke whilst writing that?
---
No but I will be in my right to roll for vendor as well on BoP’s as it IS the same thing. How else would you set the bar? On what amount of gold is need need and greed greed
---
Problem is your username is actually relevant to your trash level comments. Sorry bud, not my fault you fit the bill.
---
Any allies on thunderfury read this... how has world pvp been for you? I see horde dropped both world bosses in an hour after they were released, and I wonder if it's worth trying for them as allies?
---
Multiboxers suck chode
---
I played a Paladin back in Vanilla and BC, so maybe I was just so used to having a way to break all CC I thought the trinket had that power.  I really could have sworn the pvp trinket was able to break pretty every CC or slowing effect.  When did that happen?  I didn't play the game after Wrath.
---
Riposte and the related parry are nice for leveling or questing in general.  But it won’t do anything for you in raids and dungeons unless you have aggro and then something has already gone wrong.
---
I personally don’t take it but it’s not a “bad” choice.  I tend to put those points into sprint and evasion.
---
It absolutely is the most fair
---

---
What do you mean by letting the enrage's rage run out?  What's the benefit?
---
&gt; next year Naxx is out
---
Why would Naxx be out next year if BWL is a full 6 months after MC? With a 6 month raid release pace Naxx wouldn't be out until 2021.
---
Is this a limited timed event?
---
Dont care if its in minority, still doesnt make you right :-)
---
Rogue 19, because the face roll is real bruh
---
Well, once you *do* get into a MC/BwL raid or AV, Alliance is pretty ez-mode.
---
A rusty dagger, just like the sleeper.
