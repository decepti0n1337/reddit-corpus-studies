You're to stupid to have this conversation with if you think that's the only way to compare people

if thats true then just stay dead for 5min instead cause that works
---
You want some lotion for those shoulders? You are really reaching.
---
Without any Alliance to gank maybe the Horde will get up to shower once in a while, maybe even go outside
---
Asmon let's it's slide as a form of free promotion for himself since lots of viewers of those channels are non-subscribers or don't watch on Twitch, but if they enjoy the content it pulls enough people in to start watching him live that it benefits him still. a very symbiotic relationship, between him and those channels. I'm pretty sure catdany is in his guild and maybe assertonsin too.
---
Yeah I don't get how people think advertise getting banned on twitch wasn't obvious since he clearly breaks the TOS of targeting and harassing streamers OR EVEN talking about other streamers which is also against tos.Probably why asmon doesn't even deal with advertise anymore. He hasn't watched a video on his stream since he got banned because he can't.
---
Everyone is moaning about classic wow now. üòÇ
---
Have you considered that perhaps the honor system is garbage and was removed for a reason. If you want to succeed then cheap, fast honor farming is the method of success. Modern games use MMR systems for a reason where win rate against equal or better ranked opponents is what determines your rank.
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking specifically about pvp. Frequently class abilities are just too strong or new trinkets are not tried out. It is mostly evident in m+. A lot of this is found in ptr but not changed until it hits retail for a bit. Those usually get patched at least.
---

---
Armor clipping is something has plagued certain classes and heritage armor sets that will probably never be fixed.
---
Oh i get why people are pissy, I really didn't mean irrelevant to the world, just to the topic discussed which is asmon being a persona and not the real whatever his real name is.
---
Good for you, barely playing the game. We are twinning!
---
Definitely me, part of the reason I'm still leveling an alt is for tbc/wotlk

WSG and AB.

AV is fun for the first few hours but becomes boring outside of that. I think a lot of people are sick of the Zerg raids as well.
---
WoW just doesn‚Äôt really work with mass scale pvp.
---
Really though i‚Äôm looking forward to pug vs pug games. So much of my private server pvp experience was ruined due to queue dodging and having 90% of games being a 1 sided shitfest.
---
Why would you call me a racist? Because I called out an actual racist?
---
If its 8v1 in a BG its going to be your team's fault.  Speaking as an Alliance player.
---
Cross-realm BGs ruined WoW.  Having to look for a premade and not be an ass hole in that group to stay in it, creates a more positive and engaged community.
---
You can be an ass hole in a dungeon regardless of whether it‚Äôs LFR or not. The majority of players will simply be jumping into pve for fun and pre-bis grind. And while it is fun to see players you know in dungeons, it‚Äôs really not necessary for most people. They just want to kill stuff and get gear. And if LFR means we can get into dungeons faster, then the majority of people will want that.
---
No need, plenty of video footage of Asmon whining and banning people that call him out on getting carried.  Also a video of Esfand having horde follow him around and helping him pvp.  Its all out in the open.  People have been banned for less in vanilla.
---
No it's what happens because there really isn't that much content if you play 8 hours every day.All you can really do is farm gold and pvp.
---
the school shooter music turned me off
---
My screen i guess... Turns out randomly pressing print screen can get weird...
---
I was actually. If you look far enough into my post history you would be able to see that I was in my early 20‚Äôs during vanilla and no, I didn‚Äôt play vanilla. I started at the beginning of BC.
---
Lol i never have to crawl my way in brm. I solo camp brm and searing gorge along with dozens of other horde. The alliance literally only have the same core pvpers day after day. Who literally pvp in groups of 7-10. Who get smashed by all the solo pvpers in the zone.
---
how about now?

We run three tanks, one is a bear.  We‚Äôd just rather sacrifice 50-100 dps keeping our Nightfall on our two Retribution Paladins. They embrace being a support DPS and aren‚Äôt against being cleansers and Nightfall carriers during raids. It‚Äôs not like they aren‚Äôt going to get the 2handers for other content, but their doing their part to support.
---
On a PvP server, having PvP force upon you IS playing the game. That is the entire point of PvP servers. 
---
You don‚Äôt like that, PvE servers exist.
---
"Simple mechanics" is a relative term. Either way, simple or complex, mechanics are still the hardest part of PvE for both novice and skilled players alike. Learning and executing boss mechanics is pretty much the entire game as far as PvE goes.
---
‚ÄúThere will never be anybody pvping on a pve server‚Äù I‚Äôm on a pve server and there‚Äôs a ton of world pvp 24/7
---
This is why I went PvE realm route...BG's where going to implemented..I'll do my PvP in there.  
---
I rather level in peace.

Blizzard: does nothing to keep 50/50 balance on it's servers
---
Blizzard: adds rewards for treating opposite faction players as mobs
---
Blizzard: while fixing queues gives free transfers to both factions on servers with already shit balance
---
Players: we need honor
---
Idiots: look how could you blame blizzard here!
---
Blizzard actually hired GMs in Vanilla. Everything is automated these days so good luck getting them banned.
---
Asmongoloid and his people up to shady stuff? Nah, you can‚Äôt be serious.
---
Fury tanks are easily far better than any Ret.
---
Thankgod im on transcendence feels pretty healthy populationwise
---
People who stayed on flamelash i take my hat off. To those who left i frown upon, you ruined it. Iam horde and an ally is KOS target, but you dont need to leave server.

stream your 8 hour AQ raids for me, sounds awesome.

I wish I was creative enough to make this up.
---
Some great nostalgic clip right there. Even the music reminds me of 2005
---
&gt; I've invested 17 days into my character and I'm not starting again from scratch. 
---
That's your option - level to 60 again, which if you play regularly will not take more than 3 or 4 weeks at the most. Once you hit 60 again, it shouldn't be a big deal to start gearing up again, assuming you are in an active guild. Classic has always been a social game and our progress depends a lot on what your guild is doing.
---
No, and its happened more than once to me and my group.
---
And you're a moron who is comparing someone who was accused of being involved with pedophilia and a bunch of other illegal shit to a fucking WoW player who talks shit in a video game and triggers idiots like you on Reddit.
---
I bet you're seething that you have to work 9-5 while Asmongold can sit on his ass, talk shit in a 15 year old game and rake in 6 digits per month.
---
Imagine paying for 2 accts just because you drove off the opposing faction from the server lmao.
---
Yeah, you were complaining that no-one ever answers you, so I made up an answer. You're welcome.
---
Exactly this. I‚Äôm just mentally warn out after braking a dungeon.
---
So what are you saying?  They should be banned?  But wont because its automated?  Or they don't cheat so shouldn't be banned?  Make up you mind.
---
PvP is either gnome or dwarf.  PvE is Human.
---
If those are your only two options and you mainly PvP, gnome hands down.
---
The guilds aren't really the issue, it's the people themselves.
---
Im so desperete im paying 12‚Ç¨ a month to only make reseting my Mararuns more easily.
---
I'm not surprised a bigot would lie.
---
Perhaps you should stop being so close minded, you'll be happier if you open your mind up a bit, but I don't expect someone like you who is a self proclaimed racist to do that. I think your bigotry has you too hard.
---
And reroll pve cause you clearly suck at pvp. You wouldn't be crying like an 8 year old child about getting killed in pvp otherwise.
---
Maybe you should just reroll. Far from ideal, but you'll be better in the long run.
---
You're not 14 and you still act like this? Oof baboof.
---
Tuesday eu.  We‚Äôd na is how I understood it.
---
No there's something inherently different about horde players that makes them bad and alliance good
---
War + Sham can 2 man very easy
---
I think he knew what was going to happen but wanted to see if Asmon would passively or actively support the guild member accused of win-trading. Getting kicked means he gets to shout from the rooftops that Asmon is not only allowing it to happen, but encouraging and cultivating it by gkicking anyone who complains or calls the cheaters exactly what they are.
---
Lol the longest part of AQ is traversing the dungeon. Even doubling time to kill every boss would add maybe 10% time on the raid.
---
He‚Äôs talking out of his ass
---
People don't really understand because of 1.12 items and this "bug" making crit cap nonexistent that we're doing as much damage as people were doing in AQ/Naxx during actual vanilla. Could say it's arguably more because of consumables/world buff and raid comp minmaxing.
---
In general, the cost of premade over self built has gone way down. Depending on how much you spend on parts, it's also a good investment to have it built for you as failure to part installation is generally covered by the builder (microcenter is a close store to me. They break the part installing, you get a new one)
---
Ok, this all very solid stuff, especially the stat and stances. Thanks for it.
---
"Taken over", stop flagging in your own capitals lol.
---
Playing a caster sucks when you have spell pushback.
---
I believe your options are either power world shielding yourself to avoid the pushback until they break it with enough damage or fear them away and start casting. There's also a talent in discipline that helps with spell pushback a tiny bit, I think.
---
Don't underestimate the effect that range has in 1v1s. Warriors can do nothing to you if you stay far enough away for them to not be able to melee you but close enough for them to not be able to intercept you. Hunters can do nothing to you if you stay in their deadzone. Put swp and devouring plague on the target and run away if you need to.
---
Try to bait out their interrupts by cancelling your cast. Classic wow's built in lag system can even make it possible to get a heal off anyway even if they try to interrupt it. Once they waste their interrupt, feel free to shield and heal up.
---
Herod has good ally pvpers and a lot of idiot horde zergs, sounds like it's what you want
---
People want to project there problems on someone else to not have to think about it might be them
---
Hearth to stormwind then take the tram to IF
---
As a fellow casual with a busy life, I must warn you! Do not roll as a minority faction on an unbalanced high population server. The game will become unplayable. You won't be able to take ships. You won't be able to quest. You won't be able to play most of the game. At least wait till BG's are out to see what they do.
---
this isn't an imageboard mate
---
And don't forget timing of SS as well because you lose DPS if you SS late into a swing
---
I'm really looking forward to BGs in general for this reason - even numbers. Maybe playing alliance on a horde-dominant PVP server over phase 2 has made me saltier than the Red Sea, but it'll be interesting to see how the horde perform when it's an even fight and not 10-man gank squads ganging up on level 49 players while spamming G o B a C K t O R e T A i L.
---
Could well be a rude awakening for honor farmers whose "world PVP" didn't involve any actual PVP.
---
I remember it the way the other guy says. They ran into the problem with rolling out new servers and them not having the AQ gates open. I remember this being some time in Wrath.

I‚Äòm glad none of my guildies participate in this shitty city raids. We‚Äòre looking for Horde PvP Groups in Felwood/WS/SG etc, but not directly in their capital. 
---
We‚Äòre Lucifron Refugees and got camped in If too
---
I see I struck a nerve. You can be better than that, dude. I believe in you.
---
Yikes. I literally logged in yesterday for the first time in months too. Didn‚Äôt go to a main city, but last time I‚Äôd be leveling there were a few people around and there were none at all now. I didn‚Äôt realize there‚Äôd been big server issues.
---
Would just like to clarify some things because you‚Äôre wrong about a lot of things. 
---
Asmongold plays the game when he‚Äôs off stream. When he‚Äôs on-stream he‚Äôs entirely an entertainer. He‚Äôs been like that for quite a while. 
---
The runs weren‚Äôt done by his guild, the runs were done by randoms in chat and it took him multiple runs before he could get enough lvl 60‚Äôs geared enough to finish MC. His actual guild runs seem relatively fine and anyone who plays the game deals with some loot drama. 
---
Agree with everything else. He really should tone down some of the toxicity and saltiness in his streams.
---
assuming all other BIS items it is, not by a lot but its still worse
---
you trade 2% crit for hit and some AP

SC+dsaur still comes out on top

Uh, Druid tanks will absolutely play all three in MC.  Your decurse is a lot more valuable on Shazzrah than some melee DPS.  Add in FR gear for the trash and/or Ragnaros and you're looking at carrying almost four full sets of gear, plus tanking consumables.
---
Somehow I accidentally highlighted and Googled "stalagg edition" from the title and the first thing that came up was Mein Kampf lmao.

3 mages warlock and priest is the normal spell cleave comp.

Lock uses eye of kelrog or w/e it's called, pulls about 10 mobs with it, mages aoe shit down.

Theres a lot of nuance to it but you'll figure it out.

This is super wholesome. I just got Classic and I hope I get some positive interaction like this during my playthrough!

So what after 4 kills they get 0 honor anyways.

---
Easy to be....what's the last part supposed to be? Green? This post makes no sense.
---
You're not wrong, but nobody should have to spend 5 minutes dead upon arrival in their own capital city just to avoid being killed over and over.
---
What percentage of alliance players do you think are refugees from horde dominated servers looking for their chance at some oppression memes?
---
I agree horde isn't the problem, it was just the optimal choice for the people who wanted to cause the problem.
---
No, its on a timer regardless.   So even if your server has literally ZERO alliance, the gates still open eventually.
---
Razorgore, the egg room right?
---
what about for pally? theres no fury spec and i dont think crits do much
---
something that's more useful than a 60% mount when i already have a 100%. so literally anything?
---
Thats an interesting way to spell "giving their mains free honor"
---
&gt;It's just a term describing probability offhandedly. 
---
No, that's what the term "usually" means. In no universe are "usually" and "statistically" used interchangably.
---
Thank you for sharing this story. 
---
I feel your pain, sinse i am in the same situation, on Flamelash, after the transfers are closed. I am casual player, but was playing a bit more then you, got to 60, got some pre-raid gear, lvled my alchemy and skinning and even got just a bit of gold and reputation on the server.
---
 I need to admit that i am not a huge fan of pvp and did pvp only to defend myself even when p2 started.Not even mention that i have never participated in those disguisting "gank-fest" raids. I had the feeling that p2 can kill the server all along from the start, because we all seen how efficiency became much higher priority for the players of 2019 then 15 years ago for us, who first time joined this awesome game. 
---
And, when everyone left, i stayed here in ranks of lonely horde on pve server. What do i left to do now? I dont really know. I commited too much time to this char and i dont have alts. I have no interest in dropping my warrior to lvl another one and start over. I dont even have a hope to raid someday because the population is only decreases and the number of LFG groups significantly dropped to the low numbers. Auhcion, still ok atm, will become lower and lower on lots with time. 
---
But i still will stay untill the last call here because i have chosen my way, to stay here, on the one "mother" server of my toon untill it dies. I will be helping ally if i will see any, like i did before. And i will be playing the game just to see what will happen next.
---
May be, i will follow the same way, as you with your wife and join alliance on some server where they are outnumbered. It looks like a great idea for me. But at this moment i will stay here just to try to show the ally side that not all hordies are bad and bloodthirsty.
---
I‚Äôve been here since the start, but it‚Äôs comical to see you butthurt - if you can‚Äôt take it don‚Äôt dish it out son.
---
The rare alliance-dominant PVP server has alliance players acting like dicks as well, for sure, but there was a definite pre-selection bias in terms of faction choice. Insofar as horde racials disproportionately attracted insufferable, sweaty PVP tryhards to roll horde on PVP servers.
---
Not saying everyone who rolls horde on a PVP server has this mindset, but almost everyone who has this mindset rolled horde on a PVP server.
---
Lol Everytime I tried this and killed plugger he dropped 50s greens 3 times.I just stopped trying to kill the bosses in brd and only pickpocket when I'm bored and don't feel like mining.
---
People aren't complaining about PvP existing, they're complaining about balance. Even on games that are 100% PvP like Team Fortress 2, you can still discuss balance, right? People want PvP, they just want the game to be better balanced.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Certain factors like the population size being higher than the zones were designed for, or players behaving differently today than they did back when the game was designed, are valid points of discussion.
---
I'll pass the advice to the Alli in my server who camp Feralas 24/7.
---
AV, because the 2 rings and the wand
---
Yes, people do abuse online games. What are you exactly hoping the outcome of this is?
---
So ignorant and narrow minded, if you think this is fun and working properly you might have a future with EA, CCP or Bioware. Getting beaten in a fair fight, that's fine. Getting corpse camped by an overwhelming force isn't pvp its just fucking asinine. Enjoy your 'pvp' and the massive ques for BGs that simple math says is inevitable for such a vast disparity between factions. Lololololol.
---
I mean they have to get the honor if they want to rank.  It's not really bullying as much as abiding by a pvp system in a ridiculously unbalanced server.
---
Should they just not pvp rank when they care about the pvp rewards?
---
Reddit in a nutshell.
---
Like in the real world, you get further by working with others.
---
You got it bud
---
What the fuck are you even talking about? 
---
Answer me these questions: what hypothesis was zimbardo testing? What data did his experiment produce? What statistical methods did he use to analyse his data? What was the control group?
---
It is a dead server though...  Sometimes it's not crying when you're complaining about a legit gripe.
---
I feel ya, there should be a big ass warning before you sign up for pvp worlds saying that people are assholes in video games. Pvp worlds are fun if you have a shitton of free time but for anyone else it‚Äôs such a slog
---
I unsubbed recently because everyone was in 3-5 death balls and I just want to do a couple 1v1‚Äôs while mining but I guess that‚Äôs impossible. Probably gonna just camp org and do BG‚Äôs once they come out, which is a shame but hopefully it gets better in the open world here soon.
---
T1, CHT/BB, Rhok, Ony Neck, Shrouded Mists (Ally) Baron (Horde), QSR Tarnished Pain weavers (Troll or no?), BHB, Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas (DM trink).for that spreadsheet, watchyoursixx's sheet has all the deets.
---
This is how it was back before they made PvP optional. Stick to retail.
---
A taste of your own medicine
---
I just built one over the weekend and installed Classic as a first-up (all my friends are playing it so why not try it out?). Building was really straightforward, all up it cost me $1500NZD but it was designed with some semblance of future proofing and is way overboard just to play Classic. So you could definitely build something much cheaper to do the trick.
---
I second PCPartPicker, it helped me get an idea of what I should get and what would work well (as well as what might not work at all!).
---
"Yet through your response, you're clearly assuming I'm saying what I did under the guise of some Horde vs. Alliance stuff."
---
No, that would be pure incorrect assumption on your part. I'm not sure why you decided to jump to the conclusion that me replying meant I was being hostile. I was not. Just trying to add some context that we have a situation where people are frustrated that they cannot enjoy the game anymore and a lot of people that are responding by dismissing them and telling them to essentially shut up just because they don't have the same problems are also not being nice.
---
"Because it tends to be hordies predictably dismissing people and telling them to shut up and coming out with the "you chose to roll on a PvP" server and "reroll on a PvE" server responses."
---
This is purely an observation. An explanation as to why things are the way they are. It's because the majority of servers are horde dominated so they are the ones less having problems with the game so they are the ones trying to dismiss complaints. 
---
Again, this was not a derogatory, you jumped to that assumption. Stop doing that please. Just because somebody replies to a comment you made doesn't mean they are trying to start an argument. Don't take it that way.
---
yes, but to see the heal predictions of other healers they need to have it aswell afaik
---
What if you spend four times as long on the same circuit and instead of making 15 gold an hour you are making 4? Well it's no longer worth your time to do it. So you stop.
---
Okay- that guarantee is a neat feature and all. And hey, if you want to go pre-built, go pre-built. It's a free country. 
---
If you're interested, here's some reasons I try to tell people to avoid that route and just build it yourself:
---
* More customization options. Not just specs, but also size and aesthetics.
---
* Tends to be cheaper
---
* You know what's in your machine, which has a lot of benefits down the road when troubleshooting or upgrading
---
* It's easier than people think. Seriously, there are *so many* resources, and if it goes smoothly it's easier than Legos.
---
* **Lots of prebuilt organizations have questionable business practices.** Most common is difficulty in finding exact specs: like they'll advertise 8GB of DDR-4 RAM, but they won't tell you the speed or CAS latency. Or they'll put some off-brand PSU in and turn your computer into a timebomb. Or they load down the computer with malware/spyware/bloatware that is a huge pain to get rid off.
---
* Most PC parts vendors and manufacturers have their own warranty. If you want a warranty, there is that option available, even if you're building your own.

I'm currently 38 on Noggenfogger and haven't been camped once. Just have to avoid certain areas. I've been killed plenty, but also managed to kill horde. Maybe it gets worse at higher levels, but to me it seems like the situation on Noggenfogger is exaggerated on reddit.
---
Lololol.

Shhhh, don't say that too loud or the reddit circle-jerk will downvote you.

I like the mod that turns your opponent's picture into whatever immobilizing effect is on them. Seems useful, made noticing a mace stun easier.

Been using this bot a while now, and I love it. Great way to organize 40 mans. With that said, I'm curious if there is any way to implement any roster control? Caps to specific roles (tank, heals, dps) we sometimes have the issue of more dps sign up first leaving no room for heals, or too many tanks etc. Or ways to limit who can sign up and who can't. We sometimes run with a sister guild, and I'd love to be able to make it guild only sign-ups until everyone in our guild had a chance to sign up before the sister guild fills the rest. Are there any options that can assist with this? Thank you for making such a great tool !
---
Reply to this reply in 1 week when you see how wrong you are, thanks.
---
Well you could recapture that. You roll the instance for individual raid groups so that bosses with different attributes and abilities populate it. It sounds lame initially but as you think about it, you can imagine how that could be done to provide compelling gaming which made the most of that sense of apprehension and doubt, and forced players to adapt and create in order to overcome unpredictable boss challenges.
---
Dude, don't be naive. You can't see the future, you just don't want to admit defeat. 
---
You rolled on the wrong server. Admit it and transfer the next time it's available.
---
Yes....keep using one example to counter 15...logic!
---
I did this (thrash+mirage) but didn‚Äôt bother enchanting, got my guilds first viskag and it nearly doubled my average dps
---
I never blamed the Horde that left my server. I was just stating why there's an overabundance of Alliance on Heartseeker. I never left my server either (Herod).
---
Horde very well could have fixed the problem on Heartseeker by transferring there but they chose not to. If anything I'm blaming the Horde that DIDN'T leave my server.
---
Hey look, it's me making a sweet video of cheaters!!!!
---
I'm on Heartseeker and can tell you that it's an absolute exaggeration / fabrication that Org is like this all the time. Basically only prime time on some nights, and even then it's short lived when the alliance members are ultimately chased out.
---
Also, Heartseeker population ratio is far better than it was. Last time I checked it was 65/35 which is better than the 80/20 that it was about a month ago.
---
I am constantly finding myself in scraps with Jojo and his two balls, Gleet and his whacky crew, Jawwz and his honorable hordlings and we're chased out of places. 
---
Don't let OP scare you into thinking that HS is fucked. This is no Skeram.
---
I just quit playing.   I‚Äôll log for raids.   Vanilla PVP was always poop, and got better when they started tuning for it.   In other expansions.
---
Perception is very good. Gnome racial is objectively better as you get more gear though.
---
Swifty is going to be living in battlegrounds once they come out.It doesn't matter if he switches servers realistically.I played on darkspear for the past 5 years and have only seen Swifty once and that was because he wanted tons of people there. it's not like it matters where he goes once bg's come out.
---
It might be normal behaviour. But it certainly isn't pro-social behaviour. 
---
Unless you are saying that people on the opposite faction aren't seen as members of society. If people are considering them this way they this seems somewhat sociopathic.
---
If they are so ingrained in the game that they dont see themselves as belonging to the same society as those on the opposite faction then couldnt this be, potentially, evidence of other issues?
---
Wow tyty for the response! I really like the equation youre using there to help me get a better picture of it.
---
I care about pve way more than pvp so I always put pve enchant until I can get the item a second time for a pvp enchant. If you pvp a lot and your guild apparently doesn't really care about enchants then just get the health one
---
I guess from the other side, I‚Äôm tired of people blaming alliance for not fighting or being bad, etc
---
I just want to fight some other people in the Warcraft universe. If I was interested in grinding things I'd stick to PVE.
---
The problem is the honor system.  Its garbage.

---
This would be my 5-man setup, and likely only replace deathbone items with T2 when BWL comes out and keep everything else the same, replacing it with gear after our tanks get it all.
---
Lifesteal procs scale with spell-power, so this should be your setup for 5m prot tanking.
---
The chest is going to cost you around 200g as well so you can use deathbone until you save up gold to craft it.
---
Yeah that doesn't help m80
---
That's at best at the least he has his small 6 man party which isn't bad for the small encounters but most people who actually PVP and want to rank roll in that big of a squad anyway.
---
On a PvP server I honestly wouldn't bother until wPvP settles a bit, I've killed a few mages AoE farming today at WPL and I'm not the first considering a druid popped out to help me killing one of them.
---
On a PvE server, now's probably one of the best times to give AoE farming a shot since everyone is getting ready for BG's.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking video game

Good vid, and music (metal is best). I liked seeing u destroy rogues. Rogues are the gutter people of wow.
---
Hello,
---
So I'm a 60 prot warrior (11/5/35 - i specc'd to what Skarm recommended), but only have 343 defense. From what I've been reading, UBRS and Strat are going to be 'too hard' to tank until I get better gear. 
---
Should I focus on BRD and Scholo for now until I get all pre-BIS from there? I haven't actually tried tanking on UBRS/Strat yet, so not sure if I will be able to do it, but I'd rate myself as an 'average' tank for now. 
---
I'm in a guild, so hoping I can hop onto UBRS/Strat whenever they happen with guildies, but don't want to depend on that happening all time.
---
Thx!
---
What the guy below wrote, but you should also queue and cancel heroic strikes using the following macro:   
---
/cast Heroic Strike  
---
/stopcasting  
---
Hitting it once will queue HS, 2nd time will cancel it.   
---
The reason for this is that you want to have Heroic Strike queued for when your OFF HAND hits, but you might want to unqueue it to not use the rage. The reason for this is that you have a 6% chance to miss on your off-hand swings if Heroic Strike is queued, but a 25% chance to miss if you don't. This is assuming you have 305 weapon skill (aka human with sword or orc with axes.) If you are not one of the PVE classes, 9%/28%
---
So he was going to leave anyway what a massive deal this is
---
i mean is this any different to the 24/7 back and forth in hillsbrad the first week of phase 2? no one had any intention of winning a battle, both sides just farming honor, making sure not to completely wipe the other side.
---
&gt;Then phase 2 came out, and their fate was sealed. People killing time leveling alts, or those that hadn't hit 60 were immediately turned off. They've played since launch on PvP servers, and were disgusted with the corpse camping. The few remaining people left with a clear disdain for classic that I'm sure they won't be back.
---
Agreed man. Phase 2 was essentially the final nail for tons of people
---
Naw, there are alliance pussies blaming horde for all their problems.
---
Can confirm. Me am orc, me smash, me not think.
---
&gt; Theyre pretty comparable.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? You actually think Ice instigating toxic fights and real life drama while ruining tons of rental properties with his his crackhead "friends" is even remotely comparable to Asmon being a troll in WoW? How fucking disconnected from reality are you?
---
Lol shut up rogue.
---
Hey there were some sweet trash drops in there.  Ghoul Skin Tunic, Misplaced Servo Arm, etc.
---
95% of Classic servers will be empty when TBC releases. Blizzard will probably just merge all remaining Classic players on a handful of servers.
---
Lol 130 online during peak is amazing imo.My guild only has max 55 online during peak and that was when we had 3 raid groups full.

Wow tyty for the help here! As a warrior when i see a mob below 20%, ahh my time as come haha.
---
depends how confident you feel in regards to HS canceling. If you don't wanna bother with that, 1.7-2.4 is the speedrange you wanna opt for in your off-hand, preferrably with some stats on it as well :)
---
Lmfao, you started this whole chain.
---
Av is horde favored, people just didn‚Äôt know what to do back then
---
Like he makes money off of it..
---
Someone has to avenge the people from flamelash, justice was served üëç
---
Kinda demoralizing to keep starting over every few months.
---
Sure, why not? If you can do it without eating too much and you don't get ganked then that sounds good to me.
---
Just put your HS in Goldshire or Dun Morogh instead. People are so entitled wanting to be safe in their capital cities. (/s in case it wasn‚Äôt obvious).
---
I didn‚Äôt mean the people that left the server due to the game being unplayable. I meant the thoughtless and inconsiderate players that think full time camping and farming like this is what pvp was during Vanilla. The more this happens on other servers regardless if it‚Äôs Horde or Alliance following this pattern the more dead servers will spring up. The funniest part of this not in a haha kind of way of you would have asked most of these people what an important part of Classic/Vanilla is was supposed to be community.
---
If this works, I doubt pugs will ever queue for WSG. Nobody likes getting stomped 0-3 and you get 0 honor for it.
---
WSG will exclusively be premades win trading against each other.
---
Do not chase defense cap.  You're better off getting your mitigation through armor (especially bonus armor on weapon, rings, and trinkets) and stamina.  You'll need more total healing, but your health will drop more steadily and healers will find it easier to use big, efficient heals.
---
As to NS, I can only really speak of the 0/30/21 HotW build: I very much liked having NS because it made soloing elites much easier, and also helped me drop form to innervate / battle rez.  But I'm in blues and a lot of pug DPS is in purples, so I've dropped it in favor of a pure tank build for more threat.  I still miss it, but the threat difference is noticeable and Omen of Clarity is fun.
---
Red means dead
---
This mirrored my thoughts. Everyone is chanting "pVp hApPeNs oN a pVp SeRVeR" but the real issue is the mass of people combined with the flawed system, has made it completely unfun for everyone apart from the % of people who are sociopaths. 
---
I got killed by a rogue that 100 to 0 me in a 1v1 using all his cooldowns in a 1v1 last night. I felt that was a great PvP experience compared to the deathballs and roadblockers.
---
You think they were tuning AQ40 during the 3rd expansion? Okay...
---
The problem is on Flamelash at this point there are almost no alliance left. They go to Ironforge because it‚Äôs literally the only place that has any alliance.
---
I mean its another Advertise video to leech more from Admons name. If Asmon never showed his videos on stream hed be irrelevant so he clings to his now persona which is more annoying than Asmons imo.
---
To single this out when every server and so many others are doing this on that server is BS. Find more out on all the others doing that arent Olympus? Oh wait that doesnt produce the haters and clicks so nvm.
---
I couldnt give a fuck about either but the blinded vitriolic hate for Asmon is crazy.
---
You go full glass-cannon. On trash packs or bosses that hurt a lot it's worth swapping in your pvp gear.
---
Would you have rather every one went alliance ?
---
Also horde is the optimal choice if you don‚Äôt wanna deal with kids/manchildren.
---
Censor on the name fail haha.
---
Kirtonos is good , mainly a horde server but the alliance is strong still I go into SG, cretor, both sides are even
---
it was never fixed like i am pretty sure if blizzard added back og heroic strike with on next swing to BfA the bug would still exist.
---
there was even a blue post where Bashiok said they could not fix the issue as it was such a core part of how combat work.
---
also the fact the bug is in classic without it being one of those widely known bugs people use to hell and back on private servers also point towards blizzard never fixing it.
---
I'm super hesitant to be excited for any of them atm, private server BG meta isn't fun. Just a whole lot of GY farming or being GY farmed.
---
Depends how tryhard people are about it, but if phase 2 release is anything to go by it's just going to be minmaxed 2 cap WSG GY farming, 4 cap AB GY farming and 7 min AV rushes where if your side isn't straight up dominating people stop playing or leave to try get a new one where they can GY farm.
---
I just look at this and I wonder what the fun part about classic is supposed to be. You raid once a week -- which is boring and unchallenging. You get all the gear then you use it to... trade honor kills to get more gear to do.. what exactly? When is the fun part?
---
WSG because it offers very competitive games and playing premade vs. premade in WSG is the most fun I've ever had in WoW.
---
Which you can't really find competitive games in AV in the same way because the objective in AV is PVE centric. It won't take long before most AV games are just a rush to the end-boss.
---
turtle at that boss which nobody remembers the name of
---
???
---
profit
---
and you seem annoying
---
welcome to reddit. mob mentality and a hive mind. they‚Äôll pick another FOTM to shit on when BGs come out probably.
---
&gt; You clearly are of retail culture and have no honorable links to what vanilla was
---
I played vanilla but never got to raid, I barely got to 60 and it took me forever. Been playing WoW since that. 
---
Good guess, but dead wrong.
---
&gt;you are not what the core of this game is about
---
What is the core? Random boomers who work as truckers and in retail who are fucking pathetic? Yikes lol
---
Some druids aren't that smart.
---
It's not low priority?   
---
Priority list for debuffs:  
---
* Cast spells with benefit (think fairy fire etc)  
---
* Cast spell with little benefit (think dots)  
---
* Proccs with benefits (anahilator, nightfall, thunderfury etc)
---
* Proccs with no benefit (deep wounds)
---
MS is the highest priority possible mate, it knocks of: ISB, Winter's Chill, Shadow Vulnerability, Gift of Arthas. Each of which a fckton more usefull than your Mortal Strike...
---
That's why you detect magic &gt; poly &gt; kill
---
But I don't campy fp because that's gay
---
Good to hear, what else
---
Umm i only played wow in vanilla.  Raided up to 4 horsemen.  Those guides you speak of?  Everyone had access to them.  The only people that didnt were the first to beat the bosses.  We had raid ui helpers tnat would trll you EXACTLY where to stand during cthun and we beat it maybe a week after the world first.  Which only took that long because the second phase was broken.  Dont pretend you figured out any of the fights yourself.
---
Back when Blizzard had a bit of subtlety in their writing.
---
Because that's the only way they get honor. Because of the 25% diminishing return, fighting the alliance raid groups don't give any honor past the first 2-3 kills.
---
That had a bit to do with how the mechanics scaled - some parts of the fight got harder, if I recall. Notably the stomach part killed people awfully quick in TBC.
---
Let me respond to this as clearly as I can. You're very intelligent, so you're able to work backwards and develop through prior ambiguity a non biased representation of the words you said. We both know what you're doing. You don't get to clarify those assumed behaviors retroactively. It's inherently subjected to the bias of others involved. If you come off as hostile to other parties, you therefore have completed the criteria for the other party to say as such. This is called perspective and can be truthfully defined without intent. You're smart man. Sometimes you get unlucky and the dipshit on the other side of the keyboard happens to be too. I'm not going to sit here and argue assumed intent behind comments. I'm gonna leave this one at respectfully disagree.
---
Alliance just needs to reroll horde. Ez.
---
Isn‚Äôt only temporary loot like mage water tradeable?
---
Uh yeah.. it's worth it. Whether or not is possible is up to your server and what time you're playing. But if possible, there isnt a question its the best way to farm xp/gold. Farmed to 60 super fast and made 3k gold easy, but I absolutely love the mindlessness of it
---
&gt;if classic remains good
---
The state of Classic is pretty dogshit though and it's clear that Blizz doesn't give a shit about it. The servers can't handle large world PVP battles and Blizz hasn't done anything about it. There are numerous display issues with the honor system and how honor is updated/displayed. There are countless minor bugs that have existed since classic beta that Blizz will not fix. GMs never, ever do shit.
---
Blizz doesn't give a damn shit and I've decided it's not worth 15 a month especially with how slow they are rolling shit out. Hell  seeing the state world pvp was in BGs should have been released ASAP but either Blizz doesn't give a damn shit or they're too much of a shitty, bloated company that they couldn't. Either way the game is suffering for it.
---
Fuck Blizz.
---
&gt;I've leveled 4 warriors so far. Thanks for the insult though :)  
---
  
---
Weird to take it as an insult but if *that* was an insult then claiming I never leveled one sure is, so I dont feel bad.  
---
&gt;Show me a warrior leveling with "minimal downtime" on the level of druids/hunters. I'll wait.  
---
Well the issue here is that I ranked hunter as #1, which somehow you missed? I never said warriors can grind as good as hunters, I literally said hunters are the best.  
---
I think you need to stop either reading only the parts you want or making up your own narrative in your head. First with saying I never leveled a warrior and then somehow expecting me to show you a warrior that can grind as good as a hunter, which I never claimed.  
---
&gt;proof you haven't actually leveled a warrior.  
---
Ive actually leveled.. 4 warriors? One back in vanilla, one in tbc/wrath when it was retail, another in legion and one in classic. If you dont believe ive leveled a warrior, thats on you bud. I actually **loved** leveling a warrior, it was fun as fuck and vanilla/classic warrior shows how important stance dancing is for the enjoyment of the class, something thats lost in legion/retail.  
---
&gt;The only time you can NOT bandage up every other mob is if you're like, fighting mobs 5+ levels below you.  
---
Literally false. You would have to be **extremely** undergeared or fighting nothing but mobs that bypass your armor like the satyrs in felwood that cast shadowbolt until their mana runs dry. *But* if you are geared like the OP asked about, shit is easy. Especially if you have a weapon that isnt weak as fuck. Like dude if youre 52 and still using ww axe, you got a major fucking problem as theres *no* reason to be using that shit and yeah of course youll be bandaging after every mob because your gear is shit and warrior is the most gear dependant class there is.  
---
Anyway believe what you want, I honestly dont care. I was just giving my opinion on what classes are good at grinding and warrior is one of them.
---
Yeah I'm on Bigglesworth and it's not fun. I would've transferred already but I kinda like my guild and RL friends that are entrenched
---
You guys deserve it. Outside of dungeons I gain about 5k exp/hr at most since hitting 45. It's impossible to do any sort of questing in the open world.
---
Maybe you guys should talk your roaming gank squads into doing PvP against people their own levels instead of preventing every under lvl 60 from playing the game.
---
I'd much rather horde camp SW than not be able to quest at all.
---
Almost. But from here it's more like they're all the same edgy 14  year old who just wants to grief.  
---
This however cannot be true in any way because you say so.
---
Yep.  Fun fight with hunters kiting mobs around the room.
---
AB is the best one to premade in. In a well run group, its faster than WSG and more honor.
---
Stay mad about it alliance scum
---
&gt; Gnomish Death Ray 
---
That's literally the only one worth getting and it's more of a novelty than a useful item.
---
Just curious what do you mean by often? 
---
I see a lot of people saying it's bad for them as well but I'm not sure if it's comparable
---
I dinged 60 on my nelf hunter on flamelash last week. While questing in steppes, winterspring or the Plague lands, the average time between ganks was only a few minutes. In burning steppes there were people patrolling every quest area. I spent more time dead than alive for the last 12 levels.
---
I hope that's the case and if not it will eventually. I hate pugging against a premade and I hate when I'm in a premade stomping a pug.
---
Couple things: You can tank all dungeons for all time in fury dps specc, no problem. It's more about the gear than the specc honestly, though don't try to tank as arms at 60.   
---
In terms of the respeccing, yes it's a thing and you can opt-in or opt-out... But it is a thing if you want to actively PVP. You can ofc always seek to pvp as a dual wielding fury warrior (swifty), but it is known to be suboptimal.   
---
One way to farm the gold you need for your respec is to offer your tanking services for a fee, or reserve the unneeded items / boe's in the runs you are tanking :)
---
&gt; Everything you're saying is pretty much the opposite of what actually goes on. I'm starting to believe you actually think what you are saying is true. If you play on Skeram I am sorry you are not having a good time, but the majority of us are. 
---
You're absolutely deluded if you think people are having fun with 1 hour corpse runs to a raid.
---
&gt; I am currently in the middle of farming the dumb horde in IF with 80 other people at 1am. It's hilarious how bad they are.
---
Sure you are... 11pm after raids are over IF doesn't even get 80 people.
---
&gt; If you are having issues pugging perhaps you should learn how to lead a group. I have absolutely zero issues running any instance whenever I want. Shit my alt pugged mc in like week 4 and killed rag. There are also a few gdkp runs that happen every week that kill rag and ony.
---
You clearly barely play on the server.
---
late for what? most of the endgame content isnt even in game yet
---
bgs come tomorrow,and most honor farmers will stop camping level 50-60 zones
---
Your name tells me exactly how much actual knowledge is involved in your comment :) 
---
It will not by the way. I know more then enough people who play classic, and don't do that just bevause they wait for BC servers. Assuming that everyone will do the same as you is kinda narrow minded
---
Couldn't care less.
---
So running around and killing ally is toxic but killing the same horde as they respawn or fly in is not?! 
---
Look I don‚Äôt care if the fp getting camped! I‚Äôm just telling yous the truth, if I have to deal with 30 minutes of corpse running I‚Äôm gonna fight every alliance I see that day.
---
Sunder and plunder's late night raid is looking for 3 dps warriors. Raid time is 9-12 Tuesday Friday.   11 of 11 clearing mc in about 2.5 hours and getting faster.
---
Its the base race version. Games will be over fast.
---
And then we just get Reddit threads giving away codes.
---
Ouro was unbeatable for a looong time.
---
Nope whitemane, the only salty one here is.you alliance scrub
---
As alliance too. Play on extreme mode
---
when i am helping to kill 60s on my lvl45 rogue alt, it gives sweet honor. you are absoutely correct to not spare anyone.
---
honestly, most people are sensitive flowers and should have played on a pve realm in the first place. why would i sabotage myself/my progress/my party for some random dude who will backstab me the first chance he gets? 
---
they can all pretend to be nice guys and preach whatever stupid mental gymnastics to justify it for themselves, but in the end their arguments are based on their own selfish desires.
---
Yep they're both seriously boring. Sure a premade will make a lot of rep and honor really quick but still.. that's a big "meh" from me as far an enjoyment goes.
---
This was me maybe 3 hours ago. Same squad camping for hours. At least they weren't corpse camping, just running back and forth picking people off when they came near.
---
Advertise should reroll alliance on Flamelash and save them.
---
I'm learning that this sub is full of alliance fanboys that are upset that people prefer playing horde.
---
Eh, for orcs its alright with wf, but i was pointing out purely efficiency wise, hunter/warrior are first, with warrior edging out with flurry.
---
Although, if you're taking a ret pally let's be fair, you don't really care for "true" minmax at that point, so you can toss it to whoever is willing.
---
Yes, this is the definition of win trading: trading HK's without a fight for the purpose of boosting rank. Everyone involved should be banned
---
Got 12k honor in 3 hours as alliance Skerem yesterday.  Def super easy if your guild isn't trash

---
No, you are wrong. You can throw out a word salad all you want but your assumptions are still miles off and no appeals to how intelligent you are is going to change that. 
---
Even smart people can be wrong at times. That's fine and its ok to hold your hands up and admit that. Instead you tried to negatively portray me and then refused to accept my response and doubled down after I explained my position and you were too stubborn to say "my bad, sorry". 
---
Keep childishly downvoting me for telling the truth, and keep thinking you know a complete strangers intentions well enough that you can tell when they are lying though. It still won't make you right just because you repeat it over and over.
---
"We both know what you're doing."
---
You clearly don't. You can disagree all you want because it just makes you a fool because you don't know my intentions and just because you decide to interpret it in the most negative way possible doesn't mean shit. Some people on Reddit take any reply as an automatic conflict. Seems you did too. I'm not gonna tiptoe around people reacting so badly to things, nor should I have to, that's your problem, not mine.
---
Someone i worked with almost fell for a service selling them a rare puppy breed that was totally in our country it's just the guy selling it had to move back home to Nigeria and now had a bunch of puppies he needed to sell here and yeah the only way to pay him is through western union first and then he will totally arrange to have the puppy shipped to the person buying it. The site he had was full of 90s gif and colorful text and barely legible english.
---
I mean, most classes' pre-raid BIS is technically a Green lens of whatever, it's just easier said than done, being as you have to grind engineering up to that point, and either buy one off the AH, or make enough and get lucky to actually get one &lt;Of Shadow Wrath&gt;, or whichever one your class/spec needs.
---
There‚Äôs no punishment for it though. Since battlegrounds are cross-realm they can just continue ranking once they are released. These people don‚Äôt care that they are ruining the gaming experience of others. They just care about their own.
---
I highly doubt any alliance guilds would want to xfer to flamelash after this entire debacle.
---
Persistance is key. Glad it turned out well.
---
A lot of people dislike it but I‚Äôve enjoyed Faerlina so far. The population will be stable for a long time and no one can fuck with you if you farm dungeons/open world farm is still manageable early in the morning. There‚Äôs always pvp and the horde:alliance ratio is very good.
---
Sell now and invest elsewhere! Sell for 600 and buy flasks for 100 ea, when bwl comes out they will go up for building wanting to clear it
---
Come to Incendius where alliance is everywhere. They camp UC and all zeppelins all day long. They don‚Äôt even care about DKs any more.
---
Personally I would sell if you still need your epic mount for any 60d you have. If you already have epic mounts then I would use it as those pots will go for a fortune when AQ rolls around possible even BWL as I think MC has made everyone think raids on vanilla are easy pie, at least at first.
---
right... you need to not be wearing fury gear.
---
You feel bad when you kill a hunter? Ya must be a saint
---
Devilsaur is 74AP, 2% hit and crit. 
---
Giant stalker legs give 64AP, .6ish % crit. Devil gloves alone are 1% crit and 28AP.
---
I guess it depends on where you‚Äôre getting hit% from elsewhere but I imagine, at least for raids, you‚Äôll need the hit that Devilsaur set gives.
---
If you only need 5% for non raiding then it might actually be better but it depends if the extra AP from GS + Devil gloves exceeds the Loss of .4% crit. Not 100% sure on that. Again this is dependent on where you get hit as well.
---
Giant stalker Gloves + Legs together is better than Devilsaur set, when you get the gloves.
---
World of Warcraft is a magnifying glass for social behavior. 
---
We all fucking suck
---
Finally darnassus is relevant!
---
No, you miss out on being able to trash other people. Even more fun when doing it with 2-3 buddies. If you don't care about trashing other players in an unfair manner a pvp realm is probably not the best choice.
---
As a rogue I would go 100hp on t1 helm/legs and 8agi on t2
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your bad experiences. I get camped on my Alliance alts sometimes too. I‚Äôm not trying to say that your bad experiences are irrelevant, I‚Äôm only saying that your bad experiences have far more in common with the average Alliance player experience than the average Horde player experience.
---
Yes please and if you want to do another 10 hour sea shanty 2 stream I'll suffer through it with you like I did last time
---
PvP happened on a PvP server! deal with it!

*rolls on different server*

no not like that

All you horde babies aren't allowed to complain for 2 months while sitting in BG queues for 1 hour. Get ready for the pain MUAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAAA!

NOOOOOOO! MY PRO ALLIANCE AGENDA!!

It'll probably be 8v1 anyway while the rest of your team goes to play the objective

Heartseeker is one of like 3 Alliance dominated servers.
---
I need dem kills boi
---
We had prior knowledge of another guild catching the meteor shower fella trading a few days before. When this went down, our priest just happened to have come up dead in the SS graveyard and saw known dude running in that direction (Corner of HB in Dun Garok). He told me immediately, and as a rogue and a streamer with all the recording stuff set up, we went in and watched it all happen.
---
Westfall is overwhelmingly Alliance, so more Horde would be appreciated!
---
The 305 gives the 3% though? (2% hit and removes the 1% penalty), though pushing for glancing blow reduction I prefer so I try to maintain the 310.
---
The math on the 305 for the 3% been posted a few times on here and sims/parses all confirmed, which is why swords are only running 6% hit as a soft cap before pushing AP harder (in preRaid) easier to hit the 9% in raid gear just b/c of the abundance of hit gear that also maximizes AP for them.
---
I did run option 2 last night and topped the charts on Rag. Will need a lot more confirmation which probably wont happen without other changes but thanks for your input!
---
Horde: \*surprised pikachu\*
---
I'm mostly killed hearthing into ironforge, there are always rogues waiting at the inn
---
We had our 2nd binding and the eye [in the same raid](https://trafficguild.us/guild-data/raid/3ba2df95-00c1-459f-9591-fc26a5419803). We have been lucky.
---
The imbalance is the result of two things:
---
- Layering and the massive server sizes they were intended to enable
---
- Alliance players fleeing instead of fighting.
---
Ironforge wasn't a horde city until alliance players started jumping ship.
---
Ultimately the blame lies on blizzard for fucking everything up and enabling this shitshow to happen so quickly, but alliance did collectively have the choice to fight or flee and they collectively chose to flee.
---
Did pretty much the same thing on a Satyr Bow first time in DM. Didn‚Äôt realize it was bis for warriors too so I just saw a bow and hit greed. No one else in the group wanted it so they were ‚Äúgrats man‚Äù and I figured they meant someone else lmao.
---
This!?:P
---
Due to the number of players in classic, unless they make battle groups, clusters of servers, it's every server vs every other server.  Which makes the pool of players huge and as a result, odds of running into a pre-made you have a deal with is low and if you only fight once a day, how do you communicate that you want to trade?  How do you decide what is fair? You have to track hundreds of premades to even have a chance at successfully win trading if we have one huge pool.
---
Guess no one ever uses Reddit on their phone and also sends pictures to friends on Snapchat ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Jfc you‚Äôre legitimately asking how to read emotion out of text? Read some books and practice lmao
---
So you have the choice to not buff people with pvp flag
---
So you guys can't even form a group to take it back despite outnumbering them? Pathetic. PVP happened on a PVP server. 
---
/s
---
See how toxic that response is? 
---
I'm on Yojamba alliance, and I cannot count the number of alliance I have grouped with who have gotten camped getting into any instance (Diremaul, BRD etc) who get so frustrated they comment after that given the chance they will make life a living hell for every horde they see because that‚Äôs what happened to them, and the guiding principle is ‚Äúwould the horde have left them alone if it was them?‚Äù Also, your mentality is exactly what the alliance players camping use to justify what they are doing. Congratulations! You are exactly the same as them.
---
Come to noggenfogger, if you message me ingame I will ensure that you all get some bags and funds to get you started. Look for Aure or Auree in game.
---
Red men bad blue men good
---
I solo it on my warlock. 9+ rich thorium nodes per hour.
---
Mind sharing this macro?
---
pretty sure you do get xp from the warsong tokens or smth. at least.
---
I recall leveling slowly on my 19 pvp twink and then having to continue at level 29.
---
Thinking about it that's about when I played there maybe a tad bit earlier.  It definitely felt like the asshole Olympics with people bragging they are on disability and shit.
---
The guy that used Tom Cruise as his avatar was the kind of guy I wouldn't piss on if he was on fire.
---
Oh that's sweet music to my ears. I didn't think he ever got clapped.
---
Give me your names and I'll help you out starting.
---
Why less Ally in SW? I usually only go to IF if I have to for a quest.
---
There's no point progressing there any more. Re-roll somewhere else, leave the horde with nothing to do...
---
Both of us rolling 100 and him getting it was the point. Not necessarily losing the gear
---
 #nochanges
---
All i remember is being made aware that i should probably avoid streamer servers from reddit then following that advice happily.
---
AV is a PVE speedrun, WSG has no timer and can have crazy stalemates. AB has always been best.
---
The TL;DR is that a small streamer (advertise) built up his stream by hunting down larger streamers in game (mostly asmongold) and causing trouble for them, killing them and corpse camping them until they either stopped streaming or logged off entirely (since even if they changed zones, he'd just follow them or even potentially get there before they do)
---
Doing so at all is against twitch's terms of service (since it has the potential to hurt their profits by making a stream less entertaining) and advertise was reported for it, ultimately resulting in his twitch account receiving a temporary ban since that's what his entire presence on twitch was comprised of
---
lol. yeah no. people did that back in the day as well. its not unfair.
---
Got one on heartseeker.  Level 39 troll mage named habib.  Completely ignored attacks to just keep farming lizards for leather by the race track.
---
Alliance dominates Zandalari Tribe EU. But yeah it is the exception.
---
It's coming the week of the 10th, I don't think they specified date. Everyone took that to mean the 10th but don't be surprised.
---
It's nothing don't worry
---
Short answer, yes it does. 
---
Long answer: There is a table with the values of threat generated for every rank of every warrior and bear ability, and i think it was on wowhead, but a full 10 minutes of searching left me unable to find it.
---
That's exactly where I was, recently but 40 and slogging through STV. I also cancelled my sub during the China shit but it wasn't a hard decision after STV.
---
hey, so in each video, the starting level in the title is the absolute minimum level you can get a character into that dungeon. So RFC is 8, SFK is 14, SM is 21, etc. If you want to check out anymore dungeons for minimum level to get in you can check out this article that i use to reference often. It shows the recommended as well as absolute minimum in order to enter the dungeon. Hopefully it helps! https://progameguides.com/wow/wow-classic-dungeon-levels/
---
If it mades you feel better this is happening on most servers. Literally Rogues sneaking in and attacking the first half health caster they see. Mages are doing the same thing with POM Pyro etc.
---
How do you research a new server? This was the 3rd server we moved to because of queues.
---
It's the literal one rule that RP servers actually have though
---
Dwarf priests are one of the biggest pvp OP racial combinations.  Two fear breaks, a poison/bleed break. Both on short cooldowns.
---
I saw some online a bit after the servers had been up. Not sure about now.
---
Retail is more even tuned, ciao
---
It wasn't all the time but damn if it wasn't horrible during peak hours.
---
i just don't get why everyone wants to play horde???
---
no
---
This is more for the people that are done with pvp and want to try something new.
---
Does having 315 defence do anything significant for boss level mobs or is it just standard .04% reduction on mitigation?
---
Went back to retail?
---
Well Asmon is a cuck so whatever.
---
Thanks! Just felt like sharing, glad you enjoyed it!
---
Animated is pre bis for holy priest
---
IMO they need to add paid server transfers and allow the player base to migrate where they want with caps on the number players per faction in an attempt to balance it out.
---
Why don't people bother reading rules?
---
&gt;Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic. This is not a community for private servers, current World of Warcraft, **streamer drama**, etc
---
Just because the streamer drama is about WoW issues doesn't mean it's above the rules.
---
&gt;The discussion in that thread is about an important current issue - win trading / boosting and nobody is talking about it.
---
This is just not true.
---
&gt; The guy you're responding to is so fucking dense lol. Some people like efficient, goal oriented play, so if there's no efficient goals to achieve they lose interest. These people do not grind just to grind, they grind for a goal, so if they get everything there's nothing left to do.
---
We're not talking about people grinding.
---
We're talking about Asmon, who got everything filtered to them for free.
---
What kind of "goal oriented play" involves having 1000 viewers feeding you thousands of gold and free epic BoE's?
---
Are you even in the right conversation right now?
---
If I had more time I don't think it would as much of an issue. During vanilla I all the time.in the world but now? I'm lucky if I have a few hours. This is during peak times too. Peak ganking time.
---
im not sure engineering is the best prof to level up with tho, it was my fifth profession on my priest so i went and bought cassandras grace early and it was fine.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs really no way to sugarcoat this - Phase 2 was an unmitigated disaster for Classic.
---
It's the best time I've had in WoW in about 15 years.
---
So it's not being an asshole to camp everything then follow into the one area they try to escape?  Basically, you are chasing your prey to its logical conclusion then getting surprised when it stops logging in.
---
Lol that's impressive. Let me reword what you just said:
---
(Assuming he's 60)
---
&gt; Maybe your entire ~10 days of time commitment was a waste of time. You should consider doing it all over again on a PvE server so you can enjoy the game.
---
I don't really know how strongly I stand on either side of the issue but that's a tough pill to swallow. Personally I would have done PvE if I didn't have anyone that I knew on a PvP server but never expected things to get like this. I empathise with these users experiences. I just lucked out I played the same faction as my servers dominating faction. And I still feel like I'm corpse running more than I would ever thought possible. 
---
Maybe one day they will allow PvP to PvE servers. But until then... if my situation ever turns into OPs, I'm prob done with the game.
---
I have been solo farming SM library recently and just raw gold vendoring everything. I make 25-30g an hour. 
---
It's way easier imo then Cath with my current gear. Rarely have to pay attention or stop to eat, can just watch TV and half pay attention. 
---
I had to stop and eat too much Cath farming.
---
People who aren't at least a little like that to begin with will not act like that for money. Maybe he's cranking it up for the camera but he's no jewel.
---
Just the standard reduction
---
that was the old "i want to make a reputation" blizzard entertainment... 
---
Well now you have activision blizzard... they dont care too much about their reputation, but they DO love their money so a short ban and slap on the wrist and off you go.
---
There‚Äôs a honor trading group going on on my server.  It‚Äôs probably the worst part about this phase for me.
---
AoE farm ZF graveyard with 2-3 other mages and a healer (preferably a priest). Do this until your 52 when you stop getting XP.
---
Yeh I was really looking forward to bgs but I fully expect them to be dreadful now.
---
But Alexander the Great was a tactician. He didn't just spawn 10x more ppl and bore his enemies into leaving.
---
You probably wouldn't need custom code, try setting the trigger to Status &gt; Health.
---

---
In the specific unit you can just type in the raid target number for each aura (raid1, raid2, etc.)
---
Yes they will, PuGs won't just take any moron that sends them a message anymore but they will still clear everything pugging. You not been playing retail in years or something? People literally pug mythic runs in retail sometimes as far as the 2nd to last boss, and depending on your definition of pug people regularly clear the entirety of mythic in pugs that are formed by various high-end raider's alts and friends.
---
There is definitely a noticeable difference in the coordination needed, but that is like saying that there is a noticeable difference in a room with no light and one with a slight burning cinder in the corner.
---
There will 100% be pugs clearing raids fam, idk how out of touch you've been with WoW the past 15 years but people have been pugging much much harder content for years and years, even pre-PGF. The 40-man aspect changes things a bit but not that much, especially not since unlike retail there is still a level of responsibility maintained, so if you come in and fuck everything up a ton you'll just end up blacklisted.
---
I just shelved my lv50 Shaman alt for the same reason. Constant lv60's no matter what area I go to at this point corpse camping people over and over again. Zones like STV, Hinterlands, Feralas and Tanaris have all become death traps.
---
What are you on about?
---
It‚Äôs reealllly bad on Smolderweb right now.
---
Why would anyone feel bad it's funny
---
I am going to step in here and let both of you know you look ridiculous lol!
---
One I got said I was in violation of the "16th article" whatever the fuck that is supposed to be lmao
---
Which is awesome for you, seriously. I was having a blast until phase 2. But that's come to an abrupt end for a huge swath of the player base.
---
I've made exactly one post on this subreddit, about Alliance camping the BRD entrance, and spamming emotes at solo players they just killed 10v1.
---
Know how it was answered? With tons of ally players saying the exact same shit you just said only horde players say. Your opinion is wrong. Get over yourself.
---
I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm right and I know a lot of the reason is bc of the racial skills, but I‚Äôve always figured they‚Äôre more popular bc overall their races are cooler looking in most peoples opinion. I know that‚Äôs just an opinion but I believe the opinion is so popular it makes horde more populated.
---
Spawn time is pretty random though the average is around 3-5 days. Some of the shortest spawn times have been less than 24hrs.
---
I'm betting most guilds will clear AQ40 in a few weeks tops.  It's not going to be hard.
---
Better PVP racials, e.g. Will of the Forsaken and Hardiness.
---
welcome to life is a far more accurate statement.
---
Who vomited on your UI to make it look that bad
---
Except you can't get honor from people who never show up. Not gonna find people in Stranglethorn if everyone else kills them while they're still in Ironforge.
---
He built a cult of idiots and then got mad when he was surrounded by idiots.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
It's nearly the same as it was 15 yrs ago, minus retail option. Not every server is horde dominate.  Deviate Delight is roughly 4:1 alliance favor, I play horde. Im sure once BGs go live population will spike, so quit your whining.
---
Blizz has said they'll open the gates after a set amount of time. They'll be behind everybody else but they'll still get to do AQ.
---
Yeah I do have my epic mount. That‚Äôs what I was thinking as later phases come out the price will increase
---
and escape artist is incredibly strong, especially for warriors/rogues, better than any horde racial.
---
i have a theory that these ppl talking about horde racials being OP are just ignorant noob normies that play stuff like nelf male priest cause they don't wanna be "ugly dwarfs/tiny gnomes" so they don't understand how good it is
---
Waiting a couple extra weeks to get your desired rank ruins your experience?
---
The Tragedy of the Commons is the fault of the system, not the people taking part in it.

Invite a friend
---
Convert to raid
---
Promote friend
---
Log off
---
Log in to alt
---
Have your friend invite your alt
---
Your friend can leave and once your alt is the group leader you can reset the dungeon yourself.
---
Log back into your alt every time you need a reset.
---
No it is against ToS, and no they don't care, like most things
---
If you go druid. Prepare to hate most of 1-20. After cat is ungodly easy. They scale very well in the lvling range. There is no way around autoattack-&gt;heal post fight though. You can keep a moonfire up, but wrath ain't worth it imo after lv 5. Once u get bear, it's the same with a few mauls
---
All we wanna do is farm instance resets with the bois.
---
i don't recall seeing any good guide by him, but i've seen clips discussing and giving tips from like 6-7 years back where he seems more like a normal dude just doing his thing.
---
Haha wow this meme is so funny and great I love how you can just avoid being a crybaby who I otherwise would have filtered with the "Gripe" tag just by putting a wojak on it lol haha wow i love this sub so much I love seeing the same screenshots of IF every day!!! its so lit!!! REDDIT IS SO LIT BROS I LOVE REDDIT I LOVE /r/CLASSICWOW AND /r/WOW SINCE THEY ARE THE SAME THING NOW EXCEPT THIS ONE HAS 50% LESS FANART COMMISSION gARBAGE AND 100% MORE WHINY POSTING FROM ASSMAD CRYBABIES LOL AHAHAHAHAHA I LOVE REDDIT I LOVE IT
---
By breaking ToS
---
No they dont.
---
Rank 11 is for top 1,4% of your realms pvp players.
---
The amount of honor or whatever headway you¬¥ve made during the wpvp season is absolutely worthless unless you have a premade ready to go.
---
Battlegrounds are so much more honor.
---
I'm only speaking from personal experience here, but I went from logging on daily for as much time as I possible could each day, to logging every second day or so to check my auctions and then log out immediately. I've been on for more than 10 minutes 4 times in the last 3 weeks and that was due to raids.   
---
Going out fishing and mining and farming for gold and whatnot became too frustrating to continue so I took a long break from doing so until bgs come out. 
---
At this point though I feel like the game has lost a lot of magic for some reason. I unsubbed last night, and am giving it until my time expires on the 18th to decide if logging in once a week for 2 hours to run MC is worth a subscription fee. It's almost like the time I took off to wait out the zerg fest of wpvp has broken whatever hold wow had on me. The social aspect was severely reduced by everyone just raid logging, the grind for gear wasn't appealing anymore due to 45 minutes of corpse running to get to an instance, gold farming went from fun and a good time killer to a waste of time, etc. Overall I feel like the time off let me think, and the thinking led to me thinking I don't really enjoy the game as much as I was telling myself I did.  
---
Things could change of course once bgs come out, but as of right now, I'm ready for something new. I've played every wow expansion except BFA for at least a year after it launched. I know this isn't an xpac, but it was new to me, and this is by far the fastest I've lost interest in a new form of wow.
---
the lotus of konoha blooms twice
---
Skeram is terrible. Unless a shitton of alli can join and hit 60. It's like willfully giving yourself diarrhea
---
No
---
Very insightful and cool response, thanks!
---
And no, as someone who played 15 years ago, this is absolutely nothing like it was.
---
Lots of intellect gear. Lots of bullets.
---
Put rank 1 serpent sting on your bar and hit it on cooldown
---
How is it a net negative for your 3 worst melee dps (off tanks and ret pallys) to slightly sacrifice there dps to increase the DPS of at least 10 of your higher dps characters by at least 10%? Your losing 20% dps maybe on 3 characters to increase dps by 10% for 10 characters...
---
&gt; let the community regulate itself.
---
That's exactly what they have done so far, and look where that brought us.
---
The answers to your questions are going to be very interesting and important to me. If the Menethil boat continues to be 24/7 Horde transport and most of the world remains closed off by starved raid groups then I think many people are going to throw up their hands for good. The population disparity will widen, which will compound in a self-reinforcing cycle. Right now many people remain with the hope that things will get much better and vaguely resemble Phase 1 again.
---
Most of the stats are actually from up to date info, the problem is one is based off raid logs and the classiccensusplus is far less accurate because of how it works now
---
I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äûgood guy‚Äú look from the alliance. 
---
That‚Äôs why I play horde haha
---
I thought it was emporer to angerforge...
---
It's not faction imbalance! It's the population cap!!!!
---
Isn't heartseeker a pve server? So alliance can't kill you in the open world unless you pvp flag? So you never have to corpserun 15-20 times just to get into BRM.
---
Good. You deserve it.
---
you probably listen to Cardi B and go to the salon with your guy friends
---
Try this one: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/story-teller
---
Did he just change from tauren to ud?
---
Yep we can take it back. But I‚Äôm trying to prove a point! 
---
That ally is so stuck up that they can‚Äôt see the hypocrisy in what they doing.
---
Edit; end you just helped me prove that
---
Oh man that's sad. People in that guild barely even want to be there anymore and they're still being  tortured. 
---
At this rate, the server will be a PvE server since the opposition all bailed from the world.
---
It auto opens eventually just slowly.
---
&gt;It's nearly the same as it was 15 yrs ago
---
15 years ago Alliance were the dominate faction on the vast majority of servers.
---
I didn't pickup classic because I got up to Naxx (not full clear but still) and remember that in the end endgame was just boring, aside raid night there's nothing unless you want to farm some rep.
---
Another issue is the game is "solved" so people are intentionally skipping on some items because they know loot tables of unreleased content, and everyone and their moms are already banking up BoE nature resist gear so even aq40 will be a joke.
---
i played horde back in vanilla with some rl friends and just stayed that way ever since. didnt know it would be that popular in classic (i wasnt trying to min-max or pick racials or anything.)
---
PvP servers can be a nightmare if you arent ready for it. Pre 50ish it's not too terrible, but after that you are worth a couple honor and will be farmed for it. If you go pvp, aim for the best balance possible. Wont make the ganking less but you will have times of peace from counter raids
---
Hey man are you good
---
Just spam open trades with them right when they need to get out of melee range so they die, then the mobs are yours, and at 50% life
---
Yeah the swing timing on the main hand is important. I also didn't mention if you went combat (which you should) then you should time your blade flurry and adrenaline rush after an opener/crusader proc!
---
Asmongold is a saint compared to Ice. There is no comparison.
---
i sort of like that hes stayed true to himself , i watched him years back when he didnt have a sub button and he was pretty much the same dude. i dont really like twitch other than watching a little from time to time but i like that he just stuck with it long enough to build a following that big. i occasional watch a youtube clip of him just to see what the bullshit is going on 
---
he obviously does play a bit of a character and overeact for viewers but man hes been doing that exact same thing for years. i find it sort of funny that he is like the biggest wow streamer now because like him or hate him he sure didnt follow what everyone else was doing and just made up his own style.
---
I'd think after server maintenance
---
Red vs. Blue is a stupid minimisation of the faction differences.  
---
In fact, when selecting a character for the first time, I doubt most people even know that Alliance are blue and Horde are red.
---
Excepting Pandas, each faction has very different races with unique racial abilities.  
---
Also, Alliance are seen as "The Goodies" and Horde "The Baddies".
---
So you expect alliance to be gracious and not do it while all the horde continues to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù doing that because, hey, horde are allowed to? Horde are just as hypocritical. Look in the mirror and get off your high horse.
---
They still are on some servers, maybe not the most popular of servers, but alas that is why I said "nearly the same".
---
My setup: Stances bound to mouse buttons, Gear sets bound to numpad numbers with itemrack.  The numpad setup for gear is not strictly ideal, and if you want to PVP, you should look for better ways. but i have yet to feel that it is inadequate for anything PVE. Just make sure your "panic gear" (swapping to shield, probably) is on the most reachable button, like "0". 
---
Why stances on mouse buttons you ask? changing stances has it's own cooldown, independent from the GCD. Therefore, you can group stance changes and abilities very tight together. Using two different hands for this means you can move while stance dancing, and also don't need to move your fingers between different buttons on the keyboard (saving time), while also granting you full flexibility. (you don't need lots of different macro modifiers for different stance+ability comboes.) 
---
Basically, you make stance dancing effortless, and then do everything else manually.
---
I genuinely don't know what anime has to do with not liking camera pictures of computer screens but alright
---
So yet another factor that isn't Red vs. Blue.
---
Because alliance is boring aesthetically. You have humans, elves then short humans and even shorter humans. On the Horde you have Orcs, Cow people, Trolls and undead. A big thing to remember is that peak WoW was wotlk I think right? but the game kept climbing throughout tbc and what not, but a big thing to remember is that blood elves were massively popular so people played horde to play blood elves and now those same people who come back to play want to play what they are familiar with.  
---
So those returning players, if they bring any friends with them will have them rolling horde. People cite racials but the amount of people that roll a certain character for their racials **alone** has to be incredibly small, like single digit percentage of players. Most people will play something that they think looks cool.
---
&gt; NO WAY DUDE NO WAY DUDE NO WAY DUDE NO WAY DUDE
---
Basically i think its too stressfull for the average player, maintaining aggro or the whole group die. Also to some degree; that they have to lean on others for a lot of content; i dont think ppl like that. Also you have to lead to some degree, which is super stressfull to some. Then all the assholes that fack up and blame you. Then you have the money costs, money farming, pvp and lack of spots for raiding (atleast in this phase). All of this combined results in a very niche playstyle, which i think most players do not enjoy.
---
Gnomes! Gnomes have always been the problem. Either being them or wanting to murder them. Gnomes.
---
You only need so many HOT heals for one raid, it's not like you need a druid for each group or something
---
No one will be banned because Asmongold's guild endorses win trading.
---
AV would like a word with you.
---
Second this. Was getting 100k/hr from 43-53 in ZF GY solo. It's rough at first but totally worth it.

doesn‚Äôt matter what guide you‚Äôre reading about paladins,

I started running SM cath for people or just buy myself and selling all the shitz. Can make 25-35G per hour.
---
There is no difference between someone being actually stupid and pretending to be stupid 24/7. Asmon might have a moment of clarity every full moon but that doesn't somehow discount the 99% of the time he's drawing toxic people to his stream.
---
That's how I've been playing this whole time. Is that not correct?
---
I've got a bank character sat safely in Stormwind and my main character travels zone to zone, moving hearth to the local inn until it's time to move to the next zone. Everything worth putting on AH gets posted to bank character.
---
drop black smithing, take up engineer and start making goblin sapper charges. Engineer and mining really go hand in hand and make your self some grenades and dynamite to help keep aggro or CC mobs in a dungeon. I sell truesilver transformers for about 6-8g each and sappers go for about 2g+ on my server. I also sell other things like goblin jumper cables XL for about 30-50g. There is a lot of money to be made with engineering and it can help in dungeons as mentioned above. If your farming mithril ore in badlands on the East side then kill the whelps and loot the small flame sac they also sell for about 1g each. How ever you can also use the small flame sac to create dragon breath chilli via cooking which also helps a tank keep aggro in dungeon and adds to damage, imo sell most flame sacs and keep a couple dragonbreath chilli for yourself.
---
They should have released it with the BGs in their original versions from the get go.   If for anything else, there were a lot of quests that went with it, especially AV.   You do a level and a 1/2 easily just from the quests.   Great way to farm rep with Org or SW too.
---
Most resto druids will do lower level healing touch spells.
---
It‚Äôs pvp.
---
Good times...
---
Coffers. Buy relic coffer keys at no more than 25s each.
---
Sell Blinding Powder, potions, and food on the AH.
---
It works. I just paid for exalted with UC and my epic mount with it.
---
(I use the addon FarmLog to track my approximate gold per hour. With coffers, I easily clear 60 g/h. Sometimes around 80.)
---
But what's the point?
---
I highly doubt people are going for r14 for pve progression.
---
But if you want the gear because you enjoy PvP, the route to r14 is nonsensical.
---
Win trading, and soon BG premades where you roll pugs in 5 minutes for 16 hours a day, yet any time you come up against another premade that could offer GOOD PvP, you forfeit or they forfeit so you can get back to farming pugs.
---
So, where's the actual benefit? It doesn't make much sense to me.
---
From stv zones and beyond the horde is relentless. Most quest hubs are covered in horde. We are outnumbered at minimum 2-1. Feels more like 3-1 tbh minimum but I‚Äôm being generous.
---
Please name a game that maintains its hype for months on end. Its 3 months now since classic's release.
---
Well, that's 25% more of the large group than the smaller group. That's like 50v40 in AV or 12-13 vs 10 in WSG. If that's the low end, and you have to do that all day every day, it gets pretty old pretty fast.
---
Get a mmo mouse if you dont have one; unlimited power :D
---
ok
---
If you're PvPing a lot, then go for 100 HP. It's not the 'optimal' DPS enchant when considered in a vacuum, but death is the biggest dps loss, so being a bit more tanky helps even in raiding.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure this post was literally just to show that not every server is horde dominant in PvP.
---
It's not that he has a large following it's the people in the following he draws in. If you pretend to be a nazi and jokingly repeat nazi rhetoric then guess what your large following will be, now replace nazi with toxic incel and you have Asmongold.
---
The thing is, you don‚Äôt have to be good at pvp for wpvp. All those goons in 20+ man raids sitting outside BRD aren‚Äôt good at pvp. If they were, they wouldn‚Äôt be doing that. General rule of thumb, the smaller the group, the better they are at pvp.

Tim the tatman is in Olympus? Didn't know that. Crazy

Blizzard outlines the diminishing returns in this article. https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/23221132/wow-classic-world-bosses-and-pvp-honor-system-available
---
Good thing most of the streamers announced which servers they'd go to so I knew what to avoid. 
---
In all seriousness, who is surprised?
---
report em and they get muted, its great cause this games fucked if you can't whisper or chat.
---
Any mage that‚Äôs iceblocked and cancelled knows that you still have aggro after if no one else has our threat you in that time.

Use demo shout/thunder clap for mitigation. Put on a shield if you feel youre taking too much dmg or see that your healer is having problems.
---
This is how you leveled back in the day too
---
Annnd? Thank you, humor police.
---
What did you use it for? enlarging gathering nodes or self morphing?
---
If you can find any evidence for someone getting banned for self-morphing in the past 6+ years I'll concede my point (you wont)
---
iirc when BGs first came out in vanilla it never gave experience. People ended up with permanent BG twink toons and Blizzard didn't like that so they added xp later on to force people to level up.
---
I feel like just doing wpvp would be easier. Are they really bringing in a lot of HK's with this method? Why would someone want to keep running back to their body for someone else to get HK I'm so confused about this in every way can someone ELI5?
---
cbeck jf you have any fire spells or i dont know fear
---
No. This is the first time anyone has had this idea.
---
Blizzard has literally confirmed it in classic to be 25.
---
Would be really fun to play WoW not using WASD and every other game with WASD... Yikes.
---
It's not that it's messy it just makes absolutely no sense at all, the placement is wrong on so many levels it looked like he just clicked on a randomize button for all of his UI
---
So Execute is generally the best damage/rage ability, but how good is the extra-rage-bonus-damage of execute compared to other abilities?
---
Like, say, if the boss is at 25% and I'm at 40 rage, do I smack down a bloodthirst, or build my rage to get a bigger execute once 20% hits?
---
100%. It was like a perfect storm of oversights and bad combinations. That recent post describing this as a high-caliber, ongoing version of the Corrupted Blood Plague incident was really on the mark.
---
Sure, it's been a trainwreck. But it's also fascinating almost from a sociological perspective.
---
The horde winning PVP back in the day in my experience was that some servers did have more PVP guilds running premades on the horde side.
---
You can‚Äôt cast spells when stunned/blinded/gouged/sapped
---
Leveling it does... I have both Alliance and Horde on Westfall and it's sooo much easier to find Alliance groups for instance runs. (Just due to the sheer amount of players.)
---
They had to. Otherwise they could not allow streaming. A streamer can easily talk to the other faction that is watching the stream and tell them what to do while they also use his chat. They decided the value from free advertising was worth destroying the integrity of that part of the game.
---
Why win trading would be any different, I don¬¥t know. For me it is the same and when they allow cross faction collusion, which they do, then it must follow that they allow win trading which is again cross faction collusion.
---
No wonder why my guilds always in Org ü§î
---
A rule that no one cares about, not even blizzard. I agree that names like XXPigBenisXX should be shunted, but so many ppl that complain about RP names also hate names like HarryMike.
---
Lock is 44 and druid is 49. Thing is i don't really want to turn into a flag carry bot, so I am leaning more towards warlock but I guess we'll see. My server is extremely horde dominant, so hopefully the queues aren't too terrible.
---
So multiple videos = 1 video where a person goes out of their way to be killed.
---
Sorry man I guess you‚Äôre right after all.
---
Horde bad alliance good.
---
GNOMES RULE!
---
This is fucking dirty.. Blizzard needs to ban honor farmers  like this trading wins to scam the system
---
haha 
---
owned
---
That‚Äôs not what I said either. (Damn dude you must be tripping thinking I say stuff I never did) 
---
What I said was alliance has no place to play the victim card on this subreddit when they do the same toxic shit as horde. 
---
That‚Äôs what I have been repeating for 3 comments now. But you still manage to misunderstand it.
---
They will still beat the piss out of you, because their stasis doesn't last forever.  That also breaks them so they will never go into stasis again, so you have to evade them to get them to reset.  You might as well go grind something that has drops.
---
which is why you removed yours huh?
---
&lt;Reign&gt; is literally the 3rd best US guild right now and there‚Äôs plenty of other guilds like &lt;Rise&gt; still going at it. But yes spout ignorant shit about how Alliance is dead and still get upvoted on this stupid circlejerk subreddit.
---
U should never die in stunock if ur using ur pet . Try to bait it out and obv don‚Äôt death coil as soon as their stun ends as that‚Äôs usually when they use it. Maybe curse of weakness to stall? If they don‚Äôt get the opener and u catch them with felhunter or something, bait it out with a fear, side step, and just kite it out and deathcoil -&gt; fear gg
---
The point was that if you flip the numbers, nothing would change other than the color of the banners doing the same shit. Not sure why that's hard to grasp. Horde has more players. Of course the faction with more players is going to be under the spotlight when it comes to this. Faction imbalance is your problem, but the color red is your strawman. Believe it or not, the Horde have the same types of players as the Alliance.
---
But, nah. Let's just pretend that the Horde caused a group of vigilantes to spark up and rebel and that they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't start it.
---
&gt; Yeah and rerolling on a pve server would take a month of full grind to get to same place, probably more time than that for most.
---
This is the tough part. It took a lot of time and effort to hit 60, and I just don't have the spare time and lack of responsibilities I did 15 years ago. Based on my experience playing on a PvP server back in 2004-2005, I had no idea things would end up with being unable to stick a toe in higher-level contested territory without immediately getting corpse camped. 
---
Back then, camping flight paths/boats was something a particularly notorious griefer would do, "Looks like [Name] is at it again lol". There was a rogue (of course) on my server who was infamous for that. Now it's the primary activity for a ton of players.
---
To be fair the only population sites you will find for classic are based off of census beta because (for some reason) blizzard absolutely refuses to give us the real numbers from their servers.
---
So if one faction, say alliance for example collects less players by /who scanning and maybe uploads to that site less, that could mean it will display more horde players when in reality that could not be the case, it just depends on how often both factions upload census data.
---
All your account are belong to base.
---
Not everybody is on their guard all the time. Sometimes people just want to sit back and enjoy a beer after work, and if they‚Äôre not familiar with blizzard, they could just walk into this.
---
Also, some people are 12. There are people who can fall for this.
---
Yep.This is abusing entire  honor system
---
Was thinking the same thing. I'd just say yeah sure dude I'll give you 50g then dip
---
That's a good point.
---
And I agree completely.
---
Wouldn't tentacled old gods being playable make more sense?
---
Not rare just fun, wait until you see the boss chatter that happens in ZG, that feature really makes me smile.
---
Healthstone &gt; Deathcoil first thing when you get out of stun
---
If he has Shadow reflector up, stun him with a grenade, create distance, and then Deathcoil when Reflector is done
---
assmongoloid strikes again
---
I'm planning on starting my Alliance adventure soon and I will choose Mirage Highway.
---
He also says things like ''Owned'' and 'Fools.. Kill the one in the dress!'' (priests)
---
it's ok to be horde.
---
the horde did nothing wrong.
---
not their fault alliance who left were a basket of betas.
---
He says WOOT! if he himself delivers the killing blow on either 1) a Tauren Warrior, or 2) a Human warrior.
---
Got to Warlord never saw something disgusting like that thankfully..but yes win trading waa bannable not everyone got caught tho
---
Because it's some of the best gear you'll have to last for a while, for some racing for the first kills on the server, and for fighting for world bosses
---
From my prospective, the Jedi are evil!
---
Honestly, I'm on fairbanks horde dominated 70/30 in and I only log on during raid nights because there's absolutely zero fun in ganking Ally on their way to BRM. It's fucking boring and there's no challenge. It's shit. I grew to love the horde while leveling but have run into so many dickheads on my server horde side, I really don't want to interact with anyone either so alts are out of the question. 
---
So, I rerolled alliance on Grobbulus and am having an absolute blast. People are actually nice and the RP element is something that keeps people having fun and helping others. Rolled a human warrior with no money or bags and at level 16, I have 24 gold bc people just see my human warrior in the night elf zones struggling and open trade with no warning to throw money in my bag for new weapons and gear and just to /s "good luck out there questing" or "playing warrior is tough." And even in Darkshore, I'm finding people to group with for quests. Just a few hours ago, I actually made friends to quest with through an entire level. Fuck pvp servers. I honestly may abandon my geared 60 and play exclusively RP until they open up paid transfers.
---
Sure. That's why the majority of horde players play as a human reskin (undead) with human architecture.
---
Totally has nothing to do with the racials.
---
That can ban streamers. They won't but they can. Moral integrity is lost by blizzard, shitty to see Blizzard....I know you do read Reddit.  They won't ban bots, they won't ban win trading, or streamers who break the rules. I know now the tos doesn't include cross faction communication but come on there has to be a line.
---
Probably, but phase 1 was not an indication of how bad phase 2 was going to be, and by the time the shitshow started I was way too invested to reroll PvE
---
What if I always have FAPs on me?
---
Lmao cry more ally scrubs
---
didn't they add the option to disable xp gain by taking to an NPC next to the war masters?
---
Dude, you need bagnon and vendor price.
---
You dont think playing as the living dead isnt tight as FUCK?
---
Cool you aoe'd
---
I really disagree with the #nochanges people, they should definitely revert it to the most fun version of AV. No way I'm subbing still with 1.12 AV.
---
https://streamable.com/euz7r

When you overload your blender.
---
I had similar issues with my razer mouse - it‚Äôs an I out setting you can adjust in the synapse app
---
BRD is crap.
---
If you are herb farming and ghost mushrooms are decently priced/decent sellers, just do Hinterlands. There are 3 in Skull rock which you can easily avoid slime combat even without stealth and 4 at the top of Jintha'lor (1 in the tunnel cave that leads to sharpbeak and 3 in the priestess cave where the hakkar egg is, these mobs are elite but easy to  stealth by + pickpocket gives you poison mats, blinding powder, and dusts of disappearance from boxes) and they are on a 15 minute-ish respawn so by the time to gather at skull rock and ride to gather at jintha'lor the skull rock shrooms will start respawning by the time you ride back.
---
7 shrooms every 15-20 minutes on loop + sungrass if you care to snag those on the route.
---
Any damage buffs, like frost shields or thorns, counts as fighting back, unfortunately. At least after the first death they‚Äôll be gone, lol.
---
That dono goal though
---
Y‚Äôall still get most the world bosses somehow though =/ I‚Äôm excited to see what BGs brings
---
tank and healer duo? Strat orbs all fucking day. Outside of that, spam dungeons and vendor greens.
---
Herod is perfect. A bunch of horde bots and a very strong alliance minority. They typically hold BRM, despite 3 to 1 fights. I really regret not going alliance here, looks so fun.
---
Then y stand there? That‚Äôs messed up
---
You should get your blood pressure checked.
---
Well, you're correct. It's just most pvp servers are horde heavy, is all.
---
Noggenfogger isn't 'horde leaning', it is completely controlled by horde in every part of the game.
---
Shout out to my homies from Heartseeker. I've been telling the horde to stop feeding these animals honor otherwise they'll keep coming as they expect it!
---
Good fu king oost finally something data backed
---
why are you gonna block me? tell me why or else i cant improve myself
---
you wont have time to do quests in this version of AV. its just rush towers and end boss...
---
Yeah, man. Punish the completely unrelated players on an entirely different server for what happened to a horribly imbalance one. It's the Horde at fault, not the game's design and balance.
---
In the ‚Äúhonor‚Äù system, the competition is your own faction, not the opposite one.  Wasting your own time against the opposite faction is literally throwing time away while other people are grinding honor.
---
I don‚Äôt see it as cheating, as the games only came up once every couple of days.  Even if there was no gentleman‚Äôs handshake, a smart GM grinding group would rather concede a 5 minute loss than waste their time in a 2 hour game.
---
I just found a green bat with +40 shadow damage!
---
It works in a regular party, there's no need to convert to raid.
---
Obviously it is faction imbalance but I just love to shit talk about the horde whenever I get the chance.
---
But honestly, faction imbalance was very much a part of vanilla, anyway. That is part of the reason they introduced sharding and cross realm junk. This is literally part of the "you think you do but you don't" stuff.
---
The more druids the harder it is to coordinate HOTS on tanks at least as well as raid healing. With 3 resto druids i pretty much only use healing touch which is slow and more often than not someone else with faster casting healed my target which results in canceling heal or overhealing. 
---
Are druids still viable and the innervates helpful? Yes. 
---
Is it better for the raid to have more priest/shams (horde player) and 1-2 resto druids max, I would say so, as a druid player. 
---
Priests and shams also have the on crit effect for 25% bonus armor to tanks which helps a lot. With more priests and shams its easier for this to stay up on tanks, and much better group/aoe healing functions
---
Horde bad
---
Alliance good
---
Devs bad
---
Omar good
---
"I only like pvp when it suits me"
---
What does this comment even mean
---
You should think realistically for once.
---
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that serious lol
---
People think there are little elves sitting in a tree somewhere reviewing reports...
---
enough people report, it happens.
---
My server, Blaumeux, is apparently one of the best servers in terms of health and faction balance, but phase 2 drew me out of the game. I rolled PVP to join a friend that barely passed level 25, and now I really wish I could transfer to PVE - not going to reroll, too invested already on my cow.
---
My character is pretty well off already, around 80% prebis for feral tanking, got my epic mount, even got the Warden Staff, but I found that, even not considering the FP camping and deathballs, phase 2 made the world so much more toxic that I'm unwilling to keep going, and I just let my game time run out and I'm following reddit to see if they ever open up transfers to PvE. 
---
I'm already not so much a PVP person outside of specific PVP modes, and I found that upon the onset of phase 2, questing, exploring the world, and even grinding mindlessly were made so much worse because on phase 1 you could most of the time just wave or take the wide way around someone and that would be that, but pretty much 100% of the time I see a red 60, they go for the throat, and it doesn't help I have pretty much the worst class/spec for PVP. The game's already a chore at times, mindlessly grinding for whatever, I don't want to add multiple gank deaths while I'm questing in the ass end of fucking Azshara to that.
---
Why are your graphics settings so low? You have an RTX 2080, lol. Max that slider out, turn the render size up to 200%, and bask in the beauty of this game.
---
I have the 8700K/2080 combo and have zero issues with everything maxed out. You don‚Äôt need any AA this way either, it looks real nice.
---
I'm a heal druid for raiding and I don't ever plan on raiding anything other than resto. But I still keep extra sets in bank that do get used at times.  Takes up a lot of bank space for us druids with extra sets.
---
Resto pve, resto pvp, balance, tank, and resto resist pieces
---
Thanks friendo

---
Lmao it's obviously because there are more than 2 level 60's so the Horde are too scared to engage, especially if those 60's are at full health.
---
Awesome, I didn't know for sure if they would be cross realm, if they are that is going to be great, queue times shouldn't be that bad at all. 
---
FC's are great, but i had a lock in the 39 bracket in TBC(please blizz release tbc for arenas) and really enjoyed it, so figured i would go for that again in just a higher bracket for a couple extra spells.
---
If I do settle on lock, it's named Memi, so I'll cya in the bg's! GL as well!
---
Seems like a normal day on Noggenfogger EU tbh. Just need a group of alliance gambling in front of bank and you have it.
---
I think there are UI overhaul addons that has buff filters. At least I know ElvUI does since I use that one, but I think using ElvUI for that one feature would be too much for you.
---
I'm not 100% sure but maybe CTMod's Buff mod has a filter (glanced through the source code and I think I saw a filter functionality, but I have not used this mod so maybe just try it out for yourself) 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ctmod (as the author says this mod is modular so you only really need to install the library+buff mod)
---
Meanwhile, all of the Alliance in the world constantly getting demolished by smaller groups of Horde because nobody on Alliance will organize and fight together. Also impossible to get on the Menethil boat half the time. 
---
Source - play alliance on heartseeker.
---
I get that one, big time. My server (Fairbanks) is pretty imbalanced, but thankfully not the absolute worst on that count, and Azshara has kind of become my refuge.
---
That Olympus is a shit stain on the community?
---
Can you name another group that's brought so much bullshit drama into Classic? I can't.
---
Cant do this inside unfortunatly. So i guess it depends on location
---
The alliance mage involved has hit over 100k stretching the ranks in the last few weeks.
---
yea man iwouldnt play hunter without it!
---
Wish my guild was at the pug lvl &gt;.&gt;
---
9/10 for the past 3 weeks due to timing i.e. takes us too long on our first day and too many no-shows to down rag &gt;.&gt;
---
Heartseeker alliance come from stalagg which was 60% horde 40% alliance down to about 15% alliance now, horde took ironforge on stalagg while alliance took orgrimmar on heartseeker.
---
and when you apply dots then break it and log off?
---
As a rogue. Warlock with felhunter and Google's is infuriating. You cannot get close enough to use an ability. It feels like 30 yards
---
/suf and then go to enabled frames and click whatever ones u want active. its weird for mine that when i want party activated i have to get rid if my player unit frame, but i also dont know much about it and set it up quickly
---
Now that is creative and original.  Aplaus! Or maybe it should be mourn..
---
hah hard times man. I have been taking tests for jobs, and looking while playing.
---
I just want a discussion!
---
Sounds like your entire life is wow
---
they will do it, but they will redistribute the entire game, so classic statys classic, people can copy characters on to TBC server pre-launch
---
Lmfao someone has no fucking clue what they‚Äôre talking about
---
Not in vanilla. AQ opened in a patch afterwards.
---
That‚Äôs why you put a limit on players per faction or offer server transfer or force faction change. Or something along those lines, idk how you‚Äôd even fix it.
---
I don't disagree, but I don't really see how that pertains to what I said. My point was that playing a private server CAN make you an expert at vanilla/classic wow. Like I see people saying "BuT tHeRe NoT tHe SaMe" but it's like this. Two people can study the same subject but at different colleges, the curriculum might not be exactly identicle, but in the end we can say that both people have become experts in the same field. That's the way I see it anyways.
---
It‚Äôs a PvE server, there is not other wpvp since literally nobody runs around flagged anywhere except Hillsbrad. Hillsbrad PvP is typically a big zerg with the same few dozen people killing each other over and over so you want to get as much honor for each kill as you can because of DR. When the top weekly standings are only 80-100k honor, having a few people feed you four full honor kills worth 600-700 honor total is a big deal.
---
Playing a server side with 100+ guilds which cannot communicate and grab them together to defend a capital and playing a server side which has one TRUE guild where everyone cares and they have 1 leader with a number of officers that makes them a single organic and a True Power are different things actually.
---
Apologies for my English.
---
I mean, clearly you did, as with natural regen and front loading your spells and life tap you can very well just go forever....
---
Rat-man is a loser who likes to cheat? SAY IT AIN'T SO!
---
You are delusional if you think a 25% stun resist passive on top of having a base 5% stun resist or Wotf which is essentially a free trinket + 5 second immunity to the strongest CC in the entire game are even close to being able to escape a frost nova once and stoneform/fear ward.
---
.... yes, indeed.
---
so?
---
They actually banned a bunch of people for using it in sept, Even put out a "press release"
---
thanks for your insight captain obvious.
---
Is it the strongest gold farm spec in regards to mara farming? I have a 60 holy priest and do dm east lasher farms every once in awhile and have had very good luck with boe and recipe drops. But considering respecting to shadow for BGs here soon
---
Why are you guys Hitmonlees?
---
Yea, no one deserves to play this game! No one!
---
Do you have a source?
---
and what about them makes you think they are sweaty pvp tryhards?
---
Then why even make your comment?
---

---
awesome thank you for all of that info!
---
Yeah it's hilarious. No AQ for that pve server.
---
I think you're just very bad at the game and lose battles constantly and so you are bitter at the game and then complain about pvp on a pvp server, go play a different game you little baby, i think hello kitty island adventures is more suitable for you, not world of **war**craft.
---
I get group ganked on a daily basis, camped by skulls, etc but i know that i signed up for it by choosing a PVP server, vanilla's worldpvp design is extremely flawed but also very fun at the same time in the very rare chances that you do get a fair fight.
---
I don't claim to be above anyone, I'm just not a dumb person and i pay attention to the decisions i make and i understand that they will determine what happens in my future, in this case, PVP happening on a PVP server, go figure.
---
With a single sub you manage multiple characters on different servers, maybe even faction-wide.
---
You can't balance subs around that shit.
---
There is no optimal choice in online games if you don't wanna dead with kids/manchildren. Implying that Horde as fewer than Alliance is as absurd as saying that Horde are the only bad ones in WPvP.
---
Definitely not prebis. Crimson felt hat is better for PvP and farming. A green of shadow wrath is better for raid DPS. World bosses drop +41, 40 can drop from high level mobs, and 38 is cheap and still better than shadow wrath.
---
Lens is solid for leveling though.
---
Punkrat and followers specifically bragging about Horde not being able to enter BRD because of them.
---
Asmongold being asmongold
---
It was a joke. How oblivious can you get? Learn how context works lmfao
---
Remember bloodlord mandokir or whatever the zg raptor boss was? When he got a kill (or a certain number of kills with his execute ability maybe? ) he'd yell: "Ding!!!!" And "level up".
---
it should depend on how fast the boss is going down.
---
if it's going pretty quickly, wait and build up rage. If not, use it up and build it when it's closer to 20%.
---
All of our homies transferred, quit, or raid log.
---
Shut up, nerds.
---
Weapon skill and hit don't matter in pvp (afaik).
---
Same deal with lv. 60 mobs (that aren't bosses). You should have max weapon skill but the hit doesn't matter.
---
hur durr noobs!
---
Almost my whole guild played horde originally but never played alliance before classic. Personally I just couldn't do the same quests/instances again as a horde and wanted a more fresh experience. There are a lot of horde to alliance rerolls.
---
It'll be interesting to see how the BG's play out, given the same sort of aspects you've outlined.
---
It will be premades galore, everybody timing their queues, people scouting out other premades, etc.
---
You won't do well if you just solo queue.  You'll join up with other solo's or a party, and you'll get absolutely steamrolled by 10/15/40 on discord coordinating and farming that BG.
---
They might not even end the BG, they might sit there farming HK's at the graveyard.  You'll join a BG partway through, flag caps are 2/3 to 0/3, your entire team (of the people that haven't abandoned already) at the graveyard being AOE'd.  Even if you wanted a comeback, those empty spots from people quitting won't get filled right away as people miss their queue-pop.
---
You'll basically have to join a premade to do well.  But even beyond that, it will be interesting to see how the queues actually function in classic.
---
My server is pretty balanced and it's still aids for me to level my priest (lvl 53). I haven't gained a level since phase 2 and my alt is broke. I should gave just rerolled pve.
---
Sir this is a macdonalds drive through

If you're SL you wont die in a stun lock. Especially if you have a VW to sac. If you have a felhunter out it's 50/50 who gets the opener (Catseye goggles makes it almost impossible for me to open on warlocks with a felhunter out). As soon as you come out of a stun lock you'll want to use some instant cast dots to prevent a restealth and maybe bait shadow reflector while making it impossible for you to get spell locked. If they dont use it right away and are still on top of you its fairly safe to go for the deathcoil. If that lands you're safe to fel dom another VW and at that point you have won already. If you really struggle with the matchup I would recommend keeping some LIPs FAPs and grenades on you as they make it very one sided.
---
Healing touch isn‚Äôt a hot (since you don‚Äôt seem to know it by name).
---
don't matter. they have CDs. so gnome would be superior as they can also use FAPs
---
He is right though, I felt I was physically threatened when I read your first comment üòÇ
---
Not to mention that Swifty left Faerlina, so that's one less source of content, I think? Did Advertise even make a video regarding Swifty?
---
Sometimes it's just your friends. When I started playing WoW back in vanilla my friends were all horde so I played horde (I eventually got one alliance character to lvl 60 near the end of vanilla but I played it 100% solo and it was mostly to see the quests). I stayed playing only horde until I stopped playing near the end of WotLK.      
---
        
---
Now on Classic my friends decided to roll alliance so I went and did that, sadly now most have stopped playing (and I just cancelled my sub since not having enough people to raid got boring) but it was fun while it lasted.       
---
EDIT: And honestly I think most races on both sides look good enough, as horde I played mostly tauren then blood elf and orc while on alliance my vanilla alt was a night elf and in vanilla I got a human to 60 and a dwarf to 40.
---
That was some quality content.
---
Do you think twink items will go up or down in value after bgs come out
---
Yea.. I've been wondering about bgs as well. It's kind of unfortunate but seems pretty inevitable. I never really played bgs when I played private servers so I'm not sure how it played out there.
---
I'm just going to stick with the pve server I switched too.
---
That way I can still enjoy the main part of the game I like. Shame pvp server didn't work how I wanted but oh well.
---
I am going to hope bgs turn out okay on pve servers at least. People over there may not be as sweaty.
---
Picking a race to take advantage of the ganking racials, and then ganking people to the point they quit the game is what makes someone a bad person. 
---
Ability for people to think things through instead of reducing the argument to something divorced from what people are actually saying is pretty sad.
---
looks like you had at least half of a raid yourself. and I doubt that they were 40.
---
To be fair, they spent the time to do a depth investigation to find abnormal account so you should probably response back as soon you can.
---
&gt; There are a lot of horde to alliance rerolls.
---
My friend group among them. We now have a running joke about how we should have just stuck with horde in the first place. Sure, pallies are cool, but have you tried fishing without getting 5v1?!
---
https://youtu.be/j05hzwQf8pA
---
Look for a gnome named Dewalter. It's gonna be bloody.
---
Wtf, plenty of alliance dominated zones on this server.
---
I had this same problem, where out be working great, then all of a sudden something won‚Äôt show. I gave up and switched to ElVui. It‚Äôs also a bit of a headache, but I like it more
---
you can see in my raid frames we were 9, there were a couple other horde there too.
---
Imagine being that lame... some people take this game way too seriously.
---
Can‚Äôt say they were very smart back in the day, calling it a pvp spec without 5/5 enrage is a bit of a meme
---
I may be off base but I think he's not even talking about wow. To me and a lot of others, wow is a kid brother game nowhere on the level of EQ. When we were first doing raids in EQ we really were scrounging everywhere we could for other guild's info and advice, compiling info by word of mouth and cross server phone calls, a lot of the time no one wanting to share anything with each other anyways because you were racing.
---
wait until you fight bloodlord mandokir
---
Rats are smarter than humans. Not really a surprise actually. If you won't let someone play,  of course they are going to quit. Might as well shoot yourself in the other foot too while you're at it.  I'm so glad I'm Horde on a Horde dominated PvE server where I can just play. I think trying to get players to give each other a break is impossible due to human nature. It's a shame we aren't as smart as rats, isn't it?
---
They will go up
---
Were you able to find a good ElvUI set up? I'm looking for a Warlock set up too
---
Both have horde sitting in their main cities
---
yikes
---
a couple?? Did we watch the same video? There are more horde out of raid than in.
---
I wish i understood any of this.
---
Its every 3 kills he levels up and shouts "Ding!"
---
Jin'do also yells back "Grats!"
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community#us-realms
---
The idea that it's just horde isn't based on real numbers.
---
There's almost as many alliance favoured realms as horde ones. And the top alliance favoured ones are more skewed than horde ones.
---
But we only see one faction complaining non stop on Reddit.
---
Reddit is full of hive mind idiots, what else is new?
---
They override each others hots all the time which is very mana inefficient and a single druid is capable of providing hots for the whole raid. Healing touch's cast time is significantly longer than priests/shamans/paladins big heals so they will almost always get the heal off before you. The main reason to bring one in the first place is for MoTW and FF assuming you don't have a feral/balance druid. You can certainly bring more than one and clear raids these are just the reasons why they aren't plentiful in min/max raid comps.
---
This reminds me of that old post about people falling into the hole in sunken temple and the dragons saying something bizarre and basketball like but now I can't find it üò™
---
I was giving visible examples of alliance having sweaty mouthbreathing edgelord pvpers, not refuting that horde has majority on most pvp servers.
---
Don't lose the thread
---
He definitely did that in like late 2005 or early 2006 whenever I first went into zg in vanilla. I didn't even know there was a revamped version.
---
Helloooooo everybody
---
I'm the only Resto Druid at the moment, and lately I've been in the top 3 (sometimes top) on the healing metres. I don't go oom faster than the priests either. My secret is that I save innervate for myself (lololol). A well played Druid can definitely compete with the rest of them. However, we'll be adding a second Resto Druid soon, and I kinda wonder how that's going to go.
---
The way I'll tackle it is I'll stay on tank healing, and they can HoT the rest of the raid. If we end up adding a third (and final I reckon) then we can have me putting HoTs on tanks, then the rest of the raid can be split between the two of them for HoTs.
---
Going up to 4 Restro Druids might be counter productive, but I'd be happy to hear someone else's take on it.
---
The dream team might be one full Resto to HoT up the tanks, then a Moonglow druid to very efficiently Healing Touch the tanks, and HoT up the rest of the raid as required. You could probably reach max efficiency that way with just two.
---
imagine growing up your entire life, joining an entirely virtually fantasy game, finding out it has factions, and then deciding you basically wanna play the cops
---
My point is that that doesn't change the fact that HOTs can't stack- yes people downrank healing touch, but a huge part of druid healing kit is HOTs. Just because you can downrank healing touch doesn't mean druid is suddenly better than other healing classes when their kits rely much less on Hots
---
Hi, /u/SENT0N

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e84e8p/what_is_the_name_of_the_ui_he_is_using_in_the/). 
---
Keep in mind that mitigation is typically not an issue for tanks in MC and BWL. It's not until Naxxramas that bosses are actually designed to murder the tank if they're not wearing the proper mitigation gear for that fight.
---
To answer your question, you should aim to obtain all of the important threat generation pieces that are available to your class including OTP. And the same logic applies to mitigation gear as well. All three roles adapt their gear based on the encounter, but tanking differs the most from other roles in that you need to swap out and adapt your gear to specific encounters much more than the other roles do.
---
Yeah, you should get OTP.
---
Not even 80-100k. Weekly standing shows 67k as being number 1.
---
calling it a reskin is really just intellectual dishonesty
---
As a horde Pagle-ite, may we please have one world boss?  Pretty please?
---
I plan on soloing and I would assume there will be a lot of other players on the weekends especially doing the same.
---
Nobody is going to be banned. You can do whatever you want with the tools the game provides.
---
I understand that it feels unfair but jesus christ get your priorities in order. This is a game. All of these posts treating win trading like its a serious crime.
---
... I think you're including PvE realms, because that's 100% not close to being true
---
What about if I‚Äôm not SL? I can‚Äôt afford to respec for each raid so I‚Äôm just running SM ruin and it seems like by the time I‚Äôm out of the stunlock I‚Äôm on about 10% hp
---
You thought you did... and for a while you did... but really you didn‚Äôt.  - for the quitters
---
That's about the same rating i would give to your pvp skills.
---
And were you saying it was faction imbalance as a counter to horde being assholes, or were you saying it was a contributing factor? Because a counter will result in what you said, a contributing factor won‚Äôt.
---
we are yet to see blizz ban for win trades 
---
they dont care and there is no way to submit evidence like this
---
it unfortunately is also pretty easy to fake evidence so i dont see blizz changing their minds 
---
im not 100% sure how win trades will work in bg's but im sure it will be a problem there too.
---
at least long queues for 1 faction should make win trades harder
---
Same, I just haven‚Äôt seen anyone say anything about it. I‚Äôm 54 and have been getting ganked quite a bit and I never see hordes out slaying, however it‚Äôs not bad enough to deter me from playing.
---
So you're saying that a high-rage execute is more damage than a lower-rage execute + a bloodthirst?
---
Yeah hes #1 on his side.
---
There's a lot of hardcore players that have the mindset that if you aren't cheating then you aren't trying.
---
Especially those who believe themselves to be at the top.
---
I mean that's not the reason that these posts get upvoted in alliance cities, this sub doesnt have a random hard on for the alliance. It's just more common to see alliance cities filled with horde because most PvP servers are horde dominated, meaning there'll be more posts and complaints from one side.
---
You must be so fun at parties
---
It really depends on which kind of guild you are running.
---
In our guild we have warrior DPS pushing DPS meters hard so we need to gear tanks to hold aggro.
---
That was the server I was playing on. Once a friend of mine bragged about camping orgrimmar I knew it was time to cancel the sub. The try hards ruined the experience.
---
Thanks, didn‚Äôt consider rank 1 agony. Will give that a try next time
---
Priests have a similar fight. Tbh I haven't survived a well played &amp; well geared rogue with preparation who gets the full combo. But anytime I get out of a rogue my first to do is get a dot on them. throw a grenade if they have the reflector, instead of a fear. You'll want to pop a health stone or potion, where I usually pop my shield. It's a tough fight if they use everything. But warlocks supposedly can tank it.
---
None taken, I definitely shouldn't have rolled PVP, but hindsight is 20/20. I had retail experience, and the most I heard about Classic's differences was that it was less hand-holdy and linear, but nothing had prepared me for the game shifting so drastically several months down the line. I definitely would have rerolled PVE if the overall world aggression was anywhere as bad as in phase 2 in the first month or so.
---
Whats a good Alliance PvE server? Me and my friend want to start playing on one.
---
You're playing Classic because its Classic. I'd say MOST people are playing Classic because its closer to the WoW they love than Retail, and they love WoW. Same as people who play OSRS instead of Runescape 3. Don't assume shit just because you're that way mate. Nothing is a stupid discussion to be having, don't dismiss anything in life because you immediately disagree with it, think a little. 
---
I respect if you don't want it because of your reasoning, but get out of here with calling the discussion stupid (implying people who think it are stupid) just because you don't.
---
Err it's in the TOS and they did ban it 15 years ago lol
---
Being majority faction will encourage, enable, and make asshole behavior more visible, has nothing to do with whether that faction is horde or alliance.
---
Which is me agreeing with /u/Denworath, what I was pointing out is that there are many people who think it's because people are horde, and not because they're the majority faction.
---
The players 100% caused this issue. Don't blame Blizzard for giving people an escape from it.
---
Yeah, their actually is. Otherwise their wouldn‚Äôt be consistent horde domination if it was just red or blue. 
---
The fact that pve is alliance dominated and PvP is horde dominated alone hints at a statically significant difference in faction selection. What that is can‚Äôt be determined, but to argue it is just two different shades of kool-aid is disingenuous at best.
---
Further, from what I understand, most of the alliance dominated servers are the result of faction transfers, thus they can‚Äôt be treated as a standard population since we know they have different experiences from the common population. 
---
I swear basic research methodology should be taught in schools.
---
You just admitted to finding disgusting toxic assholes entertaining.
---
And the horde can? Dude, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs toxic either way. I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you that alliance have toxic players too. But bear in mind it‚Äôs players, not factions that are toxic. You don‚Äôt tar all alliance with a single brush, and the truth is there are far more alliance who end up being ‚Äúvictims‚Äù. 
---
Ok. Just blame the alliance. It‚Äôs all their fault. That‚Äôs what you need to feel better, and I won‚Äôt argue with you.
---
What a shock
---
If people actually use the census addon it's accurate
---
You can easily play this game and enjoy it without even touching pvp if that‚Äôs what you desire. Pve is tons of fun
---
&gt;EINGEKERKERTER
---
German is.. a silly language.
---
if you have to ask, you'll never know
---
Wow horde is so ruthless they are kidnaping alliance players into orgrimar :(
---
Not important at all.
---
For non-tank melee, you'll eventually need nature resist for Princess (AQ40) and Kel'thuzad/Sapphiron (Naxx).
---
For casters, you'll eventually need frost resist for Naxx (as above).
---
Healers never equip resist gear (although they may incidentally receive resists on otherwise BiS gear).
---
Note: Onyxia cloaks for Nefarian are an exception here. Although clever raid positioning can obviate the need for them as well.
---
You in group?
---
Anyone with a basic understanding of dats could tell you that it‚Äôs not just red or blue, otherwise the populations across the servers would average out to close to 50/50. Considering that we know for a FACT that a majority of time horde dominates PvP, and alliance dominated pve, that there are statistically significant differences in the type of players that select alliance or horde. 
---
I swear, basic data comprehension and analysis should be aught in schools.
---
But isn‚Äôt this a victim mentality? I get camped, so I‚Äôm gonna make sure every alliance has hell! 
---
But when alliance go through the SAME experience, except they can‚Äôt always fight back due to population difference, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre playing the victim card! You have no right to.‚Äù
---
Uh ok...
---
Its will be an absolute disaster. Phase 2 killed the casual. Became impossible to level in any 48+ zone. BG's will kill the enthusiasts. Blizzard will dump all the content to try and satisfy the hardcore. A few will get T2, and boast in this sub. Just in time for tax season. GL everyone. It was a real 13 days played time. Sold my shit, mailed my friend the gold, deleted and unsubbed.
---
weird how consistent the community is between the 2, huh
---
Doesn't work on or out of grp
---
It's worse than pve. You can still pvp on a pve server. You can't do shit on an abandoned server.
---
Man this upsets me.
---
Back in vanilla my account was permabanned (nearly full t3 rogue) after being hacked.  Blizzards reasoning was that regardless if i was hacked or not, the user ‚Äúmanipulated the economy‚Äù (whatever that means).  I accepted it, makes sense in the end.
---
But this? Streamers have been manipulating the economy and now honor exchange and blizzard is turning a blind eye.
---
He's sitting consistently at 3000 viewers that's pretty solid. He'll be okay.
---
No it was blizzard that caused the issue by allowing transfers. Realms didn't start out imbalanced like this. People who transfered away caused this. Idiots that can't take pvp should have gone to PvE realms instead of making PvP realms into PvE realms by ruining the balance.
---
My point still stands
---
eh... i'm on whitemane we can't do anything in contested territory right now. i don't believe that for a second.  we'll see
---
Casting animations are cooler so that's casters out of the way.  
---
Two handed melee swing looks dumb, so that's why you dont go warrior  
---
UD Rogue is pretty much the go-to.
---
What context? You commented on a post months old. There‚Äôs no context.
---
You even downvoted me.
---
Now this is a shit take, what is an individual horde player supposed to do? Holding "the players" accountable does nothing, when such an entity cant even be addressed let alone controlled. Blizzard, on the other hand, actually has ways of controlling said players, thus making it their responsibility to address the issues players are facing. But I guess it's easier to say green man bad
---
Yes, allies who were ganked so bad they had to leave their servers are the same as regular horde. 
---
Wonder what the difference is......
---
That's true, I don't want to dole out too much credit here.
---
I can't stand the male nelf casting animation... Let me throw my headache at the enemy quick....
---
To be fair, the Warlock runs were PUG runs advertised on steam as being shameless loot funnels and that he'd be taking any relevant gear.  They weren't normally-scheduled runs.  Everyone who participated should have understood that was what was going on.  I'm not really trying to defend loot funneling, just pointing out that everyone in the raid should have known it was going to happen, since that's how they were presented.  
---
I don't necessarily think his Warrior has gotten anything in raid that would be out of line for the main tank to be getting priority on, from what I've seen.  As far as I'm aware, that raid is the only real raid he runs as a guild raid.
---
I'm so glad millenials ruined classic.  I'll forever remember how great classic wow was when the idiots who are playing the game now were playing flappy bird instead.
---
Now be a big boy and compare PvP to PvP and pve to pve instead of trying to fudge the numbers.
---
Sweats will gravitate to pve realms for that reason, they‚Äôll assume there‚Äôs less hardcore pvp players which translates to an easier grind for them.
---
It's the fault of people that transfered and blizzard's for allowing transfers in the first place.
---
that guy's a try hard piece of shit. But the horde on my server were doing the same thing in hillsbrad... and redridge, and duskwood etc.
---
Cross realm
---
For some players. PvP is kind of an ugly beast right now. The hope is that Battlegrounds, which are more organized arena PvP modes, will even things out a bit. But right now, the popular PvP servers seem to be imbalanced, leading to a lot of ganking and camping from the dominant faction. It's not really PvP, it's more just players min-maxing honor because it is the only way right now.
---
I know people keep saying this but he actually tanks for his guild. I don't know about the looting but most of the time on stream he's been fine with it. But if the raids on stream are anything to go on he actually plays the content and either tanks or does fine DPS. Im not stupid enough to go 100% to bat for a multimillionaire who plays video games for a living, but I know what I'm watching.
---
You call being camped out of your main capital city to the point the whole server worth of alliance said fuck it I'm not paying to play like this is losing? That's called griefing.
---
NA/Oceanic/EU?
---
1/10
---
AV. I ran too many WSG premades back in the day. Not even gonna queue it.
---
Down, too many people have been hoarding them and the market will be saturated and driven down by undercutting
---
Now what are the odds that the people who transfer would have quit otherwise? Because for your argument to go,d water it would require that all those people kept playing.
---
I went to the trouble of linking one because you were too lazy to look through the sub, there are others, but I'm not doing any more of your work for you. Go look for yourself or keep being ignorant it's not my problem.
---
It started out somewhat balanced but allowing transfers snowballed out of control. There would be no issues if they didn't allow transfers at all. Even a 40 - 60 is not unplayable.
---
They probably were. My point, and the point of this thread, is that this isn't a Horde problem. It's a people problem. It just happens to be Horde that has the majority on most of the servers, so we see Horde griefing more often.
---
It's because he actually plays the game pretty hardcore.
---
BuT iT's BeTtEr
---
nah
---
you want more dungeon because you finished all dungeons.
---
everything has a beginning has an end. whatever they add will be obsolete eventually
---
the reason your life is meaningful is because your death is guaranteed. hope you get it
---
search model controversy on the forums, you can get multiple blue posts.  TLDR "We recently completed a wave of suspensions for World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be operating third-party software that undermines the security of the World of Warcraft client." is the general statement.
---
Lol what the hell are you talking about, there are a ton of innovative indie games that come out each year.
---
mistakes happen
---
cool story mate sounds like you got hell of a journey in front of you. when i started playing in vanilla we horde were outnumbered 2:1 and i loved being the underdog.
---
makes me wanna roll on your server but my char is 52 so wanna stay commited to 60 ! 
---
maybe ill join one day, best of luck to you. hope you get your city back one day.
---
I thought we already established collusion wasn't against the rules when you all freaked out about the Ungoro crater. Do you need to learn the same lesson all over again? Blizzard doesn't give a shit.
---
Too many gnolls
---
This pleases me. I‚Äôm going to go level up my alliance alt on Heartseeker now :)
---
Ok. Make that 30 minutes 5 hours and come back and tell me you are fine. I‚Äôve had that happen to me once. I‚Äôve also had the only 2 hours I have to play camped daily every night and zero progression for 3 days. Until you have that same experience, yes, I will raise that population imbalance is an issue. 
---
This is a like a domestic abuse case, where the husband hits his wife consistently. The one time she hits back and scratches him, he screams and claims she does the same shit to him so she has no right to say it is domestic abuse.
---
AV for the crossbow quest
---
You mean playing the game that came out after mop release?
---
Now be a big boy and see that the number is listed and across all pvp realms its only 57-43 Horde to alliance in USA and 55-45 in EU. 
---
And if youre on a RP PvP realm in the USA? 59% alliance to 41% horde across the RPPvP servers.
---
The idea that outside a few realms its this massive difference in numbers isnt supported by the actual numbers.
---
LETS TAKE BACK FLAMELASH!
---
Transfers ended days ago. You‚Äôre stuck where you are unless you want to reroll all over again on another server.
---
This server is the one exception lol?
---
No.
---
To cut off comments from the last time someone posted this, what we want specifically, is to be able to zone in, if your corpse is in range of the portal.  Not to res and attempt to jump past the freezing traps/fears/stuns
---
WPVP is a massive disappointment
---
Do you expect anything different from a GM that not only condones but encourages ninja looting? Ban then all.
---
Everyone can easily talk to the opposite faction what the fuck are you on about? Streamers have nothing to do with the Ungoro maffia you idiots just like to drool over hating streamers. Maybe some of them do it but just because they do something doesn't mean they are the only ones.
---
Of course they can! Go on fucking Yojamba, alliance is so fucking organised they give horde a good fight at BRM or any end game area. They are not controlled by ally like the zones I have mentioned but they give you a good run for your money. So do not speak in their name like they are incompetent, if you don‚Äôt believe me go on r/yojamba and they will tell you the same. 
---
Also where the fuck did you get the ‚ÄúI make sure every alliance go through hell‚Äù I said I will kill every lower level alliance I come across. 
---
Running along roads killing someone once then keep going to look for other players does not count toxic in my mind while fp camping does. 
---
Every single alliance player try to twist my words so they have the right to pick on me for being horde. Get the fuck out! I don‚Äôt camp flight paths or choke points I just kill people I come across on my ‚Äúmeaningful journey‚Äù!
---
I‚Äôve always seen people just complaining about faction imbalance. I think your going overboard with being defensive about partisan politics
---
I love that people still remember these names after all this time.
---
Ah
---
What are the odds we see paid server transfers implemented and when do you think Blizzard will do so?
---
thanks.
---
I understand your point, but I'm not going to search for evidence to prove a claim that you made. No one should expect that.
---
I just don't understand what you are trying to prove with this. A guy goes out of his way to be killed and that proves that "horde bad?"
---
What realm?
---
Very nice - congratulations. Female gnome though... ouch, gross.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=291450/model-swapping-bans-reduced-to-warnings
---
&gt;Why Ban in the First Place?
---
Many players used these programs for relatively harmless purposes, such as swapping their character model from one race to another, creating custom outfits, using transmogs they hadn't earned, adding nudity to the game, or giving female character models bigger boobs. While still against the ToS, these purposes have long been seen as harmless
---
&gt;#Ban Reversals
---
&gt;This afternoon there have been multiple reports of bans being overturned, purportedly for players who claimed to use the programs for innocuous reasons. 
---
&gt;#Blizzard Response
---
&gt;Many of the suspensions issued were for 180 days, as the exploit we detected allows for very malicious activities such as gameplay automation or rotation/interrupt botting. Upon further review, we found that some suspended accounts appeared to be only using the detected exploit to do client-side character model alteration.
---
Prestors
---
TFW your hearthstone has a 5 minute cast time.
---
No - they transferred from Stalagg - fyi
---
&gt; WPvP returns to levels similar to Phase 1
---
similar to p1 its not gonna happen...back then people were just killing for fun, now you get honor, not to mention horde will be forced to go out due to the long queues they gonna get, the majority of the realms are horde-sided
---
How is this "win" trading?  Clickbait headlines and streamer drama get the upvotes.
---
So reddit happened on a subreddit, maybe they should have stuck it out until bgs come out instead of unsubscribing. 
---
But really this is the mods fault for letting people upvote the content they agree with.
---
Thank you!
---
How does twinking work in classic? Will we be able to turn off experience gain?
---
Unlike the #nochanges morons who seem to have a dire need to relive 2004 in order to find a sense of fulfillment, I have no interest playing a minimum viable product (which Vanilla WoW was when it launched, btw. Classic is nowhere near as awful because *a lot of changes* were already implemented by 1.12). Their knee-jerk response to any QoL suggestion as if any QoL changes will immediately bring BfA to Classic clearly demonstrates a lack of basic thinking skills.
---
It proves the most common excuse from horde camping cities is bullshit, they keep saying "I'm doing it for the honor" Killing a level 1 gets you nothing, they are doing it because they find camping the other faction right off the server entertaining.

See thats what im told by my horde comrades aswell, but it seems everywhere me and my friends go to level or farm herbs we're getting kill squadded and I rarely see any horde dominating, let alone helping if i cry out for aid. Again, I can't see it from ally perspective and I can't see how much horde is kill squadding aswell so im heavily biased I'll admit that, but boy do i hate this playstyle.
---
You have to funnel your tanks. The raid can only dps as hard as the tank allows. If they're struggling to hold threat cause they have to 'duke it out' for the gear, the raid is gonna have a bad time.
---
Man, I retired from mmorpgs when wow killed EQ. I almost had no enthusiasm left in me after hitting it so hard with everquest. 
---
I wish I'd have experienced wow like I did EQ. Maybe when I'm old and retired I will have the time to dedicate to something like that again haha.
---
this comment is more saddening
---
Yup, I know I'm not the only one who dropped their horde flair because it meant every post was downvoted.
---
Doesnt change my experience lmao
---
Funny joke
---
When he's not in his obnoxious stream persona and he is just talking about the state of the game and things like that I find myself agreeing with him more often than not. He comes across as one of the more knowledgeable voices about the game.
---
His streams tho, that's a big ole yikes.
---
This.
---
and from a non-tech perspective, it seems to be a really easy thing to implement...
---
Whats wrong with her face/mouth?
---
Most the destination servers are trashcans though
---
Yes.
---
That doesn't prove they aren't doing it for honour. They are in IF killing ally for honour. A level 1 dying is incidental. It doesn't refute the claim. I guarantee if you did this on Heartseeker the alliance in Org would do the same thing, because its incidental.
---
Or they could just ban them.
---
Im glad were on the same page
---
How do I pvp as a feral Druid? No slows of my own and getting out of slows costs me 1k mana, followed by them slowing me again
---
No, it's been a video game.
---
As someone on Alliance Kurinaxx, Synergy is the largest alliance guild on the server and has the numbers to do that. Most of the horde on the server have been constantly camping BRM, menethil docks &amp; boats, EPL and TP flight paths fucking daily and corpse camping alliance from TP to BRM most evenings. Don't you fucking dare complain about being camped until you've had 5+ hours wasted corpse running and groups constantly ruined because of the corpse camping bullshit.
---
You just posted cringe.
---
... mind telling us what programs?
---
It‚Äôs funny because they think they‚Äôre winning because they are skilled and not the real reason which is massively outnumbering opponents.
---
... which?
---
iMorph, nowadays called tMorph
---
I was gonna reply seriously but you're a condescending prick, so how about you just go fuck yourself and we'll call it squarsies.
---
Yes.  Anyone horde who post here quickly learned you get hateful replies and downvotes for having a horde flair.
---
Well it's not like you'd go male gnome, is it?!
---
Are you serious?
---
Lol, that is just false. Twin Emps were very difficult, even their trash was harder than the first boss.
---
Cry more
---
You are off base.  Eq raids were 70+ not 40 like he specifies.
---
Although I‚Äôd love to blame the nazi mods for this decline, my gut says this is due to people quitting the game because of the shtty WPVP situation. 
---
Herod for the first time ever, had no queue last Tuesday night...... This really surprised me.  
---
I think Blizz made a bigger mistake than they realize.
---
There's not even an official resource to find out population balance, that's an unreasonable expectation to put on millions of people. Not a single game in my life have i sat down and read the entire internet on before I hit "New Game" on the main menu.
---
Is that in terms of the fact that is does more damage or is the threat also increasing irrespective of damage increase?
---
We camp BRM, alliance camps DM &amp; Strat. Horde isn't hanging out in SW or IF on Fairbanks outside the rogues
---
The alliance might need help in game, but Icebox needs help in real life
---
Its 'silly' only in that the gear available can't fully sustain HS spam on its own yet and is a work-around. Eventually gear will get to where it just happens naturally due to rage gen.
---
That is Gnome discrimination!
---
Kurinaxx is theoretically 60/40 favoring Horde but being alliance on Kurinaxx, it has to he worse than that due to the constant camping at the boats, epl, Thorium Point &amp; Morgans Vigil and corpse camping between TP &amp; BRM. Its awful, the above replier complaining about being killed by the largest alliance guild is laughable and is a niche perspective vs what alliance put up with daily
---
&gt;this is by far the fastest I've lost interest in a new form of wow
---
Because WoW Classic, as of now, has the lowest amount of content compared to any retail expansion (maybe with the exception of WoD?). All you get are 2 easy raids and a bunch of dungeons that become snoozefests once you've done them at least once. Rest of the time is basically just spent farming gold or going afk in capital cities because there's literally nothing to do. WPvP? Good luck. You either get facerolled by deathballs or faceroll others with deathballs. Both of which are boring and not stimulating at all/ The rest of the time is spent flying inbetween potential PvP hotspots in search of worthy opponents, which rarely happens as you usually just melt some poor solo player on their way to quests/dungeons like a truck running over wild critter.
---
 BGs should've been released at launch or with the start of phase 2 because instanced PvP encounters are infinite content that will keep a lot of people (me included) entertained for a long time.
---
You have to be the worlds biggest moron to get camped in IF for hours.... take the first death and go get a drink for 5 minutes while your flag goes away.
---
Depends on your gear, specifically your total AP. Bloodthirst scales with AP but execute does a flat damage regardless of your gear. Execute is really good when you first hit 60 but will not grow in strength over time like your other damage sources.
---
You can‚Äôt control the variables in psychological science to the extent you can other fields.  
---
Flawed studies can still provide value, just that often people who don‚Äôt know how to interpret them try and treat them as fact. Data is still data, it‚Äôs just the ability to generalize is limited.
---
The universe must balance. I take comfort knowing this is happening to Horde on a few righteous servers.
---
As someone on a 40 60 server it is unplayable
---
if youre going to be pedantic then sure.
---
not quite.
---
im saying it depends on how quickly you are killing the mob.
---
Lets say you have 50 rage at 2x% (i.e. 21/22/28%). If, by the time it gets to the execute range, you can/should be at 90+%, by:
---
- using bloodthirst. Then you should bloodthirst
---
- not using bloodthirst. Then you should not use bloodthirst
---
if you want actual numbers, someone else needs to provide them or u can check. The main idea is you want to maximise dmg per rage point and a high-rage execute should (idk for sure, haven't done the math) always be better than a low-rage execute.
---
That is 3 month old data.  Meaningless at this point.
---
How does any of that negate the observed phenomenon that occurred? 
---
Significant changes in behavior occurred as a result of his study, yes or no?
---
Practice for when it does matter, both for raiders and the LC
---
yeah but i mean if tbc releases then playerbase on classic will drop to a very small fraction. even ppl who prefer vanilla will probably play tbc.
---
2 heals over time and thorns and tank never lose agro. Druid are so good for healing main tanks
---
Nice video mate. One Tipp if you backpaddle away from the mobs while casting frost nova instead of jumping their meele leeway radius is way smaller so you won‚Äôt loose any health
---
Fucking PEOPLE you absolute idiots, that' literally the problem. Not Horde. Not Alliance.
---
Do you legitimately think that Horde payers are somehow genetically predisposed to this kind of behavior or something? I can't believe I actually have to explain this to grown adults getting so butthurt and tribalistic about red vs blue in a video game. Grow up holy shit.
---
Do you not understand the statistics?  This only happens on your server.  For all intents and purposes you are alliance.  Welcome.
---
Eh, this is false. IF is always under attack with raid groups coming out and then hiding in the houses near the FP or Mystic Ward to lure people in for the mages lol
---
imorph is the only one i know of that works for classic.  Could be that.
---
You stop getting xp at 54 when doing ZF solo GY runs. (I just got two of my mages to 54 last week in ZF with solo GY runs).
---
Because of an egoic defence mechanism. When one ego meets another, for example a post here and a reader, then they must battle to be the dominant ego. At this point rational thinking is irrelevant, all that matters is being higher within the hierarchy.
---
That all happens if you aren't aware of the ego. Once you see the ego that is controlling your behaviour, watch it. It will deflate a d rational thought can reclaim the conversation.
---
90% of the posts, 90% of the servers, makes sense no?
---
As an Alliance player on Skeram, I feel for you.
---
you are contributing to it
---
thanks man, you have a link by chance? or is it the same as this one:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-5015103051-032005231230315
---
You must heal
---
I'm sorry but if anyone thinks it's not faction balance then they are a mongoloid.  That is just the dumbest thing ever to assume one faction is that much better and not having twice as many players when there are thousands of players isn't a huge advantage.  Like to me those people are on the same level as flat earthers.
---
this post doesn't change any facts
---
Too bad that guy doesnt know what he's talking about. You want both 4piece T3 AND the ZG trinket for a combined total of 15% spell hit. Raid bosses have a 16% chance to resist taunt. This leaves you with a 1% chance of taunt resist. You want the trinket and t3 bonus on at least 6 tanks.
---
&gt;Hopefully blizz allows server transfers though to help alleviate the really imbalanced servers though.
---
Transfers have the potential to make things worse. Using Stonespine as an example, who would transfer? Alliance players. That will make it worse for the remaining players. To where? To the perceived balanced servers, unbalancing them.
---
I didn't say anyone's experience is not valid, but it's important to have a bit of awareness. "I was ganked twice, it's really the same as playing Alliance!" is a very questionable statement in a server with really bad faction balance.
---
I hate to break it to you but humans are smarter than rats
---
It‚Äôs not being a cunt playing within the rules of the game and to be rewarded by the game. It just means the reward system of the game creates an unpleasant experience for some players. But for players to win (bracket 14 etc) you have to play to maximize your gains. I highly doubt the above individual is a sociopath for playing a game with the intent to win.
---
Me and my guild are having some problems on rag with the melee. As a melee myself I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm going out and in when they tell me but we still end up getting yeeted at least once.
---
Is there a simple explanation for how this works?
---
The guide is fine, just classic does not allow the sniper scope to be used for lvl19. You can use Accurate Scope.
---
This I'd why I put modifiers on my mouse and move over a row. But I play shaman so I have a lot of buttons to press
---
link bro?
---
or is the same as this one:
---
it's a joke that he is saying might be true
---
Sure you can. If I successfully and consistently change the behavior of a lab animal whose environment I have full control over, I'd say that is as strong of experimental control as other sciences.
---
It's not just that generalization is limited, its that the conclusions drawn as a whole come into question if key variables are not accounted for.
---
It's incredibly true and to the point where most people are viewed through an apathetic lens personally. People's shittiness on the internet and in games just doesn't surprise me anymore. Rats just break everything down and make it much simpler than what we deal with lol. It's all about instincts and what they feel like and not petty shit like what humans concoct amongst themselves. Humans have egos where we get mad or feel entitled, Often we need some sort of retaliation or revenge when we feel like something happened that was "*unfair*". We make excuses, we isolate ourselves when we should just communicate, and we sure as hell will never admit we are wrong.
---
Of course, this is on the apathetic and negative end of things. It's unfortunate to me how things have played out and how people refuse to slow down and realize they're communicating with real people. These ego driven situations in these games and on reddit boards often enable everyone to mob against what we don't have a primary belief in. I'm always amazed when I see people having civil discussion and aren't getting sarcastic or dickish to boost their ego.
---
It takes a full 10 seconds to rebind wasd
---
Show me those photos that aren‚Äôt on the exact server that had the refugees I talked about? Because that is the one exception horde just keep going to not realizing that it is the result of their actions on other servers.
---
Reskin?
---
You've got to be kidding
---
We had deep breath twice on our first attempt weeks ago. Haven‚Äôt seen a breath in over a month now.
---
yes I see mongoloids crying about it every single day, they cannot comprehend that when Blizz introduces 1093851803501358103580 servers so Asmongold zoomzoom fangays will stop crying about being stuck in queues that eventually those flavor of the month players will quit and non-main servers will die.
---
What a catastrophe! Oh the agony! Someone *might* have to reroll in Phase 1!!! NOOOO!!! BUT I HAVE 3/8 TIER 1 I CANT REROLL I CANT THIS GEAR IS IRREPLACEABLE
---
Every server has the same system, what are you even talking about ? In Hearthseeker the same thing happens but this time alliance is on top
---
MAKE MY GAME EASIER
---
this sub is going downhill since phase 2 release
---
Two conflicting comments below. Are you thinking about making one? If yes, I‚Äôd bet on them going up.
---
I have no idea how to read your axes.
---
I am thoroughly impressed with how little you have to do outside playing this game.
---
It is t officially a party until at least one ‚Äòem show up, gnome‚Äôsayin‚Äô??
---
Analogies exist for a reason, not because they are 1:1. 
---
Yes I think having 25% more people is pretty significant in a competitive situation. Explain where your cut off is for it to be significant? Also small is not objective measure, it is subjective. Maybe realize that I phrased it as I think it is significant. 
---
Yep I am Alliance, because I can read the numbers and what they actually mean instead of going into a thread about PvP servers and pulling universal numbers as if that is applicable.
---
I'm on Pagle and thinking about rolling a mage, as my Rogue is having a hard time. However, from census websites, it seems that mage is the most populated class on the server.
---
Is the fact that it's overpopulated a good reason to not roll it? Mages seem to have some of the highest quality of life and the most simple rotation for raiding (a pro for me), but if I will just never get gear due to their overpopulation then that might be an issue.
---
That's not even his point you dense moron
---
CLASSIC WOW IS DYING OH NO NO NO
---
I wish people would stop pretending this is a legitimate answer. Yes, you can get a group and take back BRM but meanwhile, there are 8 other zones having the same camping problems because server population is to high. For every 1 alliance there are 2 to 4 horde, depending on the server. 
---
It‚Äôs mathematically impossible to control as many zones as the horde do.
---
What about your toxicity? Any safety nets for that?
---
isn't it kinda irrelevant how many players they got when you got enough people to spam sapper?
---
There's a limit to how many characters you can have in a macro. Do you know any addons to help with gear management?
---
no, you are being a cunt. youre justification doesnt excuse psychopathic behavior because these people are camping others bellow 48 just to make them suffer.
---
Never said anything about his conclusions, so I don‚Äôt know where you got that from? 
---
I simp,y said that it provided interesting data that is the only source of information we will ever get since nothing even remotely close would ever pass an ethics board. THAT is why we constantly reference those old studies, even though they are flawed.
---
If be pissed raiding with your guild the first time we spent as long ghost walking back to Ony as the whole fucking raid takes. 
---
&gt;  i've literally never heard anyone get upset about there not being a SS up
---
You literally raid with idiots.
---
So if you foresaw this, why are you complaining?
---
Sorry this isn't correct. Execute gets worse damage per rage the more rage that gets dumped into one execute.
---
Brilliant
---
It's not like the horde players on flamelash didn't have the option to transfer with the alliance...
---
Not for Alliance.
---
Heeey, corpse walking time is actually /played time. You might not enjoy it but I bet Blizzard does!
---
Ok, thank you!
---
I dont think its win trading because there's still a fight that hasn't been verbally predetermined.
---
Horde player on Heartseeker here. Interesting part is it's the same 15 man group that camps there 15-18 hours a day, 7 days a week. We generally kill them 3 times then move on. Also we just stopped going to org.
---
You can buy an alt account and make an alliance character that wAy
---
No suprise a horde can‚Äôt answer a question that has a easily verified factual basis.
---
and to answer your question? Yes, I do because it is not a simple matter of red or blue, if it were than populations across all types of servers would be approximately equal. We know from the data that is not the case. Horde players prefer PvP, alliance prefer pve at a statistically significant rate. This means that attributes of those faction/server combinations tap into something beyond random chance.
---
let me know if I am going a little to fast for your ‚Äúadult‚Äú brain to comprehend.
---
When you're genuinely calling people sociopaths for picking the other faction in a video game, it's hard to resist making fun of you.
---
I don't mean you personally but the people in this sub.
---
.5 second cast to get rid of soft CC versus immunity to fear that you can pop before it happens. Are you fucking high? Or 25% bonus to ignore a hoj. Yeah they buffed alliance racials because they were just so balanced. Plug in your brain next time.
---
They‚Äôll add Heroic levels of instances, and a whole bunch of content, then call it the Burning Crusade and release a classic version of that in a couple years.
---
We play Classic because we like the game *as it was.* I dunno why people keep making suggestions to change it. The only thing I would like to see added was planned content that got scrapped when TBC was announced, like the original Uldum and Grim Batol Raids. They had to have those sketched out somewhere.
---
Other than that Classic is intended to be played as it was back in 2004, it‚Äôs not some new parallel timeline they rolled out.
---
Complain to your tanks or try to see what they are doing wrong.  Alliance should have very little threat issues unless you way outgear your tanks or they aren't good.
---
idiots that have 4 raid teams clearing MC in under an hour lul
---
stay bad
---
How to level in 2005.
---
Alternatively: How to level in 1999 in Everquest.
---
That's a bit out of the budget. The first LHH broke the piggy bank but GFPPs should help a lot
---
Yeah I'm sure they woulda played indefinitely if Blizzard continued to hold them hostage on an unplayable realm.
---
I agree that healing is a lot of fun :) even when things are more complicated, it feels like a challenge and I like it. We healers have a big responsibility. I've heard of those two addons and also of Healcomm.
---
Some altaholics probably enjoy the game more. Testing the skills of the other classes is fun as when you start out. 
---
Sincerely, altaholic in vanilla (54 when BC came out), decked 60 warrior with no alts on classic haha.
---
No, the game is bleeding rn with the clusterfuck of P2. Im not blaming people for killing people, its literally how you get honor. The way it works though is just so fucked its driving people away
---
dead dps is no dps
---
dead heals in no heals
---
dead tank is dead raid
---
I don‚Äôt consider myself a grammar fanatic or a particularly good writer, but the style guide I try to follow the most (The Economist‚Äôs) doesn‚Äôt use the Oxford comma. I‚Äôve never really questioned it, as I also believe it flows better without.
---
Anyway, thanks for reading I guess.
---
Yes, priorities!
---
Mother of Christ, that is fucking diabolical. 
---
This has basically become a social experiment with an online Einsatzgruppen.
---
Its a voice he puts on. He does a lot of different voices on stream.
---
There is literally two mages corpse camping in IF. How the fuck do you even justify that? Why would anyone wanna play alliance in this situation?
---
So about 43 silver isnt too bad for a key, correct?
---
Second lionheart is actually a really good investment, even if 20 fire resist is just for meters on one boss you will want one with the frost resist enchant on for sapph and kt. 
---
Fire resist changes your gameplay by being able to stay in for more stacks. On top of that, I gfpp prepop and flame deflector at 7 stacks, second gfpp at 9 stacks. You should be able to stay in the entire fight (after 2-3 weeks of progression/reclears). After that, just keep taking off fire resist slots as your killtime decreases. You will always have to double gfpp though no matter what
---
Originally on my server the opening of the gates of AQ caused the other zones to crash and basically we all missed it. Some guild leader who had his guild helping him got the one-time-only mount and title. F everything about AQ forever from that, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Und da beschweren sich alle √ºber die b√∂sen Hordler :D
---
Lol that sounds awful for the game. The issue is the density of players not just how players act. Of course that impacts it but why would you design a system that fucks over your own player base as hard as server only bgs would. That‚Äôs one of the worst ideas I‚Äôve heard throughout all of this.
---
Talk shit, get crit
---
I'm curious if tehy will ever open free migration from any realm based on this experience anymore.
---
What route do you take? I circle the arena spectators, hop down to the highway from anger bridge, do them and end up at arena with a minute to open my boxes ready for the next round
---
My gear isnt even ful pre bis so Ive tried pullger and have had mixed reults
---
Druid main tank here. I have been enjoying it. Get to 60 and go from there. I am on heart seeker though. Idk how you are doing there.
---
If you were on the minority faction you‚Äôd change your tune
---
We're still reporting 60/40 ally/horde on Anathema on basically every reporting site and also just got a major ally streamer, so we really don't want any more... We hold our own but seeing how much more geared and organized some ally groups are, the situation turns usually if they push harder. Horde btw.
---
Arcanite Reaper or Heartseeker are much more balanced the way you want, and closer to 50/50.
---
This can‚Äôt be the only time he says it. I‚Äôve 100% seen him yell it while he was just observing. I‚Äôve also seen it many times, and I don‚Äôt think I ever had a single person die while fighting rend.
---
They wanted to, but the nochanges people bitched.
---
Remember everything is better than becoming an art sub
---
SM/Ruin would arguably be better, there's not super good itemization in the game atm for Conflag
---
My dumbass has been doing flat pickpocket runs for a day -_-, no wonder it was going so slow
---
I think they were just waiting for the players to solve the problem themselves. On some servers every level 60 on Alliance would accompany their raiders to Burning Steppes so there was 450 people there instead of just the raids. This cleared the path and let their raiders reach MC and UBRS safely.
---
In Classic WoW the community is expected to solve its own problems. Hopefully the Phase 3 drop in a couple days alleviates some of it, but ultimately people are going to have to organize. The survival of their faction depends on it.
---
My roommate and I got HWL through no sleep, no life, and depression in Vanilla.  If you're saying we cheated, fuck you.  It's the one thing I can hold onto for all that time spent.  We did it fair and square.
---
So the only way the Alliance could possibly do this is because those evil horde corrupted them? Alliance players are angels with pure hearts that would never do this otherwise?
---
I largely think it's because PvP is happening on PvP servers and it's clearly blizzs fault for not holding people's hands and only letting them gank, not be ganked
---
I play on Mirage Raceway and my 60s are Horde.
---
I do have a 21/22 Paladin that I'll be healing with, parked in Loch Modan begging to be played.
---
Name is Auldman. Add it.
---
‚ÄúIdiots hat can‚Äôt take pvp‚Äù is the most boneheaded ignorant take on this situation out there. I enjoy pvp thoroughly and the way this situation has unfolded on many realms is much more than just people who ‚Äúcan‚Äôt take the pvp.‚Äù
---
I actually can‚Äôt tell if this is a /s or if you‚Äôre serious. It‚Äôs mind blowing how some people see this stuff.
---
Sucks, cause that shit *does* happen to people and it equally sucks in similar ways. It doesn't change that your experience was your experience there. I hate that people just dismiss other people, not even in this game but out in irl situations in general. People always feel the need to pull a one-up if they've had anything remotely worse or know someone in a worse situation. No one wants to listen to other people's problems and the lack of empathy in an echochamber of ego just feeds on itself for toxicity.
---
Just hit 48 on my nelf rogue on thunderfury yesterday and fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck horde man
---
Someone posted their conversation with a GM telling them to stop doing it. So whether it's an exploit or not blizzard aren't happy with it being done.
---
But av is going to be horde favored, you wait. Also alliance premades will be complained about too.
---
Because it happened? Didn't you see the treads months ago where people described this scenario?
---
Came here to say this
---
I rerolled horde. Planning on keeping my alliance toons for BGs tho.
---
Battlegrounds don't give xp, but if you're not careful exploration might push you over the level
---
Ragemike from Twisted here, horde side on Flamelash and I salute your passion and effort! Keep it up m8!
---
Yeah well said. 
---
People want their pixels on a screen and are happy to knowingly ruin others day completely to get it. Justified to themselves as "it's just PvP on a PvP server". 
---
It's the similar sort of mentality that sees people leave a restaurant table in a complete mess because "it's the waiters job to clean it up", or someone who yells at and berates retail workers or customer service people because "it's their job" if they think it will help them get what they want faster. 
---
It might be allowed, it might be "part of the rules". People are still a complete dicks for intentionally ruining someone elses day for half an hour or more because they saw an opportunity for personal gain.
---
It's quite sad that in 15 years the spirit of the playerbase has changed and some people seem to have become all-consumed by this single minded pursuit of "BiS".
---
Can you elaborate on the RFD farm? Do you pickpocket on your way through or just rush the bosses?
---
Counter Strike is a pvp game, now let's say you want to play the game for the pvp aspect, not only fight with bots, so you log into the game, head into a match, and choose a team. Then you find out your team has 2 members, while the enemy has 8. You can't switch teams, there's no auto balancing, and more people join the opposing team every day.   
---
You spawn, die, spawn, die, spawn, die, and have no chance of fighting back or asking for balancing, because the enemy team will tell you you signed up for this and you're unskilled, so shut up and take it.
---
Can someone confirm this? Does Heroic Strike simply take the yellow dmg hit rating from your MH and apply it to your offhand? If this is the case, then an orc running an axe in his MH can use a dagger (300 weapon skill) and be hit capped at 6% for that dagger. Insane.
---
Healing is pretty fun. I use vohdo. And the priority is the tank of course. Then the dps that helps kill the adds that go for you from healing Agro.
---
You mean Generation Z. Millenials and Gen-X'ers were the original playerbase.
---
is there room on heartseeker? lul
---
Same on Pagle-US.  Ally presence constant in Org.
---
Wont fix anything only delay the mass killing. Sure, might be able to fly somewhere and turn in quests quickly, then die once the buff is gone. I stead of camping Thorium Point they camp right below it.
---
Too bad all the good devs are gone,
---
I manage to convince my friend  to transfer server with me, from a server with 75:25 to one with 45:55 on the last second. We didn't even have time to say goodbye to guild/friends.
---
Best decision we've ever made and he's still thanking me for it.
---
First time in 15 years where we were able to explore the world without dying every 2 seconds.
---
A healer + tank isn't going to clear a dungeon without dps, and most dungeon pulls can be done without a tank. Heal your dps. This comes from someone who tanks and heals pretty much exclusively.
---
The site doesn't even work
---
Ok, thank you.
---
Pagle is PvE
---
First hand of rag at least, I don't know about anything else. We're in our 30's, not our characters. And we're not all sitting around inventing reasons why a children's game is actually way harder than it is.
---
Yeah, they seem unnecessarily convoluted. Green is just the change in subs, which could be negative. Orange is # lost subs/# gained subs...
---
Feel like itd make more sense if it were just number of gained subs, number of lost subs, and the difference between the two rather than trying to put 2 statistics into one line
---
Most will tell you that this guy is trolling but it's the truth.  You should identify the dps that is hard carrying and keep them up just as much as the tank.  i've had 4 man groups with no tank clear all of undead strath just to pull in a tank that wants to scoop up an easy baron kill.
---
Ok, so what caused those changes? The manipulation made, or one of the variables Zimbardo failed to control for?
---
I bet this has been mix of nostalgia and Blizzard failing with servers. World PvP is not the real problem but amount of players is. I remember back in days when there were areas controlled by opposite faction. You then avoided that area. Now same thing happens everywhere. There is literally no place where someone doesn't come and kill you. I've been trying to fishing in furthest corners of Azeroth and still there has been people who have killed me.
---
Thanks for insulting me... what a nice guy, you obviously know everything about me
---
Haha! Ones always gotta volunteer.
---
What addons are you using? Loving that UI. Id like to copy it exactly. Looks like it might be just ElvUi?
---
It's just a line shot from her current location. Can you read a compass? If she's north, go east or west. If she's southwest, go southeast or northwest. Etc.
---
before the genocide they could've maybe said it was a bad idea
---
And the issue here?
---
Someone actually had the reasoning to say that I deserved it just for being horde. Because horde players kill allies in Redridge. That was his reasoning for why it was Okay for allies to do it but not okay for horde. Dude needs to roll horde and try questing in Hillsbrad.
---
Thanks. It worked for my group last night the same way. We grouped up and got through them pretty quickly.
---
Are you doing ok or just trying to paint a picture of something that isn't there... there are 3-4 horde in Red Ridge literally every day, they aren't there farming honor. But they are camping.
---
So... it'll happen...
---
But it's laughable...
---
This would be hilarious because it would heavily screw over Alliance on PvE servers with massive queues.
---
&gt;You can't get honor as a 60 from a 1.
---
Obviously.
---
Idk man this isn't really important to me so I'm going to leave it after this, but the logic doesn't follow.  
---
Incidental =/= accidental. Just because they kill someone that is not worth honour does not mean they aren't there for honour. Like it's a really simple line of thought.
---
Funny I just donated those two books to my local thrift store a couple weeks ago!

Spot on.

All my binds are hidden, most CDs are shown via WeakAuras and/or on the bar at the bottom.
---
0/10
---
Noggenfogger is one of the worst imbalanced servers out there tho.
---
Yeah, he should win 2v1's as the worst dueling class without using cooldowns or consumables for this to be a good video, like good old memorable warrior pvp videos such as Laintime, Maydie or Pat, who not only used cooldowns and consumables, but had full world buffs and pocket healers as well.
---
You ain't the brightest bulb in the chandelier, are you son?
---
Top guilds are top guilds. What they do has little to no bearing on the majority of people who play the game. 
---
The percentage of people clearing the current tier of raid content is going to drop exponentially as time goes by. Because it's more difficult. 
---
Pretty much anyone can pug an Ony kill or an MC clear. That's not going to be the case in AQ40. If you still fail to grasp the point and aren't just being a deliberate asshat, I suggest not sitting so close to the TV while eating your crayons.
---
What's your server?
---
Benediction is a small horde majority, 55/45 iirc.
---
That would definitely kill the game.
---
defending something and killing the same people over and over isn't good honor though. 
---
People like to play efficent. And killing the same 3-4 people camping a certain spot only gets you honor for the first few kills. 
---
There is no incentive "defending" because its not only not effective honor, it punishes you when you do it because others that dont farm more honor than you.
---
I clicked this because the thumbnail looked like a gloryhole.
---
You don't pvp as a feral druid, you pvp as a druid. Don't get stuck thinking you need to stay in a form to fight.
---
I personally open in cat form for as much dps as possible, put a bleed and free faerie fire on my target if they are a rogue, then switch out of form to moonfire/root/wrath them down. If they are running, I might innervate, change to bear form to charge and close with them and use bash before changing out of form and by then I have some extra mana to keep dpsing them.
---
There is a youtuber called "ebbnflow" you can watch, as he has some druid content
---
Also many classes don't have a way to deal with slows, but druids can shift in and out of travel form to cheaply get rid of it, or out of cat/bear. You don't always have to do something about slows, sometimes you just let yourself be slowed.
---
mouseover is a requirement for healing. After denouncing them for years i switched in cata (i think it was) and saw instant improvements.
---
You cannot perform as well without mouseover macros as you can with.
---
Hunters suck
---
Transfers off PvP realms won't create any problems in P5 that won't be there already.
---
The choice is between letting the minority faction leave, or have a decent fraction of those players deciding not to play WoW.
---
 I'm currently a lvl 55 warrior, following a cookie-cutter arms spec for leveling. I'd like to switch to DW Fury for dungeons and raiding, but I'm not sure if I should wait until I get some hit rating items or just go for it. What do?
---
Yes, dingus. To the average jamoke playing casually who can get a weekly MC clear in, it is laughable because they won't be able to do that.
---
I have a real guild. You may too. But at least a strong plurality of players are casuals, if not a majority. Ergo, comparing the ease and accessibility of the two raids *is laughable*.
---
As someone who came from osrs, and played every season of deadman mode, when I hear people bitching and crying ab dying in the game it really blows my mind. This my first time on wow, and I don‚Äôt think a death has actually upset me one time lmao, just walk back.
---
-1/10
---
Ugh I'm on deviate delight and the population is atrocious. Outside of peak hours the server feels dead, but can't bring myself to roll on a new server and give up my progress.
---
I like this one! Nice closure, not all good things last forever.
---
shoot
---
Dude you have a few screws loose.
---
Yes, data that is meaningless because you cannot make any conclusions from them. I could take some neat anecdotal data, but it would be absolutely meaningless in a scientific context.
---
We shouldn't be referencing them just because they are neat because it creates misconception on what psychology is.
---
You reap what you sow!!!!
---
Nice attempt at a save.
---
Why do you put so much gravity into the choice to group up, ride around, and kill anything that moves?
---
How do you think these PvP groups start? 
---
"Hey if anybody wants to form an unstoppable death ball to roam Feralas and make being Alliance unplayable PST"
---
Or
---
"Feralas PvP PST"
---
Stacking so tightly that you wipe to sapper charges falls under low skill level.
---
I'm utterly wrecking all the priests and shamans on the meters at the point where it is getting pathetic to watch.  Druids need their innervate on themselves to sustain mana, as we tend to uhh use a lot of it. Given, HT is probably the most efficient hp/m heal in the game, you need to adjust your output to match incoming raiddamage. Things like rejuv isnt really efficient in terms of healing, but it has a lot of output. 
---
I would honestly mix up the healing team as mucha s possible. If youre horde, you can get benefits from stacking shamans as those totems are king. Paladins are probably the best healers in the game, albeit really dull.
---
It should not be ignored how annoying it is to gear 8 priests versus gearing 5 priests and 3 druids.
---
When was this
---
Oh i wasnt talking about you homie
---
Its a thing on my server too
---
I blame the horde.
---
I agree. But someone will clear it in 4 days.
---
It's actually even worse. Those alliance players exactly know how bad they had it and left their servers and now do the same to others what they run from.
---
It's like supressed war refugees coming to another country and supress the nativs there. They suffered themselve and didn't learn but repeated the mistake themselve... How can you argue that horde is worse in that scenario?
---
No, because f\*\*\* M+
---
I switched to classic because I wanted to get away from that systems. M+ was a waste of time, but you had to do it to stay competitive
---
It is faster than clicking your target, thats the whole point. You can also have 1 tank targetted and sometimes hot someone without having to swap targets. You basically win like 100ms of reaction time. Its not as important in vanilla as it is in later expansions when healers actually get spells they can use to heal with.
---
maybe the guy would have let it slide but OP had to win the dagger and then get a verbal jab in too
---
OP is the real asshole
---
Google ‚ÄúFrost live aoe guide‚Äù
---
I have a feeling that, for you, it's always about dicks
---
It's not very enjoyable to dos dungeons as shadow imo. You have no aoe, shadow word pain costs too much mana to use it on multiple targets and usually only lasts for half its duration before stuff dies. Mindblast pulls aggro if you're not talented into threat reduction (which you won't be for leveling). You can do good damage on bosses but trash packs aren't fun.
---
*The queues will be longer for horde certainly, but shouldn't be too bad with xrealm.
---
Now repeat this for majority of PvP servers where Horde dominates from 60:40 up to extremes like Flamelash 94:6 throw 1-2 Alliance dominated PvP servers per region like Heartseeker and do not count PvE servers, thouse people mostly have little interest in queuing for BGs.
---
What you get would be at best 70:30 H:A ratio, meaning some Horde would wait full BG duration untill Alliance finishes it and requeues again.
---
Have your guild auction off onyxia bags and use the gold ~150-200 to help fund it. Imo tanks should
---
Farm atleast half the mats tho. You guys get funneled all the damn gear, least u could do is farm some arcane crystals for the coolest weapon in the game
---
This person just doesn‚Äôt math
---
fair enough, I'm not trying to debate that it's worth of not worth it, I'm genuinely trying to understand and might give it a go.
---
The only thing is though, usually I'm pre-clicking the next target before my current heal is done and in that case it doesn't save me any time using a mouseover anyway.
---
We had the same thing happen on the biggest German realm. Nothing happened to them, Blizzard does not care.
---
[https://streamable.com/lgn6q](https://streamable.com/lgn6q)
---
how is that a messy UI?
---
His cooldowns are at the bottom, on the left side are different items/trinkets/engi stuff to switch out. On the right he has buffs. 
---
His raidframe is probably between his unitframes and his bottom action bar. The only thing that might be "messy" is those 3 buff icons but im sure those are WAs just to show him that his buffs are missing.
---
I think he interpreted the cheetah comment being inside/outside as being the travel form cheetah and not the AotCheetah spell.
---
TBH, i kinda agree with you overall, just wanted to show the other side of the medallion.
---
I have no idea what video you mean. Can you link it? Took this name a looong time ago. Guess its from the sniper game with bananabread as secret phrase :p?
---
Pugs as they exist in retail are not comparable at all to how they exist in Classic. Vetting people is far more common and far easier in Retail. Raids are also smaller by 15, making it easier to corral everyone onto Discord or whatever you use. Depending on the stage of the patch, its also conceivable to have a majority of players who have much, much better gear after months of heroic/M+ than the guilds who were racing for world or even server first.
---
The lack of abundant welfare gear, raid size and difficulty in vetting will make pugging Classic more of a challenge, even if the content is easier than retail Mythic. Right now everythings a faceroll because of 1.12 itemization, prebis lists and the exceptional ease of MC because its essentially the tutorial raid.
---
I will bet you money the % of players killing Nefarian will be dramatically lower than the % killing Ragnaros and Onyxia (especially Ony). And on from there.
---
Can a server like that even support a single alliance Grand Marshall?
---
you're clearly mald about them standing next to each other? wow kids these days get offended quick
---
BG collusion will be against the ToS FYI I confirmed this last week.
---
Honestly, from my perspective I fail to see how it flows better, because my immediate interpretation of your sentence was that you were describing your wife as your best IRL friend and youngest brother, rather than a list of 3 different people.
---
This seems to be a tricky interpretation issue though, so I'm curious why you interpret it differently than me. Especially how you would denote a list of 3 in that instance rather than what you spelled out.
---
&gt;not to play WoW.
---
Switching realm (paid, new char) or switching to retail. Most people won't stop playing wow

Isn't Grobbulus also a PvP server? Just an RP one?

Congratulations. I am still trying to get Baron's cloak.

How do you like the weapons? Do you switch for PvE and PvP?

Well, ask ur guild

Or perhaps the content of the sub, it's a damn salt mine right now.
---
It's doable in one AV weekend (about 20h total) if you stick to groups grinding it out. If you try to do it at another time, you will miss out on ~50% bonus rep, and games might take longer if both sides don't try to win asap.
---
I hear ya. I did that before i switched as well. The playstyle is a bit different, and I have been trying to f√≠gure out whether its better or not. Save from a few misstargets once in a while, you do save a lot of reaction time when it has to go fast. With mouseover you can still click a target thats the whole point. You just prioritize targets you have your mouseover rather than the clicked target, so if you have a clicked target and no mouseover target it will cast the spell on the clicked target.

---
&gt;It's far less risk than the rush of playing on a pvp server, but the stress is way lower.
---
"Risk" is an interesting word that gets used a lot in the context of wow pvp servers, but it feels like a misnomer. Nothing is lost in pvp except time. It isn't risky, it just prolongs everything. It's not as if other players are looting your gear when you die; they're just wasting your time, and I think that's what I dislike about playing on pvp servers and why I regret rolling on one, and why I have since quit.
---
Unless there‚Äôs a neck that lets you reroll a real tanking class, it really doesn‚Äôt matter
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=a4fdVbg6EiM

Just go for it. Hit cap is meant for raid bosses (lvl 63), dungeons and trash have lower level caps and too much hit is wasted there. So while you are gearing through dungeons and start getting hit gear you'll be fine. A miss every now and then is not a disaster. It gets important to maximize dps when you are progressing through raids, other than that its not so mucj important.
---
Also keep in mind while in dungeons and on raid trash you dont need the 9% hit most of the times, only vs lvl 63 mobs. Have a hit-cap kit and a kit with 4 / 5 % hit and more other useful stats on it for that purpose. Look the hit % required up.
---
Days?
---
I think APES killed a buffed pserver C'thun in 3 hours after the gates opened. They'll do it again now. Probably faster. Hell, someone else might beat them. 
---
But as we saw with the irrational butthurt over them killing Rags in week 1, the experience of that top sub-1% of players is really irrelevant to the game at large unless you get irrationally butthurt by it of your own volition.
---
No idea because that is not something we can conclude from the experiment. Why are you demanding somehing as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù that you know the data can‚Äôt support? Seems like a pretty shitty way to have a conversation.
---
How we do it:
---
I don't have a problem with our warrs going arms in raids.
---
Since mc and ony are easy af.
---
When bwl comes out, we'll require everyone to have an optimal pve spec if we wanna clear the raids in a normal time.
---
If your guild is not hardcore, then it shouldn't be a problem if you are arms. 
---
But like people said, you'll have to clear that up with your leaders.
---
Who could've imagined that the thing that would kill Classic would be horde gankers.
---
you're an idiot
---
Warlock has waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayy less QoL than mage does
---
Don‚Äôt set the rules of the game and then bitch when other people start playing by them.
---
MC is a cake walk compared to BWL so the flask would be needed more for progression. Might unscrewed the demand a little.
---
I agree, the ‚Äúexcuse me?‚Äù kind of rubbed me the wrong way but that could potentially just be tone not translating well to text.
---
The problem is, you will not have much time to do that, these AVs are less than 20m
---
If I can ask, why not Kirtonos? (I also main there)
---
I'm not even sure why I'm still on this sub honestly.

All it has turned into is: blue man good, red man bad, upvotes to the left

Not really sure what I expect though.

you're either really stupid or one of them.

Well, horde paladins were also the only ones viable in pve due to seal of blood ;)
---
Well said.

Nice one

Looks like OP lost and simply said curse you as a joke to the guy you won. The black bar blocking who received it is the same size as the black bar in the To whispers, but the black bar of the 2nd person to roll (OP) is much longer.

This sub lacks reasoning lol.

Guy who wrote "Flamelash aren't sending their best here". 
---
We had a pretty nice server before they transferred. Medium population meant it was high during peak hours and low during off-hours. It meant we could farm anything if we wanted to during off-hours and still enjoy the massive world events during peak hours. There were maybe 10-15 guilds in total that mattered, we knew each other and had a pretty good community overall, our main Discord server being just a few hundred accounts short of the number of level 60s on the server. 
---
The reason most people don't like Flamelash is because now our server looks like Firemaw/Gehennas/etc., the servers we transferred from because they were overpopulated. We're happy about rebalalancing (before Horde were 55-45 now it's 51-49 for the Alliance, perhaps the most balanced WoW server there is) but to us it's like moving away from the big city to some mountain town only to wake up the next day with a ski resort.
---
I am only surviving classic till tbc comes out. Raiding in classic is somewhat of a dull experience.
---

Dealing some dps, crushing totems, removing debuffs and healing is part of your job. If you got an interrupt, even using that is your job (palastun for example).
---
If you play healer more aggressively, you'll make your job a lot easier. Standing in the back isn't enough
---
(drinking constantly is a way to not delay the clearspeed, you'll get more gold for the time safed, than you'll lose for the drinks)
---
On earthshaker we have 3-4 full alliance raids camping BRM. 20 man sounds killable.
---
This community have been festering on private servers for years. Most of the returning players were blizzfully unaware of them and now they're being driven away from the game. 
---
So the "community" that everyone has been raving about for years is actually killing the game and they're doing it on purpose.
---
How is this on nochanges?  They overwhelmingly wanted the old school AV that lasted hours or days.
---
Just go herb/alchy, nothing even comes close. I have tryed most gold methods in Vanilla.
---
Flasks won‚Äôt go over 150 tbh not needed for bwl really either
---
im dead lmao
---
Ah yes let us do exactly what we transferred off our other server for to the opposite faction. There is no way it will end up like how it did for us.
---
They changed the one thing that absolutely should not have been changed under any circumstances. Realm sizes were chosen for a reason 15 years ago, they weren't supposed to ever grow beyond that.
---
Thank you! Working on it. Already am downranking two of my healings. Gonna have to learn more about it :)
---
What server are you on?
---
How many "minus karma" did you already get?
---
This is the quality content I lurk for.
---
Awesome
---
Lol the game went from being fun and nostalgic to getting camped at every questing/dungeon area. And this is coming from a lvl 51 horde player on bigglesworth. If you aren't 60 already its hard to quest and have fun anymore. I'm going to grind out 60 and will probably lose interest in a couple months.
---
I guess everyone sees things differently. I couldn‚Äôt even see how you might read the sentence differently until you explained it. It goes both ways, e.g. your first paragraph above as a single sentence looks odd to me. It‚Äôs hard to please everyone!
---
I do see your point. I suppose I just prefer writing and reading things by drawing on their context, rather than detaching segments of sentences and analysing them in a very literal way. For instance, in context of what I was describing, I doubt you really thought my wife was also my youngest brother! 
---
Like I said, I see your point but never liked breaking up sentences with more commas than necessary. If it‚Äôs good enough for The Economist, whose writers‚Äô style I can only hope to (poorly) replicate, then it‚Äôs good enough for me!
---
(This was really not the conversation I was planning to have from this post but thanks for the responses. I really didn‚Äôt see your point at first, but it‚Äôs something I will consider more often from now on.)
---
That is what I'm saying, actually. That's the point of the game design - to make people see the other faction as other. And winning wars against other societies is pro social. The most pro social maybe, in a very pragmatic sense.
---
So Zimbardo's original paper argued just that - when a situation provides minimally sufficient mundane realism people's brain react as if someone weren't part of their society.
---
and thus my suggestion: MAKE THE FUCKING BUFF VISIBLE SO WE KNOW IF THEY JUST GOT THERE... 
---
Like.. did you even read my original post?
---
Nice! It's the key to keep your mana going while healing :)
---
You‚Äôre the one saying you wouldn‚Äôt talk to someone because of which character they like to play on an online game lol
---
You still gonna get rolled by the enemy zergball if you stray too far away from your own.

If i reroll on flamelash will i be accepted ?

---
The majority are the idiots in these cities.
---
I know of guilds from my server who was pretty balanced who left for Heartseeker. Alliance players always cry they want balanced servers, but in the end they just want to farm Horde players. They are not one bit better than them.
---
what's the rspawn timer?
---
"Let is you know"?
---
Friend got 1 after our first xp run. Twas great.
---
This. I have to PvP as Fury (which totally sucks) because I can't afford to respec every few days.
---
Dragon‚Äôs Call is pretty even, and I am sure that is not the only one.
---
So an obscure guild ganking on a realm is responsible for a majority of pvp servers being unplayable alliance side ? The horde on flamelash didn't get pissed off at some random guild, they just act the same way a majority faction acts on any other pvp server.  
---
You being stuck in stv for 6 hours once is the experience for anyone trying to level up an alliance toon now, but 24/7. The only zones where you don't get ganked by 60's or twinks is in non-flagged zones. Redridge probably has more 19 horde rogues than alliance players.
---
You talk about color grey, buy yourself consider horde as a singularity that wants nothing else but camp in Alliance capitals. Have some consistency Varian
---
&gt; but people might not know that DBM has a delay 
---
Hahaha, no. Some people don't know that wrath of rag has a cooldown, it's not on a set timer. 
---
If you're gonna elitist, at least know how the fucking abilities work dude.
---
Really depends on the server.. i think prices of flasks on those servers mostly went up due to overpopulation and worldpvp. On my pve server the price is still 50-60g. (Allthough weve been told we need to buy a flask each for first week of BWL.. so it will go up but by how much?).
---
Personally i expect Dark Iron Ore to go up near the phase 3 launch, since u need 4-5k of them for honored&gt;revered thorium brotherhood (and still way cheaper method on my server than rep through Core leather/fiery). Any server/guild needs some ppl at revered for the BiS healingbelt.. and the belt-mats price (core leather nd stuff) might go up aswell. 
---
I plan on collecting enough resources to have 10 belts posted on AH so all tryhard PVEers will buy em for first BWL.
---
SO, IMAGINE thinking youre john rambo, imagine wanting to do pvp all day, imagine wanting to camp horde cities all day, imagine wanting to own horde players all day, THEN IMAGINE horde stomps you and your stardust dream guild SO hard that your dreams dont come true. NOW THE REDICULOUS PART, IMAGINE accusing server pop for this (even if youre camping horde all day as a 20~ man raid popping sappers on cd to maximize your kills in brm door) and then imagine CONVINCING the whole server to leave (those who didnt know or play that day are dead characters) then imagine making tons of LEVEL 1 HORDE toons and speak on world chat trying to change the public opinion of people because you only have one day of migrations left! Now imagine you tricked lots of players going by force on a server that you have higher pop as alliance so you can camp kargath tp dm lhc uc org and durotar at the same time. BASICALLY IMAGINE RAGEQUITTING. Venture = most lowlife alliance guild ive seen in 15 years of wow,. That was something that reached new levels of chickenism. Fun fact you actually BELIEVED that you were having unfair pvp on flamelash.
---
Ps. At least you soon go back to retail
---
Ps2. Imagine ruining a whole server because the wpvp you were searching for didnt happen, and then saying the server died..

You seem pretty worked up for a video game...almost triggered I would say. 
---
It‚Äôs funny, I don‚Äôt actually care. I am on my pve server having a blast. It‚Äôs just fun to see you horde get so defensive.

&gt;This isnt elitism

Choker of the firelord is the bis neck for prot paladins.

Don‚Äôt stress. That guy is obviously jelly af.
---
As a level 55 gnome warrior, I can't recall the racial ever saving me in wpvp except maybe allowing me to run away successfully 1-2 times. I get nova'd, pop escape artist, and then I am immediately slowed by another frost spell. If a rogue slows me, I pop escape artist, and then I get blinded/stunned so it doesn't make a difference anyways. Doesn't feel like a game changer ability to me. Maybe that will change later.
---
Woe to the horde on Skeram, they are the real victims. Sounds like they should transfer so they can have a better honor farming experience, as opposed to the Alliance having.. any experience at all.
---
Can't wear too much defense unless you don't want reboudt or reckoning to work. I'd probably take the hit as it's one of the better hit pieces you can get.
---
anyone didn't see this from miles is an idiot  
---
p.s.: yes it is, releasing a *solved* 15 year old pvp ranking system without proper means of farming for it leads to this.
---
why would you whirlwind against single target?
---
Wow who would've thought a toxic personality would attract other toxic people to do shitty things as a community? It's like being the stereotype of a neckbeard only breeds that kind of behavior.
---
Immagine how horribly boring this phase must be for the hordes. No1 to kill anywhere. They might aswell be stuck on a pve server.
---
Patchwerk was 55-45 for Horde pretty much on any census site all the time. And if you actually played you saw both Horde and Alliance death squads in every endgame zone. Blackrock was controlled by both factions as well. 
---
This server was very fine for both factions and everyone had the same experience. Some big guilds who left like Windforce actually loved to run around in a 30-man death train through EPL. But I guess it sucked when Horde could actually defend themselves. 
---
The thing is a lot of alliance players actually don‚Äôt want to do PvP. I saw it when leveling. So many pussies running around who always run away instead of standing up and helping. Alliance just have a huge victim complex.
---
Gotta be very geared tho
---
2nd this. Horde heavy but PVP is good still.
---
Not every guild is full of bleeding edge dps that push a tank to the limit in threat gen. In fact, a majority don‚Äôt. Just because a warrior is getting TF doesn‚Äôt mean they have to 100% min-max. Very few do (as in only dozens in the world).
---
Just because someone acknowledges that it isn‚Äôt necessary for everyone to mon-max to the fullest (different people have different goals, crazy thought), doesn‚Äôt mean they are casual or bad. Get that dumb ass elitist shit out of here. It‚Äôs pathetic a (presumably) grown ass adult has to act like that to feel superior in a 15yo video game.
---
Use succubus.
---
Actually , it's better to stay dead because if you get killed again it resets the timer if I understood correctly ?
---
I don't PvP alot but when i am lucky enough to get a kill or two, i usually get 150+ honor, All these gave like 2-20 each.. is it even Worth it standing and aoe'ing in these big groups ?
---
He ninjaloots items from raids and gifts them to his streamer officers.
---
He supports and condones other streamers who ninjaloot.
---
He talks trash about "owning the server" then whines when Horde players gank him.
---
He's relies on his viewers to gift him gold, powerful BoEs, enchants, and passing loot to him (he was literally getting carried through MC at 53 and being given loot he couldn't even use yet).
---
Despite being one of the most geared people on the server, he has little understanding of basic mechanics and has been shown to do lower DPS than the same class in questing blues/greens.
---
He and his officers invade other guilds' discord servers to talk shit, then he reports them for harrassment to get their Twitch accounts suspended.
---
He berates and belittles his own guildmates publically on stream during raids.
---
He publically announces his plans to quit streaming Classic or re-roll on a new server, essentially abandoning and screwing over the large number of his viewers who only rolled a character on Faerlina because of him. Additionally, he jokes about rolling the new toon on a different, non-streamer friendly server just to piss those users off.
---
He is a rolled up ball of all of the most toxic WoW behaviors. You can say it's just an act for more views, but that doesn't lessen the impact his "routine" has on other players. You can say that he's not personally responsible for the individual actions of everyone in his guild, but he chooses to promote and condone this type of behavior and does nothing to distance himself from it.
---
At this point, anyone who still supports him is getting what they deserve.
---
I literally just gave you the first link to the upvote thread and everything, the evidence has been deleted/too hard to find so im not gonna waste my sunday looking for it. Dude named Gnarsies made a video with vvvortic about it showcasing all the drama, then the community turned against gnarsies months later so he removed his videos and went dark. If you can find copies of those videos be my guest because thats where most of the evidence is. At the very least it can be proven that dude looks at loli stuff by just checking his twitter and youtube head.
---
There are a lot of mages but people still want/need them. I always see pugs looking for mages, what the LFG channel. People love them for leveling groups, especially ae farming. Plus you can solo level if you want. Raids definitely take a lot of mages.
---
You'll just have horde start camping Kharanos/Goldshire instead
---
tl;dw:  
---
five people click goblin sapper charge
---
I have never seen an instance where the person farmed the materials themselves. It is always a guildwide endeavor to craft the weapon.
---
30% chance to resist any and all stuns as a racial is the single strongest PvP racial in the game.
---
that doesn't mean that things like Escape Artist, or Will of the Forsaken are not strong, or even stronger in very specific situations. But the orc stun resist is so much better overall it isn't even close to being funny.
---
I was beginning to think i was the only redditor on the server. Suddenly i dont feel so alone.
---
Yeah, I've always found this common grammatical argument interesting. I'm glad you see where I'm coming from, and I do see where you're coming from with your point "in context of what I was describing, I doubt you really thought my wife was also my youngest brother!" - which is completely true, I didn't realize my thought process reading your sentence was wrong until I read that line, where I understood of course your wife isn't your younger brother.
---
The usefulness of the Oxford Comma is an interesting debate, for sure.
---
correct, T1 is arguably bis over T2, unless there are multiple hunters in the raid to keep up the debuff from T2
---
I would wait till 60, and then respecc. But a lot of gear you can already farm. I.e. Mauradon Ring, DM East Bow, Wyrmhide shoulders (2%, really great). If you have some money left I would get the devilsaurer set. The difference is noticeable and I got it for 100g. (bought leather, guildie made it)
---
Are you inbred by any chance?
---
You can farm for it in Winterspring. It drops off the elite demons in the south.
---
Why you do my boy Hitmonlee like that?
---
please link a thread/math that shows this.
---
You can, just give the majority faction the option to transfer to other realms. Maybe even *gasp* PvP to PvE realms.
---
#JustDoItThereAreAlreadyTonsOfChanges
---
Check your GUID next time, the theory is people with the lowest guid will get hit.
---
/run for i=1, GetNumGroupMembers() do local token = "raid"..i local guid = UnitGUID(token) if guid and guid &lt; UnitGUID("player") then print(UnitName(token)) end end
---
you can count on ppl playing in wichever way yields the most honor. 
---
The honorsystem is a competition against your own faction, not against the other :D
---
Our guilds first eye went to a shaman that farmed almost all of the mats himself or farmed enough gold to buy most. iirc he only needed one or two ingots from the guild bank.
---
That‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve seen someone put in themselves.
---
Mankrik it's like 70% horse south shore is always under attack.
---
So, how does saying horde had a 25% advantage over the alliance support your position for things being balanced?   
---
you then follow it up with  anecdotes when I never said any behavior was exclusive to one faction or another.
---
You then made my point for me by saying alliance don‚Äôt want to PvP as much as horde do.....which goes against your previous statement of implying they are equal.   
---
so to sum up, horde have a 25% advantage, want to PvP more than the alliance, and you still claim they are the same.  Care to square that circle?
---
Your being dramatic. They ban bots all the time, usually in waves. And there is always drama on reddit when it happens.
---
They will go up because people who procrastinated are going to roll twinks and then have to gear up. Stuff like this always goes up right after launch of something new. Watch the AH prices on the day BGs come out and the prices will probably stay high for the first week then start dropping.
---
I feel like we've seen different videos and criticisms of the study. His instructions I saw to amp things up or whatever were fairly vague. The specifics they supplied from their impression of what bad prison guards do. It was a role they put on. Hence role engulfment.
---
But Zimbardo is hardly the only evidence for role engulfment. It's just the most prominent study.
---
Yeah, quite a lot of people who rolled PvP found out that they are PvE players.
---
Vanilla servers remained popular for years, a decade and then some. So will classic. But blizzard just dropped the ball on some servers hard. 
---
I am lucky enough to play on a 51/49 server and phase 2 is very enjoyable for me and most players on my server. 
---
But a 70/30 server is a dramatically different experience, I would imagine. Even 60/40 is 1.5 to 1, pretty terrible world balance...
---
Ppl farm their own gold for weekly consumes in my guild. Legendary was more a 'meme' thing in our guild (druid has the mace) and noonr helped. 
---
We do have lottery at the start of the raid tho! 99% of BoE drops, core get sold on AH since we got em already and the profit gets rolled as a lottery.
---
Stocking black lotuses myself for phase 3 Ive been gettin somewhat lucky in EPL seem to get one or two a day lately.
---
Oh yes, meant to say Phase 3.. Cheers for the input.
---
I'm not too sure but it sounds like just rushing bosses and DEing the blues that drop. You'll end up with small radiant shards and those go for a pretty penny so I'm assuming that's what he's selling. 
---
If your main isn't enchanting, you can bring a 2nd account or someone along that can DE and just Master Loot the goods to them to disenchant.
---
Feral druids are viable but they require more work then other classes. Not only do you need that helm to power shift you also have to farm crowd pummlers to do good damage. You also should be of tanking some times in addition to dosing. 
---
If you just want to do a lot of melee damage in end game raids go furry warrior. Rogues are decent but still are basically worse warriors in raids. Of you don't care about raiding you can ignore me because feral druids are great with little effort while leveling and in dungeons.
---
Some dummy will kill the elemental boss the moment it spawns, preventing new 'special' elementals from spawning, and ending the event. I doubt it'll have much of an impact on the prices of anything.
---
Yep I cant get that Cape to save my fucking life got that 7% drop rate dagger 3 times
---
Im playing dagger rogue too, not a pvp expert but this usally works - open with cheapshot - backstab (sinister if combat) - gauge - kidney - backstab - blind if target is still alive - depends on theyr health you can ambush after or start all over again.
---
Dude ele and resto shamans are pretty insane in pvp. Who cares if a pally can Bop or freedom when shamans can spam purge and then 1 shot you in a single gcd.
---
How do u do it properly?
---
Theres a wow site someone linked, and you can see there are more allies than horde, about 60 40 but more horde are on 60s, now it's possible that allies play alts more, but overall the population seems to be leaning ally especially lately in the earlier levels.
---
You'll use both cheap and ambush regularly just depends on who you are opening on and if they are mounted etc.
---
mythic plus was the worst addition to warcraft since fucking up the world in cata, if it get's introduced to classic I'm done with wow and blizzard forever
---
I loved AV as a hunter, now I‚Äôm a paladin so looking forward to a whole new perspective.
---
Any vids with a good route?
---
That and the stupid shoulder from UBRS.
---
I've never felt that way, but the good news is 17 is not very hard to get to.
---
No, you will not be good without powershifting, but powershifting is not hard/more work that any other class.
---
You basicly need 3 buttons: Shred, f. Bite and a macro like /cancelform /cast Cat form.
---
Ofc you will use ff and other skills, but rogue use the same amount of skills, so it will not make a difference. 
---
Play whatever is the most fun to you.
---
it was good till they activated the honor system, cant go to any high level zone to quest as you get ganked by ally allmost everytime.
---
plaguelands is no go, horde flight point npc usually gets killed  
---
Searing George, Badlands from kargath to searing in the pass, BRD... takes 4ever to get in.
---
TIL. Thanks! 
---
The first time through (vanilla), I never paid attention to the lore. This time through, I'm a far cry from MC.
---
If you don't want to put in the extra work required to be a hybrid then just play a pure dps. Druids are really rewarding class with slll its utility but if y ou gonna slack, and plan on slacking from the start just go rogue or hunter...
---
For all the pain and suffering the faction imbalance has caused, at least the memes born from it are crisp AF !
---
Of course you can play WoW if you haven't even played it. This is my first time playing the original game. PvP is always toxic, in any game, if you don't like it, play PvE. I'm not sure why so many people think they need to play pvp in wow, if you don't like being ganked and camped, don't play pvp.
---
we merged 2 guilds and the conditions for it was that the guild leader of one (paladin tank) gets thunderfury first, and one of our ret paladins gets sulfuras first
---
this week eye dropped, our guild had 2 ingots, so we ended up trading/borrowing the other ingots and a blacksmith with the recipe from other guilds
---
Makes sense, I missed the implication there.
---
Hi, are Battlegrounds going to be released on Tuesday? if yes, do you know at what time? thank you!
---
I ran into the same issue. I have absolutely no idea why, but the addon I was using worked fine everywhere except the encounter. Turned it off and it was fine the next attempt.
---
You can't be serious.
---
i like this as a tank warrior
---
That is one fine paint job
---
Question: what item and how did he manage to ninja it?
---
Stop. You're breaking the illusion that vanilla was perfect.
---
Same thing that has happened in every expansion in WoW history, warriors start off kinda bad then the rage mechanic kicks in and you start becoming an absolute wrecking ball.
---
This made me laugh inordinately hard.
---
I mean, are you really managing threat? You're just using a soulstone to get around the mechanic.
---
My comment want aimed at your strategy. Just the point that you keep saying the parse doesn't matter then keep mentioning it. If you wanna flex bro, just flex.
---
Assuming everyone does the fight correctly, your strat is redundant anyway. The boss would still go down with our without your presence because it's not a DPS race.
---
Then we better never see you complain about being camped here.
---
Not to mention constantly lying about Advertise's streams. "Almost all of his stream titles mention me, his entire content is about harassing me!" which is demonstrably false. Literally libel.
---
They‚Äôve devoted their entire lives to this game, $15 extra per month is not exactly a big deal for them
---
There are dozens of us!
---
OP didn't win the dagger
---
It bothered me for a hot minute, but he's so entertaining I can't not love him.
---
Keep playing the game on easy mode, horde rogue bitch.
---
Sulfaras isnt good for anyone in raiding environment. Shamans should be healing, and if they're swinging, it should be nightfall.
---
For warriors there's so many better options for dps.
---
TF is bis for tanking and should be supported by guild.
---
What do u mean by this
---
Whorde or alliance?
---
Warriors want like 3-4 things in MC for DPS.
---
If the investors see a big drop in income they sure do want explanations. You think they just sit by and watch when if it's going downhill?
---
The quests you're thinking off are the turnins for looting parts of each race of the opposite faction, and no, these are not in the 1.12 AV version we'll be getting anymore.
---
The super hardcore tryhard guilds on my vanilla server and pservers I played on actually welcomed these prem vs prem fights with open arms, because as you said it happened only once every couple days. 
---
Wasting an hour of WSG grinding to break up the monotony of stomping pugs in 5min games 18hours a day with instaqeuues was well worth the effort to not completly burn out. 
---
In other words: these hardcore prems were happy to have a chance at having fun every 2 days for an hour to then sink down to monotonous grinding again.
---
How were you planning to tank baron with a dps?
---
&gt; I can‚Äôt afford to respec for each raid
---
just go farming? 2-3h dm:e pays the weekly respec
---
Zachthetank if you read this massage, please leave org
---
So like every one of the big pop PvP realms are for Horde? Are they all gonna be dead too?
---
Actually shit, wait don't answer that.
---
It's stealth, for every class, on a 10 sec cd.
---
Tell that to my Faerlina shaman who keep getting ganked by alliance in Felwood...
---
Did I just got trolled reading this?
---
it's understandable, you're confusing classic with a #nochanges game
---
Hmm I have alliance on that server I dont play a 60 warlock hmmmmmm
---
invis pot, fap or limited invulnerability pot. 
---
Not sure when or how you should use them. But they are damn usefull!
---
Robe of the exalted?
---
this is why CoA rank 1 yourself on the reflector is the real play
---
I hope so :D
---
This graph is confusing. Having a line for subs gained and subs lost each would be better I believe.
---
i dont even need to use death coil as SL lock, they make the opener, i send void to attack and insta dot when i break free, facetank with drain health. sacrifice only at around %40ish health + insta summon another void. 
---
or as destro, i charm them with succubus, wait for cc to end, then one shot them with soulfire + immo+conf+shadowburn.
---
although, i am fully t1+t2+mageblade geared so i usually outgear people. also about succubus charm tactic, some good rogues may outplay me by sapping me and focusing on succubus after breaking the charm(with pvp trinket) so this tactic not always works. but first tactic, especially when i outgear most of the people, always works against any melee
---
I get it that this one is satirical, but can we please stop it with the Flamelash posts? It's getting annoying.
---
I wouldn't say that was the best tanking - couldn't really get threat in p3. I would say this is more impressive of the healers than the Spriest
---
&gt; Just put your HS in Goldshire or Dun Morogh instead.
---
They camp that aswell.
---
I wish there were more naked gnome dance parties in IF tbh
---
And considering he also thinks he isnt responsible for what his viewers do it just makes it worse when he whines about Advertise being responsible for what his viewers do. Just something to add to the list of shit from him.
---
&gt; YOUR ENTIRE RAID GROUP an extra
---
yeah. except for the fact that half of your raid;s dps is physical and they dont get any benefit from the debuff.
---
however it's kinda impossible in a 40 man group to not find someone that slacks so giving him the weapons is a plus.
---
min maxing in classic is terribly funny for now because blizzard doesnt have a dev team for this and bosses are shit under-tuned for 1.12 talents.
---
prolly nax should be a challenge
---
however, if u want to min max this shit, best nightfall bot is a mana geared hunter with surefooted that's spamming rank1 wing clip
---
I understand the "no changes" thing to a certain degree, but when it comes to shit like this, its really stupid.
---
Unless you are releasing patches specifically timed to when they were released, ok. But it is a "wait and see" when it comes to phases so why not just release the honor gameplay WITH the honor. 
---
Blizz biffed this one, hard.
---
That's right, the good thing about Gdpk is you only bid what you really need. You have a BIS gear list for a nice gear set, only bid on them and skip those you don't need.
---
But in a roll pug, 10 people may roll even they don't need it that much.  People would think "why not, better than nothing right?" He probably won't use it at all as he will lose like 2% hit rate or 20 spell effect even it has high gear level.
---
Another thing in classic wow, raid items can't be trade within 2 hours so if some luck guy got the item he doesn't quite pursue, and some other guy whispers him for a trade, there still might be undertable business we don't know.
---
Who cares wpvp is ass anyway
---
I think Thursday is more likely. Honor started on Thursaday too.
---
It had been said being live during week of the 10th, not being live on 10th
---
author here: first line of my post: "I'm a tank"
---
Well I mean you have to. Deserter is in this patch. And its *still* better to AFK out than play a 75 minute honest game against another premade.
---
I'm not going to try and make sense of this rant, sorry.
---
Keep questing.
---
If you have a "full"time job and still grind like 5 to 6 hours a day... rest of ur life must be damn boring.. 
---
But anyways.. beside that.. ye u won't be able to outplay those no lifers solo
---
Yeah I read the comments and was like "it cant be that bad". Holy fuck I was wrong
---
Yeah we shrunk ragnaros and it was comical, although it did fudge the clearspeed because his hitbox shrank so much that a ton of people couldn't hit him.
---
It‚Äôs 30 with paranoia, goggles and elixir
---
Healing meters are broken and inaccurate so you're probably not beating people as much as you think.
---
Autobalance would be fun. Yesterday you log off as az orc in og today you are in sw as a human.
---
isn't Finkles a sword not a dagger?
---
So am I, I just read the news. Lmao
---
ITT: people not knowing WSG is has no time limit and the opposion faction premade will gladly sit on your graveyard to get all them HKs.  
---
Can't wait to bullseye ~~gooks~~ ud mages in AV.
---
The trick is to get the relic coffee keys and go loot the chests in there if you can get the keys for cheap that is you can get like 10-15g a run of looting arena guys and the bar then going to the relic room I found
---
I don't think i've been anywhere where Alliance have outnumbered Horde on Noggenfogger. The closest was one time we managed to take back the Theramore boat only the run into another raid on the other end. So much fun.
---
Also, of topic, but based on your name... Becky's Bling?
---
be SL spec
---
I do this daily and probably kill way faster than u
---
lol
---
Not talking about dps who threat race the tank, talking about ppl who break cc and chain pull.
---
giggle
---
That's real dude go do that rn
---
Yeah me too as ally. By the time that warrior is dead more horde will DEFINITELY be there. Also the only good way to win is to drop cripplings for instants (ignore armor) which is annoying.
---
But with bgs approaching there will not much time left:(
---
I dl'er the retail client just to check on my old vanilla warrior. 100+ days played, literally dozens of epics, tank 9 pvp... and my brown kodo was still in bank slot #1.
---
Mograine or Gehennas if you are interested in PvP, when it comes to PvE I don't think it matters too much what realm you're gonna choose since even if there is a unbalance in faction ratio t wont matter
---
S H A M E L E S S.
---
How much hit% is needed for lvl 60 mobs/players, if any?
---
It is faster, even if you don't believe it.
---
You can just hover and hit the heal. Don't need to worry if you accidentally misclicked just outside the frame, targeted the wrong person, etc...
---
Also, it allows you to keep one player or mob permantly targeted, so you can essentially heal/dps two targets at once with zero clicking/targeting changes. For example, target boss, mouse hovering next to the tank's frame. DPS until tank needs heals, slide mouse slightly over to hover on tank, heal, slide mouse off tank to continue DPS.
---
It makes EVERYTHING incredibly easier.
---
Ah, it's the weekly "Let's shit on Asmongold" thread!
---
though i guess 90% of the votes/comments are just the OP's friend and their guild discord vote brigading
---
Without the premade problem I'd say WSG. But because of it, it will be AV. Don't get it what's so difficult to match premades against premades only.
---
I'm looking for an add on that change, enlarge the minimap (not the actual map you got with "m" keybind).  
---
Thank you  
---
(i've tried leatrix but i cannot change the mini map)
---
So on like 10 Horde dominated servers is 1 thats not. Impressive.
---
But that's...why...he did this......
---
It's not just nef
---
&gt;ye u won't be able to outplay those no lifers solo
---
He said he isn't playing on a big server and has been in the highest brackets every week now. I don't think he'll have that much of a problem doing it when BGs come out.
---
Why are they flagged in a major city?
---
If we're talking about a sophies choice because a dps pulled another pack or broke cc, and you choose the dps, the tank dies and then the dps will die. If the dps dies, theres still 2 more to do that job.
---
Thanks Captain Obvious, you can fly away now.
---
No, I'm scott.
---
You mad Mez?
---
Dude you are absolutely delusional if you think there is any actual difference between horde an alliance players in classic wow. Myself and all my friends and guildies have played both factions at some point during end game. It‚Äôs an ancient game. Same goes for retail. You‚Äôve been ganked a few too many times and decided to direct your rage towards an imaginary stereotype you‚Äôve created. It‚Äôs ingroup, us vs them human psychology and I get it but man do you need to take a few steps back and re-examine your thinking for a minute.
---
ElvUI, WeakAuras (the three "missing buffs" buttons, honor/h, etc), ItemRack (for trinket menu), Details and a few other minor addons. 
---
I modified ElvUI frames &amp; actionbars to work for me as a raid healer and for PvP.
---
Theres a reason the best and most knowledgeable classic players (of the APES guild) chose alliance, and particularly only allow gnomes and dwarves into their guild. Beyond that, I don't feel like engaging further in a discussion with someone who clearly has something approaching a mental illness. Good day to you
---
Whats this from
---
sure cause this became to most obnoxious subreddit ever it was allways bad but now it feels like the same crap everyday
---
ThE HoRdE MaDe Us dO iT
---
Restoshams &gt; Pallies in group pvp.
---
Having your healers able to puge and do that much burst &gt; bop/bof
---
You'll likely see premade groups going all the time that you can jump into.  The emergent behavior in AV is for the two sides to run past each other and do a base race. A good group can knock out quick wins and a substantial amount of honor. I think you'll find that the queue times are fairly low.
---
Feral Druid main here.  You typically won't get a raid spot as a 'Pure DPS'.  When it comes to raiding, the ~10-40% damage that you lack compared to a true DPS class needs to be made up in utility.  Lots of fights in MC need more than 2 tanks while progressing.  If you are able to put your hand up and tank as bear for a fight like Garr, Domo or Sulf is a massive benefit to the raid, and saves a DPS Warrior putting on a shield.  
---
In regards to loot, something like Band of Accuria while absolutely core on a Cat, is much better utilised by other DPS/Tanks.  Say a raid drop is a 15agility increase for a Cat and a Rogue.  The Rogue would produce more DPS with that 15agility than the Cat, so Cats are usually the last for loot. (Need to be patient with Loot as a Feral)
---
People talk about MCP (Manual Crowd Pummelers) are absolutely neccessary.  You can run Gnomer 5 times in 25mins and it drops pretty frequently.  No one is asking you to pop them on trash, save them for bosses/progression.  Run Gnomer a few times before work/lunch break/as you get home from work, you'll have a surplus ready for raids.  
---
I main a bear and very rarely cat, can't discuss too much regarding Powershifting.  It isn't as clunky as you might think with macros.
---
It's sad that they are still allowed here but yeah mods gotta mod and keep people like this for the numbers or whatever.
---
The second you take away the possibility to be an asshole on the Internet from these people they lose everything. Or did ever anyone of you had a longer friendship with such a supertoxic person? No? Makes sense.
---
&gt; they
---
We (Horde on Heartstriker) didn't force Alliance. The Horde on Lucifron did that. 
---
But you don't seem to understand the "The Horde" is not one person.
---
That's not blackmailing, blackmailing involves threats.
---
It was confirmed it will be Tuesday, regardless of reset day. Feels weird and it feels weird that we have zero info about it one day before launch.
---
Honestly I think you should be able to zone in regardless of your corpse.  It's one thing you camp a group of players actively trying to PVP.  It's the inability to disengage that causes the issue IMO.  If I'm not having a good time I'll stop playing, and my sub statues will reflect that.
---
It‚Äôs funny since i‚Äôve started playing again I think of irl situations as quests. Getting a package from the postal service and buying a carpet with gf felt like a quest. I think I have to get out more.

I personally would use greater stoneshield for Rag if mitigation/dmg avoidance is an issue since it smoothes out the damage for a longer period of time.  For geddon I would use mighty rage potion to make sure you don't lose agro to ranged DPS since you have to move out during hellfires.  I currently if tanking use mighty rages on both since mitigation isn't an issue on rag and I prefer an extra threat lead so I can pool rage for the threat wipe.
---
Waited this one out for a while before reposting eh
---
Logs say I am as well. So either both logs and meters are simultaniously broken, or I am right. Occams razor my friend.
---
Logs break when the distance of the logger and the person receiving heals &gt; too much. Like standing on opposite side of raggy.
---
Ty dude, he does indeed sounds like an asshole.
---
&gt;PvE
---
fuck the streamers
---
hey thats me iam in the bottom right, alliance hunter :)
---
don't bother.
---
Like true horde mentality, they like go fuck up everything for everyone else and then go "NOT MY FAULT!" when they get called out for it.  
---
There is a reason they picked horde, and that is because they relate to them in the worst of ways.
---
They weren't. They were planning to get a tank that wanted an easy Baron kill. A more appealing, faster run for them so easier to get.
---
I'm on an ally dominated server but I can't complain since it's about 60/40 (still getting ganked in Undercity when I log in on my alt but I can PvP alone on main if I want to).
---
Alliance deathballs roaming Searing Gorge 24/7. Decided he had enough, one of our PvPers formed a group of maybe 15-20 people. Alliance instantly eradicated, Searing Gorge became empty. Hours later we found out they went inside the caves on the middle of the zone. After cleaning them out, we ported to UC since it was midnight. Found out that 80% the people we just killed were in Tirisfal Glades. Now that is some mentality right there. Anytime they wanted, they could wipe our group off the face of the earth but they just kept running to different zones getting picked off one by one.
---
The next day it was business as usual, same guys, same 15v1 fights, impossible to solo travel as horde.
---
So whenever I read these horde posts... yeah sure, we are the problem.
---
He'll just reserve all chewables, no thanks.
---
Currently farming for sulfuras myself. Ingots are 800 on my server, the only thing guild does is provide a 300 gold discount on our ingot drops. Sad thing is I don't even have the eye, saved dkp for it. First binding got loot counciled to MT, yet to see the second one. He farms for arcane crystals himself and gets free transmutes from other officers, plus I sell them to him at 2g discount. 
---
Life is rough on small servers.
---
Can't recommend mouseover macros enough, they are incredibly useful. There are add-ons that fill the same function (Clique), but regardless of which you go for, you will want either one.
---
Couple it with a party/raid interface add-on (can recommend Grid2) for easy overview of all health bars, as well as all debuffs you can conjure up. Comes with a tonne of customizability, and I believe it had LibHealComm4 integrated - I still downloaded HealComm as well though, just to be on the safe side. In PvE it will first be required in UBRS when you are around 57/58, and absolutely necessary in raids.
---
I feel like he got so popular because WoW was doing so bad there for a while with nothing to do and he brought people together and made content for them. He hosted achievement runs, he would run raids to help people get gear, he hosts transmog competitions for people to show off their transmog, and more. The only other streamers were basically hardcore guilds, Towelie and Preach.
---
He also was a huge collector and at one point probably had the most mounts/tmog out of anyone else, which made people relate to him as he was clearly also a neckbeard that had sunk a lot of time into the game.
---
wat
---
I'm at the stage of Dual wielding Baron, so after initial positioning Mitigation I have 10K + lead on most ranged.
---
But stoneshield on Rag? His damager is like 75% fire damage *with* fire resist gear on.
---
post this a few more times for good measure, we haven't seen this enough
---
Tauren Druid is much better than Nelf druid tho.
---
Yeah, because of fucking Paladins, 5% Int, EA and Fear Ward.
---
None of which are strictly racial. Paladins are a class and Fear Ward requires a specific class/race combo.
---
5% Int can be pretty significant for pushing PvE content. Paladins are amazing at organized PvP.
---
None of which has any impact on \*individual\* racial buffs for PvP. If you don't want to play a Paladin yourself, you're better off playing the other classes as an Orc or Undead. If you're not a super PvE tryhard, the 5% Int is immaterial. Escape Artist is nice but is a pimple on the ass of WOTF and Hardiness yet is still the best Alliance PvP racial. 
---
I defy you to find any reputable source besides the depths of your anus that says Stoneform and Escape Artist are better than WOTF or Hardiness. Stoneform is literally useless against anyone who isn't putting poisons or bleeds on you.
---
everything progress reduced to a number increasing is what killed wow
---
Curious which data you‚Äôre talking about...? You‚Äôre either conflating liking PvP with being a shitty person, or you‚Äôre completely talking out of your ass and referring to ‚Äúdata‚Äù that don‚Äôt exist. Neither makes any sense, and both make you look clueless.
---
Are you suggesting that a priest isn't the best tank ?? Great remark...
---
Now change the experiment so that the larger rat is competing with other larger rats for the highest wins that day to get the most food from the lab assistant.
---
.
---
How and where did you record this? Looks like you used a hack? It's taking place in some cave, and you are clipping above it?
---
(Not relating to the validity of the content here, just curious)
---
It's not really a big deal, if you have any reasonable amount of BFA liquid gold you can buy a token and plop a month of game time on another account.
---
Classic just needs a sub, nothing else.
---
I don't think any fixed date was communicated by Blizzard. They only said "in the week of the December 10th". And since this is Blizzard we're talking about, this can mean anything. Up to Sunday 23:59.
---
Blaumeux *used* to be balanced. Now it favors the Horde heavily, like 2:1 H. The person I was playing with there has permanently relegated himself to raidlogging. It sucks, so I've moved on.
---
all this good boy need is Eskhander's set to tank all raid even naxx
---
There is more time in cata-present than vanilla-wotlk by a fair amount yes lol
---
bgs comes 2morrow, Is there rly a reason for him to leave now?
---
21 60s,  37 people total in IF at 4am monday.  Keep on lying dude.  I don't know what your agenda is, but you are clearly lying and up to something here.   Like I said previously I have come to the conclusion that you are getting wrecked by Horde on a PvP server and making up these lies to make yourself feel better.
---
Oof, this was a waste of time for everyone.
---
This is some fucking next level delusion. Whether or not you're having fun is irrelevant, its pretty much objectively clear the game is unhealthy. The Flamelash situation would not happen to a healthy game.
---
tbc was the first time true horde players considered playing alliance because male draenei look kinda decent (dwarfs can be finde but they look too comical in most situations imo)
---
I'd be pretty mad if I made a character, got to 60, joined his guild, and heard the GM talking about how hard they were gonna go in phase 2 just to have the guild leader quit after actually having to engage in PvP with most likely most of the guild following suit.
---
Finally got accepted into the alince gnome orgy
---
Well put.
---
The servers that aren't PvP are a bit of nonsense to drag into this though, there the faction imbalance doesn't really matter as much.
---
Yeah man, 5 man group getting through 45 payers quick. Nice try troll.
---
Paladin + priest are a extremely strong healing duo, both can dispel and if thing went south the paly can bubble and save the day.
---
Plus don't even mention the paladin PVP trinket to a shaman.
---
Allright cheers
---
Even better: go for rank 1 corruption of u got nightfall for an extra chance on procs
---
This is why every mmos with world pvp should have 3 factions
---
My point being when bgs are out, you should join a pvp team to premade if possible, it would be better. 
---
They might not need you right now but with time and their first few rk14 leaving, you will get a spot soon enough.
---
You might have to maintain yourself at rk10-11 by yourself for a bit, but it‚Äôs part of the process.
---
Good luck and stay strong, 12years~ ish later I still wish I had more time for my rank 13. (Was lacking just one week reset when BC came out x) )
---
No idea if this is still possible but I used to tame a low level creature in a starting zone that was needed for a quest.
---
Hide behind a tree and leave the pet in the open, lowbie will attack your pet and flag themself you then spam mend pet while they fight it.
---
It was funny as a once a year for 2-3 lowbies kind of thing, not a stay there all day every day thing.
---
Bgs comes out in 1 day. I think this will solve alot of the issused ppl who wants to pve has currently.

Didn't expected anything else ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Nobody care about streamers. Back to retail with them.
---
Oh.. guess I‚Äôll die

There‚Äôs one lingering hope of vanishing the DC if he did create enough distance, it‚Äôs almost impossible to do unless they‚Äôre a few yards away
---
Sure, aggro isn't a thing out of combat
---
You are saying as if it‚Äôs just REROLL LOL, these people spent 3 months or even 1 month leveling to hit 60, let‚Äôs say it took them 15 days, that‚Äôs 360h of investment to enjoy their favorite game in their spare time and they cannot because Blizzard fucked up big time.
---
The worst are people that blame the Horde, Horde are just the majority, same would happend to Horde if Alliance were the one on better end with 70% ratio.
---
Don‚Äôt blame the players, blame Blizzard for not taking action to fix this.
---
And stop saying rErOlL, because it‚Äôs a painful process because you already wasted so much time.
---
when u spammed enough "go to retail" while corpsecamping so they finally all went off
---
The whole situation is omega cringe. Surely Asmon left any scrap of dignity he may have had with this?
---
Lmao you dont think those are made *in response* to the overwhelming threads crying about horde? Like nice you found 3 threads out of the hundreds that alliance have made since p2 dropped.
---
Thats a Big feelsbadman dude, Thanks dude Im happy if i reach r10 :)
---
You sound like an instance, flight paths and capital cities camper who wants to guilt trip his competitors for rank and gain an edge.
---
Needs to be enchanted.
---
I don't do anything like that.  You are saying bg's should not be cross realm because of the toxic ones?  This punishes everyone.  Longer horde queues means more world pvp. Shorter ally queues means and even greater imbalance.  Things would get worse.  And you don't even have a reason besides to spite the toxic ones.
---
I like these posts... *"your server can't have an issue with horde dominating everything because my server is being dominated by alliance."* It's like saying that one county can't suffer from flooding because we have a drought.
---
Seriously... I'm becoming a broken record about this. 15 years we have known about what happens on PvP servers and how it leads to faction imbalance. Then we are surprised that thise things happen.
---
I love the guy who is telling me that APES are the single greatest PvPers on the earth and chose alliance so he must be right. But does not respond to my point that Alliance racials got buffed later on in the history of WoW. If Alliance was really OP would they go on and make them even more OP? Obviously not.
---
Oooh damn shifting the goalpost, didn't see that coming.

the power of 10 people actually willing to read the chat and take the flag is enough to beat 99% of warsong random grps
---
Mind you I just look at the posts that pop up in my feed but EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. since the pvp release is a Horde person saying that they're not the problem. How many more times am I going to see this same exact post? Lol
---
Note: I wouldn't care if they were posts complaining about the imbalance. It's just this always turns into a "I'm Horde and it's not my fault spiral"
---
thats the whole point of so called pvp servers... you choose to play on pvp servers to gank and be ganked...
---
if you want restricted fights in somewhat fair situations you roll on normal servers.
---
Alright, I think I will just unsub. It feels like im arguing with a child who fails to see that it happens on both sides, its just dumb.
---
Hybrids in classic have to go balls deep if they want to be competitive as pure classes.
---
Feral druids can compete on DPS and as MT or OT. They just need the player to go above &amp; beyond. If you don't wanna put in extra effort, don't bother with these hybrids outside their healing roles.
---
Blizzard bans in waves

Reading comprehension is tough.

&gt; 2:1 ratio

Glad to see one less player with the inability to rebut point by point around here.

Goodbye.

oh god, im a meme now too... Well atleast u fixed my post, with paragraphs and such!

doesnt have to be a race... just one decent player like this fearlina shadowpriest... i would follow that
---
I understood the title, but I'm not sure how some emotes, a whispered greeting followed by an ignore and then someone logging in and out repeatedly equals win trading. Could you explain it to me?
---
Just keep walking. Rogues are slower when stealthed
---
Its really weird, people blatantly went Horde en masse in Classic (as opposed to Alliance majority in Vanilla)  for the undeniably superior racials and are not trying to act like they didn't do it for the racials because....reasons?
---
Like holy shit we all know why you did it, you know why you did it, just fucking admit it. Its not that big of a fucking deal.
---
Still abit too long, honor has been out for how long? 4 weeks?
---
Kind of anecdotal. I've had blacklisted people kicked from pug raids, and those pug raids then filled just fine. Could be it was a bad time to raid, or too many competing pugs vying for members.
---
Yeah fuck these mages...Honestly. Just stahp...Then again here is the other side:
---
Meet me: a lvl 60 undead warrior on Flamelash. I have about 25 HK's to my name (and probably near 1000 PVP deaths levelling up) and had the best and - simultaneously - stressfull time levelling up this wholely useless, fucktard, gold-sink of a character. I'm a casual on the server gently getting BiS-gear for tanking and dps from dungeons and enjoying the rush of the possibility of being targeted by Alliance and enjoying the rush of possibly targeting Alliance. I do shit DPS and can't tanke for my life. I love it. I logged on today after a two week break. 
---
Saying the players caused this is true - the Horde apparently trumped the Alliance SO HARD that they decided en masse to leave the server. But that doesn't mean that Blizz shouldn't have intervened with something like, perhaps, a login queue for horde coupled with a horde-only transfer? Why the hell would you allow a character transfer for the Alliance? Of course they are going to take it to some server where they have the numbers in their favor. 
---
But no: here I am, a casual player who has done literally nothing to increase the stress on Alliance side. I spent an hour bent over a barrel at Light's Hope Chapel yesterday hoping to get stuck by an Alliance. Nothing. WPL? Nothing. Winterspring? Cold balls. Stuck on a PVP-server where no PVP is to be had, where the rush of world pvp is gone. I'm stuck on a fucking PVE server, a goddamn PVE server...Holy shit.
---
Retail has been like this for many years. People dont kill anyone and just run past each other on either side of the middle.
---
Sunk cost fallacy.
---
Just because a measurable amount of time was spent on an activity doesn't mean it's worth pursuing any further if it's no longer fun.
---
Alternate point of view - Time spent chasing video game goals can sometimes just be wasted time? Surprisedpikachu.gif
---
On the bottom right, you can see their level 1 female orc spy alt called ‚Äúlolzugspy‚Äù or some other name referencing this. What they do is wait till there isn‚Äôt many 60‚Äôs online and then camp Org. It‚Äôs a bunch of teens or nolifers camping Org whenever there is little resistance which is essentially all day.
---
It depends on what‚Äôs going on, on your server then. Most people probably were waiting to grind until bg‚Äôs dropped. World PvP grinding really never made any sense escpecially after blizzard announced the imminent drop of bg‚Äôs but since you were only playing 4-6 hours a day than it‚Äôs really no harm done. If no one hops on the grind than you may be alright. If many people do you‚Äôre probably screwed and will cap out around rank 10ish. 
---
It‚Äôs been over a decade but I believe I was grinding out 1.5mil + per weeks on a low pop server playing 12-14 hours a day. That‚Äôs a server that had like 300ish level 60‚Äôs or less. So I really can‚Äôt imagine how ridiculous the grind is gonna be on these mega pop servers. 
---
Particularly I will say, I personally can see myself playing 4-6 hours of bg‚Äôs a day 5 days a week out of boredom not even grinding. I could even see myself doing 4-6 hours of bg‚Äôs 2-3 days a week for the shits and giggles and then occasionally doing a full Saturday‚Äôs worth of AV for 12 hours straight. And this is just playing casually for fun not even trying to get rank. Now imagine if I playing at this low amount of time surpasses your honor gain and bracket spot that week. At higher rank like 12-13 you may actually lose an entire rank or be set back several weeks because of a casual doing that. It‚Äôs very unlikely someone would accidentally farm honor in world PvP at that frequency. But an extremely regular occurrence in bg‚Äôs. Which is why you have to intentionally grind constantly. I‚Äôd be absolutely shocked if you got rank 10 farming only 4-6 hours a day.
---
Nothing new here to see
---
Crying about horde when ally is nonstop ganking eastern plaguelands, undercity, and any connection route like youre angels
---
&gt;Save from a few misstargets once in a while
---
Are you mouseovering the characters/toons? Aren't you supposed to mouseover the party portraits instead?
---
Meanwhile all the Horde PVPers on German PVP servers sitting comfortably on their lopsided 4:1 H:A servers claiming they enjoy wPVP, while actually only enjoying their dominance through sheer numbers.
---
I played... I tried to play on Lucifron for 2 weeks when P2 hit and by now you've seen plenty of the shit that went down. Ally was forced to trans or quit the game. At least Horde on Heartstriker are not camped 24/7 on every.single.square.inch of the world, like Alliance on Lucifron. I encounter Horde gankers and roaming death squads fairly frequently and am optimistic that instant BG invites for Alliance will balance out wPVP immensely on HS.
---
They're just farming honor.  It is no different than killing an NPC.  These ones just fight back a little more.
---
I believe bracket 14 only exists if you have 168 pvp ranked players that week.
---
This is my opinion, but this only applies if the person ganking you does NOT get honor for the kill.
---
Yeah. I'm getting downvoted for calling it exactly like it is. Even if you were to argue Alliance racials are decent, Horde is not exactly hard mode like some of them seem to in a complex over...??? I picked Alliance because I like Alliance. I just wish people picked Alliance more because there aren't enough of us on most servers. But the private server assholes got what they wanted, a single sided game because I already quit until BWL comes out.
---
That's a good way of putting it. Sure, Horde's racials aren't better than ALL Alliance racials, but Horde does have the best ones and Alliance has the worst ones while they both have a few in the middle.
---
Incorrect. You would be been right had you said AB
---
I hope this will make people realize how flawed some aspects of vanilla were, and that changes are necessary for the PVP servers to survive.
---
I had to quit 2 days after phase 2. I was level 40 and couldn't do anything without getting ganked and grave camped. I really regret not rolling PvE... though I had a mostly fun PvP experience before phase 2.
---
Melee classes take more damage.
---
if 2h a week is a lot than this is probably not the right game for you
---
Thanks
---
Real life creates banks to rob and people to mug. Why work like a peasant?
---
Yeah, that's my point son. The game allows you to do this, but that doesn't magically absolve you from being a full-on asshole for doing it.
---
That's how it worked in Vanilla. It didn't kill the game.
---
I cannot for the life of me figure out what this means. The closest i can come to is that you don't know what posturing means.
---
Tbh, I'm not sure. But downranking doesnt make it cheaper (like a lot of casters). It's 5 rage across the board so might as well use the top rank.
---
And I understand while leveling gold is scarce, but if you want to tank effectively, always keep up to date on revenge and sunder.
---
You do you.
---
Pro tip for the future: 
---
If you can't decide on a name, have some obscenity in your name so you get to change it later. 
---
My warlock, Anuspounder, made it to 50 back in TBC before I had to change his name. Gave me months to come up with a cool, short name for him.
---
I don't really get the retail bit. What does that have to do with anything? Are you not allowed to play both?
---
Yes, but this put you into your own twink queue with players who also have exp turned off. Since the whole point of twinking is to beat up on undergeared levelers, this mode had no appeal to the twinks and was dead on arrival.
---
On current retail everyone just has heirlooms and leveling BGs are normalized so that everyone is as powerful as everyone else (like if you're level 11, the game temporarily converts you to level 19) and I don't think the no exp thing is in anymore.
---
Yours is caged up in a bank slot somewhere? That is straight up Jodi cruelty. delete it into the wild.
---
I play Horde on Incendius and can confirm that the Alliance is out there ganking and making life just as nostalgic as back in the original release. I have recently considered actually playing on Faerlina now as the queues have died down, and it sounds like the Alliance needs players.
---
Leveling shaman is a pain. You are never at danger, but it's slow and boring. 
---
The more totems you get, the more fun it becomes, but they only really shine in groups (grounding totem for example completely breaks some bosses).
---
Shaman gets more fun at 40 due to elemental mastery, but that's elemental spec, so nothing exciting to look for really
---
Luckily there is no competitive situation.   
---
You can deathball rank with 5-10players easily on a 45:55 server, because once you mopped the enemy you can keep going.
---
On a 95:5 server like Flamelash you can't do that, because you have waves upon waves of players piling up onto your small roving band of PvPers.
---
PvPing on a 40:60 server is totally possible and a lot of fun.
---
I mean, it could also be because they have better FP placement in pretty much every relevant area and their zeppelins are  both safer than the boats and have better routes. I'm sure at least a few picked Horde simply because the QoL that provides, without thinking about the racials being better.
---
What spec?
---
Is there any bonus to having 305+ wep skill to their 300 defense?
---
Hunters get their gear way faster than dps warriors in MC/Ony and through their class quest. Necklace from Ony's head is indeed a hunter bis but giving it to warriors is absolutely fair since they'll struggle to replace their pre-raid bis. Another point, hunters don't need %hit in neck as much as warriors do. 
---
After many many Ony runs, I'm still waiting for my necklace but I'm no way in a hurry.
---
I feel like this is what Blizzard meant when they said "you think you want it, but you don't".
---
Really? He can fuck off.
---
Lol no it isn't
---
Source for that data, because I don't believe you.
---
he had a premade lvl 1 just to message me, i could only imagine the horror of cross faction whispers
---
the problem is the need for tanks drastically goes down on lvl 60 and it's not rewarding to level as
---
if you level as a tank you need 3-4x the time others need to kill a mob, you will have highest rep costs and lowest money. then you get to 60 and notice you're one of the worst characters to farm with and on top of that the need of tanks goes from 1/5 of players to 3/40 so the only advantage you had is lost right there
---
Hi, Spells? Dual Wield ? One Hand ?:)
---
I'm always so surprised about the amount of furious people here.
---
wow deed
---
This makes me proud of my race. The master race and assholes of the alliance, the gnomes.
---
Ah thanks, that makes sense.
---
That's the problem with a two faction system. If the balance tips just a little too much, it just keeps ripping.
---
Hmm not worth it, go for hit crit wep. Sure the as is very nice but shred is your main damage. Especially when you powershift
---
AV. WSG will be ruined by non-stop premades for the first few weeks and without a time limit, I remember some games got really, really boring in vanilla. The BG I‚Äôm actually most looking forward to is AB, however. That remains, to this day, the best BG Blizzard have produced.
---
There's neckbeards on both sides of the aisle, the problem is that Horde racial passives incentivized the neckbeards to go there.
---
Experienced the same thing. I'm PvPing mostly in WPL in a 3-5men group. I had to take 2 week break and the organization of the alliance is off the charts. There is simply no honor to be had anymore if you dont group up as horde. 
---
Alliance PvP groups everywhere in 5-12men groups. 
---
I *love* the small scale PvP that it breeds.
---
My horde friend even heavily complained about getting camped so much recently.
---
Venoxis alliance really took the "organize, adapt and overcome" to heart and gives the horde a hard time as it should be.
---
Well, technically if they'd rolled Alliance they wouldn't be part of the problem
---
PvP= beating your opponents, knowing that someone on the other end of the game lost. This is an important portion of PvP fun. 
---
People need to realise that. You can't call people assholes for PvPing.
---
Sometimes people do griefy things, but as long as it is legal, we have to accept it. Simple as that.
---
He clears MC every week as a tank. He doesn't get boosted in Classic. The only place he gets boosted in is mythic raiding.
---
Priest +1 is an easy way to farm them
---
I was a big fan of Asmongold before classic. I enjoyed most of his content. However since classic came out, I just cant accept his behaviour. Blatant disregard of anything and everything he said before the release for the sake of progressing fast. The shitty stance on ninja looting and now this. I am sorry, but he is clearly not the person I was lead to believe he is. For months now I was disregarding some (non hatefull) comments that were pointing out issues with his attitude as haters (Which he has plenty that just shriek and cant write even the simplest argument), but now I am just dissapointed with him. I dont think I will watch him again.
---
Dropping crippling vs any kind of warrior is a suicide
---
Oh wow seriously? I only play a druid, why do some mages keep trying to poly me if it says immune? I figured it said resist which is why they keep trying.

https://reddit.com/r/BlaumeuxClassic/comments/e1x7z4/so_long_server_we_goin_to_better_place_id_like_to/
---
so yeah, thats how it works on Blaumeux. Those people / guilds listed are barred from a lot of other Horde guilds
---
True, but on the other hand, the pvp honor system is widely regarded as the worst system in wow vanilla and while reworking that to a better system would have drawn the ire of the #nochanges people, in the end I think most people would have appreciated changes to this system.
---
Damn those from lucifron
---
No problem!
---
&gt; I spent an hour bent over a barrel at Light's Hope Chapel yesterday hoping to get stuck by an Alliance.

Lmfao. don't forget the knee pads
---
What's up dude! It's so upsetting, I've just got 60 and want to keep playing but have almost no motivation. Logged on last night in the IF repair shop next to the bank and instantly got stunlocked and killed by a rogue
---
It's sweet you took time off from sucking his cock to come and leave a reply to me.
---
&gt;Just because they kill someone that is not worth honour does not mean they aren't there for honour.
---
I'm just going to leave you with that, because of how dumb it sounds when you actually say it out loud.
---
Druids should spec into moonglow / healing touch mana reduction if you have a number of druids in your raid.  Priests suffer similar issues when stacks with weakened soul / renew, so don't sweat it.  Purists will say "reee two druids per raid" but that wastes a lot of drops.
---
They won't. Premades will farm way faster than you and they will also play more. You have 0 chance of reaching above 11 with your current playtime. Not being a dick, just trying to make you see reality.
---
Ranking is about time spent, nothing else. And you're spending very little time compared to the rest.
---
Having nightmarish problems? step one, roll horde, step two, play pve.  
---
Are you surprised?
---
I think its more apt to call gankers unempathic. I do think empathy in general is on the decline globally, as political and economic situations become tenser, people tend to look to their own needs and less so the needs and desires of others.
---
Many word make head hurt! Durr, me smash!
---
The examples you provide are illegal.
---
And yes, if the game allows it and it does not violate the EULA people can do it as they please.
---
There are no rules in WPvP, it is kill or be killed, anyway possible. It does not matter if you like it or not, that's the way it is.
---
I only have one rule: Don't kill gray targets. But that's my personal opinion and in no way something anyone should abide with.
---
I play in a Horde dominated server but that does not prevent us from fighting back. We make kill squads (squads, not raids) of our own and we roam around, killing anything red. We expect to run in a Horde raid every now and then, we die, we try to dodge the campers, relocate and repeat. Improvise, adapt, overcome.
---
Cheers for sharing, and for the work you and your mod peers put in here. It's quite a heavy barrel to roll. 
---
I think it's safe to agree with the "all of the above" part, my observations from early fall (\~2-3 weeks after Classic release) when I started browsing was that the tone was overall quite positive, but already then there were complaints where some people were outraged over that dungeons and raids were too easy, and some complained about the difficulty of leveling up. Layers were brought up as a useful feature, but with potentially drastic effects on long-term realm economy, and possibly some population issues. Daily question thread (that's a really good concept, too) was bustling with activity. 
---
Next up was the complaint of content being released too fast or slow, depending on which side you stood on, with some decent positive posts and discussions going on on the side. Hysteria about the upcoming honor release started spreading. 
---
Que up P2 release and removal of layering and we land where we are now: Very strongly polarized discussions about PvP, the dying of Flamelash and how Blizzard and this faction or that faction (mostly "this" faction lately) ruined the game. Up until this point, I don't think the discussions on this subreddit had very much to do with any mentionable loss of subscriptions, but since the onset of P2 it's rather clear that the subreddit activity reflects peoples' in-game experience, as well as part of them leaving the game, I'd assume. We can hope that tomorrow brings some relief to the warzone that is pretty much every (PvP) realm, and that this is reflected in the posts here as well. 
---
Between the overwhelming number of PvP posts, repetitive memes and the fact that the game is 15 years old and dissected and theorycrafted down to the pin, it's not easy to create posts which catch peoples' interests and give rise to good discussion. Browsing the top posts from the past week highlights how subjective this all is, as the vast majority are either memes or videos related to wPvP (or the kind taking place within IF), one scenic screenshot and about 0 posts where something else is discussed. All in all, the people on this subreddit are a difficult crowd to please and we love to complain.
---
I'm pretty sure it's coming on the 10th. [Sauce](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1202226067739742208)

What's funny is Horde get all horny and swell with their "Honor for the horde" and "Mak'gora", yet they're pretty happy to join in a zergfest in any given chance.

Ahh yes, the tried and true ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make a game shit so you stop paying $15 a month to me because one of our devs said something stupid one time in a Q and A and we want to make sure he feels like he‚Äôs correct‚Äù.
---
200IQ businessing right here.
---
Sappers werent a thing in vanilla AV. You clearly werent around back then if you think a random 40 raid could have that much coordination and used consumables that werent health pots.
---
Old av had insane health on all npcs - there were no way for melees to so much against them except for some cheese with rogues. 
---
I'd say its more private servers or people who werent around glorifying it when it was clearly shit.
---
Now yes, later no. Warriors end on top with naxx tier, no question.
---
at lvl 25 you probably don't have the relevant talents yet but frost spec enhances your frostbolts while doing nothing to your firebolts so they will surpass them eventually
---
HEY GUYS I FOUND THE ONE SERVER WHERE HORDE DON'T DOMINATE HAHAHA YOU'RE ALL WRONG
---
You get what you tucking deserve
---
Fun fact, this is mostly where I got my name from. I was 9 and thought I was saving my account :)
---
Like that would fucking matter on a PvE server? It's a contested zone..
---
Gehennas for the Swedish coalition. But every realm has a large nordic presence (there's nothing to do but nolife games this time of year).
---
Personally I'm on Noggenfogger, and altough the server is very mixed, nordic people are everywhere.
---
I think I read somewhere that true full screen is no longer a thing due to the new direct x version.
---
Yea, a stupid example.
---
If you're a level 1 and you're clearly flagging for the sake of flagging, of course you're going to die.
---
That's what I thought when I saw him say it.  
---
Actually been waiting for the Devs to troll us all with an "O K B OO MER" from Rend.
---
Well you lined it out in your first line.. The bosses are a majority of the profit. Switch to another spec and use swords to kill them and open relic coffers.
---
Yeah the whole 'ban wave' excuse is piss poor when you consider that the timeframe for the ban wave is seemingly longer than an entire portion of a phase
---
Thats pretty funny
---
It's not fanboy logic moron. Ice Poseidon was a piece of shit exploiting people in real life and has a long history of being piece of shit. Asmongold ninjas items in a video game and has a smug persona behind a webcam for stream entertainment playing a video game. tOtAlLy CoMpArAbLe
---
&gt; This all hinges on fairly quick queues for Horde in BG's though. If the Horde have long queue waits things may not get any better and may honestly get worse.
---
I know there will be cross server battlegroups for this very reason but shouldn't there be some kind of punishment/disadvantage for everyone going horde by having longer queue times? 
---
____________________________________________________
---
I would imagine long queue times for horde only due to mass imbalance would result in:
---
1) People quitting cause of long queue times for Horde
---
or
---
2) People rerolling alliance for better queues thus helping balance the game out
---
________________________________________________
---
I think its just kinda silly to barely take care of the faction imbalance issue with these free transfers (which lets be honest didn't do anything to solve the problem) when the real solution should be punishing people for rolling horde across the board. I know most people like the Horde racials, or looks, or their layout across the world but if they truly care about the health of this game then they need to take a hard look at balancing this game out because faction imbalance will lead to a slow and prolonged death that can be avoided.

Zandalar tribe
---
After reading all the panic behind Flamelash, i decided to move over to earthshaker for a more balanced environment.  My first night on the server was just how i remember playing wow back in the day.  Love this stuff ! These guys have definitely made my KOS list and i look forward to bumping into these fuckers again !
---
And getting to Naxx is pretty tryhard itself.
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with with sunk cost. I already spend x hours is very different than I don't want to spend x hours on a new character to be breakeven. Getting upset because you lost all progress is not a sunk cost fallacy. And no its not a wasted time if you enjoyed playing a game.
---
People using sunk cost, dunning kruger effect and quantum superpositioning without having a single clue what they are giving me cancer.
---
30-39. The most utility any class can get before mounts are introduced. Makes things like ghost wolf, travel form and sprint much more impactful
---
You need to stop looking at it this deep, that people are killing others to be toxic. They are only camping these places because there is so much competition for honor, and they want it, just like everyone else. 
---
You dont get any +honor for being a morally good player and dont camp these places, the people that camp these places are the ones with the most honor probably, which is why they are doing it.
---
40-49 was always my favorate as well, although the one time I made a twink in the past it was in the 20-29 bracket which was a lot of fun as well
---
I always knew I was different.
---
Vael won't destroy any guilds in classic. Vael is a classic dps and healing gatekeeper boss and will fall easily to the dps values we see in classic.
---
Heck, top guilds in current gear would even be able to beat Patchwerk already.
---
Because everyone is in IF?
---
If they do, they are 100% making a pvp movie.
---
&gt; Back in vanilla they would premban you for something as severe as this
---
I don't think so. I recall people thinking it wasn't even cheating. Never heard of anyone being permanently banned for something like this.
---
the only real problems I had with classic so far where without exception, changes made by blizzard
---
man as if the no changes crowd was up to something....
---
You wouldn‚Äôt know that from a lot of the posts on this subreddit though. It‚Äôs always specifically targeting Horde as opposed to targeting whoever controls a realm. I‚Äôve seen a lot of comments from people saying Alliance just want to play honorably and Horde ruin it.
---
Have something similar going on as my main name is still Jed since Vanilla, but never really got to experience the higher level dungeons back then. Now everbody is out and about trying to kill this Jed guy
---
This comment is funny as fuck.

You tryin to drive your market price up aren‚Äôt you yoy sneaky mf üòâüëçüèΩü§òüèº
---
Green Lens isn't pre-raid BiS. You can get a +40 "...of Shadow Wrath" helm which is better for PvE.
---
It's still a really good tip because Green Lens is amazing until (and even at) level 60. It is one of the better pre-raid options, but it's not pre-raid BiS.
---
Also, pre-raid BiS is the same as just plain BiS for spriests. MC/Ony doesn't offer any better PvE options.
---
The horde and alliance are both guilty here.  On Grobbulus go to Gadgetzan and you'll have a taste of some alliance "assholes". Go outside of UC, LHC, etc if you need more.
---
The horde and alliance are both guilty here.
---
You know, there's a key to hide your UI so you dont have to paint 20 black squares on your screenshot.
---
You should definitely drop enchanting now and pick up herb or mining. It's not a profitable profession for 99% of players, and if you take time to level herb or mining (skinning is ok, but you have to kill stuff to make money instead of finding gold lying on the ground) now to a reasonable level, you can continue to level the profession and make profit as you level. It's a "do now and be efficient, or do later and spend extra time" thing.
---
From lvl 32-40 you can almost certainly afford your mount if you start saving now, at worst you'll spend some gold or level quickly (groups or such) and will take another level or two to have enough, which is no big deal. I didn't bother getting a mount until lvl 48.
---
Whats your played? :d
---
It will be 2morrow. Currently thou its 25%.
---
If the population cap was the same as vanilla it wouldn't be so bad.
---
I played on a unbalanced pvp server, on the minority faction, during vanilla and it wasn't that bad.
---
We could go around and do our own thing. Because they weren't everywhere.
---
But with this much bigger population there isn't anywhere to go.
---
You'd let it get hit over and over again to protect your pathetic ass while a healer is preventing it from dying, thus confining this poor doggo in a perpetual circle of suffering?
---
You monster!
---
Source is anybody you talk to on HS discord on alliance is a transfer from Stalagg or Skeram lol..  There's not transfer stats here..
---
I can only speak for myself. I've been playing fallout 76 a ton and am way more excited for the patch this week in that game than wow.
---
That should tell you all you need to know about how phase 2 completely ruined classic wow
---
To me it is totally fine unless they corpsecamp you 5+ times and follow you around.
---
They just Play the game. The newest update is the PVP System so why not Play the current game?!
---
Just because you in this Situation can't defend yourself... 
---
When you are in a Group of 20 People you will do the same.
---
That doesn't make you an asshole.
---
I find it very mean to call them all assholes because most of them are very nice People that are doing what they have to do to Progress and not because they love ruining other peoples day.
---
I guess this is a matter of opinion
---
have you read the tooltip?
---
Can't speak for Progress but APES have played both Horde and Alliance on pservers. They chose to go Alliance on Classic mostly because they prefer playing the underdog and for shorter queue times. They're at a skill level where the small advantage one faction has over the other won't really matter as they'll just stomp everyone regardless.
---
There's a user in the subreddit's Discord who used to play with APES. I used to think Pallies were better until I started speaking with hardcore pserver PvPers.
---
r/advertiseshadowpriest
---
You can farm without killing honorless targets.  We get ur point but its not what this discussion is about.  This is about wpvp assholes.  Not efficient pvpers.
---
Wouldn't work because the already level 60s on the dominant faction would just camp the lvl 10s, 20s, etc even with the boost.
---
It was toxic from the start with Blaumeux tbh.
---
the mechanic goes like this: every dot has a power number assigned to it, you can only overwrite dots with other dots that have equal or higher power number
---
when agony ticks it increases it's power number by 1 and decreases the time to next tick
---
1 of u get mining and the other herbalism. 
---
Do 2man dm east jump runs.
---
Out of curiosity are you fury/prot and dual wielding the majority of the time but just not on Rag due to the dmg or deep prot and dual wielding on geddon but put shield on for shield slams and unequip for more dmg/rage?  I'm usually OTing with the exception of Rag and I have been trying to see if I parse better(on random fights I don't tank) by microing shield on/off for shield slams and offhand dmg inbetween the shield slam CD.
---
This is simply because there is one PvP server in both EU and US regions that are massively Alliance dominated. Most of the other servers are similarly Horde dominated though.
---
Essence of air should rise in price once the agi enchant comes.

Most likely it is stating Dec 10th due to blizzard HQ being in the US but it may be the 11th in Europe by then?
---
I don‚Äôt think you know what definition of furious is ;)
---
Furious - extremely angry
---
To top it all off I am playing Alliance on Firemaw, so this situation of Flamelash doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with me,  I am just giving my opinion.
---
I apologize for using dota and commas as they are supposed to be used and that it makes you think that I am aNgRy.
---
Cool , now go get a job lol
---
The people trying to make it look like the horde situation on Heartseeker is comparable to the situation going on in skeram or stalag are laughable. 
---
Half the time horde can control major areas
---
Runecloth, flurry axe is on the drop table too
---
Weird. I am in ashbringer too, and j get ganked by hordes of 60lvl hordes all the time, while i am 54 :(
---
Yeah it's a really shitty situation, let's hope the release of battlegrounds can fix it at least somewhat.
---
But honor is calculated WEEKLY, so you're not competing against bgs, you're competing against other ganking teams
---
Ofc it is. 
---
Most people only ‚Äúreview‚Äù sth if they had a negative experience 
---
This sub is the same
---
You need 5-8 hours to get 20 and open pvp isn't part of the game before \~20. There's no real benefit
---
"My GF made this *just above mediocre drawing*, but is too shy to post here, so I'm doing it for her. Hope you guys enjoy!"
---
Yeah I might keep tailoring and pick up mining/herb.  Thinking about it now, I don't think I could be bothered with standing in a city trying to sell enchants at 60 anyway, I'd prefer to be out doing something - so I guess it's not for me.
---
Totality.
---
Will be filled ONCE BGS OPEN.
---
Right now it's being filled by efficient hammers, who will be higher rank when bgs actually open
---
It's also suitable for Twolls
---
What do you mean by saying "leaving one mega server for other won't change anything"? You are not on mega server dude, you are on a dead server. Im not quite sure why are you trying to fix Blizzard's mistakes :)
---
What a sad response. Most people are raid logging now because there isn't much to do outside of stuff that nobody cares about like grind Timbermaw rep. The problem with Classic is that there is no raid progression when you clear the raid within a week or two and then have it on farm every week for months until the next raid comes out. With battlegrounds that will change for a few weeks but most will get sick of doing them after that if they aren't chasing the highest ranks.
---
Idk about 15% Alliance on Stalagg, I run into plenty of them roaming BS, BRM, SG, and around Kargath. Obviously they are still very much outnumbered, but we aren't exactly at Flamelash levels here lol
---
I even get scared of stealthed pantheras ... Even from stealth friendly pets in sw.. this sound...
---
Agreed. But weapons are the most important thing for melee classes. Rogue with R14 2,90 speed sword? Hell yes. 2.00 speed main dagger? Hell yes. Backstabs numbers on that thing are bonkers since all other daggers are 1,6 or 1,8 mostly
---
You want slow weapon in MH in 95% of cases.
---
I don‚Äôt think you will
---
‚ÄúI will leave this country if candidate x,y,z is elected!‚Äù
---
Well might be true but at least it's entertaining
---
Anyone care to explain what i watched for a noob?
---
So you're saying you *should* transfer off? Why would anyone want to play on a server that's not fun to play on? Sounds like everyone left should either straight quit or leave
---
I literally logged in at 2am to try and do something today and literally as I loaded in, I was ambushed by a 60 horde rogue in the gadgetzan inn and killed. I just logged back out. I feel like I've put in a lot of effort despite the constant death squads but I just can't do it anymore.
---
Nothing about having your time completely wasted equates to difficulty. Just tedium.

---
I have felt your pain a lot but I think the problem is boredom. It‚Äôs a combination of overpopulation and not enough to do. I think BG will help to some extent. I also support classic plus because part of the classic experience was trial and error against raid bosses trying to find workable strategies and that is going to continue to be missing going forward, it took a lot of time and manpower to do it.
---
Except significantly less were clearing MC and raiding in general.
---
Criticism of Horde make me sad
---
Horde majority subreddit is Alliance biased
---
The only two things I play are the victim and WoW
---
This happened on my server like a week ago. Elemental fire scaled up to 8g each two weeks ago. So everyone thought ‚Äúdamn, i need to over-farm these fires‚Äù this ended up in tons of people farming, and saving elemental fires for the MC reset.
---
When Tuesday came, everyone had elemental fire, and few people were buying, plus everyone was competing for selling so price went down quickly.
---
Wow is a perfect example of supply and demand effects.
---
Ok so i can go beat and rob Homeless people IRL? I mean i need money to progress in life and nobody will stop me.
---
Do you think this was intended design or? Pretty neat tho, thanks for sharing :D

So this is your post
---
&gt;You are saying as if it‚Äôs just REROLL LOL

What does reroll mean? Also holy shit maybe check your blood pressure you need to calm down

Oh. I‚Äôm in ascent and wasn‚Äôt aware. I‚Äôll GQuit next time I log on.

Who cares about any of these idiots?

Rank 10 pvp gear matters you dumb ass and just Cous they won‚Äôt get 14 doesn‚Äôt meant they can‚Äôt try and be competitive
---
Literally applying salt to the wounds of the 80% alliance crowd here on reddit. This will prob never be upvoted.
---
Defense is only valuable because it provides dodge. There is no way to get def cap that doesn't ruin every other aspect of your character. You need 25 defense to equal 1 dodge, so you should generally only think of defense on an item as a small bonus. There is no item in the game in which the defense stat is the deciding factor for a druid.
---
The go-to source on all things feral-tank is [Taladril's treatise on druid tanking in vanilla.](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/) That also has a guide on itemization, as well as a decent spreadsheet on gearing druids.
---
There have been many times in history where following the rules was far from ethical. COUGH slavery COUGH
---
They probably do , but if the server is really that empty, killing alliance in IF might be their only option if they don't want to lose total honor. 
---
(playing devil's advocate here, I know)
---
In our guild, the epic materials are provided by the guild bank (Sulfuron Ingot/Elementium Ore). The remaining materials have to be gathered by the player (any raider can obtain materials that the guild bank has, such as Lava/Fire Cores, Essence of Fire etc at 50% of the AH value to craft items, so that's how you can also easily get those). I'm one of the tanks going for TF and I've gathered 80/100 Arcanite so far by myself.
---
Gerade wenn man von Lucifron kommt sollte man wissen wie sich das anf√ºhlt. Deshalb campe ich keine Leichen und greife insgesamt keine hordler an. 1. weil mich die R√§nge nicht interessieren und 2. weil ich ihnen das Spielergebnis nicht noch schwieriger machen will. Und ich kenne einige Leute die so denken 
---
Ich hoffe mit den bgs habt ihr etwas mehr Ruhe, ich dr√ºcke die Daumen!
---
Im happy you pointed it out.
---
Its exactly what it means. If you are getting TF, but can't bother to get the best items for it, then you are a casual and bad player.
---
Gl clearing the game if your guild got that mentality. You will be stuck somewhere in the middle of AQ40.
---
Bows don‚Äôt fire bullets silly.
---
The best solution would be that Pre-Mades can only play other Pre-mades. So if you group up with a party of 10 you can only be drawn against opposition that did the same.
---
rp-pvp server would be my server of choice
---
my region didn't get an rp server at launch, didn't get one with the first server wave and then got one single rp-pve server in the last wave....
---
AV will have 40 man premades.. and more premades than WSG I bet.
---
There was a big thread describing this situation recently and it should be pinned at the top of this sub for the next month. Really useful.
---
Brilliant, literally changes everything
---
Look at all these salty virtue signallers haha. Pretty hypocritical hating on Asman for having a toxic community
---
I think it's all related to players' age. I think the players' average is bigger than 15 years ago.   When you are younger you are more inclined to fairy tales, when you are fat and balding you identify with the horde better.
---
Kinda how that one infamous sub started out as a joke but actually turned into a rabid group of people who unironically believed in and supported Commander Cheetoh.
---
&gt; But isnt part of the idea of WoW that the 2 factions are fighting each other?
---
Lorewise at least during Vanilla it was mostly skirmishes in the border regions. Completely different from what's currently going on at PvP servers.
---
As a new player I really wouldn't go on a PvP server unless you REALLY want the hardcore PvP we currently have. And if you do, I suggest to get on well balanced server. Preferably on the bigger side.
---
And even on a PvE server you can still get PvP. For example by joining a raid on the enemy city and of course as soon as BG's come out which IMHO are much more fun and challenging anyway.
---
Or it spirals into ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alliance and only horde do this and it‚Äôs only their fault‚Äù
---
PvP rank 13, Ahn'Quiraj (a raid that's not due for another few phases) and PvE tier 1 or 2 gear, acquired from Molten core, onyxia and later on Blackwing lair (early 2020 according to blizzard).
---
Appriciate your respons, i Will aim for rank 10 Atleast and see How it goes after that now that holidays are approaching, now for the other question, should i aim for a premade Or just roll solo and enjoy the AV's while still farming good honor per hour ?
---
really cool because you can line up your next target long before the one youre attacking is dead. can't believe I never noticed this before.
---
Which doesnt matter because rank points are based on your placement that week.
---
You wont get enough points to progress to ranks 11-14 unless you have a premade.
---
No premade = 11-14 are out of your grasp.
---
Anyone doing this grinding with out a premade ready to go when bgs release is just wasting their time and destroying their own server for nothing.
---
Jesus fuck do you people not understand numbers or whats up ?
---
I think he meant personal private servers. You can download from torrent fully configured and well enough scripted vanilla pserver and just practice stuff with friends. It's the same files that all the public mega pservers we setup on.
---
On lucifron EU he was called 'Blizzard'. Exact Same message
---
Rxx refers to gear you can aquire at different PvP ranks. In your example it would mean the gear that becomes available when you are Rank 13. 
---
AQ is Ahn Qiraj, a Raid that will come out in Phase 6 (correct me if im wrong here). 
---
T(ier) 1, 2, 3 are different armor sets that are available in different raid tiers. Right now we have Tier 1 from MC, and some items from Tier 2 (Ragnaros and Onyxia). The other Tier 2 items will become available in later phases,  as well as Tier 3.
---
Dire Maul came out on Tuesday in Europe as well. So I guess it will be tomorrow.
---
make a new world channel with blackjack and hookers?
---
R12-R14 is the epic gear from reaching the highest 3 pvp ranks. R14 only has weapons. R12-13 has armor items. 
---
Also there are the blue gear rewards that are obtainable at ranks 7,8,10
---
AQ gear is the gear from Ahn Quiraj instances at Silithus which comes in a late phase. 
---
T1-3 are the tier gear you obtain from Molten Core - t1
---
Blackwing Lair - t2
---
Naxxramas - t3
---
Yeah not sure what the drop rate is but it's pretty low! Probably best to get it from AH if you haven't found it by the time you want to leave Barrens.
---
If they rolled alliance they wouldnt be part of the problem because theyd be unable to be part of the problem. Given the opportunity though...
---
Taxic here, we have guilt admitted by some of the parties involved both in game and the server disc. Even if bliz takes no action, horde an alliance will take needed measures. Both factions legit pvp peeps are in agreemant this is bullshit, and are more or less working together.
---
Appriciate ur honesty :)
---
Which is defined by the amount of honor you gain.
---
Come on man, either your trolling or have absolutely no idea how the pvp system works.
---
I actually never did dme jumps on my fury but I ran strats for days, probably 250 orbs total.  And investments, etc
---
how do I know which servers are balanced? (Im in EU)
---
I've been slapped down repeatedly for pointing out the same on Golemagg.  Kargath to Thorium Point and Felwood you've got the same Alliance mobs corpsecamping constantly, and they run a mile once the Horde 60s appear.  I've started up retail again to get BFA flying for a few weeks 'til BGs start and it becomes fairer.
---
Lorewise it is mostly small skirmishes at contested areas like Ashenvale, Arathi or Hillsbrad.
---
R E P O S T and garbage meme. Delete pls üòä
---
R13 refers to PvP Rank 13, a part of the honour system which allows you to unlock certain things as your individual pvp rank increases such as gear, weapons, tabards, titles and mounts.
---
AQ refers to a raid (which i can never spell correctly) that comes after Blackwing Lair and before Naxxramas 
---
And T1/2/3 gear refers to Tier 1/2/3. Each major wave of raid content includes a ful set of gear for every individual class. Tier 1 is Molten Core, tier 2 is BWL and then T3 is naxxramas.
---
Why should it be worthless? They ranked up until Rank 8 and can switch to BGs now.
---
No. Idiot.
---
+ T2,5 from AQ40
---
Hi Mate,
---
You should gear Tanks :) However it's important.. to find out whether your tanks know what gear they want.. 
---
E.g. you can raid  MC quite successfully with Warrior 8/8 T1 - DPS warriors will not need on that Tier gear anyway - so you have weapons/jewelry left 
---
You can give tank Head from Onyxia to take neck, and give him Band of Accuria and be done with any "prio"for tanks.
---
It's easier then you think :) 
---
"Problem" is when Tanks want to have prio on  Onslaught Girdle or Brutality Blade- you might want to put them back in line :D
---
I get that camping flight paths is pretty lame, as well as camping capitals, and that both of them should have better NPC guarding.
---
But what's wrong with camping instances? Isn't that pretty close to what the purpose of PvP is? You take control of an area and the opposing faction has to fight for it. I don't get the justification for whining about that.
---
Reroll = Starting from Level 1  
---
Transfer is a paid service and it costs 25e, maybe actually know features of WoW? Or you didn't have these on Private server you came from?  
---
I am perfectly calm, I think you should get some education and learn how to read lol.  
---
And in context I used that "You are saying as if it‚Äôs just REROLL LOL" is an answer to OP's "Go and Reroll", so I mocked his approach to the situation, I apologize for you not being able to understand.
---
A lot of people came to classic to experience vanilla raids as it were on 60, so there will be steady drops in between raids and a lot of people coming for new raids released. After naxx release it will downfall, then depends on TBC announcement.
---
This whole saga just gets better lol
---
Who needs TV!
---
Awesome dude! Thanks for the time helping me out with some questions 
---
Im horde btw :)
---
Yeah....but I'm cheap.  I absolutely resent paying for something I can grind, even if I can make more money questing.
---
I don't know much about raid level tanking, but why don't you try the dw fury tanking spec?
---
That way you can swap gear according to the situation and do your job.
---
You basically use the same bis weapons as humans and orcs. You just have the option of choosing from either list.
---
Ive been playing on Zalandar tribe EU so far, RP PVP,because I want funny interactions between people. Most of the population things seem to suggest pretty good balance, but other people are saying heavily alliance favored, and I dont know what to believe
---
Ethical objection? How is it your prerogative to control how other people have fun? Who is getting harmed by his actions?? All I see are snowflakes crying about internet trolling and fun entertaining shinannigans hosted by a sloth in his parents attic. You might as well cry about someone spawn camping you in pvp. But you're prolly ok with it because it's within the rules.
---
Just go fury dual wield tank in my experience a off tank really doesn't need a lot of medigation (although you always should have a shield on you)
---
Yeah because we should rank up by having honorable 1v1 duels only. That would totally work.
---
what? The dragonling doesnt require goblin. does it? Are we talking about that superexpensive arcanite dragonling?
---
Long queue times will result in Horde queuing in the capital, flying to a zone of choice, and camping their until the queue has ended.
---
The longer the queue time, the more incentivised they are to do this.
---
Though those would be dishonourable kills I think so only shit tired level griefers would do that.
---
Literally the same screenshot, how lazy :')
---
&gt; That‚Äôs two meme specs. Congrats.
---
by that logic anything but a warrior dps is a meme spec.
---
I don't think that calling you names has anything to do with me being mad or not, I just feel like calling you names because I'm an asshole and it's a simple concept.  
---
It's not the same because as I said you haven't read what I wrote up but yet again you come here thinking you are an intellectual or something.  
---
So it is different simply because transfering means you are continuing on level 60 character, while rerolling means you are starting on level 1, and whole point of my message up was that people do not want to REROLL, they'd probably be interested in transfering, so if you go to my first comment and actually read it you might understand what I wanted to say, but highly questionable to say the least because you've just shown your malicious intent since you actually do not even know what I initially wrote, grats buddy.  
---
Here, take a clap. /clap  
---
I'll write it again for you so maybe after reading it twice you can take information and process it.  
---
Rerolling = Starting from level 1  
---
Transfering = You move your level 60 character to better server than Flamelash and enjoy the game at your terms.  
---
Whole point of my initial response up to OP was that people DO NOT WANT to reroll because it's a boring process!  
---
Cheers love, hopefully you can maybe understand now, if not let me know, maybe I can chew it down even more for you!
---
Because most people are looking for a guaranteed win not facing people who have a chance at beating them - that‚Äôs why they prefer to head to stv and corpse camp mid 30-40‚Äôs trying to turn quests in at nesingwarys camp.
---
Afaik there is no way to dismiss your totems other than outanging or replacing them.
---
Can you post gear &amp; buffs used ? I need to try this too :)
---
but but but my hOnoR pOiNtS
---
She is a *huge* pill poppin junkie now; everyone comments on why she is always smiling, its due to the fact she is always high out of her mind lols
---
Woudn't really fix anything and really does not feel   good gameplay wise
---
Decided to head out and do some mining on my Paladin alt earlier.
---
Bubble HS and spamming laugh made me happy at least.
---
HS
---
You can get into sfk at 10.
---
Yes because getting HK's and enslaving other humans are much the same thing! /s
---
"Not really more than 3 or 4 weeks at the most" when it takes began 150-250 hours on average to hit level 60, that's a lot of hours you're just casually telling him to give up.
---
4th Angerforge kill netted me HoJ. Call me lucky.
---
34 arena runs and not even seen Gorosh spawn yet... call me unlucky?
---
you cant fix imbalance
---
Wrong place at the wrong time. Gadgeztan is a huge PvP hub. I have allied running around killing people, some times the opposite faction is controlling the city. Mages blinking around avoiding guards and killing enemies.
---
I'm leveling an alt at the moment. Almost never got killed in Tanaris, died 4-5 times in Searing Gorge. Sometimes I can fight enemies, sometimes I join in on killing enemies with 60's. It's all part of being on a PvP server and I think you either enjoy that or not. If you don't, you really shouldn't have picked a PvP server, as the intention of it is to be able to kill all enemy players, no matter their level or location.
---
Btw tab is supposed to be ''target nearest ennemy'' so why does it swap to mobs 40meters away ?
---
Im not talking about those 15, all of them means the Whole Toxic ninja looting ppl that just annoy all non fans with their fake drama in game and actually starting to ninja and act like selfish dushs, themselfs, just because their idol star said them it‚Äôs fine
---
wtf is this shit lmao
---
you dont need to worry about it at all. It cost like 40g or something at revered. Cheap as fuck. easiest attunement ever.
---
It's an RPG, literally how much time we've invested is the entire point.
---
So not fun when not zerging with other 40 ppl ? (You chose undead for pvp racial so no emapthy here ) .
---
Exactly.
---
I play im a server 85% horde dominated, is doom, ist shit, is hell, in my opinion, the problem is not alliance or horde, the truly problem is Blizzard and i say this because they have BETAS and ALPHAS to realize how much imbalamces servers can be and also because they could see how servers was growing and so, they have forecast enough to controll all of this but they never do... So the problems come later when no one put solutions to the To the circumstances that are obvious from the beginning and i guess they dont do it for money, now you just pay your month then, they open pve server, then maybe you pay your transfer to pve server...
---
Yeah I could do that, but I heard you need a bit better "tanking" gear - raid pieces, for that to work. I only have shoulders of might, other pieces are prebis. If somebody can confirm I could do that now with thrash + mirahs song with other prebis pieces then great, I'll try that...
---
I'm not exactly sure. The ones I've encountered where fully decked out lvl 19 twinks with enchants and everything. They managed to kill the lvl 28 quest giver without much problems. They would completely destroy everyone who even tried to attack them and was in the same level range. They also had their 60's parked there to join if a lone high level player would try to punish them.
---
Quite a bunch of overly dedicated wankers.
---
Could we instead make it the other way around so you instantly ding 60 instead of 50? :D
---
&gt; Rerolling and transferring are effectively the same thing 
---
Well that's a fucking retarded statement.
---
Basically the "phasing" was always there, even in vanilla, but it was much smoother and didn't really notice it then except in really bad cases. Nowdays it feels way more jarring and noticeable, but why that is, due to lag or bad servers or simply a remnant of how the world is set up (e.g a legion glitch) I cannot say.
---
I know a plenty of servers where this rule is enabled even now.
---
If you don‚Äôt powershift you will be nearly worthless. To make feral dps work you need to go absolute balls to the wall sweaty tryhard.
---
Yeah that's what I thought. I mean, last week in the same spec, I was handling adds when needed on certain bosses, but also I was like 3rd lowest DPS to 2 other (fury) warriors... I now have a bit better gear this week.
---
Sadly you're not one of those people who unsubbed here.
---
Also the way leeway works on classic. Backpedaling is useful in a lot more situations just because you can avoid a lot of damage. 
---
Strafing or turning around and running will allow you to be hit you from much further. Backpedaling will not allow them to have leeway.
---
Unless there is a massive increase in weapon DPS, you want the slower weapon in MH because abilities revolve around the raw damage of your MH weapon. I'm mostly speaking from an arms perspective, but iirc whirlwind/cleave/heroic strike etc. all do weapon damage + bonus damage. If your faster weapon has significantly more DPS (not sure on what number/percent difference you'd be looking for), you will likely eventually benefit from the increased hit% you get for MH swings.
---
you won't get to rank 10 by camping flight paths.
---
**11/11 &lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Shazzrah Server, Horde | Casual but serious raiding guild.     
---
**Introduction**  "Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, you only have to attend one (read our guild-info for some extra rules concerning availability).   
---
We are clearing MC with 2 raid groups each week and are looking for a few extra to get our 3rd one going!  
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days are Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot is distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
The amount of "Hur dur, PVP on a PVP server?" going on here is immense.
---
This was implemented in legion and is the only good part of classic using Legion's garbage tag-targeting.
---
I suggest you ask your guild it won't wipe you probably (we cleared rag with a off tank that barely had 75% pre bis)
---
You realise that the people doing this either are bullied, or were bullied earlier in life. It's the only way they can assert what they deem to be dominance in any expect of their lives. Tbh I'd prefer they do it in wow than at school with a rifle.
---
Well at least according to wowclassicpopulation.com it seems to be pretty even. And I think RP servers are special kind of breed anyway which results in a lot more wholesome player experience. As long as you don't mind excessive role playing.
---
Makes me think of the film quote from Durotan; I prefer my enemies to be holding an axe. Not saying they can't defend themselves but this just isn't a fair fight.
---
because they were the closest enemies? idk haha. or do you mean the scanning part. when you hold it it just targets whichever enemy is in the center of your screen
---
They're bad maintanks, but decent for AOE tanking and the costs are cheap, because a lot of holypalas already take the talents which are necessary
---
Protpalas aren't as bad as everyone says, they're just bad for tanking raidbosses :)
---
Then play on a pve server full of carebears. Lol. Simple and it stops u whining.
---
So the source is people saying stuff on dicord? Cool
---
I'm in the same boat as you. Was prot but guild needed DPS only.
---
Your dps will be crap in Prot, period. You need to respec in order to make something happen. I changed to Fury/Arms and actually increased my DPS from +/-250 to 450 which is like average on the raiding group. The best thing is, i equip my plate items in dungeons and i can tank it all with DW either way. It's actually faster since you have a lot more damage, and rage to manage threat. 
---
TLDR: Don't be afraid to change, just go Fury. You can still do anything.
---
If only there were servers that had optional PVP, like you could both agree to flag and fight each other and unflag when you didn't want to get camped.
---
I don't recall these extreme problems back in Vanilla. What is different this time around? Player mentality?
---
Oh is this the anti-circlejerk circlejerk?  Let me jump on board. 
---
Probably be downvoted for this but alliance bad too! Durhhhhh
---
This train of thought baffles me. You judge every follower on the actions of the few loud outspoken without realizing most of asmons viewers are calm laid back individuals just looking for a good time. guess it goes to show that most of asmons critics leap to stupid assumptions like this based on limited exposure to the man
---
Sounds like something you might be able to create with WeakAuras, though unfortunately I'm not aware of any you can just copy/paste in.
---
S-teir: Hunter
---
A-teir: Lock/druid/mage Lock mage are as quick and safe as a hunter but with some downtime. Druid is slower but less downtime.
---
B-teir: Rogue (very fast on green mobs but struggle alot against orange)
---
C-tair: paladins/priest are slow but very safe, warriors are faster ut lots of downtime and struggle against higher lvl mobs.
---
Why don‚Äôt blizzard just make guards much stronger loads more civilians that Aggro problem solved
---
How many dungeons can you enter per hour? And does the timer for this to reset start as you enter the first? Or last?
---
No that's wrong. I usually manage to fd trap on PvP without having to scatter first.
---
I don't get how you hunters still think fd trap is broken. The only thing that can screw it is spell batching. But this happens to rogues vanish toi.
---
The real issue is having your goddamn trap being resisted once every tree times...
---
First you gotta decide what you want to do, tank or dps. Next I would talk with the class leader or officers which spec to run. Without getting too much into semantics, yes you can tank in 0/31/20, but if you use a shield, your threat output will suffer vs deep prot. Then again if you're an OT, you probably don't need to min max threat output. But you could suggest fury prot to them as it does work out just fine when you're an OT, even without a lot of gear.
---
I don't respect you enough to read this wall of text response when my previous comment can basically be summed up as "youmad"
---
And the jury is in. Verdict is: verymad
---
Didn‚Äôt I say that he‚Äôs smart?
---
Should have been more clearly..
---
1. Acts like a selfish jerk
---
2. it‚Äôs all Fake and set up.. he and his buddy‚Äôs had a hard time not to laugh when they set up the ninja drama etc.. 
---
probably half the reddit shit is of him or friends or fans anyways..
---
3. makes his fanboys believe that shit to be legit and act like selfish idiots and ninja, too -&gt; way more toxic community and that‚Äôs what ppl makes ppl go nuts
---
Either Alliance crybabies stopping playing or people like me who are a bit tired of this subreddit's toxicity.
---
Amazing PvP class.
---
Get praised by your melee dps thanks to trueshot aura in raid.
---
Gotta enjoy being the last man standing when your raid get wiped. Repair cost ain't in your vocabulary.
---
Don't have to deal with toxic or clueless players while doing tribute runs for money. 
---
Hunter best class period (I couldn't care less than topping the charts in pve. No pride from smashing 1-2 buttons honestly).
---
Aye cause having flamelash servers are way better.
---
So do you just want quicker OH so that you can get right back to your bigger MH hits, or it doesn't really matter what the speed is on your OH? And yea, I imagine having a slower MH makes timing that HS toggle easier than if your MH was quicker. 
---
I appreciate the response!
---
LOL role playing servers? Yea Right... Like anyone would just hang out in a starting zone inn and role play, mate..
---
Its not but it shows your argument is weak at best.
---
Time is one of the most important variables and resources, though.  It's your availability on any given day or night.  It's your xp/hour, honor/hr, the number of dungeons or raids you run.  Wasting time with long corpse runs and endless camping will burn people out when your time is finite on any given day.  Risk isn't misused if it exists between a successful session or wanting to quit the game out of frustration. 
---
On a pve server, you are in control of all of that at any given time.  I think this is how we got to all retail servers turning into pve with war mode, in my opinion. People can play how they want, and turn on war mode for the extra perks and activities.
---
But i can use that as Gnomish?
---
Still real people you're fucking up.
---
Funny thing is, all those alliance who left this server went to Earthshaker, a close to 50/50 population before the transfers. They are going to sway it heavily into the alliances favor. I wonder if theyll be good boys and girls when they hold the power to corpse camp the opposite faction.
---
It seems you‚Äôve lost the plot pal.  No one said another server couldn‚Äôt be horse dominated they are simply saying the individual players and faction imbalance is the core issue not any one individual faction itself.  Get a clue dude.
---
classic wow is just proving that wow was never good and has always been badly designed.
---
Does anyone have any tips or a video on how to do the first MC jump correctly without falling into lava? I got it the first few times but have failed it the past couple raids. For reference it's the jump that's to the right after the first 2 trash pull giants in MC. Plz help I don't want to keep being a noob who gets summoned after falling in again haha.
---
No changes was stupid, the streamers are fucking clowns and the problem with griefers is that they are the majority. Vanilla priv servers were interesting for me because the game played out as a fantasy simulator mostly, and the community played a huge part in that. With groups reserving every single item, hordes camping every boat and dungeon enteance/flightpoint its not realy fun getting into a group.
---
You would seriously be surprised. I ran this in a hospital and many doctors fell for it:
---
https://lolware.net/assets/images/phish_email.png
---
Thats retcon from cata
---
Weird how pvp ranks are ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù. Farming is kinda pve centric? I mean that guy who is running around in leet epics in a few months time will not seem so cool to me now.. I mean he probably no life camped fp‚Äôs for 3 months  (says more about the time he has than anything else?)
---
"Granted who knows."
---
 What do you mean who knows? This is not a big mystery, we are all humans and would act the same way. A faction in a fantasy game doesnt fundamently change your personality as a human LOOOOOOOL
---
You could try nugrunning. It adds a movable bar that gives a visual indication of how long is left on abilities including sap
---
From a lore perspective, both factions and all the races are corrupt and barely covering up their awfulness, with the possible exception of the Tauren. But I think at the end of the day, neither faction is as bad as you're making them out to be. Let's go through the races one by one, shall we?
---
Humans are probably the most diverse race in terms of how good or bad they are. Most of the prominent medical institutions, churches, orphanages, and so on in Azeroth are run by humans, and they're generally the first to come to the defense and aid of the other races. That said, they're also abnormally susceptible to corruption and greed, and natural masters at hiding it. Just look at the contrast between the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade, and it's easy to see humans hit both extremes with little trouble.
---
Dwarves are money-grubbers, sure, but at the end of the day they're happy to share with whoever can outdrink them. Dwarven hospitality is far and away the best in Azeroth, and they're greatly welcoming to strangers and travelers. The biggest problem dwarves have is stubbornness - they tend to have tempers, and don't give up grudges easily, whether personal or political.
---
Gnomes are probably the "best" of the Alliance races in that they're rarely characterized as anything other than eccentric, odd, and maybe a little crazy, rather than really doing much at all bad or immoral. Their drastic vices are few, but so are their meaningful contributions.
---
Night elves, like most elves, tend to come off as stuck up elitists, but that's honestly about the worst you'll get out of them. They're polite, respectful, generally nonviolent, and mostly just want you to respect both them and nature in return. Pissing them off is very, very difficult, but Light help you if you manage to do it - Malfurion Stormrage alone should be evidence enough of that.
---
Despite appearances, orcs are actually quite civilized. Now, to be fair they do obsess over honor and battle, but that also makes them very simple to work with - if you can win a fair fight, you'll be respected. They want to treat their strength, not crush their enemies with no competition or effort. Keep in mind that a lot of the horrible things attributed to orcs were while they were enslaved by the Burning Legion.
---
The Forsaken probably have the best excuse to be assholes to everyone; everyone was an asshole to them first. Even the Horde don't like the Forsaken. But at the end of the day, most of them are just normal humans who got caught in the crossfire of a horrible war and just want to be left alone. Sylvanas does have the best interests of the Horde at heart, despite appearances - ensuring the Horde's safety is the best way of ensuring the Forsaken's safety, after all.
---
I know nothing about trolls and would prefer to keep it that way, but from what little I do know they're basically just friendly Jamaican voodoo tribesmen. If the worst thing they've done is be hippies with questionable religious practices, I honestly can't see calling them evil. 
---
Tauren are possibly the only exception to the idea that there are bad apples in every race. I can't think of a single Tauren villain outside of the "Alliance good Horde bad" style of storytelling, and the fact that they're involved in the war at all is entirely because of a blood debt to the orcs, not out of any particular desire to fight for themselves. They're just big ol' lovable cow hippies who've done nothing wrong.
---
Have all the races done bad things? Yes, except maybe the Tauren. Have all the races done good things? Yes. Both sides are largely normal, rational, reasonable people, not the psychopaths and warmongers we play as, fight against, or do major quest chains for. War propaganda and players being shitty human beings are largely the issues you're seeing.
---
TIL, i guess. Never heard of that addon but it sounds life changing for shamans. Thank you!
---
This fucking this. Match people up against approximately how many queued together.
---
this is a game changer
---
Yep, it's really "high damage MH fast OH" but when comparing gear of similar dps it's the same as "slow MH/fast OH" I'm on mobile so I can't check but abilities will say whether they use base weapon damage or attack power in the tooltip. I think execute is just flat damage which probably scales with AP, and bloodthirst is just %AP like you mentioned. I do believe that 2H is a different story where higher DPS is better in nearly all cases, assuming very high melee uptime (PvE). For pvp it's a different story
---
Eh, depends. There are great items that just also happen to have fire res on them. Actively discouraging people from wearing anything with res isn't something you should do either, just to clarify.
---
Ony neck, some tier pieces and black dragonscale come to mind. All are decent items, have some fr and will help your uptime on the lootdrake that stacks its fire res debuff if you get lucky, and reduce stress on healers for vael.
---
I agree tho, don't gear too heavily for it
---
Novelty? So hitting 3k+ is a novelty? Okay mate. Besides you can also get Gnomish Goggles and The chicken trinket as gnomish only on top of death ray. Goblin has NOTHING worthy of beeing goblin.
---
I hope not. My biggest fear is they rush everything classic so we have it 'done' in time for Shadowlands to release.
---
Fyi, if you die as honorless that does not reduce the honor of the next kill. It just does not count as a kill at all.
---
Im saying this would be true if the world was small, but its not, people are spread around the world, in some zones the 40 faction will be dominating that zone.
---
Oh for fuck sake, grow up and accept that people do everything to get an edge, especially in a game, that people play for fun.
---
Fire reflector works in pve?
---
"blizz gon' fix this"
---
What's your name? Don't tell me you're gameking
---
as long as it gives a HK it's considered a kill
---
You didn‚Äôt even bother changing the title
---
Rank 10 isnt done by camping a FP is done by spending almost 28 hours a week in BGs. Anything rank 10+ takes almost full time playing of 40 hours a week, or like what happened in classic account sharing and swapping ranks with other people
---
It‚Äôs honestly a really simple problem to fix.
---
Faction based queues and free transfers for the bigger faction.
---
Really? My bad, I was so certain it was in earlier.
---
1. faction queues
---
2. free faction transfers to the lower population faction on every server
---
3. free server transfer to low population server + free faction transfer if your faction is higher population on the target server
---
Free transfers should've been limited to specific faction. Also amount of people to get transferred to some server should've been limited too. So allow only Horde to transfer to Server 1 (limit 5000), Server 2 (limit 1000). Once 1000 horde transfers to Server 2 free transfer automatically closes.
---
But it's not the solution for situation we now have. Now there's no non-destructive solution to solve this mess. At this point the only thing they could do is to merge servers with 90/10 and 10/90 balance.
---
Was being camped today at fields in hillsbrad by a skull hunter. No idea why. Killed me roughly 14 times
---
Oh I picked a Night Elf Female specifically anticipating the roleplay... (But mostly because Male Night Elves looks much worse model wise)
---
Exactly. Honorless debuff does not count as an HK.
---
Perfectly fitting book to describe the problem with faction inbalance and how the stronger faction treats the weaker.
---
I am confused, you are praising and hating on the tab targeting system at the same :D.

But....that HAS been done in the past. Wizards of the coast specifically stopped publishing books in older DnD editions so people would only have the option of buying NEWER DnD books. Older editions staying alive cannibalizes sales from the newer ones. Pathfinder (Paizo's DnD 3.75th edition) took many players away from DnD 4e. Companies abandon older works, despite it still making them money, because it cannibalizes from their NEWER stuff. If YOU made newer editions of your game, or released new content, wouldn't you want people to buy that instead of clinging to older books? Even if people BUY the older books, you put money into your new work and you want a return on investment. If you have micro purchases (or whatever they're called) and they're only applicable for the NEW stuff, wouldn't it severely harm your bottom line if people are opting for an edition that doesn't partake?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If people migrated to classic, while they'd still be paying subscription fees, they wouldn't be buying the new expansion packs, they also wouldn't be buying the items in the store because the store items do nothing for the classic game. If a large portion of the playerbase moved, it would cripple ROI for shadowlands and BfA.
---
Just use paladins. Mp5, AP, Aggro reduction for warrior dps, 10% stars, fire resustance auras, powerfull and quick target heals, you name it!... Oh I see, Horde topic.
---
No, but the deflector does
---
Who gives a fuck what these cunts do just don't okay with them
---
I think asmonds followers are a tiny drop in the bucket.
---
So what kind of PVP is allowed then overlord? Fuckin crying dramaqueens.
---
The operative word is "works", yes.
---
On ganking servers, we have a temporarily unstable equilibrium, which lasts until one side starts leaving.
---
Lol didnt know!
---
Make that an hour
---
Sheeeesh. 300 runs for my Savage glad n you come in here saying yoooo
---
i think the counterndoes increase  
---
can someone confirm evidence?
---
Basically everyone wants to balance the servers. Every suggested solution before the mess of phase 2 has been to reach towards that. The unfetted early transfers have absolutely fucked two servers: Skeram(towards horde heavily) and Heartseeker(towards alliance heavily).
---
Shoutouts to the madlad who farmed the wintersaber.
---
And if you need money for your mount you can whore yourself out in Goldshire. üòÄ
---
*semijocking*
---
Playing the game efficient is not being an asshole imo. On my server there hardly any hordes in the open world. If I want to rank, I have to go to OG or Durotar.
---
I am not sure anout OH speed. I think it may not be important. Only raw weapon dps matters. 
---
Slow OH eats less furry procs. 
---
Fast OH give more rage from 2ns tier talents in furry. Fast OH teoreticaly better fits into slow MH heroic periods and thus better reduce OH miss penalty.
---
But those are such minor mechanics... who realy knows?
---
Actually I have played since original beta.  I have limited private server experience.  I dont care if there are changes from vanilla or not.  Classic is not vanilla.  I'm just saying this happened in vanilla as well.  You might have played on a dead or pve server in vanilla.  It seems to be what you are looking for now as well.
---
Looking for Alliance players on Zandalar Tribe to level together. I'm a night-elf warrior and want to find someone who could help me with the burden of slow leveling a warrior.
---
What about a weapon with a built in dot?
---
If it‚Äôs one thing you can count on, theres always a warrior around the corner with arguments as to why they should get loot prio.
---
Oh I get it, you're mad
---
You *can* but you need to buff the ever-loving crapola out of the minority faction so that PvPers want to play that faction on that server.
---
Think automatic stealth detection, breaking CC and so on. Half measures just won't work.
---
I can't give a 100 % answer but the requirement for the pala mount was a quest without any gold paying involved
---
Why play on a pvp server? U should be on a pve server. They're not assholes. You're just soft. You can't beat them or brush it off so you're crying about it to other people
---
ZT supposedly has balanced pop, but the horde is getting crushed aswell
---
Buy a free action potion. Put on your anti fear trinkets.
---
We'll be busy fighting in battlegrounds, so no world camping. Enjoy!
---
Ofc you will. You gain ranks based on the amount of honor other players from your faction gain.
---
I mean you're late to the party now. From what we've heard the Alliance side on Flamelash is completely and utterly gutted. 
---
It's not about underdogs any more, Alliance simply don't really exist now, from what people are saying. Flamelash is basically a Horde PvE server now.
---
Faction specific queues with a free option to faction change. People need an incentive to do something, theyd consider swapping if it meant theyd not have to worry about 2hr queues every night.
---
HAHAAHAAH keep doing gods work, he's trash, too bad I heal so my spy score only shows that im 0-3 vs him
---
Up voted for OEB
---
No you don't need any riding training, neither for the 60 warlock mount.
---
If I can use fury/prot with my current gear, swapping pieces when needed, but I'll be putting out more DPS, that works for now I guess.
---
Do you think with that gear (use shield too when needed) I can tank things like UBRS, strat, or whatever? I've been doing that to make a bit of money as deep prot, I know the pulls etc... but would it be a massive drop if I try tanking like that in fury/prot?
---
They absolutely can be duo'ed, but you have to be a beast warrior priest combo to do it. A guy in my guild was farming Ironfoe that way till he got something better from a world boss.
---
&gt; It is how pvp servers worked in vanilla. #nochanges.
---
The servers are already six times larger than they were 15 years ago! Increasing the size of a football team to 60 players but leaving the field (world map and PoI) the same already altered the game.
---
In 2005, three months after the games release, rarely has a faction been reduced to simply being nodes to farm honor on.
---
I didn't roll an undead rogue for nothing kiddo
---
Moreover, you do not bring honor if you go out of an instance sooo...
---
One cannot end a sentence praising Legion regardless of whether or not it is due.
---
I watch asmongold (not often but sometimes), so I know not all his viewers are negative but you can't say it's a loud minority because there is no way to know what the "silent majority" are thinking in your statement. I'm pretty confident it's the reverse, the loud majority are toxic and a silent minority just watch him for entertainment. And there is probably an even smaller minority that watches him for entertainment and can avoid falling for his rhetoric.
---
i have the same. typing a quick /reload wil fix it until your next alt tab
---
Rip when everyone transfers out or stops playing. Camping capitals just helps cement a self fulfilling prophecy.
---
I do
---
You‚Äôre correct
---
Yeah that's what I mean, it was a different time with priorities and concepts. It wasn't neccesarily wrong to go hard on the mitigation, it was just how people did things.
---
Now we have fury tanks, GBoK paly tanks, even shaman tanks(mostly 5mans). Its cool that you can mix up how you tank now, but you cant really knock how it was done before because... well that's how it was XD
---
&gt; So you expect me to believe a class that relies on janky mechanics, farming and enchanting throw away weapons, and a lvl 40 helmet for the entire game isnt meme af? Hilarious
---
I believe you can forgo enchanting MCP. Farming MCP is the same farming you would do for any other item/consumables (there's even summoning taxis to quicken the process). Feral druid PvE tanks don't use a lvl40 helmet that is for PvP. I play as a priest raid tank and having just cleared 3 bosses in MC and hearing someone say feral druid tanks are a meme is odd...
---
Met your fellow members last night, nice and peacefully
---
https://i.imgur.com/TKl4tbz.jpg
---
We should all roll Alliance and retake the server back. Calling out to all you hardcore wow players who like a challenge :D
---
Wait... Is Brad a lizard?
---
Well, that‚Äôs not 100% true. There are rogues  ganking mages teleporting in the capital. 0 honor.
---
When you come out of a dungeon, 0 honor.
---
When you log in, 0 honor.
---
Still, some idiot gank you. Time wasted for you and them...
---
Many servers are balanced.Like Faerelina where i see streamers whining while having advantage , classic alliance playing into victim mentality while they are ganking like crazy
---
&gt; When you are in a Group of 20 People you will do the same.
---
I actually don't. *Some* people might do that, but I've never initiated a 10vs1 in my life, nor joined in one. When I see eight people hitting one person, my immediate reaction isn't that it looks fun and engaging, so I want in! It's "poor guy", and I just go my way.
---
This is your best bet.
---
If you don‚Äôt have engi, or don‚Äôt know how to solo DM trib you could always send in your pet on a mob, then put it on stay and let it soak damage while you skill. When your skill is high enough that you get some hits in, just make your pet slap the mob 1 time to get agro back, then stay again.
---
7.0 drastically changed how tab targeting prioritizes targets and the new system very often prioritizes far away, non-combatant enemies over enemies you're actually fighting.
---
&gt; Yeah for about 2 months now. Bummed out a lot of us.
---
Dang. What about between boss combat pulses? I swear I heard many people pull this off very recently.
---
zZz zZz
---
No. But it‚Äôs sufficiently inconvenient that people just don‚Äôt bother with playing at all. On some servers you cannot leave the major cities at all without a raid.
---
HordeZeppelinTowers:
---
55 ELITE GUARDS with nets and SPAMMABLE KNOCKBACK BULLETS. 
---
AllianceBoatDocks:
---
41 Guards. If they run on top of a civilian they will spawn a 55 nonelite. No net, no knockback. 
---
H O W I S T H I S B A L A N C E D
---
If there are no players then you cant get rank was the joke.
---
Nah mate you just got outplayed 5v20, i think you need to get better skillz, or maybe you're just an idiot who cant handle pvp.
---
I just think it is hilarious that I have personally seen the non 60 dungeons camped way more than the 60 dungeons.
---
Right now they are fine but they still aren't top, you can see that on WCL.
---
legion was sick
---
I used to play on this server and it felt very cliquey, same with the server discord.
---
I‚Äôm in the same ball park as you (with a bit lower rbg scores), what makes you think Classic strats would be different than rbgs?
---
Tbf blizzard has already done plenty of changes. One of those in particular is with population increases to servers.
---
They should be roaming in small groups and not staticly camping 1 spot for hours in a raid. Worse honor doing that in my experience anyways.
---
There is nothing else to do in the game. Many players already had all the content on farm for several weeks before p2. P2 added nothing to the game besides a reward for world pvp. Saying that this wasn't to be expected is really naive imo.
---
And yes ganking lowies is a dick move. Tbh I never really experienced more than the occasional one shot from a passing 60 on my twink. Could just be me being lucky though. But again ... what did anyone expect ?
---
&gt; A rogue can tank AQ with TF?
---
yes, TF allows the introduction of more fury warriors into a raidcomp to provide the required dps to kill a boss without approaching enrage or burn the mana of most healers.
---
Yo there is this ally rogue on kromkrush, a thankfully pretty balanced server. I swear he pays rent at Marshall's refuge in ungoro because for the entire 3 days it took me to finish ungoro (up from 1 day on my phase 1 hunter), lobotomizer the ally rogue would just chill in stealth. Wait for people to land, wait for honorless target to fall off, and then boom.
---
He literally targeted a spot where he could get honor consistently from those at a 10 to 12 lvl disadvantage where it's just far enough away to not easily recruit help as a class that gets to decide whether or not to engage.
---
I brought my hunter out anyways for protection, never saw him. Log back to my shaman, ganked.
---
Was nearly unable to retrieve quests or turn them in without the protection of any 60 (he was scared of people his level).
---
This was extremely dumb and not enjoyable,  but at least I have a vanilla style memory.  If I ever see him outside of his safe place I will obliterate him and the feeling of retribution will be intense. 
---
But yeah,  he's a total shit,  I hope he sees this and sees how weak a lvl 50 shaman thinks he is.  And if he ever wants to 1v1 an equal lvl player,  let's go.
---
55-45 alli server.
---
Hahahha good shit üòÇ
---
What the...
---
Not on sulfuras. There does seem to be a market for one though if one were to be made.
---
Sure hope not. They should maybe try to prioritize it to a small extent but they should not make the same mistake they did in TBC introducing this kind of system, pandering to lone wolfs and penalizing players that want to play with their friends in battlegrounds. It's a group based gamemode if you want the best experience, go with a group noone expect a pug to be as smooth as a guildrun for dungeon and raids. 
---
The idea is good in theory, and I think I had the best pvp experinces from premade vs premade battles, but if you make premade only face premades, they get longer queues which means that you effectively make playing solo be the superior way to gain honor which make the number of premades even lower.
---
Yeah this really bugged me..they are fighting Black Dragonflight ! That lore is everywhere
---
Well, confirms that population balance isn't going to save every server
---
Rivals only the Knights Who Say Ni
---
QS is your best bet. Sims very well - especially during execute phase.
---
I haven‚Äôt read much about it, is it good?
---
These are some good question I aant answers as well
---
Man alliance are so whiny on this sub its insane.
---
I'm getting excited like a child for christmas about that. You will have hundreds of posts of people who *demand* this is fixed, addressed, and believe it's Blizzard's duty to enable them to raid.
---
And then we should all spam "#nochanges" under their posts...
---
Yikes
---
That attribute isn‚Äôt solely attributed to the US, there, comrade ;)
---
I don't know why people are hating on you.
---
The pavilion north of camp mojache.  There is a night elf there that gives a quest.  If you have crescent key you can open the door that leads to a portal.  
---
Keep this quite or people will camp the hallway because that‚Äôs how life works.
---
My brother is about to hit rank 9 before BG's release, he wasn't in the top pools for our faction each week either so I think the top people might actually hit 10 before BG's.
---
Well, I kill everyone, even if theyre 30 lvls below me, its part of a pvp server. But I guess crying about it is part of it for some people aswell, so yea, youre right. Who am I to judge people crying about pvp.
---
I honestly don't get how you people can't understand analogies, THAT bad. Here, I'll help you out.
---
The point of an analogy is not to say that getting HKs and enslaving people is the same thing. The point of an analogy is to illustrate a flaw in your logic, by stripping your argument down to its simplest essence possible, and then comparing it to another argument's simplest essence.
---
Your argument, when you break it down, is "It's morally okay to be an asshole to others when there is an incentive to be one and there are no ramifications." That is essentially what you're saying when your defense is "It's in the game".
---
One could compare this to a million other circumstances that fit that criteria.
---
Stealing something when there are no security cameras / police around, aka the perfect crime scenario, where you never get caught. Most people view theft as immoral, but in this situation, why not?
---
Selling your ex girlfriend's nudes, viewed largely unethical but not actually illegal, with a monetary incentive for you.
---
The Milgram experiment in its totality, really. Following orders that have you do something you understand to be immoral to some degree, with an incentive to keep doing it.
---
All of those things are technically "in the game" that is life, but most of us understand them to be unethical and frown upon them. So if you're going to make the argument that doing the same thing is somehow magically okay in a game, at least accept the fact that you're saying that all of these other things are also okay, because they largely follow your moral template.
---
But at this point, why would anyone look at Warcraft pvp as a playable game? I feel like it gets less attention than island expeditions.
---
When in doubt, always look at the looks
---
For me I quit because it wasn‚Äôt the Classic I remembered from when I was a kid. Too many private server players took the game to a min/max place that I hate about retail.
---
No one actually. Blizzard launched with those popcaps, and also caused the issue by not having enough servers at launch.
---
They have like 300-something players in &lt;leftovers&gt;. Doesn't seem too unreasonable to get half of them 15 HKs if they tried.
---
The only reason to bring a feral dps (who doesn't have rank 13 gear) would be for leader of the pack and the ability to offtank. It would be fine if there is no feral in the raid, and the feral who wants to join puts in max effort (wolfshead, pummelers, consumables). The decision to bring a feral is much easier if they're a tank. 
---
But dpsing as feral is boring as hell. Jesus christ it's boring. TBC made it fun but in vanilla it's painful. 
---
Source: Was feral dps / offtank in vanilla. I had rank13 gear and used every consumable for dps so I actually did a very decent amount of damage (we didn't powershift or use pummelers back then). I'm resto this time around because it's actually fun and engaging.
---
Yeah, I stand corrected, didn't bother looking it up, if im honest.
---
Yeah, seriously, everyone knows you're supposed to take the picture with an overhead projector and then get the film developed at Walgreens or nobody is taking you seriously
---
Because of shamans or certain items?
---
Or and this is just idea maybe you could sit back and think for a second and realize that this toxic behavior could kill the server and drive ppl away from the game i'm going to just wait a little bit and start ranking with bgs
---
This isn't retail the way the player base treats each other actual matters to the health of the game you need only ask anyone on flamelash if you think i'm wrong
---
No probs, sarcasm can be really hit or miss in written format. Especially so since it's highly subjective.
---
Lol, no. That literally never happened. 
---
And of course it's unfair, you'd have to be a sperg not to understand why it is.
---
Is there any way to know what lvl my char is without paying 12‚Ç¨ to buy playtime ?
---
I'm willing to bet anyone that uses the term carebear is a huge asshole.
---
fury/prot should be the nest decision for you. You will lose 10-15% dps compared to full fury warrior. Yet, 15% threat from prot will make you able to tank both dungeons and raid at almost same lvl as normal tank (However I would stick to off tanking until you get good enough gear for dual wield tanking raids).
---
All dungeons except maybe UBRS can be easily tanked dualwielding even with half geared healer (I did entire strat with shadow priest as heal in half bis). 15% extra threat from talent will make it very easy.
---
Just remember as fury/prot you need dps pieces as much as tank pieces (crit is important for threat gen), so don't be hesitant to swap some defence gear for +2% crit.
---
This sub has literally become an anti-horde propaganda outlet. It's absurd how hostile people get as soon as they figure you're playing horde, like you're griefing the game or something. The funny thing is that the global playerbase balance is pretty much 50/50, alliance just chose to play on PvE servers more. That's not something horde players have done to them. It's a self-inflicted problem.
---
Half the time I post something indicating I'm a horde player, it goes to 0 or -1 within a few minutes even when it was something completely benign like mentioning which spec I leveled with on my shaman. Once this sub has its hate-narrative of the month, it becomes impossible to post anything that slightly infringes on that. First layering was going to kill the game, then early DM would lead to Naxx in April, and now horde is apparently ruining the game because fewer alliance players wanted to play on PvP servers.
---
I'm guessing next week we'll enter the era of "premades are enemies of the world and Blizzard should remove the option to queue with other people."
---
Sure there was. You focus on killing all the commanders, then towers, then last boss. Even if the enemy team wins, you get a decent amount of honor. Engaging the enemy only prolonged the game, so its better to just 100% pve focus on the mobs that give honor.
---
Are you pretending or really dont understand?
---
When you kill an honoursless target you kill them when they respawn again. That is the point of killing people at flightpaths.
---
You get my respect for posting this :)
---
Anyone know what time it will be released in EU.
---
Nope. 
---
They didn't win the game, whatsoever. Blizz just fucked it up by having Free transfers open on a server with 70/30 - 80/20 faction balance, of course people are going to prefer to leave to a server closer to 50/50.
---
I'm confused. What part is Blizzard's fault? Besides putting the game out and staying true to the original timeline as much as possible, I don't see why you (and many others) think they are to blame. And if they are what action would you have them take to change the events that have already taken place?
---
It‚Äôs unlikely BG‚Äôs will make a massive difference. There‚Äôs still going to be a ton of players who don‚Äôt care and just in it to grief and troll people out in the world. 
---
You‚Äôre still going to see instances, graveyards and flight paths being camped.
---
The MC quest is literally called ‚Äúattunement to the core‚Äù and is the reason raid attunes are called what they are
---
Looking for Horde players to level together on Razorgore EU, I'm currently level 15.
---
I am really interested in this as well, would be awesome if Blizzard could release this info.
---
Multishot is about 20% of my raid DPS. So a 15% increase to that is huge.
---
During my logs, multishot is about 15% of my total damage.
---
The 8/8 set bonus is 15% ekstra of those 15% so that's 1.15 \* 0.15 = 17.25 % **or an ekstra 2.25 % dps total from the 8/8 setbonus.** 
---
I somehow highly doubt that that the 3-set tier2 and additional stats won't out-perform that meager tier 1 bonus.
---
Fuck off with these memes.  
---
They're so cringe.
---
After every kill I thought. At least when reworked one first came out. And would be answered by "ey, grats mon!" Yelled by end boss
---
I mean, most of the PVP is never actually even PVP.  I run around with 5 and we either get 5v1-30 every other fight, there are times where we get good fights but it is pretty rare it's actually PVP.
---
you want to execute immediately at 20% with as little rage as possible. this means setting up your globals and dumping rage to get there. i think the breakpoint is like 3k ap for bloodthirst to do more damage in execute range.
---
i also BELIEVE that dumping heroics before execute is more damage efficient because of the implications it has with glancing and hit chance but someone can correct me
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt understand the intent behind what I meant because I didn‚Äôt specifically say it but celebrity is just another word for paid to entertain me.  Some folks got it twisted and think a celebrity is someone to idolize - they‚Äôre not.
---
As soon as you enter the gates within BRM, you'll get ganked on my server. Even when you jump directly into the direction of MC with slow fall (coming from burning steppes), you'll still die 4-5 times on your way to BRD
---
Thats exactly what I was thinking as well lol. Thats literally sadistic behaviour right there that socipaths say. "If she didnt want to get raped she wouldnt have dressed like that" smh.
---
Bloodfang is pretty damn even, not sure if that's the one you're mentioning though.
---
And now they ruined Earthshaker. Impossible to find alliance that is not in atleast a 20 man raid group. No small scale fights anymore.
---
You seem to be trying to guilt the people doing this, but for most of them, this is the *point* of what they're doing.  They know they're assholes, they're proud of it.  This sort of post is their *trophy*.
---
Sure, ok, thanks for that - I might just look into that. So if I go Fury/Prot I can use the shield in UBRS for example, and still do OK? I listed my gear above, I also have full prebis tank gear (With shoulders of might) so I can just swap some pieces over if I need? Or even in Fury/prot if I want to tank a dungeon, should I just use my full "tank" gear (including lionheart helm, SGC) and shield?
---
I'm fury prot main tank.
---
Group isn't quite ready for me to dual weild on rag, the spike damage is too deadly.
---
An asshole as well, impacting others play time for no reason than being an asshole.
---
(Not gonna lie, I've done it a few times as well)
---
You're an asshole!
---

Priest Service Announcement
---
Sounds like PvP happened on a PvP server, don't see what's wrong here
---
The way it has always been handled in multiple guilds across several private servers and is now handled in classic is: 
---
Grind the arcanite yourself, the other stuff is provided by the guild bank. Maube 10-20 bars from gbank for tf. Too few sulfur on ingots? Buy them or wait for gbank to get more drops.
---
I am not that informed on the ranking system but I think he is saying that once bgs come out, someone like me who has not pvped a lot can easily get to the same rank in bgs without having to camp lowbies and fps.
---
Free race chances would result in the game being 95% horde and 5% paladins.
---
Thank you, good sir.
---
I actually also have a druid at 25 and enjoying it, but I'm worried about endgame. They may the least-played class, but from what I see supply still exceeds demand by a few factors (in my guild at least and I never see people recruiting them) I like the HoT style of healing but it doesn't scale well with other healers (healsnipes and non-stacking buffs). Or are these things not as bad as I may think? I wouldn't really like to be there just for buffs and raid cd's.
---
Dont tell alli about this until Tuesday,  i get all my honor by camping dire maul.
---
&gt; Sounds like everyone left should either straight quit or leave
---
But they can't leave because their characters are *stuck* on the bloody server. 
---
It's easy to say "just reroll" when your resources and progress of the last three months isn't stuck on a dead server. I rerolled on Pyrewood Village before all this and when my character was 56 on my main server, and the process was painful as hell. It made me nearly just quit the game.
---
I can't imagine how someone with one or two level 60 characters with epic mounts would feel.
---
That's awesome friend! Yeah sadly my work schedule on top of having a newborn has proven to be to much for me. I hate it give it up, but priorities have to change my love for classic will never change. Keep grinding friend! Enjoy your happy trap!
---
My raid leader broke us from using tab targeting back in tbc because everyone kept pulling adds. Haven't used it since.
---
OOF on Fairbanks they go for 17.5G a stack
---
That was Flamelash before. Fucking Vrnture no-lifers (seriously, there was a group of 5 at least that I've seen connected at 8am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm, 8pm and 11pm during a couple of different work days) annoying as hell camping the leveling zones.
---
Its still way better then cross realms and lfgs playing with nameless people you will never meet again.Overall classic population is full ,queues are regular so yeah ppl want it
---
whats the issue with having a list of ppl who can eat a bag of dicks? Then just not invite them?
---
Selbe Bild auf dragons Fall üòÖ
---
You‚Äôre that desperate for a better parse on one boss?
---
They were servant of the old gods, it's not even a retcon from cata.
---
Point is, they still don't give a shit.
---
Ragnaros is sealed away and has no connection or intrest with the old gods anymore, until he was summoned back in Cataclysm - at which point was intrested since well, he was summoned back.
---
Nefarian has no deal with the old gods because he has no deal with the old gods. Neltharion, which is Deathwing, did. He might make some deal out of intrest, but the reasons are his own. Onyxia as well. The black dragonflight aligned themselves with the old gods following Neltharion, but with Nefarian they don't until Cata comes around.
---
&gt; Just know that you probably ruined someone's game by wasting 30 minutes of their 2 hours playtime.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs why they do it.
---
You have clearly never seen what being on a PVP server meant when they were first introduced.
---
How about this: I am exactly where I should be, given that I DO have experience with what PVP servers were like in vanilla. How about YOU move to a server that says: 24/7 GANKFEST FORGET EVERYTHING ELSE.
---
Ooooh
---
Servers caps are higher In classic than they were in vanilla, don't think they gave any figures though other than saying something like vanilla high pops are the equivilant to classic medium pops, and that high pops in classic hold multiple servers worth of players compared to vanilla. 
---
Not sure that even holds up now that tourists have gone and phase 2 has bled players. Playing early morning in classic feels baron compared to vanilla and I played high pop on both.
---
Asking someone via Bnet you used to play with.
---
Or with any luck, warcraftrealms.com has the character info still
---
Vanilla until now.
---
You must watch him quite abit for that is a pretty big list lol
---
I‚Äôve watched a few of his reaction videos on YouTube recently and he sounds mostly reasonable.
---
Why would India do that
---
Guild is actually a good idea I‚Äôll try that
---
I heal, tank, and have a dps. The only keybind I use is a cheap shot opener on my rogue.
---
You know what the irony of all this is? Back when, Rallos Zek had a reputation for being a shithole, but shit that disrupted gameplay to this degree absolutely was not tolerated. Guilds would actively work together to drive individuals and groups whose douchebaggery went way beyond the pale off the server. The standards were pretty loose, but they did exist and if you couldn't control yourself you'd pay for it in the end. Who got to farm more Sleeper guardian drops than anyone else? Who killed the bastard?
---
PvP with real consequences is underrated.
---
Thanks for replying. What about my point on Molten Core?
---
You'll have to talk to Relentless Insomnia or whichever sweaty megaguild has em camped about that. Most of us aren't even attempting to tag WBs.
---
How come faction balance is so bad in the modern game but was relatively stable in the original game in 2004?
---
Yes but they will still have to wait for that when everyone else will be done already. :)
---
Please never become a judge. Holy shit this is flawed thinking. Like people had statistics avalible on day 1 about server balance. Tool
---
Still funny though.
---
Bent doesn‚Äôt work you see them but not their lvl or something like this and it‚Äôs a new classic char therefore not on that website afaik
---
There's usually pvp happening in Hillsbrad - it'll probably dry up w/ bgs tho.
---
Healing is mega easy, there is nothing to learn really unfortunately atm.
---
Horde Zeppelin Towers: in fucking horde territory (save for Grom'Gol) can travel across cities freely and safely without being flagged
---
Alliance boats: contested territory with absolutely no defense so lowbies can get camped just trying to cross continents.
---
Yeah the more you look the more obvious the horde favoritism stands out but horde fucks are so tunnel visioned into being dominant that they can't pull the camera back to see how rigged in their favor the whole thing is.
---
He‚Äôs an insufferable twat
---
Server size. The cap is like 5x what it used to be.
---
There was imbalance back then too. But now the realms are bigger and the world is the same size, so you're bound to get more conflict.
---
But I honestly think more people just stuck around then and battled it out. Now it's outrage and "voting with your wallet".
---
Is there a Priest guide that gives some advice for what skills to buy and what to skip?
---
just died in a 1v1 "ive yet to see a 1v1" lmao
---
your garbage son
---
IF is more central. Closer to Scholo/Strat/General Plaguelands. Closer to Menethil Harbour for doing stuff in Kalimdor (the case can, of course, be made for Booty Bay for Stormwind).
---
That wasn't very chill bro guy.
---
I noticed I was having problems with it in Legion, whereas I had been totally happy before. They changed something and it wasn't an improvement.
---
Come to Rattlegore, I think horde dominates. Can‚Äôt even quest in 50+ zones
---
keep that helm for pvp tho
---
I think you ppl are missing out on the fact that the pvp gloves both epic and blue give you a %dmg-increase to multishot so combining 5 piece and pvp gloves might actually be worth it if the stats add up.
---
I hope not.  They deserve this.  Fuck'em!
---
Can ppl that are skull gain honor if the kill me?
---
Most of the time Pagle IF is hosting mountlines, epic mount arrangements, or some dude on a horse making non-stop noise. Sometimes someone will fire up a trivia bot.
---
It used to be personal preference, but since today the game is fully understood and documented, many people heavily optimize their choices ("minamaxing"), resulting in much more Horde than Alliance.
---
In general, the Horde racials are better for PVP (Will of the Forsaken), and Shaman totems (Windfury) outweigh Paladin blessings in PVE for melee.
---
Or... wait for it.
---
Or....
---
get gid
---
Because I like windfury?
---
I like how all the alliance in the comments are more salty than the guy being ganked in the video
---
Hard to say. You could deactivate all addons, and turn them on one by one until it breaks again.
---
When will battlegrounds come today? Can europe expect them around 2 or 3 server time as usual? Finally, is there still some honour counting bug that I shouldn't even play after 3?
---
WSG!Capture the flag was always best bg
---
I refuse to watch to watch any of his content.
---
All of this knowledge comes from other streamers or former guild members of his discussing what an asshole he is.
---
Advertise Shadow Priest has made a name for himself by constantly forming PVP raids against Asmon, which has also led to videos discussing the drama in general. He makes videos with plenty of evidence, often from Asmon's own stream, which display how truly shitty of a human being he is.
---
Hahaha is this the classic the Donald tactic? Basically just go "no you". I'm not a bigot nor a racist, unlike you, your post history is the evidence. Nice try Trumper!
---
&gt;  Pvp happened on a PvP server.
---
This is true unironically. PvP in wow is actually just this. Ganking, 5v1, camping entrances and FP. That is what you should have expected when joining a pvp server.
---
How easy is it to get groups as a Warlock? For dungeons etc? Not too concerned with raids right now
---
It's garbage. Nothing like tabbing through a group we're fighting to dot them, only to target one across the room instead of one next to me.
---
Same rofl..my druid is an alt but there was gnome spamming sheeps on me then i killed him
---
You understand that if they allow only horde to tranfer off another server would become flamelash right?
---
Respec goes up to 100g ?? Making it so expansive is really dumb.. why did they do this lul
---
Join a guild with 13 days between mc raids schedule and allows pvp spec for onyxia
---
Im a main tank, I equally share loot with the OT or give it to him if its a bigger upgrade. Blue gear will carry you all the way to rag where you then need more FR gear.
---
AQ
---
If you treat other players like NPCs, then you're an arsehole.
---
The answer was that sulfuras isnt good for anyone in raiding environment which is false. In average case u have 4-6 dps warriors and i doubt each is equipped with BRE.
---
As far as I can see, just the +15 agi enchant, which only requires 2 essences. I don't know if this qualifies as "Skyrocket".
---
&gt;Logs break when the distance of the logger and the person receiving heals &gt; too much
---
I think it was changed to a max range of \~50yd (thank you Blizzard for "fixing" Spy), but this is the crux of the matter of why meters and logs can lie on certain fights. 
---
And as a shammy, I'd like to join for a few fights and put up some competition :p agree that you want a mixed bag when assembling your healing team. And not running with too many in your raid at the same time.
---
Hunters replace it sooner. They get a better neck in BWL where as warriors wont replace ony neck until phase 6.
---
Im not entirely sure, I know there s a German server thats ally favoured and maybe one rppvp one thats also leaning towards ally. Rest is either dominantly or slightly, but still horde favoured. Not entirely sure about Earthshaker now since lot of people migrated there in the last moment from many servers.
---
That's the point of pvp lol. Poe server's that that way. Drive safe.
---
I'm just triggered they put the scare quotes around the wrong word.
---
Some guy at the Stonespine discord did a scan of the server with two accounts and it showed ~900 active lvl 60 alliance players and ~2500 active lvl 60 horde players.
---
So yes, the problem is that everyone is in IF.
---
IF is also camped almost 24/7 by the same rogues, had to change my HS to SW.
---
Happy cake day!
---
For MC, I would stuck with tank gear with some hit pieces. Using some crit items would be also good (your dps will love you for that) if they are much better than tank pieces (for example 2% crit trinket or dps ony trinket are better than anything you can find now).
---
As for Garr I think full tank might not be bad idea. It will make it easier for healers and threat is no problem there. You should have enough rage from multiple adds hiting you to build threat very fast on first add. After death of first add threat on other shouldnt be a problem even when rage starved (as you will have already some threat built on them)
---
Warlock has great utility.  Desirable over everything except mages IMO.
---
Tell that to the three rank 6+ Ally rogues camping feralas on Herod you giant baby
---
Yup.
---
=)
---
Agreed than.
---
You can pvp in your fury spec my brother does it. He has fun doing it the only thing you need to master is when to stance change and learn what you need to trinket or not.
---
So if i report my name ill get a name change?
---
oh sweet summer child
---
So you're saying a whole faction can't drive out 25 people in their home city? (If they're safespotting, report them)
---
You have a different opinion on me AND PLAY HORDE????? Time to purge
---
Quit your job
---
I will Just PvP in Fury spec maybe switching a bit between 1h and 2h Fury
---
VICTORYYYYYYYYY. what now?
---
What a condecending thing to say.
---
Yes not sure how many people you need
---
The other guy almost certainly already had the account for other purposes.
---
Also the fact that he's referring to OP by a real name is very suspicious
---
Isn‚Äôt there another way?
---
If you have suspicion, tag mob the bot is about to attack (his target in frames). If they kill it and continue like nothing happened(not even changing target to you), it's a bot.
---
Congrats! :)
---
Oh yeah, I usually have it on the highest settings as well, was just messing around with every setting during the raid to see if it would help fix the problem. Are you experiencing these glitches with your rig?
---
My tab is set as target nearest enemy player. I rebound shift + tab to target enemy but rarely use it.
---
Wait why holy water? I‚Äôve just been doing tokens
---
No they don‚Äôt as killing an honor less character getting down the fly is providing them no honor at all
---
&gt; As a warlock, it's never hard to get an invite, but there could still be 20 minutes of "LF1M Need tank".
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
It used to be that 90% of the player base made their decision on which race/faction they rolled based on mostly cosmetics.  After all this time playing dress up game in retail, lots of people are over the cosmetics and rolled the min-max best choice for playstyle which happens to be mostly horde for PvP.
---
Tell that to my third alt becoming slowly another lvl 60.
---
Sounds good to me, Warlock is a lock... then
---
Well that was thorough. Upwards pointing arrow it is!
---
ye, Payo is nowadays the most fun/entertaining classic streamer out there! POGASINDACHATTAH! (pls dont get me banned :D)
---
Pilav however....is fucking annoying.shit stream (it almost kinda feels like is all content is basically talking shit about others likes he¬¥s some kinda of all knowing god of wow.) more so, hes fucking voice is annoying as hell :) always screaming and shouting (get dat dick out of ur throat m8! just my 2cents, the dude actually has alot of viewership.
---
Can you name a few other funny things, I'm curious.
---
Release day is the 10th, so tomorrow. Since it's not a patch, no clue when they flip the switch. Dire Maul was up in the morning, honor system unlocked at 8pm.
---
not a patch.
---
Nope
---
&gt; You cannot blame this on human nature, because human nature is unchangeable and known to everyone, including Blizzard.
---
My *nine year old* nephew understands that if you are a dick to others *for any reason*, especially for your "own gain", then people will stop coming to play with you.
---
This isn't a hard concept to grasp, and it's baffling that everyone wants to put the *entire* blame on Blizzard because they aren't far enough removed from the game because it might mean that they won't get a R14 title *that 99% of players will never even get in the first place*.
---
People in this sub have gone crazy about retail for years. How *unsocial* it is. How it's *not an MMORPG*. How they want their *realm communities* back. How back in the day *reputation meant something* and you are held *responsible for your actions*.
---
And now that the situation arises and it would be a case of saying: "Yes, maybe we went a *little overboard* while playing this make-believe game to the detriment of others.", you're trying to push all the blame on Blizzard. They are *equally* as much at fault as the people who see a post about &lt;Leftovers&gt; and decide to be 12-hour-NEETs and gank them into oblivion and *purposefully* destroy an entire server for some short-term gain.
---
Blizzard was the one who gave you the "get a biscuit but someone else starves" button, but the people engaging in this behaviour "for ranks" decided to press it 10,000 times.
---
To enter BRM you can try invis potion... Will save you one or two death maybe
---
Well, personally in early ranking (where we are now) I would rather be a dwarf to counter blind - and wear spider belt / ornate mithril. 
---
The punishment from wearing those gear-pieces is more punishing as you get more gear.
---
Well I guess it would be you as I never said he is stupid I just said he looks stupid. 
---
And this is exactly my point btw, it wasn't a mistake.
---
19% miss bonus with DW
---
In retail at least, you can still get to your character select screen without a subscription, it will just say (inactive) or something like that.  Give it a try.
---
If it infuriates you that much and make your gameplay so miserable, why not play on a PvE server? Wouldn't that solve all of this?
---
It is not a surprise this could happen on a PvP server.
---
Yes it is fun, and it will be even more fun once BGs come out ;)
---
And as stated already, back in Vanilla there were less people, and that meant less hardcore guilds going for PvP.
---
These days even if only 1/10th of people on a server were super hardcore farming honor than that is still 1000-1500 people at peak time farming honor at flight paths, instance entrances, on the way to them, etc.
---
Back in vanilla, if 1/10 of people were pvp orientated then you're only looking at maybe 200ish people doing that, it's a huge difference in numbers when the world is still the same size so it's just not reasonable to state that just because vanilla had FP campers and boat campers it's exactly the same when it really isn't when you change the variable of players on a server.
---
Nah. But they can dual wield aswell.
---
You don't have a threat issue, your tank does. If he can't do decent threat he needs to step up his game or be replaced.
---
There are way more people on the server. Back then a 40-60 meant there were maybe 600 people more on one side. Now it is easily 2-3k. 
---
Also because of free transfers the problem got worse.
---
Yeah I knew that, sadly doesn‚Äôt work on classic :/
---
Me and a friend started our accounts on Stonespine 1.5/2 months ago.
---
STV was 80% horde, also roaming 60's every now and then.
---
Tanaris was pretty shit too, around 70% horde. We had a 60 warlock camp us for an hour in full tier gear.
---
After hitting 50 we stopped questing as all the end game zones were camped except for Un'goro.
---
Leveled to 60 in instances.
---
Nope, Vanilla had no phasing like this. A similar system was only added in Wotlk.
---
A month from now it wont be bis for hunters. It will be bis for warriors for more than a year. Warriors also dont get a dps tier set so they remain in mostly prebis gear for a long time and get 5 or 6 items from mc/ony while hunters replace everything but trinkets. Warriors are also a better dps class while hunters are mostly used for utility in raid. Like this argument is so stupid. This is why people shouldn't post reddit comments with zero thought.
---
R e r o l l T o B o om k i n
---
Thanks kind sir!
---
Most dont kill people coming from the flightpath but rather those moving away from them and kill them once they give honor.
---
Ah right you are, otherwise we might maybe have gotten keyring - edited. 
---
I still don't think it changes the timing though, as it's set for Dec 10 that sounds a lot like typical patches which are set according to US time and thus go live in EU early on Wednesday, historically speaking.
---
Man, this sub has some top notch analogies. This one isn't has good as the guy comparing PvP to slavery but still pretty good.
---
I fuckin' love it.
---
Just remove the useless posts like "EKSDEE I CLEARED A DUNGEON AND IT WAS DIFFICULT LOL I LIKE SOY BTW" Thanks.
---
Thank you! (:
---
It's a change, made by blizzard to host classic servers on their current (low cost) infrastructure (and to allow the bigger server caps).
---
Deleted parent comment:
---
The honorless debuff doesn't mean shit to these players. Hell, Blizzard could make it so that honorless players award 10DHKs per kill and they'd still camp those areas. All these griefers care about is griefing.
---
By Synli
---
AV for rep and fun tower defence but wsg for pvp and honor.
---
&gt;every few months/weeks this gets posted and everyone is still surprised
---
I browse this subreddit daily and have never seen this.
---
Googling it, I find a single reddit post, from 3 years ago, with 73 upvotes.
---
Yeah wasn‚Äôt like this in vanilla, it‚Äôs something they changed in legion.. tbh I really hate it somehow :(
---
short answer no.
---
you have a tps issue, there's more to this problem than i can solve. but a short bandaid fix is to communicate with your tanks. if you're popping reck, ask them to rotate taunt/mocking/challenging and make sure you bring lips. be aware that bosses going forward are mostly untauntable.
---
for me, in regards to sunder vs normal rotation I do one of each and just gague the "time to kill".
---
Absolutely hilarious.
---
&gt; wPvP is the most fun part of vanilla
---
spends all day in IF as horde
---
"world pvp" lmao
---
Woosh
---
Why is that the prevailing opinion? Dire Maul released tuesday the 15th as well in Europe, honor system also same day as in the US.
---
Not much "driving out" you can do. You can kill them repeatedly but they'll still one-shot one unsuspecting victim before they die. Unfortunately, it's an effective honor farm. 
---
Aside from that, capital cities should be a zone of piece.
---
I had a post about Faerlina yesterday that ended up with a good discussion.  Feel free to check my post history about it, but it is likely that Faerlina is about to tank when  the streamers leave.
---
I play Mankrik PvE and it is the only NA PvE server that is horde heavy.  The horde side is quite active and healthy.  Lots of groups and pugs going all of the time.  Still tons of people leveling alts etc, starting zones are buzzing.
---
idk man its not that expensive... but that comes from a rogue who gets like 35 40 gold per hour from brd pickpocketing sooo idk
---
&gt; You won't get 40+ ppl in a guild pvping
---
except in like every normal guild?
---
there is no pvp stat in classic so every one who wants to pvp is going to raid
---
&gt; are we thinking honorless is an unclear mechanic that works in mysterious ways?
---
No? But since you said:
---
&gt; i find it quite funny how they make sure to pop all their cooldowns to kill me with the honorless debuff
---
I wanted to make sure you know that the enemies cannot see if you are honorless or not, unless they have a mage with them. So from their side it might look like a perfectly legit HK for them.
---
And for the other topics where you complain about people doing X method to farm honor. People will ALWAYS go the path of least resistence, ALWAYS. If there is an easy way to do it, people WILL do it, its always been like this. If they are not getting much honor, its their own fault. I dont know why you mention that they backpeddle and keyboardturn other than being salty, if you think you're better than them, okay. You dont need to get some kind of higher moral ground.
---
still a thing. Think it's like1.8k AP?
---
Oh boo, sorry.
---
I mean, if I go fury/prot - with tank pieces ready. Can I still get by as 3rd "tank" / OT? I want to show that I can DPS but when needed I want to tank to get the guy out of his position. I'm worried that basically if I go fury/prot or full fury I won't be able to do that and my tanking vision will fade.
---
Yes!  I remember that now.
---
At one point when a pally can get enough crit, it switches around (so too if you have world buffs), as your most expensive heals become almost free due to how broken pallies are.
---
I recently got an Owl and benched my Cat for now. Looking to spam dungeons for a while and wondering which one I should take?
---
I can see the debuff from screech being useful for the tank but worry it will cause aggro issues for them. Any thoughts?
---
You‚Äôve no idea what you‚Äôre talking about lol. You could play two hours a day and get rank 10 eventually. so no you don‚Äôt need 28 hours a week you fool. And it depends on bracket capping on the faction please stop taking nonsense.
---
But that is exactly what pvp servers supposed to be. I understand camping flight points is asshole behavior. But taking control of instances is actual in spirit of pvp servers. If you think that is bad then you clearly chose wrong when going for a pvp server.
---
From what you just read I enjoy doing, knowing that I am actually a lawyer in real life, I'd let you use your imagination to fill in the blanks.
---
Almost half of the entire alliance from lucifron transferred to HS, because Lucifron was way to "imbalanced" with Horde 60/40 alliance.
---
Now Lucifron is 68/32 and HS which was almost balanced is now 24/76.
---
Good job.
---
Every content released was delayed by one day for EU? just a suggestion?
---
Probably the most I miss from retail, playing my paladin as Horde :(
---
i could believe that
---
if your horde just raid in arms. mc is faceroll.
---
Errr, wut? What's the rationale behind your post even, that BE attracted more casual players to the Horde on top of the hardcore PvP crowd?
---
Because it's only tryhard and wannabe top level players that are rolling Horde for racials on PvP servers right now and skewing the balance, not the average player, and guess what, Orc and UD racials are by far the best racials in TBC too, since warrior / warlock / rogue are the top classes.
---
\&gt;Makes game unplayable for the other faction  
---
\&gt;other faction leaves for another realm that favors them or is at least neutral  
---
"WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?!
---
Average honor-hunter player doesn't understand simple cause and effect. It is too hard to comprehend for them.
---
yeah, really looks like it. although they are all just toxic spergs..
---
&gt; "rewards"
---
The 'personal milestones' AKA boomers with 80 hour workweeks who post they've reached lvl 34 after 3 months of playing are even worse content imo
---
[You got it, chief](https://giphy.com/gifs/jennifer-lawrence-thumbs-up-ok-Fml0fgAxVx1eM)
---
Wrong on all accounts, try again
---
Lol using tab for targeting. For pvp it's a better ability keybing you target with mouse.
---
It‚Äôs important. If your faction controls the instance entrance then that means people of your faction can get easy access to said dungeons.
---
&gt; Tell me again what progress they're losing
---
Levels. Money. Currencies. Epic mounts. Gear. Skilled professions. Rare recipes. Rare enchanting materials. And the list goes on.
---
Most ppl would say use cat
---
Why use a levelling guide when Classic is 50% about the levelling?
---
I thought we were relocating to TB?
---
You can check combat log..
---
&gt; I believe two pvp realms at launch was enough
---
- Blizztard
---
Flights points are one of those great places youre talking about. Who knew
---
You wouldn't be able to tab-dot or tab-sunder or whatever else then.
---
What would be the point of it if it stayed on the same enemy? Why do you want a keybind that does literally nothing?
---
How do you intend to make every PVP server 50/50 if the whole balance overall on all PVP servers is shifted to horde as much as it's shifted to alliance on PVE servers? If you suggest forcefully bring alliance from PVE servers to PVP servers in order to make them balanced then I am sure alliance won't appreciate the idea.
---
Considering the people on my server being in Ironforge are usually top bracket I guess you‚Äôre very wrong.
---
If anyone thought that pvp servers would be anything different than how they are now you're dull. With how the honor system works its obvious that people would camp like crazy and the dominate faction would make the other faction unplayable. Wow is an MMO, honor is just another grind. World PvP is some of the worst content in World of Warcraft, you either have a dramatic advantage or you're at a dramatic disadvantage there are rarely fair fights and one party always feels cheated.
---
For what its worth, Blizz definitely sees all the complaining happening, since they addressed the "honors getting lost between 2-7am" issue. Lot of people are just desperate that the company is okay with the current state of the game which makes it even more infuriating. 
---
And to be fair the "any other content" you mentioned are just badly crafted memes anyways.
---
No i get it and im not saying those things arent great and i sympathize. But it is a capital city and i am hoping you can action enough people to take it back and it shouldnt be that hard. We have defended a few raids of people coming in before with lower numbers.
---
That is simply not true.
---
Dude finish reading the post before you prove you're a brainlet.
---
Who killed ~~~hannible~~~ alliance
---
Op's talking about something else than MC duel.
---
I had a dude doing the exact same thing yesterday, a horde priest mc me and made me attack a civilian and then a horde rogue helps take down the civilian.
---
They didn't make it and I was wondering the same.
---
Not for the blue pieces. Only for Epic. And T1 gloved give +2% hit. which is quite huge.
---
We noticed discrepancies on Healing/DPS on Onyxia after the "Spy fix", not before - or maybe we were not looking close enough before. Hard to say at this point. 
---
At the moment there's one of our 3-4 resto druids and one hPriest who offer real competition. Current content and fight length allows healers (shamans at least) to go pretty much full-out without OOMing, provided they pop their MTT, mana pots and runes as needed. Playstyle will probably have to be adapted further down the line when fights drag out. 
---
That said, on fights with little raid damage and just some tank damage, there's really not much for me to do when the priest or druid blankets tanks with HoTs and then spams quick heals on them. Give me a good Luci, Garr, Geddon, Harbinger or Domo with some raid damage and it's on!
---
Game was designed 15 years ago bud. #nochanges
---
no people that was alliance in vanilla took horde now, because of racials
---
Ya assuming all else is equal, like weapon skill level and talents. It's 5% chance to miss against level 60 players or mobs. Skull mobs count as level 63.
---
how do you want to drive them out? no matter how often you kill them they just rezz again
---
BG honor is actually the fastest. Trading in BGs would be the ultimate but once bgs come out all the traders will be in the bg.
---
They lose world pvp which is a tiny part of classic. BGs are coming out and now they have all the world's resources for themselves. Pretty much nothing has changed
---
and dwarf shadow priest is also insane strong
---
it must be Very surprising and confusing how someone zoning out of an instance or just lending has a honorless debuff.  
---
i think i should be the one feeling bad for not giving honor to you and then 12other zugzugs
---
It would kill it now.
---
You essentially want to make a stupid system in which half the alliance players and half the horde players cant find good Battlegrounds.
---
When this guy was young, he sucked at everything and his parents and teachers thought he was trash, so he slaughtered ants with a magnifying glass, shouting ‚ÄúfEeL mAh pOwAh‚Äù after each kill.
---
Now he works a shit job in a small cubicle and his boss and love pillow think he‚Äôs trash, so he logs in to IF to slaughter AFKers, shouting ‚ÄúgO To rEtAiL‚Äù after each kill.
---
One day he‚Äôll die and nobody will notice.
---
Sooo - you are saying it is very possible - OP is just dogshit at the game? :D /s
---
Practice makes perfect - as with most things - right?
---
I swear some of you people are gonne be the first records of gaming induced PTSD
---
i think ohhgee made a video about wsg strats.

he also has some "high level" footage of the games he played.
---
you could probably look into that :).
---
Well whatever you're probably right. It's not like Alliance is doing the same thing...oh wait that's what this whole thread is about. But you're right, Horde are jerks
---
The point of the game is to enjoy yourself. If you‚Äôre no longer having fun, how much time you‚Äôve played is a non factor for future decisions. 
---
Think of it this way, day one WoW has a net present value of 100 fun units. At the end, you‚Äôve used all that fun, and any more you play, will be unfun and unenjoyable. You then make a new decision, to maximize future fun, and time previously invested is not part of that calculation. Humans tend to want to do this, hence the well known and well studied logical fallacy.
---
Well I went through a list of all abilities and these are the only ones you want to skip. There's also some utility stuff but I think you want those usually. Mind soothe is very handy and you need to level it up or else it stops working on enemies past a certain level, and mind vision rank 2 is amazing.
---
When you're geared to the teeth and fully worldbuffed rage generation goes through the roof, so much so that you often have to actively try to avoid wasting rage
---
thing is 40% of allaince = pve or rp casual playing human, if alliance was playing this game for pvp, they would do dwarf / gnome / druid, like apes
---
I have over 40 days played on one character and a second 60. I rerolled PvE and I'm so happy.
---
funny how you can make honor while not having any
---
It wasnt as bad before they opened transfers. Without transfers the worst servers had 30-70 balance. Only because of transfers this 5-95 stuff came to be
---
I heard that Mograine is pretty good. What is the world-PvP like? Might give it a go.
---
Well you only need to look at retail. At one point 92/100 top guilds were horde. What do you expect classic to be?
---
Allies on Heartseeker weren't getting enough wpvp because Horde were just sitting in their cities. Well guess what, now they've been camping the flight tower in Org for the last week or so. ZZZ.
---
My first ever experience with blackrock depths in my life was tier geared Alliance 10 man squads killing every level 54 that tried to get in. This was in phase 1. Don't be so smug.
---
I don't know but going by BG queue times back in vanilla .... servers weren't very balanced.  There is a reason I rerolled from alliance to horde back in vanilla and the 1 hour BG queues factored into it.  Horde on the server I rerolled on were instant queues.  Overpopulation and people being honor-crazy due to late-patch PvP gear that is way too good for this phase is what is making world PvP so shitty.
---
Haha I played a hunter in legion too.  I wonder how many fuck up were due to this.
---
Why I miss BC and 25 man
---
I'm sorry, I though this game was called world of WARcraft
---
Yeah especially for me at a low level. I will probably have a hard time finding people for groups and dungeons. What do you think about Mograine? I will probably give it a go.
---
You can switch continents just as easy as us from Ratchet / Booty bay...
---
Faction queue wit transfers open would be better
---
The issue is getting way too uptight about a game and being unwilling to forgive and forget. People are shitty sometimes, but most aren't shitty most of the time. In my experience, it's pretty rare to find that person that's an actual bag of shit. I would say the longer your blacklist, the more toxic you are.
---
Stop telling me I‚Äôm an asshole because I roam around instance entrances and flight paths, I want to rank early and that‚Äôs the only way how to do it consistently. It‚Äôs not fun, but what shall I do? Stop it and dismiss my rank because you can‚Äôt deal with it? Obviously no, blame blizzard for the super increased realm players caps, not the player for the broken honor system.
---
Everyone that played some kind of Pserver knew this would happen and a lot warned you, you should roll PvE, but you didn‚Äôt listen. It‚Äôs not that different from Pserver experience, be happy you can‚Äôt queue for BGs from anywhere in the world.
---
Aaaah so all these whine posts are jokes, okay buddy
---
&gt;  I am not sure why blizzard should change something when they explicitly were asked not to.
---
You are the one proposing changes here, mate.
---
&gt; Being Blizzard, I'd introduce paid transfers and paid faction change then let the community regulate itself.
---
Yeah I watch my bro shit on a mage last night the 3k exacute was just the icing on the cake.
---
Atiesh alliance checking in.
---
Can y'all just leave us poor protection warrior tanks alone please? :P
---
That rarely happens, nobody spends their time killing honorless targets
---
have a weak aura that shows my mainhand swing timer and it changes colors if I have heroic strike or cleave qued. as soon as the timer runs out I que heroic strike and keep it qued until right before it runs out again (if I dont want to rage dump). the only times I "mess up" are if hoj procs and it's usually not even a big enough issue to matter
---
What possible use is any of that one that server?
---
Nah they just on reddit to get mad at this point.
---
I think you and me have different definitions of what pvp servers are supposed to be and what counts as "asshole behavior", then. And if we're speaking of "in spirit of pvp servers", then you could make the bad argument that literally any interaction where players are set against players is "in spirit of pvp servers". 
---
As for my realm choice, on the days when my game time is limited, I kind of regret my realm choice. On other days when I don't have as many IRL obligations and can waste time corpse running and fighting to get to a location, I don't. 
---
Cheers for your input.
---
can someone copy pasta that into a readable format?
---
For most leveling dungeons, "LF1M Need tank, summon ready" is a lot more lucrative than "LF1M Need tank". For endgame the difference isn't as big.
---
Yes

The only joke is the whiners making the posts :DD
---
Wowhead should display where all the rich nodes are in ungoro. There‚Äôs about 15 total spots and only 2 are live at a time usually. They are all located on the south - south west area of the map. About 5 on the boarder, 5 in between bottom of map and volcano, and 5 around volcano. 
---
I just do a counter clockwise loop around to each node and if nobody is contesting I find 1-2 nodes per loop. I always try to farm early in the AM when less people are on, but if you‚Äôre on a high pop server it might be a bit too tough at anytime of the day to get the route to Yourself.
---
should make them able to reroll other faction
---
 I just got done a fight, was half health, I saw this troll and knew i'd end up in a youtube video so I killed him. Lol. its Game.
---
Yes, that is true. But until then it is the best, if not only way to gain honor.
---
Well fair enough.
---
I see it the exact opposite :D
---
I love that the fights aren't that difficult and interesting because it leaves a lot more space for fun mistakes and interactions. 
---
I am a very social Player and just love to make fun about other raid members and have a good time :P
---
While BC defenitely also offered that I found the raids to take more concentration and less time. Leading to less fun interactions Overall and less bonding with guildies.
---
So everyone has their own Cup of coffee he gets off of.

It‚Äôs not that hard to take the cities back but, again, with the numbers, that‚Äôs all you would be doing. Asking the minority faction to stay in their city and fight back against invaders is a different game and not the way this one was meant to be played.
---
The game is broken right now.
---
That was a long time ago as far as reposts go! I didn‚Äôt see it, and its useful information.
---
You sound like a white guy trying to convince a black guy that he has it rough. Sincerely, a white guy.

So let people be shitheads without consequence? That's almost encouraging more toxic behavior..
---
 wait.. Im the toxic one now because I actually have a list of ppl I refuse to play with because they are total shitheads in the past?
---
So beeing at the top means its funny, tha fuck you on about? The upvote button is not a "this is funny" button.
---
Kromcrush ally here. The server is def getting better in terms of balance lately. At its worst it was at or per 60/40 but it feels closer to 55/45 now
---
Legion is the best expansion.
---
And what about the sub 50s trying to get to BRD? Every group I have been in dies 5-7 times minimum getting there
---
&gt;If a game is the only thing that matters to you and the only place where you feel like proving yourself to others then toxicity seems hard to avoid.
---
First of, props to you for successfully finding an alternative way to vent.
---
I myself am a rather uncompetitive/calm person, so I never understood why people just didn't type toxic stuff. Until I read some of the experiences from toxic players in league. Some of them basically said that they removed their "enter" key, so that they weren't able to send whatever they wrote. They sounded like really good guys out of the game and very reflective about themselves, but still couldn't prevent getting extremely agitated by league-stuff. And those were the people who actively knew they were toxic. I think there are much more people that don't even think about their toxicity, but disregard it as normal or other people being overly sensitive. Still not overly excited when playing with toxic players, but at least I think I now have a little insight in their struggle to remain calm. Anyways, wish you a fun and non-stressful playing experience and much fun/success in the gym.
---
Those items have a much much longer cooldown than EA. Those might fly in wpvp, But in battlegrounds they basically become a non compete. And even in wpvp I'd rather eat a full blind or wait for poison cleanse from a shaman or paladin than give up being able to totally remove indispellable hamstrings/imp hamstrings in organized pvp.
---
I see what you did there
---
There is no imbalance if there is only 1 faction!
---
64% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
---
Although I get your point, having 200-300 active Horde players move alliance would be painful for Flamelash. It is already "borderline acceptable" how much time it takes to find groups out of peak times, not sure we can spare losing more players.
---
We should merge with an Alliance dominated server for an ~even, full server... but there aren't any really in EU.
---
oh right ok in that case they dont need any loot then because the content is so easy right?
---
its about showing effort
---
So the rationality is that those players should feel punished for a problem *they* didn't create?
---
Yea because all the comments are just pure laugh huh? This is a whine post dont get it twisted
---
I understand what you're saying. Stone form is strong. But it isn't one minute cooldown escape artist strong.
---
They aren't "forced" to do anything. It is *entirely* possible for them to chose not to.
---
It is, I usually play kinda late due to work, but between 23:00 - 02:00 BRM was mainly controlled by the horde, but several 5-25 man ally raids kept on fighting. Also I heard some horde crying about a 40 man ally raid controlling winterspring.
---
All in all, I'd say its probably leaning towards horde (as most realms) but its a constant battle between I'd say, certain zones tend to be kept by the Horde more often and others by Alliance. I don't think there are any servers that are more balanced than Mograine, probably same or very close but highly doubt anyone is more balanced.
---
I'm on PvE now. It's a shame, I loved PvP during phase 1, but wPvP as it is now? No chance I'm playing that.
---
Cross-realm makes BG‚Äôs faceless ppl
---
I think this is an unpopular opinion, but here goes.
---
Am i the only one who hates when people cite faction ratios on servers? 
---
My logic is, the numbers don't come from Blizzard. They all come from third parties who do not have all the data. Therefore, they are inherently inaccurate. To cite them as basically gospel is naive. 
---
Furthermore, when people talk about a 40-60 server, or something to that effect, it irks me. You don't run into all the people on the server at the same time. They aren't all logged in, and three ones who are logged in are spread out around the world.
---
It just seems like 9 times out of 10 people who talk about faction imbalance are just whining and making excuses. Bitching for the sake of it. 
---
Ready for the downvotes.
---
If you've got a long list of people, possibly. I don't have one, because it would take something pretty extreme for me to "blacklist" a person.
---
The plan was always to release the BGs "early".  Just like them did with Dire Maul.   They're releasing tidbits of content regularly, so that they can entice people to stay subbed.   Arathi Basin will come early too, just wait and see.
---
whats the addon for class colour bars and class symbols :)?
---
&gt; I dont think anyone has ever disputed that 
---
Yuh-huh

---
That's a really good point, havent seen it that way before tbh
---
It wasn't. Dire Maul was on the 15th of October. When I came home from work that day and logged in, it was already available. 
---
The news that the honor system is available wasp soted at 19:00 GMT on the US website, Honor system was avaiable at 19:00 GMT in Europe as well. 
---
Every single content release was simultaneous in WoW classic so far and until a content release actually requires a patch, I'm pretty certain it will stay simultaneous.
---
The satyrs in Hydrospawns room are great XP once you can do them.
---
Yea, it's like people can't mouseover the party interface to find out where the others are. And somehow most seem to think that everyone else in the party can make it to the dungeon faster than they could  themselves, and with greater enthusiasm.
---
well you see rogues have the advantage of choosing what fights to fight 
---
so naturally you would choose the most efficient ones 
---
a hunter (who can reset the fight in 1 click and run away 30 yards) is not something efficient to gank as a rogue
---
Its currently at about some 13 people atm..
---
Bro I've read your responses to this thread and I think you're severely mis-remembering dailies in TBC.
---
There were 3 sets of daily factions: 
---
1. Netherwing, rewarding Netherwing drakes.
---
2. Shatari Skyguard, rewarding Nether Rays.
---
3. Ogrila, rewarding catch-up gear (which was largely not worth it).
---
All of them were cosmetic things and mostly limited to content for casual players to do outside of heroics.
---
They went on to add the Shattered Sun Offensive dailies, which had some pretty decent rewards but largely functioned as a catch-up mechanic on top of MGT heroic loot and new badge loot.
---
For most players, dailies didn't even exist. I was a top level PvE and PvP player for most of TBC and the only faction I ever got past friendly was SSO because I thought their tabard looked cool on paladin S4/SWP gear lol.
---
Don't get me wrong, I also hate dailies and despise how they make games feel like chores, but TBC dailies were the perfect way to do it, just optional content for people who don't have the time to get into hardcore PvE or PvP. I hated them and never had to bother with them, unlike later expacs where they became a primary source of gameplay.
---
Horde camping alliance: "lol looks like pvp happened on a pvp server. Go back to retail! lok'tar brogar m i rite bois :)"

Not so fun being on the receiving end now is it?

People really regurgitating this like they know anything about BG queues lmao

Deleting, making new char with same name on other acc works

Okay nicee
---
Welcome to reddit, you have so much to learn :)
---
Everyone: we want this old game!
---
Blizzard: releases game
---
Everyone: this is horrible!
---
Guy was wrong though. This is the rank 13 requirement. You need 320 or so for rank 14.
---
Made my day :D
---
I mean... just get the macro that prevents overwrite of rejuvenation? Regrowth is only for emergencys since it cost so much mana
---
Imagine getting so buttblasted over people minmaxing. If ppl wanna speed clear then let em speed clear whats ur problem
---
This. As a prot warrior trying to get to dungeons (where I make most of my money in game, as mob grinding is basically a chore with my DPS output) being farmed is more a nuisance than anything else. I literally cannot compete 1-1 with casters, I've managed to kill a few warriors and rogues, but I don't do enough damage to be a threat to anyone.   
---
Running to dungeons now is just a gauntlet of 10-20 enemy players zerging me and anyone else. I don't think BG's will change this behavior.
---
Can I finish BWL attunement now ? Or it is not ready yet ?
---
Im playing on a very balanced server and all of this is kinda hillarious. Its fun to poke the bear too
---
World PVP is ganking people that are at 10% with your 5 rogue friends. Nobody needs FAPs for that. BG PVP now that is something different.
---
You have last stand over bank ? üòÄ
---
Ok, so those are 13 people you've decided have no redeeming qualities and they possibly feel the same way about you. It just seems silly.
---
So you farm the world for weeks and expect a free faction change and get short bg queues? 
---
Though luck, highly doubt blizz will do anything about it. But with BGs coming out, it's not that bad tbh. Only issue might be AQ opening but you always have the option to reroll you know.
---
Facts hurt
---
Yea Mograine seems good also.
---
 52% Horde and 48% Alliance
---
- dream server if it's true but take the info isn't super accurate always.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/overview
---
When aoe-farming ZF GY most of the mobs get stuck in the pillars at the boss and can only be attacked by melee. How can I aggro then from range?
---
Did you watch the same clip I did?
---
This was nowhere near bad lol. All Allies were not in a big group and similar level plus the rogue in the end 1v1-ed him, OP just decided to not fight back at all for some reason.
---
If this is infuriating you should come to STV on my server where there's regularly several 60 Horde camping Nesing killing lowbies.
---
It depends on how it does rounding. Do you have a source that supports it always rounding down? At least the wiki claims it rounds to the nearest whole number, meaning 167 should be enough for 1 spot in BR1.
---
And it sounds like he won't miss them since he's willing to move on from a toxic guild.
---
Guard presence in cities should increase as enemies are spotted within its walls. Eventually it should get to the point where guards have long range stealth detection, and strong ranged attacks and snares like goblins do now.. guard presence should become so dense that a solo enemy can‚Äôt exist in the city.. Then they should go away after some long amount of time, maybe several hours.
---
This allows raids on cities but will make camping impossible.
---
i see alliance people trying to kill people in OG all the time on a PvE-Server. I see people flaming other hordies for not killing these alliance players. And my only thinking is: Why are you PvP Flagged on a PvE Server, if you don't want to PvP?
---
Still it's a kinda "dick" move. I was in tarrens for some pvp, hs to og and got killed instantly, because i was still flagged, lol.
---
&gt; Outside of faction imbalance 
---
99% of PvP issues right now are related to faction imbalance. Make an intellectual effort dude. 
---
I am on PvE now. If telling people they should have picked PvE is your excuse to be an asshole, let me tell you it's not a good excuse.'
---
Allow me to spoil the illusion. Pss. I'd argue hes got just 1 left.
---
Im not arguing. I wasnt home back then so i thought it will go like usual.
---
None, all of the gear you got from dailies was Heroic dungeon level or lower. They were okay for slots where you had some super sucky item, but really, if you were doing the dailies, you were doing them for the fancy mounts.
---
Oh damn, sounds like a solid trickly lil play
---
ok good, he won't miss them, they won't miss him
---
We had a hunter that ripped aggro on ony and then had no mana to FD. (It was made VERY clear that threat is the #1 concern in this fight beforehand)
---
Tell me, do you invite that person again? Are you that altruistic?
---
Grieving the enemy to the point of logging or leaving the zone was considered a world pvp victory in the last.  Making them abandon their character and leave the server?  Ultimate victory.
---
I think you missed the point I was trying to make. Yes controlling the instance portal gives you an advantage, both in accessibility and honour farming. The point that the poster of the thread tries to make is that this is an arsehole thing to do because it is not necessary to do it. So yes, controlling the instance is better than not, but if no one were trying to [control it], and if no one was participating in massively unbalanced PVP combat - then there would not be a reason to. Therefore I think the point stands, since this is not a limited resource that necessitates control it is arguably arsehole behaviour.
---
Legion arena was the best ever. More spec flavour and comp diversity than any other seasons. Only Mists has an argument against it.
---
I'd actually put the blame of this situation on blizzard. They should have released BGs with the honor. Every successful private server released BGs with honor.
---
If the argument is that they want to recreate the wPvP of honor without BGs, that's just dumb. It will never be recreated, since back when honor launched in vanilla, it took a moderate amount of time before all of the camping strategies were formed. And still most people didn't even know what the rewards were. And the rewards of original honor were worse, we have the naxx patch versions in classic.
---
There was no way in hell, that this could have gone well. People knew to prepare for honor, farm consumables, best pvp gear, form teams for it, pre-plan how to get to the top.
---
BGs should have been in P2. At least WSG.
---
So much this, both are garbage in their behaviour. A leech and a Carpetbagger.
---
Not the sharpest tool in the shed huh? These guys thinking a human will change his entire personality based on a fuckin team in fantasy game. Use your brain once in a while why dont you
---
Yes. You've never done something you regretted in your entire life?
---
Transfers will come back, but with more attention on the faction specifics, since that tech was released in the middle of the last transfers. Once those are running again, they'll turn on faction queues.
---
You people are an embarrassment to the concept of adulthood. This is the most childish shit I've ever heard, if people can get this blindly tribalistic over a fucking video game so much so that they actually think there's any difference between Horde and Alliance it makes me weep for the real world.
---
I feel like it's too late, the method (not that Blizz could have known) would be to initiate server caps on particular factions.
---
E.g. If one faction has +X number of players more than the other faction (perhaps 500? 1k?) then disallow character creation for new players on that faction.
---
Merge back with Stalagg.
---
I‚Äôm def interested if you wanna share the love.

Those rets living the 2004 live

If he's practically begging you to join then you probably have the upper hand in bargaining
---
You can probably negotiate a situation where you only join if you're on and feel up for it.
---
No, you‚Äôre still an asshole. You are right here saying you want something, and to get it you don‚Äôt mind giving others a miserable experience. That classifies. You don‚Äôt have to be sorry, but don‚Äôt pretend you are bound by some invisible chain to do what you do without choice. 
---
You want to rank up and it can only be done through camping and group ganking which sucks for the other side. Fine. You still participate.
---
Well it varies by week/server of course. I got 95k on Mankrik H last week which was Standing 2. Starting tomorrow the numbers will skyrocket anyway though so it‚Äôs irrelevant going forward, aside from dealing with the people that have previously cheated this way.
---
People who have 
---
A: Ninjalooted. 
---
B: kicked partmembers to get their buddies freebies for last bosses. 
---
C: generally been insanely toxic towards other players. 
---
They probably dont feel shit :P Cause they dont care.
---
But its incredible fun to remind them of that situation when they "didnt care" and suddenly dont get a spot :)
---
Oh snap I'm on Kurinnaxx. What a place huh?
---
I've seen alot of "qq pvp happened on a pvp server" have you been on this sub in the past 3 weeks?
---
I never admitted to being a racist. And I‚Äôm not a bigot. Anyone can have their opinion. Including you. Doesn‚Äôt mean I have to like your racist opinion. So fuck off with your racist ideas back to the Donald where you belong. Your white supremacy idealist world is failing and you know it.
---
Private servers lived through fine. Just because they never allowed people to transfer characters out. Choice was done, you either leave the game completely, or play through it. 
---
Were free transfers available during original vanilla pvp phase? Pretty sure no. Blizzard changed it and now is making players suffer consequences.
---
Its an interesting study in human nature and how an incentive can have horrible follow-on consequences.  
---
PvP servers were great before honour was added. Logically, adding honour should have just increased the amount of wPvP, but it had the followon effect of turning some people into what can only be described as sociopaths, which in turn made many others reciprocate, snowballing into what I can only describe as a maelstrom of madness and evil where people do bad things to eachother without any remorse or empathy which many feel justified in defending.
---
The entire faction consists of fewer than 25 people. How the fuck are they supposed to drive anyone out?
---
Yea i was a normal student before i started playing WoW. Now that ive played as a Horde, im a serial killer in real life :)
---
Sadly yes but we won't have to deal with this kind of post
---
We clearly do not encounter the same kind of player then.
---
first rule of the fight club. you don¬¥t talk about the fight club
---
No, demoshout does flat threat to all mobs hit, since bshout is a buff it splits the threat between all your targets.
---
Bloodfang is an English pvp server, and it's as even as you can get it I think.
---
They shouldn't be getting stuck unless you are hiding after you pull them, or are dying. 
---
Any (well, almost all of them) zombies that are stuck will be aggroed when you pull another grave on the same side. If you have trouble dying, you might want to save 2 graves on the bigger pull so you can free these zombies.
---
Says the horde player.
---
Thats not the point genius
---
Ehh I just see locks as another dps.   You have pros and cons, so you are nothing special.
---
rename the servers then... anyone who expects anything else but ganking is delusional about the game and the human nature
---
No, that's just the way they walk.
---
Yeah, your roommates are sociopathic dudes that only can enjoy power over the others in a game that requires you to be a no-life.
---
Sad isn't it
---
NugEnergy seems to be the most common one.  
---
Its measures energy ticks.
---
Because most alreyd stack on them
---
 Wait till bgs come
---
But then you didn‚Äôt release tab to show that it works....
---
I‚Äôm going to go on a limb and say he‚Äôs an Undead Rogue
---
It was very clear from beginning that faction imbalance is the problem and not "the horde".
---
Show me one Ally with more than 2 brain cells who says "The Horde players are the problem"
---
Are people really calling outside of portals trying to gank rezzers?   Pretty pathetic.
---
Thank you for sharing. I would never have figured that out.
---
Advertise is like 14 years old and has been caught like 1000 times stream sniping. It‚Äôs against twitch rules and blizzard rules. The absolute irony of people in here complaining about asmon GUILDIES *possibly* cheating vs. advertise being caught cheating multiple times and you‚Äôre all asshurt and defending the actual cheater. If asmon‚Äôs guild is cheating, that still isn‚Äôt asmon cheating. Advertise has been caught, like I said, cheating just about every single fucking day. He‚Äôs a child who tried (and has failed pretty badly) to make a career out of griefing streamers. He deserves the twitch ban a YouTube ban for targeted harassment. He deserves a perma blizzard ban for the same in game harassment. Deal with it.
---
From my experience the most toxic players are those that just dont have any balance in their lives. They live for the game and as such take it so serious that they become defensive, bitter and angry if things dont go their way.
---
If you want to translate "kys fucking trash player" into real words it would probably be something like "Fuck you for ruining the only enjoyable thing in my life. My workplace sucks, my family sucks, I have a hard time socializing so this game is all I have and you are ruining it."
---
I spent half a year of my life as a shut-in NEET between quitting university and starting a real job and during that time I had no real friends, no girlfriend and no real social life to speak of. Thats where I found online games as my only outlet. Thats where the toxicity began.

old blanchy is a pve server. You can create characters of both factions on a pve server.
---
Arms is better for pve than fury for pvp. If you want the best overall performance, play arms
---
Well did blizzard actually opened free transfers to allow people "escape" pvp? They were trying to fix queues, but instead they ruined the server balance completely. If they were concerned about fate of those strugglers they would open ally only in-bound free transfer.
---
Mouseover macros are a lifesaver for DOTs (at least on retail, I seem to remember them not working when I was checking out classic so idk if you can)
---
The thing is, you care this much... Why, it's a genuine question. This is his life and he is making it a good life right now. He is doing this stuff in a game, a game he makes insane money from. He is aware that he can do what he wants and his guild don't care, why do you.
---
Healers also get targeted first at least you have plate and bubble.
---
Fury warrior can go nuts with salvation, without several tanks reserving taunts in case random windfury proc that will get aggro on him.
---
Druids benefit from Blessing of Kings, but not from windfury.
---
Blood Lust is a nice raid cool down, but it arrives only in TBC.
---
All totems need to be in range and work only on a group. Blessings are raid wide doesn't limit your movement.
---
Lay of hands can pull out these desperate tries when you need your last tank to stand little bit longer to finish thouse 2% of boss HP. 
---
Bubble can save from certain death mechanics.
---
Missed a question mark there, bud. Wouldn‚Äôt expect a horde player to be smart enough to know basic punctuation, though.
---
Helping the idiots like me who fat finger
---
Flag carrier is fun! I played a mage at 60 and did a fair amount of premading. There were plenty of times when I got to do flag caps that were extremely exciting, though ideally our druid would have ran it with me peeling.
---
I have no problems with queues (I didn't logout until I was level 60). I explicitly rolled on a "dead server". I knew, from privates, that mega servers in classic absolutely suck. I wanted the real classic feeling of a small tightknit server community. Heartstriker was exactly that for a solid two months. I loved it. It was quite obvious, for everyone except Blizzard, that classic will not be dead after 2 months.
---
Unfortunately, Heartstriker was the target realm for (almost) every other German realm. Transfers should've been closed with the start of Phase 2, Blizzard overslept it and it absolutely ruined Heartstriker. 
---
I'm not rerolling. I have 3x Level 60s with BiS or Pre-BiS gear (my priest has literally every pre-BiS item on the bank and 6 pieces tier 1 + bene). So do my friends. 
---
We're hoping the situation will improve with BGs and wait for paid transfers to get the fuck outta there.
---
My brother who has in part been the one keeping me in the loop about the situation asked what the ally to horde ratio was, he was mindfucked by how it wasn't 70-30 ally because of how it seemed in big zones as he  was leveling his alt 50-60
---
Lots of players play PVP for the rush and risk. I mean some people my self included have played PVP MMO's where you drop your entire gear on death, now thats risk and rush.
---
Whats the worst thats gonna happen in WoW if you get ganked? They are gonna corpse gank you? Just dont ress, go do something IRL, the players are ganking them selves by waiting for you.
---
Your username is very fitting. You're a colossal idiot.
---
&gt;give them busted racials
---
Belf racial was like a tier 2 racial at best, WotF and Hardiness were still king in a game dominated by warriors, warlocks and rogues.
---
&gt; (paladins, who were seriously buffed for TBC) 
---
Paladins were unarguably the biggest losers of TBC, at least as far as PvP is concerned. They had 0 competitive comps, they got destroyed by RMP, they got mana burnt to oblivion (both DPS and healer), and its only unique utility worth bringing (Judgment of Justice vs druids) was really nothing to write home about.
---
The class just didn't get anything as useful as what other classes got, and ret was in a particularly bad spot before it was reworked in 2.3.
---
&gt; an exclusive skill that is outright OP and makes pala DPS good right out of the box (Seal of Blood) 
---
Seal of Blood was a pretty big deal, yeah, but you never really brought a ret paladin for his personal DPS contribution anyway, the small damage difference wasn't the end of the world. You brought the ret paladin for Judgement of the Crusader's extra 3% crit chance on the target and keeping up the other paladins' Judgments up indefinitely.
---

---
Hahaha epic autocorrect
---
And in my guild it‚Äôs based on performance. And I as a hunter preform better then our current warriors. Later phases it will be literally impossible for me since warriors scale very well and hunters very badly.
---
I was the first one given the head after our tanks.
---
Ah the good old blizzard forum poster spreading like cancer to reddit, I see.
---
Obv. Only free race changes towards the servers minority faction duh.

could have sworn i've seen one a couple of weeks back. could be a comment or somewhere else i guess.. boomer memory
---
Well....when i was fighting the rogue at the end. he trinketed out of my fear so i dotted him up and then he silenced me. I thought my only option to come out on top at the time would be to kite him to some mobs and get a second fear off and hope he gets aggro. Didn't work out. 
---
I could of came out of shadow, healed up and carried on fighting for sure. Captain hindsight.
---
Your right though, it isn't so bad, infact its probably the best kind of ganking, that most people hope for when compared to getting done over by a gang of 60's
---
Check out the tests done here.
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Threat-Mechanics#battle-shout-testing  
---
You can see that when you go from 1-2 targets each targets threat gets halved making the total threat the same.
---
&gt;And to be fair the "any other content" you mentioned are just badly crafted memes anyways.
---
To you. A healthy sub has everything for everyone.
---
Part of the magic to vanilla wow is that everyone actually likes all the jank, bullshit, and instability. I agree that there needs to be some tuning to emerging problems but I would hate sweeping balance passes. You can play retail for that shit.
---
Well in that case you could do a macro like this:
---
    /targetenemy [noharm]
---
I believe it would have the same effect - if an enemy is targeted do nothing, otherwise target nearest enemy.
---
No you can't
---
He could also be a very successful manager in some bank. He's an ass all day long to anybody under him and boss around his team constantly but his team is full of good workers that get the job done anyway and he get praised for it.
---
Every day he come home cursing the world and saying his team is not good enough and how he has to do everything by himself. Then he sit at his desk and kill those trash ally for hours because he's the very best.
---
Why would he ever change since life has been good to him all this time. He must have deserved it.
---
The name blocked out in red is Pss.
---
No need to block character names, it isn't against reddit policy, and who gives a crap about subreddit rules.
---
Okay now it's a 40 min run instead of 45min
---
You have no idea how often this happens on Skeram.
---
Perfectly balanced
---
I was living a lie...
---
Suck a fart out of my ass
---
Nah the vast, vast majority of players will just no-life AV as usual, which requires 0 PvP skill. Besides the flag re-capturing heroes, the most useful players in an AV game are those with the highest PvE DPS for the boss lol.
---
What exactly would be the point in replicating those patch changes? 1.12 is the most complete version of the original vanilla WOW game. I see no issue with them sticking to it.
---
Go on, answer this guy
---
My guild is helping on Sulfuras for our Ret Pali. I my self contribute with Dark Iron and what ever other mats I get to help him out. 
---
We also do jump runs in DM to farm ore and crystals for our MT. 
---
Its not req but since its 15-20min of time, I normally help with it. 
---
Same for Blue sinue and eye for priests. 
---
TF and Sulfuras are considered guild weapons by us.  We treat it as such such.
---
Nice ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù. I take it you‚Äôre the type to run away whenever you see an enemy player around your level that you don‚Äôt outnumber at least 2:1. Oh who am I kidding? Of course you are, you play horde.
---
How dare he play the game according to the incentives that Blizzard provided, and for which he pays a monthly fee. The nerve!
---
The only toxicity here is from people like OP and others in this thread whining about what a loser he must be irl.
---
? phase 2 really wasn't that bad. This is just a example of loud, stupid voices in reddit, and how history repeats itself because people have the learning and adapting rate of a potato.
---
Considering there are currently ferals doing good dps I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a stretch. Granted they are outliers who expend a ton of effort farming before raids and know the rotation inside and out, but it is doable.
---
Zug zug, horde ganked and camped so much the other faction on flamelash that the alliance transfered to enjoy the game zug zug people noticed it and now make fun of us.
---
Lo'ktar sad.
---
Ah, i thought you were implying getting the tank was a bad move, makes sense now.
---
They opened transfers to allow people to "escape" getting camped by gank squads everywhere they went.
---
Also in bound transfers would have been useless. No one is gonna transfer to the dead ganksquad server lol
---
#Nochanges wasn't about having a 1.12.1 state from the beginning.
---
If it was for the #nochanges People we would have a normal patch cicle like it used to be.
---
It was Blizzards Interpretation or realization of #nochanges in a way where they save resources and Manpower. 
---
We only have 1.12. because Blizzard or actiblizz are cheap fucks that didn't want to invest too much into classic and decided not to put patches in....
---
And even that they didn't do properly.
---
IMHO the biggest Problem of classic is Blizzard not putting any Money into it but expecting everyone to be spoonfed with shit that is nothing like classic.
---
If we have anything then it is #plentyofchanges
---
Which sucks
---
what lvl have you got?
---
Generally the saying goes, if everyone you meet is an asshole, actually you‚Äôre the asshole
---
I bet the situation wouldn't be so dire if Blizzard gave us modern locations of spirit healers making corpseruns much shorter.
---
But this way after getting killed twice the most tilting thing really becomes the subconscious awareness of that long walk no matter where you die.
---
Really waiting a minute or two for a resurection isn't even bad because you can step away from the screen and breathe for a bit but walking that distance to your corpse just to die a minute later is insanity inducing.
---
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1202915804100079616
---
This very much depends on the gear though. With enough of it a prep rogue can kill you in a stunlock &gt; blind &gt; stunlock even if you're SL.
---
That or ret pali buff the dmg!
---
Lots of people not liking the drama of the last weeks, but ive enjoyed it. Flamelash exodus was cherry on the cake. 
---
Classic is not getting enough new players, PvP is great at getting new players to quit.
---
Chimney Swifts are hyperactive. They just fly-and-fly-and-fly-and-fly as if their life depended on it. They're perpetually airborne. I've very rarely seen one land.
---
We had one find it's way down into our house during my single-digit years. It was a fun time.
---
Our family lived in this old house - built in the late 1800's - and it had an old, red brick chimney that climbed up through the center of the structure and out of the roof (obviously). The whole of the structure was long buried and made useless behind walls constructed over the years but the phallic tip still hung proudly erect over our home.
---
Crumbling, but mostly intact.
---
But yeah, we had all sorts of Chimney Swifts that nested in this thing, they would circle the house and yard and neighbourhood throughout the evenings and into the night eating insects and would just keep circling through the air until it was too dark to see their shadowed bodies anymore.
---
Nighthawks evolved far better with this tactic than Swifts and can go longer into the night - until their white markings are burnt by the darkness and reduced to charcoal - but yeah, Chimney Swifts.
---
One of these things made its way down into our home one quiet evening, somehow.
---
I'm guessing through the chimney.
---
I can't remember exactly how old I was, but it was surely in the single digits because double-digits me would have remembered this differently.
---
We chased this thing around for what seemed like hours, in and out of every room in the house. If you know anything about Chimney Swifts, these things love to fly and hate to land. And if you know anything about humans you'll agree that we as a whole hate to deal with things while they're still moving unpredictably and prefer for them to stop. We also hate waiting for this preference to be achieved naturally.
---
We tried to wait it out for a bit against our primal instincts - let it get tired and perch somewhere - but no, this thing refused to perch.  
---
Of course. As a Swift should.
---
Swifts just fly-and-fly-and-fly-and-fly-and-fly.
---
Swiftly.
---
We eventually resorted to holding salad bowls and cooking pots up in the air like butterfly nets trying to catch this erratic thing in mid-flight, but again, this bird is called a Swift for a reason and saw our concave traps rising to block its path in slow-motion. Lumbering into the sky like celestial objects. I'm sure.
---
Anyway, it eventually cornered itself in the bathroom behind the shower curtain. It circled and circled within the condensed space - trapped - and eventually rested its never-ending flight upon the showerhead. Contemplating its next move.
---
Finally sensing an opportunity, we crashed the plastic fabric around the tiny bird - quickly, dramatically, but gently - as a family.
---
It wasn't a hard-fought battle, but definitely a long one that tested our reflexes and endurance. We left the bathroom victorious - Swift flapping around within the shower curtain - and returned the bird to the sky, where it belonged. Free from walls and barriers and the confusion of rooms.
---
I don't know, maybe afterward we made popcorn and watched a movie and laughed about the whole thing wholesomely, as a normal family might.
---
Honestly, I can't remember, but let's just say that's how this little diddy ended. Let's go with the popcorn finish and a lesson learned. A sitcom-style dilemma solved with bowls and pots and a shower curtain.
---
The bird was returned to nature. Problem solved.
---
It was safe now to continue flying eternally in meaningless circles until it finds the entrance to death's door on its own.
---
So, about as safe as any of us are in this life.
---
unrelated but why do Shaman show up as pink in the search box? They should be blue.
---
Well, since Blizzard won‚Äôt publish numbers it‚Äôs all people have to go off of. And maybe they are inaccurate as far as exact ratios or numbers but they allow us to get an estimate. Mostly the ratios shown seem to be close to correct when you play the game. 
---
Faction Imbalance is a massive issue in Classic currently. It‚Äôs not whining to point to the obvious fact that servers are losing people fast due to one side dominating the other and not allowing them to play the game. This isn‚Äôt theoretical, it‚Äôs happening right now.
---
It's 3 alliance, no skele's,.  Not an issue at all.
---
We still get patches like bgs reignited my interest in the game again (hopefully not just the hype) but I think you don't understand why #nochanges came to be simply by not trusting Activision see where that brought us? Exactly a big change.
---
He wasn‚Äôt able to keep up the teddy bear facade forever. The cracks have begun to show for a while now. Dude can‚Äôt handle the idea of not being classics sweetheart.
---
What this sub taught me is that no, victim blaming certainly isn't dead in 2019
---
Heartstriker went from a "dead server" to being as big a server as Lucifron or Venoxis (based on concurrent player numbers).
---
In my experience players generally aren‚Äôt insanely toxic by themselves, they were just the one that was caught on screenshot in the middle of the conversation
---
They don't dominate every PvP server. Theres been plenty of posts showing alliance camping ogri on horde dominated servers.
---
Im now a level 13 human paladin called Humanscum, nice to meet you!
---
so... 13 shitheads out of hundreds and hundreds ive played with... and im the asshole now?
---
Then if enough people call him out he‚Äôll defend himself in the comments.
---
Yeah, I‚Äòve been saving graves to get them unstuck, but the. Occasionally I‚Äòve unlucky with 3-4 empty graves :D. 
---
Will try though, thanks!
---
Dont confuse FR with the crafted ony back. The crafted ony back is req or you die to shadow flame. 
---
FR is /vendor!
---
haha yea mate spot on ! it was the running back that pissed me off the most ! all that time to think about what you did wrong and how your going to get your revenge only to get fucked over again lol. Good times !
---
I use Shadowed Unit Frames
---
Rando alliance player happened to be walking by unguilded when i was buying a mount, gifted him 10g without saying a word.
---
Always wondered if that made his game a little easier.
---
Yes. And I suffered the consequences of my mistakes.
---
I don't mind players making mistakes. But at some level I draw a line and say enough is enough. It also depends on how hard the task at hand is.
---
Here it was "Just whitehit in phase 1". That means this person
---
1.) Disobeyed orders or didnt listen (happens)
---
2.) Ignored threat meter (happens)
---
3.) Didn't have the foresight to keep mana for FD (happens)
---
but you know, all 3 of those after being explicitly told what to do
---
In the end our ony raid would have been BETTER if that person wasnt in the raid. So why bring him along?
---
World pvp not a thing. Duels not possible. Arena melee cleave mongo bs only. Most braindead pvp ever that represent everything that is wrong with new wow pvp. Ohh and DH inclusion as cherry on the cake.
---
&gt;They opened transfers to allow people to "escape" getting camped by gank squads everywhere they went.
---
Did they? Because the only reason officially listed is lined to queues. They never did express any other goal of free transfer system.
---
&gt;With restarts at 3:00 a.m. CET on Tuesday, all WoW Classic realms will be set to a single-layer. We expect some realms listed above to experience long queues after this step. We especially encourage players on Firemaw , Flamegor , Gehennas , Golemagg , Lucifron , Mograine , Sulfuron , and Venoxis to use the Free Character Move service to avoid excessive queues.
---
Dude do you ever read stuff before clicking?  Sonyd is using a 3rd party program that lets him change his character model. Stop cooming or you‚Äòll get brain seizure.
---
Even if you lay out the patch history and roll them out approximately per vanilla time frame, it wouldn't change a thing because these patches are known as well. It's still a paved road.
---
And the situation when someone can erase their memory to relive some moments from the past with whole fresh emotions is something you better pitch to Black Mirror team (unless it's been already done there).
---
Your opinion is irrelevant. You can think the millennials (posting FAR more often than boomers) with 80-hour workweeks and taking the game slow is worse content, but other casual players enjoy it. You can think the tryhards tryharding is worse content, but other tryhards appreciate it. You can think fanart is worse content, but others appreciate it. Even the P2 salt has a place. But domination of the sub is bad for everyone.
---
I figured I'd answer since I'm one of the people in the video killing you. Basically, I want to get rank 12-13. That gear is amazing and will last a long time over the life of the game. 
---
The first 2-3 weeks of Wpvp, I never went to IF. We'd roam hours and hours flying from zone to zone never finding any alliance, apart from the odd 3-4 pack of people or maybe a 10-15 person raid, eventually the alliance always get overran by like x2 their numbers, they hearth out after dying 1-2 times. 
---
As horde we die but would never port out to avoid a fight, we want to fight, even if we lose, even if we get crazy outnumbered by the allaince, we know some horde will slowly flow in and we will eventually win. We need to fight constantly to stay up in honor. 
---
After the first couple weeks, we started adding all the top pvpers, Onslaught, etc, we see that they are just in IF all day, everyday, bar a couple hours here and there at BRM, and its like...well fuck, we can never get that much honor, so we go to IF...
---
There isn't enough of you guys around in the actual leveling zones. I don't like it but your 60's get a lot of honor from us, till we DR at 5 deaths. We Die a lot, corpse dragging is a part of WPvp, if you let it get to you, dying in general in a pvp realm, your gonna have a bad time.
---
I am waiting to see how does BG affect Firemaw, if it stays the same I will be leveling a character on PvE server myself!
---
All I can ask is that you just grow up because this is honestly and incredibly pathetic view if you actually take it this seriously
---
Pretty sure their goal is to pump out as many new mounts \[to the store\] as possible.
---
This. In original WoW people didn‚Äôt understand how much better Horde racials were for PvP. This time around they did so most people rolled Horde for PvP. Simple as that
---
No. Let the community stew in what they did. 
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you shouldn't.  It isn't world pvp to kill a level 51 going to BRD 30 times, knowing after 5 kills you get 0 honor from them. 
---
Just because world pvp exists doesn't mean you turn into a violent sociopath killing everything that moves, a child who takes care of their toy will enjoy it longer than the child who breaks it with a rock and demands another.
---
Pyrrhic victory, by all accounts.
---
No, this won't fix the issue it's not it bei g 60/40 it's 
---
Not having enough servers to begin with which results 10+ classic realms to be in one azeroth (over exaggerated but you get the idea)
---
This is completely besides your Point and post but why do you Phrase it in a way that makes it seem like Classic is actually dying?
---
There is dying Servers but there is a majority of Servers which are fine Balance wise. 
---
Classic is not going to die. Some Servers already did. But classic will Keep going :D
---
Yeah I was bit bored of the game because of how dead it was and impossible to get groups for anything 12-14 hours of the day even on weekends.
---
 /who any 55+ instance and all empty was always a tragedy
---
If it was one mistake (especially if they apologized afterward) then yes, I would. If they do it repeatedly with no regard for the strategy then I'd agree. But once is a mistake.
---
not prebis u can get a green helm of wrath with 41
---
ofc on alliance it should go to the ret
---
Hillarious~ 
---
I really cant believe people are pretty much defending toxic/Griefing  behavior in wow xD
---
Please tag this as rant.
---
Better to take a ret pally to ensure you get full buffs.
---
Seal of Wisdom also accounts for a serious boost to mana return.
---
Same with seal of light.
---
Classic isn't all numbers, utility is fine too.

---
I'm certain this happens frequently, and TBH any warlock who gets to the entrance of a dungeon before anyone else is a seriously good bro.
---
Oh boy a 10~20 minute queue for a BG, so terrible.
---
Not really, I regularly spend more time than that running back to my corpse multiple times after being killed by alliance honor farm squads on the way to dungeons.
---
This is literally painful to look at.
---
To be fair a lot of fellow hordes recognizes that Alliance is endangered species now and won't attack unless attacked.
---
Very hard understanding written text if it is riddled with grammatical errors like yours ;)
---
Warlocks are the 2ond best utility class in dungeons after mages (but have a higher skill ceiling). You don't compete with tank for gear, so you will be on the priority always.
---
Wow nice tip time to pick it back up again!
---
They were pink in Classic
---
I like the idea.
---
Yep, said it before, numerous times, this is mostly Venture's fault.
---
They camped DM, Tanaris and Plaguelands with coordinated killing squads... What did the Horde do? Go to BRM to attack the small groups because it was the only place we weren't steamrolled or go to IF to farm honor from the unorganized people there (only see this happening last week though, maybe Venture had left by then).
---
Holyprio, Retprio, and Func can also use a break from sitting in org for 10+ hours
---
Horde = evil, brutal, genocidal murderers
---
Allaince = merely enacting righteous revenge
---
I am not sure what you are asking.
---
Are you wondering what instance to spam with your owl, or are you wondering which pet to bring to the dungeon spam?
---
MCP is more like a consumable than it is a weapon - youre going to be using a normal wep 90% of the time
---
Well yes that's the official PR reason but in most alliance player's eyes the transfers were for the dwindling alliance population to relocate to more balanced servers
---
Errr I hope you are trying to troll on purpose because otherwise your reading comprehension is surely something. I would like you to pay more attention on this particular part. 
---
&gt;  some necessary changes to avoid queues but doing something to create queues instead is unlikely 
---
See?
---
Yeah, I don't think its a coincidence that they released the honor system RIGHT as the 3 month subscription people were about to expire (if you subbed to save your name - I.e. I was in that boat).  They are going to keep releasing shit, right before people's game time expires to make people invest in that extra month.  This is here just to make money, and we're throwing it at them.
---
\*Note This assumes that people signed up relatively close to the name reservation day.
---
Also, at least right now Arms is perfectly fine for the PvE content as long as your raid has no ambitions regarding the MC speedrun competition.
---
For the love of god the community can stop sucking the keybind and minmax train train as well.
---
I understand that, but my point is that its clearly not enough.
---
The bots I mentioned have been active since the start of phase 2, and will likely be until after phase 2.5 is introduced on the 10th (tomorrow!). Seems rather silly to just let a bot run for an entire portion of a phase
---
It's because Paladins are pink. And since Shaman and Paladin are faction exclusive they say them to be the same color (which is why BC changed then to dark blue)
---
Yes, I helped with this testing. This is before the blue post that reversed the way demo shout and battle shout were functioning. This page has not been updated since the beta. Thanks.
---
I'm saying if everyone start blacklisting everyone for every infraction (real, nor not) you end up with noone grouping with anyone.
---
Hi, /u/Spreizwangen
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e89ota/as_a_60_rogue_what_is_the_best_hybrid_spec_to_pvp/). 
---
Cant help but wonder about the global, inter-PvP-server Alliance to Horde ratio. What happens when we discover that there are three hordies to every ally? 
---
The obvious solution to this would seem to be faction transfers handed out similarly to the realm transfers, but this is a whole 'nother can o' worms.
---
You know 15 years ago there was the same situations and no one complained or tried to fix it.  We all just played the game and had fun.
---
How can I repost this to /todayILearned 
---
?
---
so basically everyone was removed from martdoncals except for you? ok boomer [https://streamable.com/s3vs2](https://streamable.com/s3vs2)
---
You‚Äôve corrected my grammar on reddit I am LAID LOW 
---
Accurate username though. Correcting grammar on reddit in 2019 lmao.
---
Ok so do you have a more specific estimation time-wise? When do you think they will do it? Next month? Phase 3? In half a year?
---
Well yeah, but I died 2-4 times running through BRM to BRD before phase 2 as well so that's nothing new lol
---
5-7 sounds like a stretch though
---
It's my personal opinion that this is the beginning of a spiral.  Servers dying 3 months after release is a pretty serious red flag.  I don't think mine will die, I play on a PvE server that has been untouched by the cataclysm of phase 2, but most of the PvP servers are seriously off balance and I think intervention by the game developer is needed.
---
Typical person on any kind of forum on the internet,  complaining about a problem he himself  is core part of.
---
It was the same color as paladin in Vanilla. They changed it to blue in BC when they made it possible for both classes to play together.
---
Nahh if they say they will keep the server as classic I will quit after I beat AQ. I wantes TBC from the beginning and simply took what I could get until they get to TBC.
---
As all things should be
---
Afaik the mob is there, but won't drop the quest item.

It's PVE dipshit

LOL, horde player mad. Classic.

I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, if I was having a conversation with someone about WoW and they told me they were a horde player I would just walk away. Nobody wants to associate with you bitches who make the game hell, except for yourselves but you guys are worthless IRL anyway so it doesn‚Äôt matter. And for that to happen a horde player would have to go outside in the first place which isn‚Äôt gonna happen.
---
Stereotypes exist for a reason and it‚Äôs because you guys are pussies who are obsessed with ganking. That‚Äôs all there is to it.
---
Alrighty guy, keep making assumptions.
---
Man, you are ALL OVER this thread. I'm assuming you were an asshole that got blacklisted. Deal with it, or stop being a terrible person.

:Thinking emoji:

Depends on a BG queue but of course BG is better.
---
Add to opposite faction 3-5 more people vs only you alone. Thatstype of leveling on my server :D
---
What is great, you get timer for ress like "u suck at pvp, lets punish u noob"
---
Ah, pss, the loneliest rogue on Flamelash
---
One of my bullets dictates that the new PvP servers would be closer to vanilla population levels.  You are right that the massive servers has a lot to do with it, but the point was addressed in my post.
---
yeah ur fucked
---
Healers are the least important role to gear up in classic. More dps means a faster boss kill and less healing required. Having enough dps even allows you to skip entire phases of fights in classic. Healers also dont take nearly as big of a performance hit as dps do from being under geared.
---
It was 38 / 62 before consensus addons were nerfed.
---
&gt; That's not what i said, i'm surprised you managed to write a full paragraph about my thoughts on the issue from a 1 line suggestion.
---
It was two sentences?
---
I don't think server queues and corpse camping are comparible. I also had to RDP to my computer a couples hours before I got home to play.
---
thx a lot !
---
Ok go ingame right now and show me.
---
That doesn't mean much as ferals don't scale well with gear.
---
To be fair most people ive encountered from that horde guild are dickheads, so not surprised.
---
No one to blame but allies. See ya flametrash allies.
---
Wrong. The servers are almost 5 times larger today than they were then. A faction imbalance would have been less noticable with a 3000 to 5000 server. Now it's up to 15 to 20k. Larger servers = more noticeable differences.
---
Usually it's a guild officer being extorted to either kick someone or they publicly try to shame your guild to make people want to leave.
---
Yeah, I remember. Each expansion decreased the mana back from crit heals, because it just made paladins too powerful, hehe
---
The mistress / pool-boy would be the guild/friends you hang out with on the 'other server' :P
---
never too late to join the superior faction.
---
Over read that one then sry. Did you mention how many you'd make?
---
Rattlegore is decently balanced
---
/u/a34fsd BTFO!
---
How will he EVER recover?
---
&gt;Faction Imbalance is a massive issue in Classic currently. It‚Äôs not whining to point to the obvious fact that servers are losing people fast due to one side dominating the other and not allowing them to play the game. This isn‚Äôt theoretical, it‚Äôs happening right now.
---
 That is a different issue to me than the typical "my server is 60-40 wahhhh" post i see. 
---
What you talk about is worse than imbalance. It is an exodus. 
---
But a server that is stable, even if it slightly favors one faction, is fine and date i say, healthy. 
---
However, another side-effect to all these people talking about how horrible a 60-40 server is, is that other people start to believe them, which in turns leads to people leaving the server or unsubbing entirely. I'm other words, people are exacerbating the issue by making it into an issue in the first place, and by whining about it. 
---
I'm going to go on record right now and say it'd these population websites didn't exist, there would be significantly fewer servers who have an actual issue. 
---
There is a reason why Blizzard originally broke the functionality of the census addon (*before* they broke Spy, might i add).
---
Well, there's Ironforge... And that's about it.
---
The fact that you even play FO76 just makes me laugh though.
---
&gt;The obvious solution to this would seem to be faction transfers handed out similarly to the realm transfers, 
---
Agreed on this part, and the can of worms too.  I really like the faction conversion idea, I would be tempted myself to do it.  However the biggest problem with this is Paladins and Shamans.  How would they work in faction conversion?
---
You are not complaining about faction imbalance but simply ganking on a fuckin PVP server...
---
Most complaints I have heard were about Classic servers being overpopulated but now I see the complaint about dying. Hilarious.
---
I think most of the mentioned suggestions are pretty good as-is. I'll focus on the one I that really disagree with, #5. 
---
Faction-specific forced queues could result in some pretty skewed and horrendous ques that interfere with raid times if you have guilds on one side who are communicating and coordinating raid times around popping Onyxia's head for the buff, or just if you happen to have a lot of people from the same time zone who raid at more or less the same time. Just based on my own experience it seems 3-4 guilds on our faction have our raids aligned to more or less the same time (and that's on a Medium/High realm, far from Full) whereas we very seldom encounter anything bigger than a few stray BRD groups from the other faction inside BRM at that time. On larger realms, it's feasible that this would be exacerbated further - you might end up postponing your raid times ad hoc if a change such as this was set in place. And sure, you might say "just change your raid times", but you're talking about 40-80 people per guild shifting their schedules - which might already be pretty packed. For this reason (a PvE issue as a consequence of a PvP "fix", that is classic) I think this would result in more problems than it would fix.
---
Thats what i thought.
---
Ineligible. Lol. 
---
Or we wait until BC Classic to fix everything.
---
Also lol.
---
lmao, blame the players for the broken system, really cool mate.
---
Are you sure that's not just a talent thing? Several classes have stun resist talents, but outside of that I don't think I've ever seen it happen.
---
I agree that guards should actually be able to guard their havens.
---
You're just talking to a wall with the #NoChanges people. Let the game burn, #NoChanges.
---
No because they are using this trivial content to prepare gear and consumes for the non trivial content. Wasting your gold now is a bad play even if you have 10k+
---
You're playing on a pvp server for sure. a retail pvp server
---
Do you also do the vaults?
---
My buddy just got to 59 and he does the pick pocket run while watching streams or playing MtGO and makes some good gold (avg 45-60/per hour). 
---
He picks /vendors and opens vaults for the coin purses. 
---
He also likes to pick off the gnomes just before golemlord. He is very lucky though and has gotten some nice trash drops from the gnomes.
---
Sorry! Lets just say that it was really the gnome getting baptized. Lol
---
Well that is the mediocre way :)
---
Best way would be implementing also seal and weapon twisting lul
---
For example you have an macro to switch between a very fast weapon and nightfall lm
---
You need an addon for swing timer to see it.
---
You use for example an 1.6 attack speed sword. Like flurry axe.
---
You also use Rightouness 
---
In the moment when flurry axe hits you have a 0.5sec window to change weapon to get the proc of nightfall thanks to spell patching.
---
Your first hit would count as flurry axe but your Rightouness would count as nightfall.
---
This means you hit every 1.5 sec with nightfall.
---
Nightfall normal is 3.4 you half that thanks to righteous = 1.7
---
It sucks mate, but as you've said yourself you must have known this was a risk. Classic is a game of kill or be killed, with 3 capped chars i don't blame you for not re-rolling. I would suggest the next alt you level is on a fresh server though.
---
Atleast then you can see both sides of the classic experience.
---
Even the Old Gods themselves fought amongst each other.
---
Well, opinions I suppose, but to me nothing is worse than this huge cryfest. Reading a salty post once in a while might be fun, but reading nothing else is really driving me away. For me personally the only thing even close are the 'look at my cake' kind of posts...
---
Ah, that makes sense. Thank you!
---
I always expect those are quite the neckbeard type of guys. It's not faction dependant if you're an asshole or not. Both factions have these pvp assholes. Somehow players find it funny to make the experience of the other faction hell once they can. And it's easier to do if there is a huge faction imbalance, because who's going to stop you? All players are assholes
---
Hahahaha
---
Fuck yeah dude I just want to quest and explore the game, make some friends and have a good time. Glad to have rerolled on a PvE server. I salute every horde I see.
---
I like where your brain is - presenting potential solutions that is.  Level boosts or XP boosts would be altering game mechanics, which I don't believe blizzard will (or should) do.  Again, that's just my opinion.
---
No I defenitely agree with you on all Points.
---
Also I don't just mean you - People just tend to "overphrase" their titles making it look a bit clickbaity. 
---
You said yourself - PVE Servers are mostly untouched by this - why must we make "classic survive" then? It is not even dying.
---
While I agree that a lot of PVP Servers are unbalanced I would say only a very few are actually dying. And that will be fixed I am sure!
---
PVP Servers that have a 60/40 Distribution are still healthy and thriving. 60/40 isn't that bad honestly. It was just a shit Show without BG's but they will fix a lot. Not all of it but a lot. (Im hoping) 
---
But yeah Blizz Needs to do something for a couple of Servers for sure. The Problem is that we cannot have all pvp Servers balanced because there is too Little alliance. 
---
Quite hard to solve
---
Hunters only need it for the attack power, and the Dire Maul trinket is better than HOJ in that respect. So, as of phase 1.5 the hunter bis is DM trinket/Blackhands.
---
you have to start a cast then cancel it to bait out his kick. he wastes energy and you can cast with impunity.
---
&gt;it's about being faster than everone else at leveling and getting the reputation/fire resist beforehand as well.
---
They did it without a full group, with mostly greens and not everyone being max level.
---
Here is the thing about your "analogy". It has a few logical fallacies which is how you try to make a dishonest argument and still lose. They are easy once you know them so I'll break it down. You started with a straw man argument. You made up a point that I wasn't making in order to seem like you were right. Then to top it off you added absurdity to make the argument you made up seem crazy to make. Its an incredible pretzel and I'm a little impressed you did it all without noticing.
---
&gt;Your argument, when you break it down, is "It's morally okay to be an asshole to others when there is an incentive to be one and there are no ramifications." That is essentially what you're saying when your defense is "It's in the game".
---
This is where you made up a point then claimed it was mine. I never even hinted its morally OK to be an asshole. Its actually the opposite. My point is that its not being an asshole to PvP on a PvP server. The game actually creates safe zones in the world where you can't PvP and they even created servers for people that would like the option to avoid PvP in the open world. Choosing to play on a server that allows PvP then being mad at the PvP happening is just childish.
---
I have a few other favorites to this pretty obnoxious post
---
&gt;Selling your ex girlfriend's nudes, viewed largely unethical but not actually illegal, with a monetary incentive for you.'
---
That's actually illegal although more recently than it should have been. Its called revenge porn and its both immoral and illegal. 
---
&gt;Stealing something when there are no security cameras / police around, aka the perfect crime scenario, where you never get caught. Most people view theft as immoral, but in this situation, why not?
---
Again still illegal. The idea of a perfect crime or even more a victim less crime is still a crime.
---
&gt;All of those things are technically "in the game" that is life, but most of us understand them to be unethical and frown upon them.
---
This again is not a thing. I think what your attempting to refer is "griefing". Its a category of behavior not explicitly stated to avoid but still wrong to do in a game. PvPing on a PvP server is just not on a list of no no's. If the game were played only on PvP servers you may have a point but again its completely by choice people join PvP servers so you can't hold it against the other faction for PvPing. But 10/10 for a fun read.
---
It means when you win something, you get a +1, meaning everyone else who didn't get anything yet have a priority over you.
---
Here's a good suggestion for you: Re-roll on another server if you want world pvp.
---
yep same here
---
we also knew the other sides big honor farming group and would get in their voice server, we kept a running tally or who was sitting out the games, and all took turns doing it, 
---
we also would just go at it depending on the time of the week and where we were with honor 
---
then xserver came and fed it all up
---
Asmongold reacts to Nixxiom reacting to Bellular reacting to Esfand taking a dump in a Taco Bell bathroom.
---
I don't know what the fuss about coordinating hots is. I play a resto-druid and my parses are ~90% healing-touch.
---
With a bit of math it becomes very clear that both HPS and HPM of HT are superior to Rejuvenation and Regrowth.
---
To me those are PvP-Heals or for the rare situations where you have to move while healing.
---
In Mana-intense-fights Innervate feels like the best spell there is. For someone with decent spirit-gear it's worth around 2 Major Mana-Potions. And if you compare the HPM and HPS of HT and GH of the priest, they are really quite close.
---
Druids may just look worse than they are in fights that aren't really mana-intense because other classes have faster heals. In fights with clear responsibilities and one healer per tank, I don't see any significant disadvantage to other classes because there I can actually time my heals just like in 5-mans without being afraid of being sniped into overheal.

Probably around 8pm like Dire Maul
---
Ok, so, lots to unpack here.
---
First, combat is not the stun lock spec. If you want to stun lock, you want to be subtlety. Subtlety gives you access to Hemorrhage, which is a cheap way to rack up the combo points for a 5 pt kidney shot, as well as Dirty Deeds, which reduces the energy cost of cheap shot. While you don't need these things to keep someone locked down, they make it far easier and rely less on cooldowns.
---
Second, if you're opening with ambush, then you aren't exactly trying to stun lock them, are you? Cheap shot is the stun lock opener. You open with Ambush against low armor targets (cloth and leather, except druids in bear form) and then yes, backstab, in an effort to kill them before the can react. If you fail this, you may be in for a rough time as they then begin to kite you. There are ways around this, but I won't go into the depth of rogue pvp, as it is quite complex.
---
Against tougher targets, cheap shot is the better opener. It's also a safer opener in general, as it focuses more on keeping an opponent locked down then in pure damage. It's really something you have to feel out, rather than can be taught.
---
Breaking: Rogue camps capital city
---
Maybe shitty given the context, but find a server that doesn‚Äôt have an enemy rogue on either side in Ironforge or Org
---
Hehe, you're not wrong :P
---
RIP Flamelash.
---
yeah blame the rogue for faction imbalance. so fucking stupid
---
We sell the sulfuras blocks and buy arcanite bars for the gold.
---
That's how we finance our thunderfurys.
---
Yup though its nice since you can just log off instantly before landing. I actually created a huge ambush on a server I play on because of FP camping. Had a bunch of people log off right before they drop down then we hit them and broke the camp. It was insanely fun and something that wouldn't be possible except on a PvP server.
---
&gt;His bugs seem to have a longer melee range than the videos I‚Äôve watched
---
So those will have been videos from private servers, which had incorrect Melee Leeway.
---
Look for videos done recently, in Classic, not Vanilla or Private servers.
---
Otherwise, the best I can offer is the wowhead comment section, from patch 1.12ish, so patch relevantish comments.

Now be honest, did you fall off the plank in booty bay or did you happen to right click on me, while I was wearing my big bulky furbolg costume, stealthed in the flight master body, causing you to attack me and getting killed by the guards?
---
Or you use nightfall only.
---
Add crusader to improve attack speed and twist to rightnouess when the weapon hits = manacost high but you get 3.4*0.6 /2 = 1.02 nightfall proc time
---
Loot generation is server-side so we can only observe the results. And there is no evidence of it.
---
Yikes imagine being so thin skinned that someone pointing out you clearly haven‚Äôt been involved with retail gets you that offended.
---
My "calculated" risk was a dead server. And that's fine for me. My calculated risk wasn't being roflstomped by Alliance on a server which turns out to be as big as Lucifron or Venoxis (the two biggest German PvP servers).
---
I just realized scrolling will change pages on NPC inventory screens
---
Why would they need to know? :) I'm just gonna rock up in fury/prot and start doing DPS and then tanking when I need to. Should be OK.
---
Exactly. We love PvP, we just love choosing when we want to do it more.
---
Cant relate to these toxic PvP server problems. :)
---
There is no Pity Timer in WoW so make your appropriate sacrifices to RNGesus.
---
You're paint with a pretty broad strokes there. Just cause someone rolled horse makes them a bad person? That's pretty childish.
---
Exactly. This is the only way I take communication seriously. Sometimes I'm like.. "Wtf?! This hasn't been around Walgreens.. GTFO!!" Some people...
---
I love Vanilla WoW. It‚Äôs my favorite gaming experience of all time. Let‚Äôs get one thing clear: WPvP in Classic is not WPvP in vanilla. Getting banged out by a half dozen alliance then having them camp you while slamming emotes happened to me maybe a handful of times from vanilla - tbc. It happened to me at least 4 times YESTERDAY. 
---
WPvP in WoW Classic is actual garbage. I‚Äôve had maybe 4 good fights total, either solo or grouped. The rest has been ganking or one side just rolling through the other with insurmountable numbers. Can‚Äôt wait for BGs.
---
just read the skill text.

---
DPR after Initial = 15
---
How are the server dead? You're not locked out of any content, unlike alliance on pretty much every server. With BGs coming out you even get to pvp and rank normally. You're getting the retail wow experience on a classic server, and if you don't like it, you can man up and re-roll xD
---
TY
---
60-40 is pretty huge when you consider the size of classic PvP servers. And 60-40 is about the best you can hope for. That mean the other faction has 50% more players than you do. 50% larger pool to pull active players from. And since classic servers are prob anywhere from 10-20k people. That‚Äôs 2-4K more people. Those are real significant numbers. Fact is, Blizzard should have faction locked certain servers,l when ratios got too high, but they didn‚Äôt and Classic is forever going to be in bad shape balance wise
---
I do. Classic wasn't done to make money. It was done to keep subs up.
---
((I don't think they planned on it being this successful, though. So, expect some kind of 'extra monetization' to work its way into Classic. - No way Activision-corporate is going to let ~1 million subs pay *only* $15 a month; gotta make 'all the money' after all.))
---
Retail is where the money-making happens. A single mount on the store is worth about two months of sub time from one person, or one 'extra' subscriber. - Need to boost quartlies? Release a new mount!
---
For the past month Alliance transfers had been disabled so only Horde could transfer out. Meaning that a lot of the Alliance just raid log or have quit. Hopefully the introduction of Battlegrounds will revive the Alliance population. ([Source](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7&amp;minLevel=60&amp;realm=4475_Shazzrah))
---
I think Diremaul came out at like 5pm or something, so that would make sense for BGs too.
---
Aren't all cats rebellious? :P
---
Faction balance really isn't that much of an issue. Simply having more of one faction than another doesn't affect the game until you get to extremes (75/25 or worse).
---
It's the fact that the behavior is different; which is as others have stated, is because of the amount of people per server.
---
Sure, you used to have some greifing, but on Raid days you'd hardly see a soul outside of BRM. Now there's enough population to have death balls in every area at all times.
---
The fact that flight points, in multiple major areas, are instant death at 3AM server time on a weekday is absolutely preposterous.
---
How old are you? Like 12?
---
Soon.

Queues, afkers, premades, people who give up against premades, (possible) inability to queue as premade, paladins, druids flag carriers, AV bridge/backdoor.

this is just Illidan again, same boring shit
---
And when do you actually do damage?
---
Can someone explain. Don't you get less honor for killing the same person over and over?
---
Takes two to tango. haha
---
So the guys in the middle gibt knocked into whelps and this is their public shaming?
---
Let's flip this pathetic narrative. Alliance are children, you're clearly alliance, this you're an angsty pre pubescent child. See how this works kiddo?
---
You buy gold with real world money
---
Easy to get 3 dps for it with all orbs res
---
I have both a 60 rogue and warlock, i know this matchup pretty well thats very unlikely especially with sac and trinket. Warlocks are probably the most equipped class to deal with rogues.
---
Your understanding is pretty much the same as mine . 
---
Only one guy was in the original raid and he didn't down any bosses (backed up by logs). So he shouldn't have even had the ID.
---
I'm not aware of any safe spotting but I guess it's a possibility I haven't specifically explored so if nothing else, it's  another thread to pull on.
---
Sauce?
---
Lmao
---
Top tip!
---
If your pet is on the current kill target, it should be fine, since the MT will have the most threat on that one. It might pull aggro on other mobs though.
---
Are you mentally disabled or what?
---
Never seen it as a "+". On Pagle the advert is something like "-10/-20 to roll" (additive) after you've won something in a pugged raid.
---
 Clicked the lip too :D
---
I meant in context they need to know that fury/prot build exist and is a viable method of tanking. You might happen to have leaders that will think only full prot is the way to tank and will simply refuse to accept you as offtank. 
---
In cases like these its better to find different guild. There will be a lot of guilds who will gladly accept fury/prot tank as it shows you are comfortable in it where lot of normal tanks will be reluctant in trying out "dps" tank (which sooner or later will surprass full prot build)
---
Merge the Heartseeker and flamelash server
---
But that's objectively wrong. Their warnings were based directly on private server experience.
---
I don't understand this anti-private server people mentality. It's almost as if retail players are offended that private server players have more experience with the game.

Doing MC later today, will check at what point I get saved.
---
God, I hope we get Alterac Valleys that are that long. It was so much fun, having a surge back and forth across the battlefield, actually going for objectives. Felt like an actual battle in a war the way that other BGs can't really replicate.
---
As for the bugs I‚Äôd try to save Multi for them and have rank one volley on my bar. Dense Dynamite helped me as well. If you‚Äôre not en engineer you can get crystal charges or easy throw dynamite. 
---
Are you specced into sure footed for 3% hit? Or a warmonger off AH would give you 3% more hit. Can‚Äôt remember miss chance on lvl 60 elites though. 
---
All that being said I did this with a lock guild member and it was a joke. Just WC, time my MS, use volley if MS was on cool down, and dense dynamite as last resort. Took 2 WC roots to kill him. Used 1 GSPP and 1 Demonslaying Elixir. So unless your hellbent on truly soloing it I would try to find a lock. Could even offer to tip one some gold too if you are having a hard time.
---
Looks like horde wins then. Xfer them all out and close her down...

No changes!!! üò†

---
Subs = Money. I'm fairly certain that Blizzard has made more money from subs from players that quit before BfA.
---
Unless some monetization actually comes to Classic, what you're saying is an assumption.
---
I'm pretty sure the ONLY reason Classic exists is because of the lack of subscribers in BfA. Out of all the players in retail, how many do you think have actually spend money on a boost or a mount? How many more have opt out of paying for subs and simply farmed gold for tokens?

With the massive populations on classic realms blacklisting really doesn't work. The aforementioned can always just join one of the many other groups. Even on nostalrius a much smaller server blacklists didn't work. You need a true vanilla population to see this play out and then you run into the issue of not being able to fill. Most of the time when I see someone spamming So and so is a ninja I will ignore the person spamming for filling my chat with something I couldn't care less about.
---
&gt; No one to blame but allies. See ya flametrash allies.
---
For... not wanting to be glorified NPC's and log on for the horde to farm them them all day for honor while never playing the game?
---
Right.
---
literally unplayable; no changes in classic! /s
---
To be fair to Blizzard, I'm leaning heavily on janky population sites like ironforge.pro, and forming opinion on the state of the game based on the deluge of tears spilled in this sub since phase 2.  Blizzard has the actual numbers, and they may already have a plan to fix this.  They may have even fixed this exact problem before without us knowing it.  I'm just going off of conjecture here.
---
Unfortunately no. However, if there *were* a pity timer added, I'd approve of a quest-drop pity timer over a rare/epic/unique pity timer.
---
Everything is recorded. They have logs you know.

I mean if they don't want to reroll because of the time spent already, and they believe their server will never get better, and are still going to play many hours, than yeah it is sunk cost.  "I spent too much time on this character, I will not start over again.  Knowing that if I did I would have a more enjoyable experience in less time than my current situation would be fixed."  How is that not sunk cost?
---
Premades will be dominant from the 1st minute of BG opening, the no lifers don‚Äôt need some stream to teach them how to farm honor
---
It's not only flurry, but also dual wield specialization and the higher damage two weapons brings over a 2H. For me fury always generates more rage than arms, which is then dumped into your other abilities. Some of our warriors are using Heroic strike on pretty much every other mainhand hit and still having rage to use BT/WW on cd. Granted, they tend to pull aggro and die xD.
---
On my server, there is a suicide squad running into IF nearly all the time.
---
It's a multiboxer with 5 mages and accompanying him are a druid, another mage and 2 priests. They just simultaneously rezz in the middle of the AH or the bank or the area in between and start to aoe. They live for 5-10sec before being killed, but in that time they kill 3-5 allies standing there and repeat this for 8-12 hours a day.
---
12/10 after maintenance PST. 
---
Translate that to your local and thats you answer.
---
How is he a part of the problem though? Rogues always raided enemy cities.
---
Yes (well actually it's 13k for each faction) and that's only one material. Both faction have about a dozen different materials they need to donate.
---
During my time in Vanilla I basically lived in the Deadmines with my 60 mage to farm all that linen and wool cloth. After all 800k linen bandages where needed.
---
On [this page](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj) you can find the actual numbers used back then.
---
Honestly, the best might just be to implement a version of Warmode on PVP Realms. - No bonuses, though. Just "you pvp now".
---
Now, I wouldn't use the WM that's in Retail, because that phases; F that.
---
I would instead make it so you head to a NPC in the 'capital' (Stormwind / Orgrimmar) and get flagged for PVP. You can't turn it off until you go back and talk to the NPC.
---
This way, you're stuck PVPing until you spend time to go unflag. Not the 'wait 5 minutes and rez' we got on PVE realms. But, if things get a bit 'too much' you can decide to unflag and not be corpse-camped/ganked for the remaining of your play time.
---
I say this as the only feasible option because:
---
1) If you allow faction transfers OUT; all the 'underdogs' are going to leave.
---
2) If you allow faction transfers IN, but only for one side; no one is going to decide "oh ya, I'll totally go to the 'losing side'".
---
3) Switch existing PVP to PVE and open new ones; Horde and Alliance will coordinate among their members to pick servers. Even if they put a limit on it. Once word spreads that "Server-X is Horde capped", what Alliance is going to roll on that server, knowing that server is already full of Horde.
---
Even in the nerfed version it‚Äôs still a blast to play.
---
Except that the servers they're going to aren't more balanced? They just have a way smaller population. I'm not sure where you're getting this from. As a person who switched from Faerlina to Arcanite Reaper, I can safely say that the server is not balanced in the slightest, it's just not quite as noticeable because there's fewer people.
---
If flipping a switch was true, then why are servers going down for like 5 hours tomorrow for maintenance?
---
He already [does stream](https://m.twitch.tv/advertisesp/profile).
---
Eu trash here, can someone give me an eli5? As far as I understand, the whole alliance side of the server has left?
---
The only problem with faction changes are paladins and shamans. You can't transfer these, so you either deny them faction swap or somehow turn shamans into paladins and vice versa (which would likely be too hard).
---
Omg blizzard pls enable horde paladins!
---
They failed to transfer in the allotted time.
---
Imagine farming rank14 on that server as alliance.
---
Thats so free!
---
Huh? That didn‚Äôt even make sense. Well here‚Äôs my version
---
Horde are little bitches who play the game like handicapped toddlers, and are virgins with balding heads and patchy neckbeards who‚Äôll never get laid or move out of their parents house. 
---
See how anyone can just make up shit? Doesn‚Äôt make it true without evidence. And there‚Äôs plenty of evidence to support what I said earlier about the horde.
---
Remind me when it was the last time Blizzard used faction-based queues?
---
You are in the wrong spec for pvp daggers.
---
Look for 21/8/22 dagger spec, to stun lock you can open with a cheap shot, backstab, 4 point kidney, auto attack, blind just before kidney finishes, restealth, sap, cheap shot, sinister, cold blood eviscerate.
---
Or something a long those lines. 
---
Vsing clothies or a druid open with ambush (45% increased crit from talents) for a 1500+ ambush crit, followed by backstab, if they get out of arms reach, blind them or vanish and reopen.
---
It takes practice, but right now you are in pve spec.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs just garbage. I played retail last night for literally the first time since August 27th. Not done with Classic or tired of it, but the community... it‚Äôs just exhausting sometimes. My server is 50/50 and just Alliance crying about Horde on forums while they‚Äôre busy camping the FP, the GY and everything in-between.
---
it's short for "woot woot in the boot"
---
I agree, I think there are just a lot of people expecting something other than what they will get, which might cause issues.
---
In top percentile sure.
---
But your average raid, with average people will have hunters on top in MC/Ony phase.
---
So the argument it benefits rogues and warriors is bullshit. It benefits those 3 classes equally.
---
Combat daggers is tough.   The only finisher you worry about is kidney.   When you Cheapshot make sure you energy is just about tick.  If you don‚Äôt have a tracker, get one.
---
Cheapshot &gt; BS &gt;build energy &gt; kidney &gt; BS &gt;BS &gt; reset with blind.  Sap &gt; Repeat.  Reset with gouge and/or vanish. Sap. Repeat.
---
Another trick is to turn sideways so you can‚Äôt auto attack.  And Cheapshot during sap.  Cheapshot doesn‚Äôt break sap. Gives u 2 more combo points.  You can also expose armor the same way.  Depends on the fight if you need to do it. 
---
If you have Adr Rush.  Pop it on your opener.
---
As a hordie on Shazzrah I can safely vouch for the alliance resistance! Lots of very good active pvp players on their part no where feels safe. That being said I wouldn't want to be levelling 48-60 as an ally.
---
So in that scenario, RL was fresh last night. He had been away for most of the week so couldn't have raised if he had wanted to.
---
If RL is outside of MC with no ID And dude with an ID tries to enter MC , what happens ? He enters a separate instance ? He gets locked out of our instance and is told he can't access or, because he went in first we all get locked to his ID ?
---
Incorrect assumption, but I would say that a person with a long blacklist lacks communication skills.
---
You quit playing because blizzard enforced the rules that the players themselves agreed to before the tournament?
---
I think there's a point later in the game (naxx geared) where fury just kills so fast that you don't even go arms in BGs. I remember my friend getting 1k white crits and 2k bloodthirst crits.
---
I think they‚Äôve made it so that only groups can queue and not raids, so the max size of any premade will be five people. Unless two groups of five get lucky and get paired together in Warsong it should be pretty decent matching that way.
---
I mean it seems like no one wanted 1.12 AV..
---
If they don't you need to take a look at things.. Even in pre-bis it is easy to push 500 dps without world buffs or consumables. With buffs our warriors push far above that.
---
1. Are all warriors applying sunder armor on their first global? Are druids using fearie fire? Is curse of recklessness up?
---
2. Are warriors doing their rotations correct? Bloodthirst and Whirlwind should be used every single time it's off CD. Bad warriors tend to fuck up and spend a lot of their rage on lower priority abilities like heroic strike, overpower and hamstring.
---
3. Are warriors timing their cds right? Recklessness (if used) and death wish should be stacked together at the execute phase. Try to predict how long a fight will last and certain mechanics so you get the full value of these strong cooldowns.
---
4. Are dps beeing hold back by the MTs lack of threat? Make sure your MT is doing shield slam and revenge ever 6 seconds and is well geared. 
---
5. Maxemize uptime.. Dps drops to shit if the warrior has to bandage himself during a boss fight, stands in front of the boss or uses to much time dodging mechanics.
---
Salty? I'm laughing my ass off thanks to your comments. I'm wondering, it seems like you are not so bright, do you need help in your daily life? You seem like someone who has trouble breathing because it is to complex.
---
It wasn't that though. That's whats there now that there's less than a dozen level 60 alliance. Before that it was raids at every flight point in every contested zone and on every boat, so that nobody alliance could go anywhere or do anything without being killed by a dozen horde. So people left and as alliance numbers dropped horde moved in to the alliance cities.. not 25 of them, multiple raids worth. Now there's no alliance left 25 level 60 horde is more than enough to kill anybody who flags up.
---
That in itself should say something, if "all the alliance transferred" there and it's still nearly balanced pop wise
---
Some people requested a simplified graph. Here are two graphs, one showing subs gained (green, top) and one showing subs lost (red, bottom). The axis for each is the same for easier comparison.
---
[Subs gained](https://imgur.com/m99yVYs)
---
[Subs lost](https://imgur.com/KG53DKK)
---
As someone who was r13 in vanilla i can say that it's exactly the same. Our group was banging people in vanilla and it still does. Not much changed at all.
---
It‚Äôs less ‚Äúwack a mole‚Äù with heals, and more steady targeting your MT, while being able to mouseover anyone in the raid that needs heals as well. 
---
Honestly, the only things a find required for a mouseover are dispels, and my PW:S. Healing the old way is just fine. It will help you to MO your heals eventually, but until then I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much.
---
If the ‚Äúwhack a mole‚Äù chaos becomes too much for you in MC, get healbot, or work in some mouseovers to your flash heal/renew.
---
That wasn‚Äôt the question.
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit, like I said you bitches deserve it, reap what you sow.
---
Blizzard have addressed it even before launch. 
---
&gt;We are fairly sure ‚Äî we can't know for sure without being fortune tellers, but most of them align ‚Äî there will be a fairly steep drop off compared to that day one interest
---
I mean, if you come to them and say "I thought I did but I didn't" they can just shrug and say "we know".
---
Let's see them Warcraft logs boiii
---
Lying through your ASS
---
Those combat cooldowns are useful for overall dps, but in pvp, overall dps is not nearly as useful as control of combat and burst dps. There's a reason no rogues use slice and dice in pvp, despite it being the best finisher for pve.
---
That rotation isn't too shabby. Sap is only useful as Subtlety, as otherwise you'll break stealth, though if you are still combat, I suppose stealth doesn't matter quite as much. But it would prevent you from using cheap shot until you were able to restealth. 
---
Also, keep in mind that with improved gouge, it lasts 5.5 seconds. It takes 6 seconds to drop combat, and thus be able to stealth again, so as long as you didn't put any bleeds or dot poisons on the target (which you never should in pvp), you can sometimes gouge, back away, and if you can go just half a second without them using something ranged on you, you can stealth again without wasting a vanish. Only works with imp gouge though.
---
But the same applies to blind. Assuming it doesn't break, it lasts 10 seconds, and so you can use it to leave combat. Also, both of these only work if the target is alone.
---
Another benefit to subtlety is that lets say your opponent has a friend with them. They attack you first, so your best bet is to vanish (and hope a hunter pet doesn't ignore it) and sap one of them, that way you can focus your attention on the other guy.
---
Did they make MC gear better? Because pretty much everyone raids in MC gear now
---
2-4k more prone who may or may not even be logged in at the same time as you. And if they are, most likely aren't even in the same zone as you. 
---
The whole thing is just ridiculous. I play Horde on Faerlina, which is supposedly 44.8% Alliance and 55.2%  Horde (according to ironforge.pro). I promise you i see way more Alliance out in the world than i do Horde. According to that website there are 8363 people logging raids (where they get their data from). That means 3746 Alliance and 4617 Horde. A difference of 871. 
---
Are there 871 more Horde than Alliance? Maybe, but out in the wild i always see more Alliance. Always. And why is that? Because even if the numbers are to be trusted, *not all those people are online at the same time, and those who are, are spread out around the world.*
---
A lot of people here need to try playing Rust
---
fury is fine for wpvp shenigans but once you start doing group pvp not having mortal strike hurts your entire group
---
rogues can break fear/sheep with their own trinket already. warriors have fear breaking abilities. also, having dwarf priests gives you another fear immunity. oh, and blind is not counterable by any trinket. really not that hard to understand.
---
There's farming, questing, dungeons, raid, world bosses (uncontested), BGs (which will be cross realm). But yes, that's nothing.
---
Yeah, on Pagle.  I'm in a late night guild on there. TBH every time he gets bored one of our guildies rolls up there and either starts a raid or joins one.  The impression I've gotten is there's usually something going. I haven't joined in because I'm fine waiting for BGs.
---
Guild lead would prefer 8 paladins for 40 man so that we can easily split into two raids with 4 paladins.
---
At some point more healers wont help so yes, Ret is at least in casual guilds back on the menu. If they have a healing gear to switch on occasion or are willing to nightfall later, more power to them. 
---
I was forced to DPS as a paladin on Ony last week as we had too many priests and druids that wanted stuff. I felt kind of silly with my 200 dps.
---
It‚Äôs like 15 years ago complaining all over again, I‚Äôm so happy for this. It really classic wow!
---
It will be the original vanilla raid sign up system, why would they change it without stating a massive announcement for everyone given how closely they have stuck to 1.12
---
Even at 50th percentile hunters aren't top. You can see them on WCL.
---
I can confirm that mouseover macros do work in classic, I use them all the time.
---
Why not just forcefully convert some of the horde players to alliance huh?
---
I'm doing the math and 48 60 isn't adding up. What knowledge do you have?!
---
Damn. I never would have thought of that.
---
You‚Äôre right, I didn‚Äôt mean to be rude, I should reword that. 
---
It‚Äôs a lot of bloody effort to go to for a higher parse on one boss
---
There is a really simple solution if you dont like how things are run, just quit. It doesnt seem like either PvP servers or Classic is for you. You seem to be so upset about it that nothing can change your mind on it, if you are so angry about a system just stop playing.
---
If the raid group or its leadership decide not to bring a person, that's a different story. I'm just suggesting we cut each other some slack sometimes.
---
lmao can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre getting downvoted for this. 
---
These puggers are in for an unpleasant surprise when aq40 hits. 
---
Even the first boss of aq40 was unbeatable for non-hardcore guilds on my p server. I doubt it will be puggable until after naxx released. The other bosses were rather easy up until twin emps which was a long ass fight and required more coordination than all the previous tier bossfights counted together. Viscidus wasn‚Äôt really hard if you had enough sapper charges and everyone farmed their nature res gear and frost dmg gear. It‚Äôs all a matter of organization, which is something usually not well established in PUGs when compared to raiding guilds.
---
Back in tbc I tried to make a blood elf paladin nearly 3 times and never made it past level 16.
---
Because that‚Äôs dumb as fuck.
---
Are you here for a conversation or to be a prick?
---
The issue with 'nochange' is it was coined by hardliners.
---
Realistically, 'nochange' should have been rules like those Pristine Servers, that Blizzard toted awhile back.
---
Things like Spell Batching....should have never been implemented. It'd be like saying you want your old Win 98 system back. So you get a new system, install Windows 98. Then downclock that 4.1GHz to 500 Mhz, with all but 1 core enabled and no Hyperthreading; because "nochange".
---
((Then complain that your Netflix is stuttery. \[People complaining that abilities/attacks still go off even though they stunned/interrupted the target.\]))
---
it's not. it's just a rng. most pvp are done in wsg and you won't even cross paths with rogues very often as a warrior since you are playing in different areas of the map.
---
meanwhile meanwhile stoneform/fear ward/escape artist are on demand abilities to help win a fight.
---
oh, and I forgot to mention the most important thing of it all: paladins, the most broken pvp class in the game. (healing ofc)
---
Not that long, the war effort filled up by like 1% every day even if no one contributed iirc. Still means they will have to wait several months for it, but it won't be years. What took 3 years was banging the gong to open the gates themselves, but that's doable for horde alone.
---
Oh god....
---
The first fear can be a bit useless since they can easily obtain the pvp trinket which breaks it.
---
There's a 5 + hour server shutdown tomorrow, longest they've had yet, so I'm assuming it's because of BGs
---
Woooooooah. You have to be one or the other on pvp? Daamn. I never knew that. That‚Äôs kinda neat.
---
Yea no one else in the history of the entire world has ever been selfish except americans /s
---
I agree, but you should probably request that information in the official forums instead of here. 
---
In any case, it will arrive tomorrow sometime between 8am and 8pm.
---
The most important part of being able to target a hostile is seeing the buffs you can purge, cast bars to time heals with (for topping charts/parses), and being able to see who pulls threat with the Target of Target. 
---
Basically, being able to target an enemy and still heal your raid is pretty nice üëç 
---
Ony‚Äôs breath attack puts me in top healing because I‚Äôll time me heal to end (or stop cast canceling) right when the bar starts. It has the same cast time as my heal, so I always end up on the top of the charts, and everyone else fights over over heals. 
---
My secret is being able to target the boss, mouseovers, and 3/8T1
---
Hah, I can imagine! Damn. And yeah, bloodthirst scales extremely well. Even with a 3.8 weapon speed, your weapon only receives 27.1% of your attack power as weapon damage, while bloodthirst is a constant 45%.
---
Also, one thing I've noticed, and is very handy, is that you can bloodthirst even when disarmed.
---
If you cry about being camped on the way to instances, flight paths or your capital city you chose the wrong server type.
---
Rogue flair lmao
---
You probably followed Thermaplugg to the very end you scum.
---
They must be using shitty bot software then. The bot rogues infesting my server recognize after a second or two that they don't have the mob tagged and move on to the next one - but yes, with some bots this works.
---
Dude, the way people play games has completely shifted. You're not going to get that unique 2005 PVP you knew and loved, It's all about efficiency and theory crafting. People 10+ years ago were content with fucking around just for experience. Making a post does literally nothing and is completely self-serving, which I guess deep down you already knew.
---
I thought I did, and I do.  That's also why I rolled on a PvE server because I knew PvP servers would be hell.  I'm having a great time, just worried about the game being here in the long haul.
---
Yeah, he was a funny goofball when he was playing on private servers, but the fame went to his head and he started believing all of the stupid shit he was saying. He's an enormous lootwhore and actually thinks that ret is a viable DPS now. I think he's actually turned that corner.
---
Lol ok
---
Your server is what happens when world of warcraft meets the walking dead. :D Sounds pretty fun tbh. Have fun in your adventure!
---
I mean, I enjoy it when you have multiple groups playing a constant game of chicken, having a skirmish, then retreating to lick wounds.
---
Southshore is a great place for world pvp, because there are convenient graveyards for each faction, and it doesn't really stand in the way of questing or raiding.
---
Winterspring/Gadgetzan can also be fun, pushing the envelope with guards until total chaos erupts in the city limits, but is more frustrating for those trying to quest.
---
BRM is just kind of a pain in the ass. Though I do like the occasional instance portal hopping.
---
I loved original AV but i am not sure if it will be the same. It probably won't.
---
Hit rating is not really that easy to come by if you look at the hunter tier pieces. T1 gloves have 2%, T1 shoulders have 1%. You can get 2% from rings, and then 1% from trinket or neck. So you‚Äôre gonna be using the Rune of the Guard Captain until you get the Onyxia neck.
---
Also, need the T1 gloves before you can replace the Devilsaur Set, so if you get the T1 legs first you need to wait to use them. It‚Äôs really kind of annoying to piece together the hit gear to stay at 9%
---
In fairness, he's not asking why they left, but rather complaining that Blizzard LET them leave.
---
It's comments like his that motivate me to spam 'go to retail'.
---
Lol happy ur ally, u seem horrible
---
&gt;All it has to do with is engaging in fights you know you‚Äôre going to win/not engaging in fights you know you‚Äôll lose.
---
This is ridiculously inaccurate, unless by choosing fights you mean switching servers. On a lot of servers there are simply no fights you can win. Kill one person? They called 3-8 people over to waste an hour of your time. Go to turn in a quest? Guess what, every single NPC is dead. Wanna take an FP? Better have you're hearth up cuz there is no flight master on the other end of this FP.
---
No one thinks you're inherently an asshole for playing horde. There might be the occasional whiney gnome who decided to roll Stalagg, Skerig, Mankrik, Blameux, Thalnos, Herod, Fairbanks, Yojamba, Kirtonos or Kromcrush only to find out that every single one of those has between two to five times the amount of horde players and refuses to give up and roll PvE who comes on here to vent, but that's about it.
---
&gt;Most people play both factions anyways.
---
I also don't know where you're getting this from, but out of the eight or so people in real life and forty or so in-game friends I have, there are a total of zero people who play both factions. You're telling me you know people who have both a horde and an alliance character on two separate servers raiding?
---
ye I saw. Credit where it's due but his other reaction to ninja looting did not paint him in a good light..idk
---
They work I have a bunch of them
---
Horde Rogue flair*
---
You can still cap things against a 40 man man premade and get some honor.
---
Do you think the other flamewakers call him flametrash?
---
The problem is imbalance itself, not "reeeee horde reeeeeee"
---
&gt;Ironforge.pro was never about total server populations. The ratio is supposed to be representative of the overall server balance (with a grain of salt ofc), but the numbers are nowhere near since there's tons of people not raiding or not logging their raids, and have no way of showing up on it.
---
Yeah I know that. And it just further reinforces my original point:
---
&gt;My logic is, the numbers don't come from Blizzard. They all come from third parties who do not have all the data. Therefore, they are inherently inaccurate. To cite them as basically gospel is naive.
---
Absolutely! I saw my BIS cape drops off Azuregos and laughed out loud. No way I‚Äôm getting that. I‚Äôve resigned myself to just wanting to watch a world boss downed. I don‚Äôt really care to participate lol.
---
\#NoChanges will be the death of Classic WoW, mark my words.
---
Bruh, IF isn‚Äôt getting ‚Äúraided‚Äù on that server. It‚Äôs being completely occupied.
---
Watch the southpark episode. There ya go.
---
You don't stunlock as combat spec'd. You need a cheap Cheap Shot to stun lock effectively. So you need 2/2 in Dirty Deeds.
---
Really? It's a bad time to raid, when people have vacation time and are off work, or the younger high school students that play are home and bored?
---
My week off during college and the days I take off from work for vacation are the days I get in the most WoW.
---
You've completely missed my point yet again because you are focused on painting this scenario in your own colors. I'll be happy in 4 days, wpvp will go back to being the fun kind, which there was plenty of in P1. That's the point I made originally which you continually ignore because you have some sort of odd vendetta against pvp in general. You're ridiculous.
---
Battlegrounds were greeted as the saviour of pvp when they launched, since world pvp was basically what we've had the last 3-4 weeks -- except even worse because of higher server populations.
---
Life we return to normal starting this week, and all this doom and gloom will go away.
---
PS Life on PvE servers has never been better.
---
The idea of typing a random console command from a reddit suggestion makes me feel uneasy.
---
I will look into it though buddy cheers!
---
I actually agree, but I think that the world is too much of a large scale for lets say 15 dipshits that perma farm Flight Points or something make group of 5 friends to leave, if I had 4 more people to go through that I personally woudn't mind.  
---
But it's undeniable truth that it has effect on how this progressed to worse, people taking a weird ass approach to the game and griefing and so on so forth, maybe introduction of penalty? Active GM's unlike robot right click report? idk...  
---
But for some servers it's too late, I completely agree with you actually, but don't you think that Blizzard is also responsible on maintaining order and keeping people's attitude least toxic as possible?  
---
I think if Blizzard was more strict when it came to people's behaviour that so much could have been prevented.
---
Doesnt matter if 90% of the horde would actually do that, those 5 rogues still hiding in stealth at every fp , desperately waiting for a griphon to arrive, are still enough to ruin it for the last few remaining alliance players.
---
It is hillarious tho.
---
I love boring yard work. Settles me down as a person with a stressful job, a young boy and too much paper work.
---
This is about Ice Poseidon.
---
Ahh i believe 60 hmm but with 2 distracts you might be able !
---
Do whatever you want, but accept the consequences... that's all there is to say.
---
Despite my above point, I don't believe this is horde being evil at all.  It's entirely predictable that this will happen just given the fact that horde have better pvp racials.  The real villain here is Blizzard who allowed this problem to fester for 15 years without solving it, then made it worse with mega-servers.
---
But...but..but your Flair says you are a Mage.
---
Always in disguise - even on reddit.
---
That is what I call rogue dedication!
---
Lol then horde go to the start of each contested zone and aoe spam. Contest over.
---
World pvp. Imho it's the whole reason for back tracking to classic.  Im not going to play through multiple expansions blizz. Just make the world pvp line it used to be
---
Currently leveling a Forsaken Mage and am level 22. I am roughly following a 'single-target frozen' guide from icy-veins. My questions is should I keep trying to level as this spec or respec to an AoE grinding build? 
---
At endgame I would like to be able to comfortable raid as well as PvP.
---
This is my first time leveling a mage and just want to make sure that I do it right.
---
BGs are confirmed cross realm buddy
---
That 2-4k people you mention is enough to fill a new server at proper size. Also, your anecdotal confirmation bias is something fierce.
---
&gt; You can tank every 5 man dungeon. But there is no high end gear. So ubrs and beyond is out of your reach.
---
On the contrary, shaman tanks are more than capable of tanking raids if give the right amount of effort.
---
Nerdcraft on Gul'dan (Thunderlord before xfer) downed Sapph, not on the list. Anyone still around from then?
---
The community issue you refer to is only on pvp servers. 
---
Join us on pve... I promise, it's a whole different community.
---
Why?
---
Not sure what level, but there‚Äôs one way to find out! Get to it!
---
heck even as a horde on a PvE server i visit Ironforge sometimes, though since the server i'm on is around 65/35 in alliance favor i'm allways happy that i live for 5 minutes
---
Great job getting through it. Healing can be tough if the party‚Äôs not following etiquette and the healer usually gets blamed.
---
Not too downplay that dps and tank should do everything they can to help the healer. But once I get a little geared I actually like running a bad aggressive group occasionally. The hectic action of struggling to keep everyone alive and sometimes just willing the party to get through an encounter can be really fun. Even sometimes despite my crazy heals in these Dungs going unnoticed.
---
In closing just talk to your healer about how comfortable they are going fast and breaking etiquette, and don‚Äôt forget to thank them.
---
Tbf 100 bars is like 5,5k gold.. And will probably be more as prices will go up... Farming even half of that on a warrior takes a hell of a lot of time as some of the best farming methods for a tank gives about 40g/hour.
---
Backed into a corner and after spending all this time typing arguments against your point, they admit that it really doesn‚Äôt matter to them after all.
---
Exactly.  "nochanges" ensured that they wouldn't re-examine the design flaws they were about to make worse.
---
Working As Intended
---
The only goal the developers are single-mindedly pursuing with fanatic zeal is Time Spent In Game, and throwing hammers at some random non-agressive crab 50 yards away only reinforces this.
---
Eh? 200 dps on Ony is pretty good for a ret paladin, you'd be top 100 in the world with that. I doubt, you can manage to do that, if oyu are generally a healer.
---
Ony is one of the worst fights for ret paladins due to the air phase, where you literally can't do anything but kill a few whelps.
---
I also don't see why 200 dps is something to feel bad about at Ony. That's around a top 30% parse for locks, mages, rogues and warriors.
---
So lets say I stay combat specced, whats my pvp strategy? Pop all CD's and try to out dps them?
---
Because he's clearly taking a video game way too seriously and deserves to be laughed at.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=294747/classic-wow-server-queue-times-eu
---
6 servers have queues during extremely off-peak hours. It's like 6-9am in the US.
---
I give up attempting to communicate with you. Good luck.
---
Ok boomer.
---
Or be on anathema where it's pvp and not dominated by either
---
&gt;NEET armchair cagefighter

Never heard of them explained this way, I'm definitely stealing it because it's funny as fuck.
---
Engagement scores and other nonsense metrics the corporate overlords like to track.
---
Is Shazzrah the European Skeram?
---
Haha yeah, rerolled lemme change it
---
I think this is a good idea that would help to mitigate the problem. The real question is, will it help enough to justify the considerable effort? Unless a LOT of PvPers change faction, we'd end up with a number of 55/45 realms and a large chunk of Horde players that are stuck on rather empty PvE realms with no chance to move to a PvP Server unless they change their faction.
---
Blaumeux player here.
---
Thank fuck I'm alliance.
---
I get what you're saying, but there comes a point where you're just being an asshole.  Sneaking around and picking off people might be fun entertainment if it was just happening periodically, but when there's such a huge, persistent presence in the \*capital city\* that the minority faction can't even post auctions and check their mail... that's messed up.
---
If you can't see why people wouldn't want to play in that environment, maybe you should try playing a minority faction (roll on flamelash, perhaps) and see just how un-fun it is.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt really need a tank in dungeons anymore
---
Kinda true, I'd say the bar for what is required is lowered. I've seen many high end dungeons tanked by warlock and rogues.
---
For sure, Classic only happened because the sub dipped lower than expected.
---
But if a mount's value is that of ~2 subs. Then selling 100 mounts is like having 200 players suddenly sub for 30 days, and that's not even factoring in the sub money from those players buying the mounts.
---
On boosts? Probably not that many, hence the desire to "refine leveling". Which made it take longer (even with heirlooms).
---
On mounts? Just hang out in a capital. - At least on the Crossrealm of Stormrage-US, I saw a lot of store mounts running around during my stint in BfA.
---
On Tokens. Blizzard would love it if most of us went to using Tokens. Because each Token user is paying $20 for a 30 day sub. - Someone still has to buy 'em; the more that use them, the more that are bought.
---
Mixer is a good thing,  pretty weird to hate on it.
---
What about if you want balanced wPvP? What do you do then?
---
If that were the case they would allow transfer to 'normal' servers and I don't think they do
---
You're going to get 0 permanently if they leave. 
---
When an endangered species is almost extinct, do you kill the last one or let them try to repopulate so one day you could kill more of them?
---
Problem is getting into brd takes like 30 minutes and if i cant even get to guzzler its a waste of time :P
---
Haha yeah these assumptions about some guy who plays video games is definitely fucking pwning him bro. Absolutely murdered by words. Haha what a fucking LOSER for camping in IF after complaining about the lack of world PvPers. Haha he DEFINITELY deserves this kind of this talk. 
---
This weird tirade about how much of a loser this guy is IRL is definitely a proportionate and appropriate reaction.
---
For individuals, it's not too big of a deal. If you are doing that for entire guilds, though, then you are judging people by their associations rather than by their own merits.
---
That's your thing and you can do that, but I won't be. I keep an ignore list and, while I do judge based on guild name, I won't not group with someone based on their guild name.
---
Fair, but you would still be way more coordinated then a PUG.
---
So in a party of 5 vs 30 mobs, each shout would do 55*5*30 in total?
---
Lol myself and my friends played pservers and were adamantly against mega servers. In my experience it‚Äôs mostly non pserver players who wanted mega servers because they thought the game would lose 3/4 of its players in 3 months. If they just did vanilla caps from the start snd released more than 10 servers we might not be in this situation.
---
I'm in charge of the bank for my guild and this is how I'll be handling it. Hand of Rag is a personal item, it doesn't help the raid at all so it will be on the ret pally to acquire all the mats except the ingots. We will provide the ingots as we get the drops, but won't go out of our way to get them if we happen to get an Eye before we get 8 ingots. TF is different, it greatly boosts MT threat so will be the priority along with Nightfall. MT will use whatever mats he has saved up, but the guild will accept donations for arcanite when we get the bindings. If we are missing any bars after donations occur, the bank will purchase the rest.
---
There are boots that give you +1 stealth maybe i can buy them
---
Oh. Yeah.
---
Faction Based Login Queues fix the in game playing experience.
---
Blizzard could also delete a server like Heartseeker and merge the Alliance back into Skeram. 
---
Put the horde from Heartseeker on another realm somewhere.
---
You can do as much pvp as you want. But apparently many players forget that behind those moving pixels are real humans that also want to play and have fun. Only a masochist would love to play on a server like this
---
You are probably correct. I can feel those Forces too since classic was announced.
---
The sheer amount of ignorance (at least it sometimes feels like that) amazes me.
---
The community literally spoon Feeds Blizzard what they would like adressed/adjusted or changed. Yet nothing happens.
---
I feel like These Forces put very Little funds towards classic in the first place and now start regretting it. Still not giving any funds and working hours into the game they hope it will die and they will remain correct with their Superstition...
---
And if falling Population also means even less Focus on classic then it is indeed a big Problem...
---
I just hope that they now start realizing how big of a Thing classic and "old Expansion" Servers are in General and put together a dedicated Team just for that. (A Team larger than it is now) because obviously the current Team is under a lot of pressure...
---
Very difficult and we can all just hope for the best I guess...
---
Dude just turn your flag off and you‚Äôre good to go. It‚Äôs only an issue now because the server is empty - If blizzard never let people transfer off it would have never got so bad.
---
It's just get rid of the black and white effects of being a ghost. There are a lot of graphical console commands. Many usefull
---
I dont think i heard single private server player ask for layers
---
&gt; wPvP is the most fun part of vanilla 
---
Oh boy yeah, we sure do love having whole squads of Horde just sitting on the path up to Thorium Point, or camping the hallways of Blackrock Mountain, ensuring we get blocked off from being able to do anything meaningful with our game time.
---
Just logout at BRM with your raid. It's been your natural habitat for some weeks anyway.
---
I remember that! Someone needs to find it haha
---
Ikr and I thought lol community waa toxic. This is just so salty its unreal lmao
---
RP PVE is like a warm cup of hot chocolate and a cozy blanket next to the hell on earth that levelling in PVP has become.
---
Totally agree, why miss out on life beyond your own fence??  Sure it‚Äôs dangerous but equally rewarding.
---
damn that would've been helpful when i was farming the Runecloth Bag pattern in Winterspring lol
---
Yeah I switched from PvP to PvE about a month ago. Best decision I‚Äôve made. Renewed my love for the game. I‚Äôm having a great time. Very relaxing
---
&gt; During vanilla I tanked up to around level 30. (didn't go any further because i got bored). Single target you can easily hold aggro but with no aoe and no way to generate snap threat it just makes it hard. Earth shock only does so much and no amount of fire nova totem or chain lightning will hold aggro properly. Also tank swapping during raids is impossible.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Im going to say in a group of friends you can handle doing any dungeon, pugs are a no go as well as raiding.
---
Shaman raid tanking is very much possible. Aoe threat is generated by healing a raid member with the aid of Eye of the storm or Hand of Edward the odd. Threat is not an issue for shamans. If you care to know more about it, just let me know. I've tanked up t'ill Naxx as a shaman raid tank.
---
You're allowed to. Just don't complain when suddenly consequences show up (ie no alliance play)
---
Our Company did this too. When I reported it, they thanked me and advised it was a test. Then they roasted everyone saying how many people actually clicked it and rolled out a "CyberSecurity Training" as well.  
---
If it works IRL, it will work in game.
---
Think the boots with +1 is from the rogue quest that is added later ?
---
Bunch of softies if BGs are the last chance. Sounds like the cowards who left Skeram to play on Heartseeker.
---
For me its Azshara, where those spirits/ghosts are. I've seen multiple botters there.
---
You'll respec (plenty of times) at endgame anyway, it's all up to how you prefer to quest. If you want to aoe grind or run spellcleave dungeons, go for it, otherwise singletarget questing or doing dungeons the normal way is still a perfectly viable option.
---
The argument is the volume of people in gank squads. So your personal experience ganking is irrelevant.
---
yeah i agree. i tried messing around with it when i first found out about it but i dont see myself really using it anymore.
---
The private server meta has completely taken over classic, and the private server meta for BGs is to leave / AFK losing games and to lock people into games your dominating whilst you GY farm. 
---
We are going to get a ton of 2 cap WSG GY camping, 4 cap AB GY camping and 7 min AV rushes because that's what min maxers do and the majority casual playerbase from the vanilla days just doesn't exist in classic.
---
It was probably drowned out by screenshots of people getting their stupid level 40 mounts.
---
The hots from your parses are bad because no one respects them.
---
Ask around in your raid to see how many people actually cancel their heals or refrain from healing a hotted target (Spoiler: most will not do that)
---
As a bonus you can ask who actually TRACKS other peoples hots on their healing interface
---
I shudder every time i see a druid referred to as a dudu.
---
+1 overall is a pretty shit system because people just leave once they get an item. I prefer the one you mention.
---
Crit cap:
---
Assuming 305 weapon skill and 6% hit, what is the crit cap? 30%? 35%? 40%?
---
Right on. It's a guy getting hella excited about getting banana bread at work. :) Search "banana bread hell yeah."
---
&gt;/console ffxDeath 0
---
Google has confirmed. Cheers good sir for the tip and sorry for doubting your intentions !
---
Go with QS. I‚Äôve been using QS and mirah for a month now, it‚Äôs a solid combo for both farming and raiding.
---
ROFLAMO!
---
truly those who will weep will be the ally without the shaman
---
They ran from an unplayable server to a playable one
---
Thanks, looks great!
---
Looks like my comment huwt somebody‚Äôs feewingsüò¢
---
He‚Äôs not saying anyone would be forced. You‚Äôd willingly transfer to a new realm that‚Äôs forced 50/50 balance.
---
Not true at all. I plan on getting rank 10 on my main for gear rewards and have two geared out twinks
---
I disagree: people wanted "nochanges" because they wanted the same balance that is totally figured out because it felt safe and they were afraid of the  "jank, bullshit, and instability" that indeed made Vanilla fun. 
---
They wanted no changes because they thought it was the only way to recapture Vanilla spirit while being totally obvious that to recapture some aspect of Vanilla you had to made some changes.
---
They wanted no changes to roll the perfect character that would dominate charts and PvP without any risk that a patch would change that. 
---
#nochanges was a movement afraid of changes and not embracing the chaos that was Vanilla.
---
Definitely can relate. Cancelled my subscription for now, played on a PVP server my entire life but now that I'm limited to time due to work and other things, it's not enjoyable. Hit 60 and trying to do anything as far as farming herbs or even running to BRD isn't possible depending on what time of day it is. The difference between now and back in Vanilla is people know how much honor they have to farm so I feel like it's just like back then, but amplified x10000000.
---
Their may be more horde, but the alliance on Herod are *organized*. I don't know what level you are, but Horde have the same problem getting into BRM on Herod as alliance on other servers. Alliance regularly owns BRM and it takes 4-5 corpse runs to get to BRD. Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes are a bad time for everyone. I tried playing in SG Friday night and got ganked repeatedly and eventually logged. 
---
Saturday night was more of the same but not quite as bad earlier in the evening but a little later an alliance gank squad came through and lit up fucking everyone. Horde ghosts running everywhere. Tried doing BRD, took 5 corpse runs to get there. After we finished up there I went to Burning Steppes to get the flight path there. I had to wait for the flight master npc to respawn and got killed in our little outpost there about 4 times in the process. Alli also often have the entrance to DM on lock, several folks in Feralas were getting farmed there last night. I can't ride the boat between BB and ratchet without getting killed. 
---
I think the honor system has turned the world into an absolute shit show for everyone, but at least on Herod it's sorta balanced. There are a lot of horde, but alliance are fucking us up regularly. This isn't a complaint though. I'm happy about the sort of... equality of the situation. I'd prefer that to the crazy imbalances elsewhere. People aren't getting rampantly farmed in capital cities on Herod.
---
Could be one of those guilds on PvE who has both horde and alliance branches, and they know each other.
---
what a weird way to value a person...
---
NERDS!
---
This actually has a second reason for working that's not obvious at first. If you gank someone who is leveling an alt and they get pissed off enough they are going to log off and get their main for some revenge ganking.
---
So if the ganker sees your body disappear they might think you're getting your main to come kick their ass and they'll haul ass out of there.
---
Press V
---
But im lvl 40 so i guess that wont work or?
---
I don't know if I agree. I think most players would be fine with equal faction sizes.
---
Got any logs or screenshots of his dps? I wanna see how bad he is!
---
You find a private server with faction queues or faction locks that maintain a balanced ratio.
---
Give me faction change and I will go Alliance in a second
---
If all of the realms became 1 big pool of players with a 60 / 40 horde alliance. You would get 30 minute BG queues for Horde.   Acorn isn't wrong, horde are going to have long queues lol. xrealm doesn't change a darn thing.
---
rep iirc
---
This. 8agi ain't nothing thou that's almost half a crit %!
---
Not quite, only 52 atm. If anything you're the one preventing me from getting into BRD xD
---
That guy was responsible for several burnouts and one attempted suicide. I have little to non respect for someone like that
---
Shoutout to the good wives out there making dreams realities.
---
I ate my own arm because I was hungry and now I have only 1 arm. WTF BLIZZARD?!?! Why would you do this to me?!!!!?
---
As a person who watches Asmongold and has shamelessly used my Twitch Prime on him for well over a year, everything he said is 100% accurate. I watch him because he's entertaining enough to put on in the background. I really only enjoyed watching him before classic because he played Dark Souls and I enjoyed his transmog competitions and his variety streams.
---
But seriously, everything he said is absolutely correct. Asmongold is bar-none the most toxic player there is. He has zero actual skill and openly admits this (occasionally, when he's not blowing smoke up everyones ass), he got carried through the game, has been given over 80,000 gold, constantly whines about problems he caused himself, everything is a hypocritical echo chamber, he promotes ninja looting and steals items himself but gets away with it because he has a following of 50k people who watch him daily.
---
I'm not sure why you chose to talk about something you clearly don't know anything about. Seems like a weird choice of things to call someone out for when you yourself don't know anything about the situation.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of players that are very good that don‚Äôt try to push themselves to the limit all the time, and raid more casually. Casual != bad. You have some serious fucking archaic boomer mentality going on.
---
You act like Classic is hard. Most of AQ and even Naxx are god awful simple, boring and easy. The few fights among them that are challenging are mid-to-high tier heroic difficulty in retail, which isn‚Äôt saying much.
---
We dont need more snowflakes running around IF, we already have paladins.
---
This. There's so many factors pushing for slow and fast and it's hard to tell which ones are most impactful. My own experience have been to just use the highest weapon DPS you can get your hands on (or items with great stats on them like core hound tooth or brutality blade). But a slow mainhand and fast offhand feels better to me.
---
What does that have to do with anything besides you bragging. In the last 30 days, this sub has taken a dramatic turn towards alliance tears. It's absurd if you think differently.
---
Mouseover macros lets you cast spells on a unit frame or player model your mouse is hovering over. So if you‚Äôre my tank I can hover my mouse over your frame, without selecting you, and press a button to cast a heal on you. Clique and healbot go one step further and bind spells to modifier clicks. So I can shift click your frame to cast heal and ctrl shift to flash heal. I have dispel on middle mouse cure  disease on shift middle mouse. And since my raid frames change colors when there‚Äôs something dispellable I can very quickly spam middle click on every frame that changed colors.
---
You get commendations, which you can turn in for rep and goodie bags.
---
But why worry about that? AQ is 6-8 months away.
---
Agreed. I hate when people camp lower-level players. I get that sometimes, their goal is to get you to switch to a max-level alt (if you have one) or ask your guild for help (if you have one), resulting in a large-scale battle breaking out. But it's always bugged me. There's absolutely no skill or fun in killing someone so much lower level than you. When you are high-enough level that you can literally press a single button to kill someone, what is the point? That's just griefing. You aren't engaging in a battle and coming out on top. You aren't doing anything skillful or fun. You are just pressing a button that says "this guy is not allowed to play the game right now".
---
I'm glad I play on a PvE server these days. Back in the day, anyone I would ever play with would always be on a PvP server, so I would be forced to try to level up, questing, on a PvP server, with random max-level douche bags camping me and stopping me from playing the game. But some people just *really* get off on the idea that they have the power to prevent a person from playing the game. It's sad.
---
Laughs in PvE
---
You could delete the char, create a new one with same name, and them open the option to restore your old char.. When the char is restored it will say there is another with the same name and you can change the name.
---
The issue started when they could not leave IF. Everyone left when they had to stay in IF due to the world being Horde controlled. Now they do not even have peace in their main city.
---
WRONG  
---
Warrior blue gear is considered second BIS only behind rank 13 gear if you focus on Threat gear. Until AQ that is
---
Blizzard isn't doing anything more likely because they don't want to or don't have the resources to spend developing classic. Those items aren't in the game because they weren't necessary with original Vanilla faction populations. If this had gone on back in Vanilla they absolutely would have fixed it, we know this because that's why they added guards to the zeppelin towers. Way back when alliance would camp the hell out of those to the point where horde couldn't go back and forth. This got fixed. Now they just don't have the resource or will to do any serious development in classic.
---
&gt;If blizzard never let people transfer off it would have never got so bad.
---
Alright, question: Do you believe Ironforge on Flamelash is camped because you're all mega-awesome-l33t-skillz-playaz or because there's a population imbalance?
---
Also, wtf is with the "turn pvp flag off". Ok. Can totally interact with a dead npc when my PvP flag is off.
---
I am impressed the horde managed to camp out these cities on these realms though, given you are all clearly sharing a single brain cell
---
Odd you should say that.  I seem to recall premades carefully sending in a single scout for each BG session, and if what the scout saw wasn‚Äôt a PUG they could easily roflstomp, the scout would leave the game and they‚Äôd requeue with a replacement scout.  It‚Äôs almost as if they went out of their way to avoid other premades rather than relishing a ‚Äúrare‚Äù opportunity to finally face some real competition.
---
Well, what good pieces are there according to you? I would say the best is Band of Accura. However this is prioritized. And Ony neck. Which I have now because it drops every run. Apart from that you have true flight bracers from Majordomo. That rarely drop. And you just get 3% from Tier. So 2% hands, (rare in our guild. Only dropped once) &amp; 1% shoulder.
---
This is why they came out with cross realm bgs
---
Reddit always mad. Can‚Äôt be surprised.
---
As someone wanting to play alliance, is this server worth rolling on??? I don't really wanna do a pve server, but have a friend here. But the alliance dominant element slightly concerns me.
---
Well yeah it's anecdotal. Of course it is. My whole point is that the numbers we have to go off of are unreliable. Therefore, the only thing we can trust is how the servers feel to us on an individual level, IE anecdotal evidence. 
---
To me, Faerlina feels Alliance heavy. That doesn't mean I'm going to jump ship to a new server, though.
---
What's the problem of the old world becoming obsolete, exactly? I play TBC to play TBC, not to play Classic. If I wanted to play Classic I'd play Classic\^\^ Especially now that we have separate legacy servers, I don't really understand this kind of complaint.
---
And flying only ruined WPvP in the sense that it "ruined" (1) large-scale WPvP battles and (2) corpse-camping (since ppl can flee more easily). But WPvP still happened a lot, especially around PvP objectives, daily quest grounds and important farming spots like Elemental Plateau.
---
Also, the game doesn't really revolve around WPvP. I thought Classic Phase 2 kinda made it clear by now that there are better things to do and enjoy in the game\^\^
---
That sound exactly like our main tank. Super early and good gear + garr binding, stop raiding like 7 weeks ago.
---
Ive helped 5 other people farm their HoJ after i got mine first. So in the time ive seen 5 HoJ ive seen 0 SGC.. And im still going..
---
So he can speculate what to change.
---
Nice idea!
---
I'm so glad you brought this up.  Boy, how could they ever possibly avoid this situation?  It's just an unsolvable problem.
---
He is rather dense, isn't he?

Imagine everyone starts with a +1 which adds 100 to their roll on ms loot. Once someone wins an item, they give up their +1 and no longer add 100 to their roll for the rest of raid.
---
let's say that the server is almost the population cap and my guild of 300 people wants to move there but there are not only 50 places, how is the matter resolved, are you forcing me to abandon friendships ??
---
stupid
---
Horde doesn't get sword spec.
---
a server with no horde will still negatively impact your gameplay experience, even if youre a no skill trashcan like you
---
Well guess what. If everyone knew how, those paths would be known to the Horde as well and camped just as the others.
---
The only reason YOU at the moment can use those "secret" routes is because few people use them. So better be glad that no one else knows how.
---
Lf horde people leveling around 21, I'm leaving my warrior alt and solo questing is butt.
---
Incendius, horde, lvl 21-24 ish
---
Made by an angry horde fanboy after his 10v1 gank has failed.
---
&gt;  wpvp will go back to being the fun kind, 
---
yes yes. the non-existant kind. we agree here.
---
Or the top guilds just make ally alts, and make a coalition to turn the stuff in by cheaply selling mats on neutral AH
---
Except anyone who played knew that vanilla even by patch 1.12 was far from balanced. It was incredibly unbalanced actually. And you all haven‚Äôt seen shit yet until you start to see the refuckulous shit warriors and mages in naxx gear (or even ele shaman in aq40 / tier 2 gear) are going to start doing to your precious raw bootyholes. 
---
People wanted the community spirit of vanilla mixed with the janky bullshit that was both exciting and hilarious. The movement for some was largely a movement of preserving that. The others that hopped on did so out of ignorance because you labored under some bizarre delusion that vanilla wow was some amazing balanced golden age. As evidenced by the continued nonsense you‚Äôre all posting about it despite being warned. 
---
1.12 wasn‚Äôt balanced at all. It was just significantly better than the previous patches of druids being fucking awful, shaman having 30 yd range frost shocks, and mages needing to spec talent points into arcane explosion in order for it to be instant cast.
---
Can confirm, I use to make the trip to Org on my rogue in Vanilla to kill the bankers and auctioneers.  Fun times.
---
Eitherway: if the wowcensus population stats are correct that means your server is currently around 70% alliance. You can sit around all day and discuss why you did X Y Z, who's fault it is (Blizzards) and whether you were right or not to make the choices you have etc.
---
Ultimately though it'll still come back to what are you going to do about it (if anything)? The options:
---
1) Re-roll.
---
2) Try getting more people to play Horde on this server.
---
3) Do nothing and hope Blizzard sort the issue out for you.  
---
Personally i'd be hoping for #3 but i'd probably have a cut off point too. I can't imagine you're actually enjoying playing the game in it's current state if you can't even chill in Orgrimmar.
---
The Dai Li were the swamp that needed draining.
---
&gt; As someone who was r13 in vanilla
---
Link your armory for your retail character, you'll have Rank 13 classic Feat of Strength so we can see you validating your claim.

Imagine getting this upset over a joke unrelated to you.
---
I'll do you one better.

[Here's the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OGrrMKHr4)
---
Imagine having this opinion lol
---
I guess not. I really don't understand how reddit works. I made this account years ago but never use it
---
Never thought of hunters as a DOT class =P
---
OK yeah that's good to hear actually. I think tbh I'm just gonna respec to Fury/Arms then and see where that takes me for the time being. Try to tank when I need to and let them know I'm still interested in that...
---
Failing any change there, I'll join a new guild I guess as a OT/MT. Thanks again! What talents do you use? :)
---
I agree but now you have mutliple unbalanced servers you've created from one. Spreading the fire.
---
Yep clear the entirety of the zone between the front door and the portal and just roll through 10 at a time.
---
Weakauras is what you're looking for.
---
I transferred from Lucifron as an alliance couple of days ago and havent had the chance to play.  
---
As an alliance, will I have any fun at all?  
---
I didnt have any trouble leveling to 40 on lucifron, but when they announced that they are closing and everyone panic transfered I got scared by the 80:20 ratio on lucifron and moved aswell.  
---
So, how is the server funwise playing an alliance?
---
That should be part of your unitframes. Unless you're using default ones?
---
Either way, everyone is affected.  If blizzard does nothing, and people who rolled alliance quit PvP servers, the player base of the game declines.  The fewer people who play classic wow, the less blizzard will do to keep it going.  This is how even people on PvE servers are affected.  The game declines, and not enough people play it after a couple years, and blizzard forgets about classic + or anything else having to do with classic, including fixing bugs and community issues.  
---
The flip side of that is a drastic change now, outlined in my post.  Everyone is affected, but the hemorrhaging is stopped and some players even come back.  The community grows and blizzard is forced to continue to maintain the game and maybe release subsequent expansions.
---
I feel like warriors have too many abilities. There's not enough space on my hot bars. What abilities can I get rid of and which are too important? Thanks in advance.
---
Retail and classic aren‚Äôt comparable. Everyone can do everything in retail. There‚Äôs gonna be a wall hit for bwl. Especially on thalnos.
---
Not sure Blizz allowing people to leave is an actual solution to the "problem".  These people will just move to an Ally dominated server and do the same thing to the horde there.  I know Blizz is wanting to milk Classic for a long as possible and wants to keep everyone happy.

Meanwhile I gave up trying to convince my guild on shazzrah that it would be more useful and beneficial for the raid if I would join with my ret instead of my hunter to get one more blessing when we were lacking palas.
---
But our leader and all officers still share that mindset that they would rather trashtalk for 5 minutes and commit sudoko than giving even just a single item to a ret.
---
Don't forget healcomm.  Puts that overhealing shit to bed.
---
Yeah I've been doing that every time I get corpsecamped as well (except when I'm corpserunning to an instance because in that case a new person will always just replace the person that left). Taking a shower while being corpsecamped is a very useful tactic IMO.
---
It‚Äôs way cheaper. So can be a good place holder if you don‚Äôt have the gold right away
---
You say it like a joke but boomkins are like unicorns and if you can bring some decent numbers in DPS a mage group would give their left nut to have you there.

Lol, i am new to reddit i hope u can tell me a tip on how to fix the title :)

Just finally got mine after 18 hours over 2 weeks!

My server Incendius is fine.  It‚Äôs actually slightly alliance dominated and a PVP server.  I‚Äôd rather not have a drastic change affect me as I rerolled on Incendius after being on a PVE server.  I did my own research and rolled on a realm that was somewhat even so I am not in favor of a drastic change because I have a healthy server.  It sucks that people have to face uneven factions but it has been a part of the game since inception and it has always been left up to the players to decide whether or not they want to play on a specific realm.
---
Nightbrace is effectively 55 AP, 10 stam and .17 crit. the resistance is pointless

Cadav is 76 AP, and .27 crit

The parses you pulled up are while he has the P2BiS meanwhile the rest of the players are sitting at prebis/1.5. I'm not sure why so many people are defending him like this. Don't take what that guy said with a grain of salt. It is all 100% factual... this is coming from a person who has been subbed for over a year.
---
Sorry for not using hyperlinks, for some reason it's not working rn.
---
&gt; I know it¬¥s an US thing to throw your principles overboard if it enriches you 
---
weird flex but ok
---
Yeah there are a lot of variations out there. +1 only on tier pieces is another way to do it.
---
All spellpower cause why not.
---
They are cross realm, what I don't know is if they are cross realm with pve and pvp and rp
---
Guilds are the only thing worth blacklisting imo. Nobody is going to remember a specific guy who ninjaed a guildy.
---
Only guild I blacklisted was because the members were consistently toxic and their leadership didn't care.
---
60
---
I think there is a simple combination of two things. 
---
1- only allow equal amounts of both factions to log into a server at a  time +- a few hundred. So if there are 7k ali, and 7.1k horde. Horde are told the server is full until more ali join.
---
2- Allow open server transfers for factions from one server to another in a way that improves the numbers. So if you're horde, and you're on an overpopulated horde server, allow transfers to an overpopulated ali server.
---
If in an attunement group with a locked raider, and a person zones into MC portal, they would get locked.
---
You chose your name when you make a character.Period.  
---
New name = new character  
---
(making a new character is called, rerolling)
---
Blizz has logs(chat logs and combat logs), but they couldn't prove cross-faction collusion from ingame logs if people communicated it outside the game. From Blizz logs, they can read only that there was some weird pvp going on and can't act only based on that.
---
Whoa whoa whoa!!  Hoard only ganks alliance though I thought?!  Alliance are the perfect martyrs just trying to play :'(
---
Don‚Äôt spend a dime until 60 on extra gear that‚Äôs not bis and other things that aren‚Äôt required. Yes your expenses are less than most classes but that doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt going to need plenty of gold at 60.  DEFINITELY find a lock on your server to help you with mount quest, it might cost you 50g but that‚Äôs nothing. 
---
Once again, you are going to need money at 60.  About half of your pre bis are ‚Äúof shadow wrath‚Äù greens. This is an established market (at least on my server) and it will take daily searches on the AH in order to find a bargain. Otherwise you will pay 50-110g for each item depending on server economy. 
---
Also, let‚Äôs say you hit 60, and join an MC pug. You get azuresong mageblade, your raid bis weapon. That‚Äôll be 300g to enchant with +30 spell power.
---
I could go on but I feel like the point is made. Be frugal when you‚Äôre leveling.
---
Every time I see these posts it just makes me happier I rolled on a PVE server.
---
I'm on Razorgore Alliance since release. It's a great server imo. :)
---
Are pve and PvP realms battleground linked? If so it won't be bad. As most PvE realms are alliance rich
---
As an alliance on a 60/40 horde server I have to disagree that you don't feel the sting until it gets beyond a 3:1 ratio.  In lvl 60 areas you have a very bad time.  As an original Vanilla player I don't believe any server ever got beyond 60/40, and most were somewhere between 45/55 (and people complained about that too lol).
---
Not really, you can check people comment histories and figure it out. I sure the are some outliners though.
---
I think the simpler solution that everyone would still hate anyway, would be just to bring cross realm layering. With that being said i really don't think it will ever happen. I think Blizz is going to be spiteful about the success of classic and the #nochanges movement and basically go the "This is what you asked for route" so the can say they were right all along when they said "You think that's what you want, but you really don't"
---
Jesus he's actually terrible.
---
Does your Owl have Claw learnt or just Screech?
---
If you have both on your Owl just take your Owl with you on a run and see what happens with Screech on auto-cast. If you find it starts messing with aggro, then turn it off and turn Claw onto auto-cast. You'll have *slightly* lower DPS on that run, but nothing anyone would notice.
---
If your Owl doesn't know Claw and doesn't have the spare TP, I'd say respec your pet just to experiment. You can probably drop some of the armor talents since they shouldn't be taking hits on a dungeon run and throw in Claw.
---
They wipe easily, buy there is not often enough people that will sit and fight them for 15 hours a day. Especially when you get 0 honor after 4 kills.
---
Yeah sure most of healing comes from healing touch. Still I do see quite a lot druids using rejuvenation. I'm pretty sure it's just habit for most as hots have been majority of druid healing for a long time.
---
Currently most effective way of healing is regrowth spamming. It's faster than HT so you can pull more numbers. If other healers and dps are doing their job and you have consumables (mana pot and runes) there is no way you run out of mana in MC. I usually need to use potion/runes in Majordomo and Raggy, rest bosses are easily doable without.
---
Twink brackets are where casuals with bad gear go to pvp

---
I only played classic for pvp, not mining nodes.
---
Basically. Just try to stay on them since you're combat spec'd you do a lot of damage. Are you combat spec'd because you're leveling? You'll have a rough time pvping if you're not pvp spec'd. Another thing you can do is use crippling poison so its easier to stay on people.
---
Holy fuck there are actually alliance idiots like you that exist
---
If you have wf you prob won't need slam or cleave.

Curiosity + planing.

My favorite is when he was calling out Advertise saying that all he can do is MC into lava and that he has no skill, and then Advertise breaks down the video and how he has a mage feeding him reckoning procs, a mage that sheeps him when he gets low health, and people who bandage him when mind controlled, and Advertise points out that MC'ing him into lava is really the only viable way to win in that situation. 
---
He then shows a duel in which he points out how Esfand has no idea how to play and wastes his mana and then complains about how he could totally just run away. 
---
He's a massive tool.
---
this is perfect.
---
American chiming in, definitely have a blacklist, and love being able to say no every single time. Granted, it's just for party-groups, my raid groups don't need pugs.
---
Not my fault that your "cross realm" argument is completely illogical.
---
Changes nothing, you not buying them doesn't suddenly stop Blizzard from spending their resources making the only good art assets come from the store. You not buying the celestial steed didn't suddenly stop WoD from having nothing but reskinned rep mounts while the cash shop got all unique assets. 
---
But do continue to take your non-stand against the cash shop so an artist can slide a Hue slider on a 10 year old mount to "reward" you for your in game actions, while Ion keeps telling you that having unique looking class sets is just TOO DAMN HARD nowadays while the artists shit out another unique flying boat dragon into the store.
---
No, come to Windseeker. Max pop servers suck. Still Alliance dominated, but way lower overall pop.
---
That‚Äôs actually insane , Jesus Christ
---
Ah, a mistake on my part. 
---
But it *was* a mistake. How else can you interpret it? The guy has the item now, Asmongold doesn't. 
---
Why do you feel like you have to invent reasons to justify your hate for someone?
---
Yeeea, I don't think so...
---
As a tank on my server I've had a few people do fucked up shit, leave the group, and then whisper me to tank a dungeon next week. It's always so funny when it finally clicks for yhem.
---
Hold one wait, grass is allowed to grow near the trunks of trees? Ok what‚Äôs next? Why are the clouds shooting into the ocean?! Heathen.
---
so instead of blizzard making a small change making it much easier on people, we should just put up with it and add an extra 5 seconds of nonsense typing the same sentence over and over and 5-60 seconds of silence waiting for this stranger to whisper you.
---
god forbid it's the last spot and someone else whispers you, then you have some drama.
---
like do you really think it would be better for this suggestion to not be in game? i don't get it.
---
God damn. Here I am complaining about it taking me 45, yikes
---
In my total of 15 days played on classic so far and lots of mob and dungeon grind I haven‚Äôt seen one rare item drop yet. :(

I didn't say they believed the game was balanced but they wanted the same balance because unarguably 1.12 is totally unbalanced but we know the unbalance and it makes a very predictable game.
---
Nobody is gonna be surprised when mage will be topping the charts and all the players who rolled a mage for that will have exactly what they wanted. We know that balance druids aren't a sleeper class that maybe will become good but will remain a joke like resto druid will not become the best healers at any time (reasons that explains why there's 3x more mages than druid for exemple)
---
I mean what would have been the more unpredictable and source of shenanigans: to keep everything as it is in 1.12 or try for exemple to rework all classes a bit?  This would have been a source of great shenanigans if suddenly the engineer mage got his ass kicked by a balance druid with a special leatherworking boots totally new in the game?
---
The fury warriors who wouldn't be allowed to raid certainly care.
---
Guzzle soy harder
---
And I'm saying noone needed to play on a private server to know that releasing the honor system without BG's was going to be a cluster.
---
I don't know why private server players have the mentality that they somehow know more about WoW than anyone else.  Especially when they were playing on hack servers that at best got things mostly right.
---
Represent
---
Wait till you get owned in bgs because you are used to hiding all the time
---
Unlike retail where every activity can be repeated infinite times, there‚Äôs so few systems in classic to engage with regularly that you can really grind to improve your character and pvp is one of the biggest. What these players are doing is saying ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to grind this and earn it‚Äô. I just don‚Äôt get the point of playing then. There‚Äôs no achievement in cheating the system and there‚Äôs no fun in mindlessly grinding honor this way. Surprised they haven‚Äôt burned out already.
---
Yeah drop rate feels really low tho, i found tanking strat live to be more profitable
---
cool. than there you go OP. 1-2h of sm farming and you respec every week
---
If have mining and engineering what is the best way to maximize profit of thorium bars? Just sell them straight up or turn them into something?
---
Thanks for your input, but maybe you didn't catch my stipulation that only PvP servers with imbalance worse than 60/40 would be addressed.
---
I haven't been told I was blacklisted by anyone yet, so probably not. I would assume that's the kind of thing they'd get a lot of satisfaction from telling me, right?
---
Players: We want classic WoW #NOCHANGES
---
Blizzard: You think you do, but you don't
---
Players: Wow, this game favors Horde so much wtf
---
Blizzard: #NOCHANGES
---
How can nochanges be causing problems when the launch version of classic was literally already completely different than vanilla?
---
Better talents, better itemization, layering giving the hardcore players extra resources to progress with, etc etc.
---
To be honest wow is just in a pathetic state, the fact that most of you enjoy playing with addons that tell you everything and trivialize the game, speaks volumes about what kind of gamers you are.  You just want the illusion of challenge, but no challenge that actually risks you failing a lot.
---
Trying to mow down a tree definitely sums up PVE.
---
So what? People would just level 3 characters instead of 2.
---
But server merges would only take place when there aren't enough players to sustain a normal population and because there are fewer players there would also be fewer items coming with them.
---
Yes there'd be some instability shortly after a merge but this would be nothing compared to a layered server, which had a skewed economy for the entirety of phase 1.

The bottom panel should say "why would Blizzard do this?"

Beating my child hood wow hero... feels good man. And it was a 1v1 in a secluded area just like his videos lol. Best moment of classic easy. Tidal charm ftw and playing around his reflector is why I inched out that win.
---
&gt; If you don‚Äôt want to experience the game like it used to be, then you don‚Äôt want classic.
---
Classic had constant patches. Classes were buffed, nerfed, etc. Bugs were fixed and talents were changed. Gear was re-itemized. If you don't want changes, you don't want classic.

That's a very good example of proper action during p2, well done!

offer pvp to pve transfert peri fucking od
---
You've been lucky then haha. There's no worst feeling than setting the perfect ambush only to get your ice trap easily resisted... 
---
I've been testing in pve while doing tribute runs. If you wait for the mob to hit you, then you can safely fd. Like you said it's harder to do in PvP because there's not only auto attacks but also spells. If the player has already clicked the spell and is in range, it may fucks up your fd trap combo due to spell batching
---
This is the exact reason I picked pve this go around. Even back in vanilla with my rose tinted glasses on I remembered being ganked and camped when just trying to level up an alt. I remember the good times, but I didn't forget the bad times. Knowing that gamers in general have changed a ton since 2004/2005 I wasn't taking the change that it would turn out like this. I can play in the BGs if I really want to pvp, the Wpvp days of vanilla can't be recreated today sadly. I enjoy being able to log on, spend 45 minute grinding/questing and knowing that is what I am actually spending that time doing instead of spending it as a ghost waiting for the 5 alliance players to give up camping me and leave the area.
---
The problem is that Alliance players  are very much outnumbered and they can't fight back the horde. This is nothing new in wow - a faction imbalance.  Now the real issue is that this escalated to the point  where there are around 100/200 active Alliance players. All others migrated because  the game is virtually unplayable. Why is it unplayable  you would ask? Because  the enemy  can freely roam you capital cities 24/7 and even make you corpse walk to safety in your own capital. 
---
 And now to make a logical conclusion.  The people who basically sleep in the enemy cities and kill everything on sight for a few HK's are the reason for this migration. They don't  even think what this means in terms of the server  and the playing experience as a whole. And here the prime example- this bozo just beeing an asswhole and then just crying when he realizes what has contributed to happen.  Welcome to the internet in 2019 folks
---
A majority of players would probably benefit a lot more playing PvE than PvP.
---
How is he in any way not allowing you to explain your situation?
---
Materials for the Darkmoon Faire quests will probably rise when it is released. E.g. Glowing Scorpid Blood, Vibrant Plumes, Evil Bat Eyes, Soft Bushy Tails, Small Furry Paws.
---
I recently got an invite for a BRD emp run. "Sweet" I think to myself, maybe I can finally get my offhand.
---
I get in to the dungeon and realize that the group consists of me and four warriors; all from the same guild.
---
I think to myself, "Well that's odd, ah well, life's hard out here for a Holy Paladin, no time to get picky".
---
Everything is fairly normal up until we get to the arena, I'm group healing, but they're trash mobs that go down pretty quick so no red flags.
---
Then we get to arena. We get bats, fun. When I'm drinking as the boss arrives, I think for a moment and say in party chat "Okay, who's the tank?".
---
The response...."We're all tanking".
---
That's right. Four Prot warriors, two with shields, one with a two-hander, and another dual wielding.
---
I regret rolling on a pvp server and would gladly pay to transfer to pve.
---
Apart from more common "meme"-specs (ret pala, boomkin etc)?
---
I come to think of:
---
\- Disc/holy priest smite spec
---
\- Melee hunter
---
\- Arcane missiles mage
---
&gt; As someone who was r13 in vanilla i can say that it's exactly the same.
---
Link us your armoury and prove it.
---
I've been playing WoW since 2005. It was never *this* bad. There was always a form of ganking or lowbie zone grieving. The argument is about the quantity though, and that was impossible back in the day. The server population alone was three or four times smaller than it is today.
---
There was an occasional gank or an hour or two of lockdown in a smaller town, but it was never *this* much. Stop spreading nonsense.
---
Very helpful advice. Thanks for taking the time to write this out!
---
I kind of agree with this guy though, the post says more about the person writing it and the kind of conclusion he gets that the moron who is very very shortsighted
---
It sounds more like a hate boner to circlejerk than anything and add nothing to the conversation
---
You‚Äôre arguing that you should wear a scuba suit to space.
---
Scuba suits work underwater just great (PVE), but they don‚Äôt work in space (PVP). You can‚Äôt really compare the two, it‚Äôs apples and oranges. 
---
I see your logic about leveling, experiencing content, but I also see a large portion of the WoW experience missing. 
---
Ganking, getting ganked, raiding cross roads, and fighting the 1v1 roadside stare down is a huge part of the WoW experience. 
---
I can also understand how stupid imbalances can gate the weaker faction from experiencing ANY content.
---
I think faction based merges/transfers should be initiated, but move to PVE isn‚Äôt the answer.
---
Instant queue times though and I guarantee you'll memorize all 9 other people who queued up for the last 30 games.
---
He's totally right. Allys are little pussies. Why are you playing a pvp game on pvp server and crying about being killed by other players? You are plainly stupid
---
You make no sense, his point is valid regardless of his class
---
You might as well sap, cheap shot while still sapped, run a short distance to drop combat and restealth, item with another cheap shot. At this point you have five combo points to play with and haven't used any CDs...
---
Some servers. I am on Sulfuras-US and it feels close to 1:1. I get ganked by an Alliance "Kill Party" and a few minutes later a Horde party shows up to fight them.
---
The worldwide population has Horde outnumbering Alliance 60:40. There are going to be huge queue timers for them.
---
Yes I'm saying there was nothing special about playing on a pserver that somehow gave them some super insight into phase 2.
---
Case in point plenty of people who didn't play on pservers predicted exactly what would happen.
---
Horde Atiesh player, here! &lt;3
---
Care to post the macro?  I didn't know one existed.
---
If we can get all the Druids on my Raid team on-board with using that, then yea, it would be very beneficial.  But still having assigned groups for regrowth and Rejuvenation still makes sense, as it would prevent the highest +healing druid in guild from slapping 20+ Rejuvs on the Raid and running out of mana long before the boss fight is over.
---
Reread the post
---
link or bullshit
---
Yes.  The majority of the people still playing do not advocate against their faction members committing these actions so you might as well be stuck on your own server with your own bg timers. You did this to yourselves. Police your own.
---
I noticed this yesterday as well, but have no idea as to why
---
blizz should pressure nochange stone golems back to private servers and start taking action to move forward with this mess
---
Sphpoooky
---
U said wait until tbc like its sure it will b released.
---
lets hope it doesnt! 
---
or if it does make it so theres no fucking flying mounts.
---
tho i would much apreciate arenas in vanilla in some way :)
---
It is not ideal to mix the single  target and aoe talents.  If you have frostbite and try to AOE it can mess it up because the pack will get separated.  Better to pick one and stick with it.  You said you are new, I would stick with single target for now because AOE is pretty unforgiving (1 mistake is hard to recover from).  If you aren't "good" at AOE-ing then it quickly becomes slower than just questing (deaths, not pulling enough, etc.) plus a lot of mages are going AOE route so competition can be tricky and if you're on a pvp server you are easy honor.
---
I worry for any server where that search doesn't open the search window.
---
Why not just /who part of their name without the letter?
---
But you're confirming exactly what I'm saying: you don't want "jank, bullshit and instability" that made Vanilla fun but the safe state of a game where everything is figured out.
---
You're afraid of a patch that would shift power and make the game unbalanced in a different way.
---
Also curious. Are you just aoe pulling and looting mobs? Are you enchanter? Sounds like a neat way to make some cash
---
Not sure about the specific feature but I ise tidy plates, works great.
---
Yeah, that had nothing to do with Blizzard massively increasing the total popcaps beforehand, or launching with way too few servers. 
---
Do you actually have a learning disability?
---
&gt; Zach (Asmongold's real persona) is a smart, college-educated
---
He dropped out after 1 year, FYI.
---
About pummelers. 
---
They're necessary if you want to compete on dps chart. That said, ferals can currently do 400-600 dps in most of MC and help with heals at Rag. 
---
In a regular guild MC bosses take between 1min and 3min.  That's either 2 or 5 charges of pummeler. I'd say average is 2 or 3 charges per boss. I doubt you'll ever use 5 since the longer fights you can't stay on boss constantly. But for 9 bosses(you can't be a cat at Rag) in MC you'll need at least 6 pummelers per full run. Pummeler has around 2/5 drop chance so you should do gnomeregan clear 4 times every week. Just put hs in BB or gromgol and it's easy for horde. For ally keep hs in if obviously. 
---
About wolfshead helm. Absolutely necessary.
---
Don‚Äôt you hate it when someone steals your last hit
---
Didn't they have transfers available? Why didn't they take them?
---
It's not wrong.. I'm no Noggenfogger Alliance.. and the numbers (according to Ironforge pro) are much the same as flamelash WAS before the exodus..
---
I'm levelling.. I'm now.. 49. and right now typing this, because I've been killed 12 times trying to get from the boat at theramore to the flight master at menethil. 
---
Do they REALLY not realise that if I get the arse and stop playing, that is one less player for bg's.. making their queues longer. so they come back to the docks.. and lo and behold.. nobody is there. and then we enter the same cycle. 
---
At this point, I really do feel 2 changes would be GREAT.
---
1, 58+ is an HK for 60.. not lower. at LEAST 56..
---
2, buff the guards. stealth detection. quadruple their damage. give them all the nets etc.. they are there to protect an area. not to sit there whilst some neet gets his rocks off
---
I have loads of add-on, so I may just need to change some settings. I  should just play around with my add-ons a bit, it is still set-up for leveling. Should make it more raid friendly.
---
So, the only people that would bitch are those on a very imbalances realm where their faction is the dominant one. It would cause players of the dominant faction to quit the game because they can't play. Long term it works out for the better because the realm would be balanced. 
---
What's occuring now is the wrong faction is quiting the game this the end result will be a pve realm for dominant faction. 
---
What comes from all of this is a very enjoyable play experience for those logged in.
---
Ha, i was horde on that server, glad i stopped playing
---
On my server flasks get used because all the top end guilds want to parse and speed clear
---
Shit, I thought tab just cycled through them. Had no idea that you could aim with your camera.
---
I don't care how he said it. He is actively causing the problem himself. He deserves to be ridiculed.
---
And yes, when people toxically keep farming players and preventing them from actually playing, you get upset behaviour. Even before honor was implemented I had to wait over 2 days to progress through Duskwood because a druid spent the entire weekend insta-killing other players, for literally no gain.
---
Reap what you sow.
---
What's a good pvp spec up for level 49 fury?
---
I asked the author about this on Curse Forge.
---
It is an option left over from retail. 
---
I suggested adding fields in the config in which we could put in the names of MT and OTs so that it would function in classic, and he said he liked that idea.
---
Because of gear walls? Cause that is largely the main issue which even exists atm from some pugs who can‚Äôt kill rag before submerge. I‚Äôd say people forget you can do heroic with 30 which means the number of people coordinating isn‚Äôt that much higher. Plus there is a higher responsibility to perform as I said earlier since people will remember you and by the time AQ comes out people will have a reputation for the most part. The main issue is going to be that the average classic player is worse than the average retail player but there are enough retail/pserver players to make a pug tbh. Making sure people are using consumables will be the biggest wall for pugs initially imo since they can make or break a run.
---
Wouldnt the same logic apply to cleave tho? It also consumes your next MH swing and adds a small damage modifier to it. At least in theory, assuming perfect conditions (enough Rage to cleave with every MH hit) a fast MH has a higher cleave damage output potential than a slow MH with the same dps. Whether that would outweigh the reduced damage of WW and OP is another story. Tho having rage enough to cleave on every MH hit with 1.8 Speed is probably not very realistic.
---
or create an alliance alt, funnel mats, and GG
---
What server and faction?
---
Weird how this doesn't have nearly 8k upvotes like the alliance cry fest(s) do.
---
Show me the bluepost where it says that was the purpose of the transfers, ill wait.
---
&gt;Cheapshot &gt; BS &gt;build energy &gt; kidney &gt; BS &gt;BS &gt; reset with blind.  Sap &gt; Repeat.  Reset with gouge and/or vanish. Sap. Repeat.
---
If you're talking about doing this as Combat Daggers, that will only be a 3 combo point Kidney.
---
Our guild is providing mats for Thunderfury because it helps the whole raid.
---
For Hand of Rag, we will give them our one and only Ingot for free, but they have to farm the rest themselves.
---
So far, no one wants the Eye if it does drop. The PvPers don't want to miss a month of battlegrounds to farm mats, and the PvE focused people don't want to spend so much gold for an item they won't use in PvE. So . . . we're not sure what will happen if the Eye drops.
---
The goal is getting enough defensive stats so you don't die and then go ham on threat generating stats (Weapon skill&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hit to 6%&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;crit&gt;Strength&gt;Agility)
---
Defense is one of the least important tanking stats due to Shield Block making you immune to crits and crushing for 2 strikes every 5 seconds, as a rule of thumb if you're struck more than twice in a 5 second window the boss/mob doesn't hit hard enough for a crit to be scary.
---
Hell when you get decent gear and go fury tank you'll *want* to be critted on low hitting bosses like Onyxia because the 25% damage increase from Enrage is huge.
---
Pfft. Obviously photoshopped Orgrimmar over what is clearly Ironforge. Nice try! #Hordeisalwaystheproblem
---
No I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt trust the balance team to make changes that would preserve the charm of the game which was the jank bullshit and instability. I‚Äôm concerned the game would be retail lite. If they can ‚Äúshift the power‚Äù but keep all the things that keep the feel of that game alive that‚Äôd be totally fine.
---
Why did a dragon manage the humans resources?
---
My body is a cage that keeps me
---
From dancing with the one I love
---
But my mind holds the key
---
I agree that there's nothing special about it aside from the fact that they played the patch cycles many times over with different admins, scripts staff etc. 
---
However, that is not nothing.
---
I don‚Äôt play on this server. But you clearly don‚Äôt understand what I am saying - the server is camped because the alliance is gone and there is nothing else to do for horde. If blizzard never let the faction balance get so bad - it wouldn‚Äôt be this way and there would be alliance in the cities to fend off the 25 horde that are in IF. (That‚Äôs not a lot).
---
I‚Äôm combat daggers, it‚Äôs easy to stunlock low armor classes like rogue. 
---
For example against rogue 
---
Cheap shot &gt; Backstab &gt; thistle tea &gt; backstab &gt; kidney shot&gt;kill
---
I have nice gear and perditions blade so this combo will usually kill a rogue.
---
Against other classes I will do same combo except after kidney shot I will Blind when kidney is almost done then reset and then Cheap shot &gt; backstab or if they are low hp ambush &gt; backstab.
---
This is my trick too. 
---
Ever since my hunter hit 48, my house has gotten a lot cleaner. 
---
I mean, sure, they WILL still be there after I get all my laundry folded and put away, walked the dog, and taken a shower, but hot dang am I fresh and clean for another corpse run.
---
&gt; Why didn‚Äôt they just transfer.
---
Because nobody guessed it would be *this* bad. Yes, some guilds were leaving. But during the last two days of the transfer, literally *everyone* left almost overnight.
---
It was a completely unexpected move and left everyone who didn't log in for a few days absolutely flabbergasted upon coming back.
---
What a shitty analogy. Take your delusional comment and reread that shit.
---
Thats because you started playing after BG's. Vanilla was just as bad...
---
or they'll create a lvl 1 alliance alt, funnel mats via neutral AH, and open AQ gates anyway.
---
There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll farm you if they are trying to rank, Honorable kill DRs still apply in battlegrounds so that‚Äôs a plus.
---
I could agree if you said you wanted it like it was, following the patch progression that classic originally had. 
---
But you don‚Äôt want that. You want patches that change things to apply more to a ‚Äòmodern‚Äô game in 2019. 
---
If you want a living breathing game that can go this way or that way depending on what players want, then classic isn‚Äôt for you. What you‚Äôre looking for is retail (which you‚Äôre already paying a sub for). 
---
The changes you seem to be looking for will absolutely not come into the game before all of the phases are over, nor should they come into the game. 
---
Classic *was* an evolving game. But now people want to experience that again. So the options are to either follow the classic patches, or pick one classic patch. New patches with new changes are a no-go.
---
Crippling poison, Adrenaline Rush, lots of Backstabs.
---
Crippling poison should be your best friend.
---
He does have an obnoxious stream persona, as does dr disrespect, but it‚Äôs a persona at the end of the day, and it‚Äôs earning him bank.
---
Given that there will be no IRL consequences to the actions he takes, it is simply drumming up publicity for him when people post to reddit/YouTube
---
 [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e87tcs/looking_for_groupguildplayers_monday_december_09/) it is.
---
You've clearly never played on a one sided server. I have and sometimes would go days without seeing an attackable alliance player.
---
We handed out the first sulfuron blocks to our enhancer. Had to borrow some from other guilds, so we'll have to give back those back before we think about anything else sulfuronblock involved 
---
For tf we'll pool Arcanite bars from alchemists and miners and thus don't really pay for it as much as we farm for it.
---
Earning DKs for honorless targets will immediately backfire into abusing this, jumping into mass pvp with lvl 1 toons. You can‚Äôt lock every aoe ability for open world pvp.
---
While flagging recently landed players dishonorable might not seem a bad idea at first, I am sure this would result a) in some kind of abusing, since you become a walking DK-Bomb and b) in people waiting for your buff/debuff to expire, while CC-ing you. B would enlarge the amount of time you need for corpsewalking wherever you were heading too.
---
Flagging someone for a DK after reviving would instantly kill wPVP since people in massfigts cant tell who just ressed. Abuse guaranteed(tho this cant be called abuse anymore since it can not be expected to ress outside a hotspot and wait for your debuff to expire before rejoining the fight, leading to everyone giving honor once and DKs for the rest of the battle).
---
IMO a solution to the problem could be:
---
After dying, let‚Äôs say 5 times, in open world due to PVP-actions, while each death followed the previous (or the ress) within 2-3mins you enter a PVE-State for 10 minutes. This state will hold untill a) you leave the area, b) you perform any kind of PVP action or reflag yourself with /pvp, c) the duration expires. 
---
All numbers to be tuned.
---
I know this is not what PVP servers are supposed to be, but you can feel free to reflagg pvp instantly if you are into it, or give away some honor to the junkies while wasting 10-15 minutes of time and still be able to reach your dungeon or make a little progress to your quest without being stomped. Just as an infinite corpse-caping prevention.
---
Stop talking please, u are wrong, this is literally like it was on vanilla, like it was on private servers and SUPRISE SUPRISE its the same thing in classic.
---
This. Paladins run on spell power.
---
&gt; or they'll create a lvl 1 alliance alt
---
On a PvP Server...?
---
Cheap epic mount and some great pieces of gear
---
Hello, Eric, this is a you as a old man. I am an ugly and I am dead. Alone.
---
Kinda unrelated, but how good is the barman shanker compared to other daggers? I assume the MC one's beat it, but is it top tier among pre-raid?
---
Best thing is to ask the raid leader for some clarification
---
I myself use +2, but this means, in my pug raids, that you have 2 "charges" and 1 charge is used when you win something, so you can win max 2 items per run.
---
There's a lot of different ways so yeah ask the leader for info on what it means. I stopped using +1 since people tend to leave/go offline when they win something early on..sadly.
---
People sell their accounts dumbass. I played in vanilla and it was 100% like this. You probably started after BG's or not even in vanilla.
---
People think the nerfed version means the retail version. But that is not the case. It means it doesn't take 3 days anymore to win it. But it could still be easily 8 hour per AV.
---
Oh shit I forgot. &lt;Picks up script&gt; Sorry what I meant to say is while I was eating alliance babies and pillaging their orphanages, I fell down due to my own poor life choices and died repeatedly. The Alliance are innocent, oppressed victims and I, a proud Horde member, inject methcocainecaffeine directly into my fucking neckveins so I can stay awake to harass them 24/8.
---
Uh no, not even close. You need to do most of the quest chain yourself which still ends up costing like 600g.
---
yeah, and while I don't want cross realm BGs for Classic, I find it ironic that the Classic fanbase (at least the ones on reddit) will complain about a feature and have asked for QoL changes that Blizzard implemented into retail, and yet they dog on retail for having too much QoL, where is the line?
---
Agreed. My 3-5 man tries to find other 3-5 mans, however that 59 on the road is almost 100 honor in a group. What do you expect?
---
Earthfury.
---
Making this post 1 day before BGs release
---
smh
---
Meh... Guild switched over from Stalagg to Heartseeker, so I followed them and while leveling was a lot easier, I'd rather be the "40" on a 40/60 server than the "75" in a 75/25 server (but definitely not the "25" on a 25/75 server).
---
That said, that 25% Horde on Heartseeker is resilient AF and I tip my hat off to them for being able to farm us stupid Allies for honor every day. There's always a group camping DM entrance and another camping MC entrance, who just kill PvEers as they trickle in.
---
Obviously, they get wiped when Alliance groups up and fight back, but they get tons of HKs in the process.
---
Alliance doing Alliance things, they all transfered to a server that is already Alliance dominant :D
---
Yea and the thing is...PvP still happens on PvE servers. 
---
I'm on PvE and there are constantly battles at SS, BRM, STV, and other places. My guild has extremely active PvPers that barely raid and are mostly out in the open world hunting Horde. 
---
If getting ganked 30 times by ?? while leveling is "the real classic experience" then count me out. It sucked when I did it in vanilla, no thanks this time around.
---
Or you can sheep them, then kill them. Is it divk? Yes. But it‚Äôs effective
---
That whole fight is just memes. "Go for the one in the dress, you idiots!"
---
I also enjoyed Bloodlord Mandokir "levelling up" during his fight and yelling "Ding!" and another boss from across the raid yelling "'ey, gratz mon!"
---
i don't call him stupid this idea is stupid .
---
Anything that doesn't miss, glance, Dodge, parry, or block can crit. So the crit "cap" is whatever you chance to not do those things is. This is very different whether you're talking about dual wielding or 2 hand weapons (dual wielding has an 18% chance to miss at 6% 305), and if you're talking about yellow hits or white hits (special attacks don't glance or get the dual wield miss penalty).
---
This is a perfect summation of what happens is most of these threads. "It happens on both sides!", they say.  No, no it doesn't.
---
It exists! Got my SGC on my 2nd BRD run ever but it took about 80 runs to get HoJ
---
I always enjoyed leveling pvp, and resource pvp. It's not mass scale, but little 1v1 or 2v2 fights based on trying to kill a quest mob or get a resource. What we have currently is a shit show though I agree.
---
Ah, I must've missed it. thank you!
---
They still exist, but everyone is frost
---
10g weekly raid tax for every raider in six raid teams. 
---
Every guild Onyxia run (roughly 10 per week), the bags are sold via silent bid, person who spent the most gets the bags, and the gold he spent goes to the guild bank. 
---
We also craft Onyxia cloaks for every raider for free.
---
Go read the official forums, basically everyone knew exactly what was going to happen in phase 2.
---
Well, officially, I switched off Stalagg because my guild did. I was the last officer arguing we should stay, but in the end, learning that BG queues were cross-servers and we'D have insta-queues no matter where we played sealed the deal, as that was my last (and main) argument.
---
I wouldn't call Heartseeker fine, though. We could use more Horde.
---
Yep Legion feature
---
Why is that man so ugly?
---
There have been many AV's. We're getting 1.12 version of AV. Which is not the same as retail rush AV. It's just the version that does not take 3 days to complete. But you can still have matches taking a few hours easily.
---
I said elsewhere that I don't see it as cheating.  Shit, modern gamers call pretty much everything "cheating" that they just don't like, or think is an advantage to someone else.  Play a rogue?  cheating.  Use consumables?  cheating.  Engineering?  100% cheating.
---
Being smarter than your competition (your own faction in the case of honor system) is not cheating in my book.  You're playing the game by the rules the game sets in place, and gamers quickly learn how to take advantage of those rule sets to give themselves an advantage.
---
Good luck with relying on a few people with double subscription to play messenger for the materials.
---
I've been using the same bear from level 12 to 52 and was thinking I should try to find this cat. Any advice for a first time player? Do I just ride around The Badlands with track beasts on mousing over the minimap until I see "Brokentooth"?
---
Most people don't actually enjoy the reality of PVP, they just do it to be with friends or because they didn't know better or because they were told it's the "real" way to play.
---
FYI...PVE has pvp in it, we just also have the ability to ignore the enemy faction and play without that stress sometimes.
---
It makesa  me happy that we trigger you so much. The issue is simply that despite having such number advantage , that we were able to outmaneuver you on multiple occasions. We got all Kazzaks except the release date one and ofter manage to kill your full raids with 20 ppl. Not to mention we helped to disband your Nucleus noob guild (arent you Tastemyskill lol?)
---
I like how you‚Äôre not saying why
---
Bro if you didn't pummeler or power shift you were doing about half the dps of druids today do in pre-bis idk why you keep mentioning your rank 13 gear like a few ap and crit make much of a difference. Also powershifting is the single most engaging rotation for dps... if you find dpsing as feral boring then you would find dpsing as any class even more boring..
---
I fucking hate your UI.  The font is by far the worst part.
---
Of course it's not perfect.
---
That said, game wide numbers are much better than individual servers numbers.
---
having 100,000k plus data points and 100ish servers helps statiscally to balance the individual inaccuracies.
---
Well I am on Firemaw and didn't want to transfer because there is no data on balance on other servers, simple enough, maybe being scared of moving to even more dead server?  
---
Blizzard is giving no info at all and I feel like that's making it 15x worse.  
---
But yeah, they could have transfered, true.
---
This is some 4d chess shit.
---
Only true reason to change your characters name: you were a dick, want to continue to be a dick, but cant stand being ostracized because of being a dick.  Rinse, lather, repeat.
---
No offense just an observation, but everyone looks down on "Pvp happened on a Pvp server" comments meanwhile this comment is kinda just as bland, it's "pve happened on a pve server" in essence.
---
I'm saying that the balance isn't inherently bad, it's the population.
---
Back when servers only held 3000 people there simply weren't enough players to camp like we're being camped.
---
There weren't death balls waiting every step from Thorium point to the BRD entrance; not because players didn't want to, but because you simply didn't have the numbers.
---
Now there's enough people on the server to camp all the boats (not just neutral ones), all the flight points, auction houses, the tram, mailboxes, as well as all of the endgame dungeons.
---
Regrowth is more mana efficient than Rejuvenation.  Yes, it costs more, because it's healing for more as well.  In raids, I typically use Rank 4 regrowth.  and Max rank on the OT's and MT's.
---
If a person is above half health, they get Rejuv.  If they're below half health, Regrowth.
---
Just weather, since zf is technically outside.
---
I shall /moo and then will fight for death and glory
---
I agree with you - Eve Online is one of the ultimate risk vs. reward type of games out there.  Being defeated has more of a significant impact.
---
In my original comment, I didn't intend to make it sound like being on a pvp server sucked.  I love both types of servers, and it has been a good change of pace to go back and forth between the 2.  For those people who are extremely impacted by the faction imbalance and to the point of quitting the game, I only suggest giving a pve server a try.  Nothing stops you from doing your pve thing, and people are flagged for pvp all day long if you want to get into that as well.
---
Or you can just wait it out until BG queues go Live (tomorrow?) and world pvp will see some reduction.  I'm pretty sure you can't join a BG if you are running to your corpse, so people will be more cautious about queuing up and going out to world pvp at the same time.
---
Finally, all my retail characters have war mode on.  The exp and gold bonus are nice, plus I've only seen a few folks of the other faction actually having it enabled too.  The risk of being camped on retail is currently substantially lower than in Classic, so the bonuses are worth it.
---
What do you think this is? Some sort of *game*?
---
Windseeker would love to have you...if you decide to come back.  :)  Hell, hmu and I'll send you some bags and a few g to get you started.
---
Is this dependent on some game settings? I've probably done 4-500 ZF runs and I haven't seen this before. Or, I haven't noticed before.
---
They are just staying true to the #nochanges spirit
---
Yeah the raiding meta doesn't need to be enforced nearly as much as people think. 
---
Bring ret paladin, enhance shaman, boomkins etc
---
It really doesn't matter.
---
You seem hurt.
---
Get help.
---
Getting that hoj to just use it on npcs seems so boring imo. The amount of post I see of people saying they just raid log is crazy.
---
Ok, try to hear me out, ok?
---
Let's pretend we're in Phase 4 and ZG is out already, ok?
---
Still following me?
---
Let's say I want to get a 40 man raid started for BWL and start doing invites, ok?
---
We only get 20 people in the raid, ok?
---
Instead of raiding BWL since we don't have the numbers, we decide to run ZG instead, ok?
---
Now let's transpose this to a PvP raid, ok?
---
I want to get an Orgrimaar raid started and start doing invites, ok?
---
We want at least 40 people to be able to get somewhere, ok?
---
Since we know we can't get anything done in Orgrimaar with only 20 people, we decide to raid something else, ok?
---
The next day, we try again and get 80 people, two full raids, ok?
---
That day, we decide to raid Orgrimaar, because we have the numbers for it, ok?
---
Was it so hard to understand? People raid what they can (in PvE or PvP) based on the numbers they've got. They don't just go "Well, we play on a low pop. server, so lets fail miserably, because that's the best we can hope for.", ok?
---
I honestly don't know how else to explain this. This was never about the fact that it is harder to find enough people to raid Orgrimaar on a server with low population, that much is obvious. My argument all along was that if a raid doesn't have enough members to raid a capital city, they will obviously go raid something else. Can't you simply agree with that so we can both move on?
---
I don't know what else you could possibly have understood from the two very simple sentences I've been repeating in this "discussion"...
---
&gt; the size of raids against an enemy faction's city aren't based on a % of the population
---
&gt; If I want to raid something, I'll see how many people we can get and if we don't have enough for Org, we'll settle for something smaller.
---
If the size of raids against an enemy faction's city were based on a % of the population, then it would mean that if a "high pop. server" raids Orgrimaar with 80 people, then a "medium pop. server" (ie.: a server with half the pop.) can't possibly get more than 40 people in a PvP raid, which simply isn't true.
---
Do you need me to draw pictures to help you understand, or is your brain capable or processing simply logic, by now?
---
No u
---
Depending on age group of your guild, it could simply be because of finals and it'll pick back up in a couple of weeks
---
Ah, they're macros and not addons. Apologies, I must have misread the comments. I'm at work right now, so I can't access any real game-related sites, but if you can leave me a link to where I can find these kinds of macros so I can play around with them, I'd be very grateful.
---
Staying on a pvp realm to let them farm you over and over is directly letting the terrorists win. You are accepting the terms they employ. Leaving the realm as retaliation and forcing them to be stuck as the only faction on the realm is a great punishment and response.
---
This is so far from accurate. You can pay a warlock who has completed the quest to join your DM run and begin the ritual with his mats, however this is the last step on a long and expensive quest chain.   
---
Depending if you farm or buy mats on the AH you‚Äôll spend around 600g. Paying a friendly warlock for help can turn the final 300-400 into whatever the run costs. Personally someone helped with my ritual for 80 so the entire mount was under 700
---
only need 1 person. will take few more minute than doing it the normal way.
---
it's a complete non-issue.
---
I need to do this soon too. I'm dreading the thought that I'll wait for an eternity only to have the cat spawn and then some other hunter snagging it away from me or someone killing it for fun.
---
That's a wonderful idea. Thank you.
---
I haven't taught it claw because I figured one focus dump was enough. The re spec cost shouldn't be too bad seeing as it will be the first time.
---
Horde for the win.
---
&gt; I mean if you don‚Äôt log in for days at a time how big of an issue is it really?
---
So because you didn't log in for two days once during a specific period, this suddenly isn't a bigger issue?
---
You know people can play daily, and then suddenly take a quick break to organise stuff, right? Or be out for a weekend? Or their computer went blank? Or they had the flu?
---
There's virtually a thousand reasons to miss a few days after a few months, and being unable to play for the next couple of *months* for three missed days is ridiculous.
---
This has been the hardest lesson for a lot of people.  In later iterations of the game it got easier to just wing the guild/raid building aspect of the game.
---
Classic guild/raid building is like setting up a mini organization. 
---
If you don't have rules, structure, schedules, and expectations it will fail over time.
---
u can reset with no outside help.
---
go in and do ur farm, log off ur toon and log in a alt or bank alt and wait 5 minuts. log in again on ur farmer toon and bam!ur right at the entrance of the dungeon again (go out, reset, get in). 
---
NOW: this will only work on dungeons with no "middle entrance" wich mara is not one of those, cuzz ull get placed in the waterfalls thus u cant run outside to reset it.
---
Guys I start my thoughts with the word imagine like my favorite streamers. By the way it's this other guy and not me who is cringey
---
Rogue's don't just shit on me, they shit on each other...
---
Wait, paid transfers still aren't a thing? Its be 4 months?
---
Meh, very minor upgrade. Resistances does help, especially with wpvp as it is. It's just a stop gap till T1 anyways.
---
ty

Well you like to make assumptions i see, No the reason is i just dont enjoy my name anymore. It used to be related to an inside joke of my friend which has passed away and i don‚Äôt wanna play seeing this joke gives me memories of my dead friend.

---
Oh man, the past 2 weeks Ive spent a lot more than the 4 I spent today.. I got lucky. Some people wait way longer
---
Mouseover macros are overrated. If you're not able to identify/select a new target during a 1.5s GCD or 2.5s heal then I don't really know what to say.
---
The release of battlegrounds will ease the pain felt out in the world, but will not do anything for the actual balance of servers.
---
Let‚Äôs blame this motherfuckers. Check  every 30min-1h who is in og (or if/sw on horde server) and write some toxic message before you set this retarded shithead on blacklist/ ignore. Also never invite them to group they already know the reason. It would be great if blizzard comes around take all this scumbags and put em on a fresh server only for teebagging group corpse campers so the rest of us can finally enjoy this masterpiece of gamehistory how it was meant to be..
---
Ah BTW I tried to talk normal to them but they don‚Äôt answer or give a shit. You can try but assholes are assholes and nothing can change it.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted. Leaving free transfers open is what allowed this to happen. Exact same thing happened in GW2, more than one server went from being more or less stable to fucked.
---
I use a shift-modifier to show/hide my ElvUI bars, then keybind my shift + ability key to correspond to the ability that‚Äôs shown, So, for example (and simplicity):
---
No shift modifier: Show Bar 1, abilities bound to 1-9.
---
Shift modifier: Show Bar 2, abilities bound to shift+1-9
---
Then lots of stance dancing macros.
---
Xp wise it's only worth it if you're the only person there, otherwise you might as well be questing.
---
Alliance and horde are the same it makes no difference. I was playing on a balanced server and there were just as many, if not more, alliance out ganking and corpse camping.
---
not sure why these idiot mods keep removing this
---
you can make some money off herb but enchanting is just going to cash until you get high level enchants
---
Hey, I never said alliance or horde.
---
I just said people who mindlessly hunt for honor without thinking ahead are stupid.
---
Am I the only one who thinks it's cool Horde took over a server? It's like watching an alternate timeline and a reminder as to why every single last one needs to be slaughtered before they get the chance to do it to you.
---
farming cath or armory?
---
Your analogy makes *zero* sense and I'm amazed at how much time i spent trying to understand it.
---
Everything after your analogy is a valid opinion...but you miss the point that we can pvp on PVE servers...it's just by choice.  And it would appear that many people don't actually *like* the ganking and getting ganked part.
---
Don't forget *They have no choice. They're forced to mercilessly camp alliance everywhere and prevent them from doing anything. It's not like BG's was only a short way away.*
---
Lastly, you do realize that even assuming the numbers are accurate and saying ‚Äúthings are great!‚Äù when people are being camped in their own major cities on multiple servers does not in fact make things great, right?
---
Just so you know, I feel and do exactly the same as you.
---
I got 60 pala on shazzrah, gave up two weeks ago. Will be interesting to ser if the server will become playable again with BG‚Äôs.
---
Lol thanks
---
Dinged 60 last week, didn't have time to really play since then but I plan on doing a few more 5 man dungeons for some loot, then do mc / ony once or twice over the holidays, probably do an AV or two, and then I'm probably done with classic honestly. It was fun to do all the stuff again for nostalgia, but I will not start raiding seriously again. I don't really want to lock even just one day a week for wow permanently again, and leveling another char or spamming BG's doesn't appeal to me.
---
I'm just starting to get into macros, and this sounds amazing. Would you be willing to DM me the text for this?
---
Why do you find it boring?
---
As a shaman that got ganked at the meeting stone for ST, I waited for them to leave to ankh.
---
The bastards stayed for the entire 6 min release time and then started AOEing my corpse with like 20 seconds until it forced me to the GY.
---
"Considering there are currently ferals doing good dps"  
---
I was replying to this and what I meant was just because ferals are doing okay in MC doesn't mean much for AQ or Naxx because they don't scale well.  
---
But if you want to earn your spot and do run of the mill dps as opposed to shit dps you need to do as much as you can.
---
Appreciate the support. I'm actually having a hard time finding guildies to run it with anymore. I have personally gotten almost all of our warlocks and half our mages their Ban'thok sash, over half our healers their second wind, and 2 of of our 4 rogues their HoJ. Hell, I even got my own HoJ (which I am very grateful for). So while I've only done maybe 100 arena runs, which is not that many compared to some, there's simply nobody in guild that needs it anymore. I've started to pug, but you rarely can keep a group together for more than 2-3 runs with a pug.
---
Oh, and in around 100 arena runs, I've seen Gorosh 4 times. 4 out of 100. It is most definitely NOT 1/6.
---
Staysafe is just a small minded twat pure and simple. To be fair cdew and tipsout are also in the same boat.
---
I would actually prefer to roll a server where there is horde dominated. I feel like pvp would be better
---
It's fun to think that the majority factions are going to get a rude awakening come AQ, but unfortunately that's not going to happen.  What will happen is that there will be enough people (likely from the most tryhard guilds) with multiple accounts that will transfer all of the mats via neutral AH.  They'll end up doing both factions' roles for the event, and since we already know what the requirements are, they'll start months in advance and the gates will be open on day 1, just like every other server.
---
Server merges might be an answer
---
I have two 60s on alliance on Thalnos, it's pretty bad but its definitely playable. Blizzard opened up transfers to two different realms on thalnos in the beginning, which kinda fucked the population, it used to be a lot better. I wish the 7 horde rogues living in Ironforge would fuck off though.
---
You sir, have opened my eyes to how a true pally should play, I can't wait to get home and start playing the way it was truely designed.
---
High risk, high reward. PvP servers offer so much more fun but right now we are in the dark ages
---
You could, but giving up Barbarous Blade (60 AP and 1% crit) is pretty big
---
What gear do you have on for this fight?
---
Feel free to level as hemo, but it‚Äôs not anywhere near as strong (PvE wise) as full combat SS. Set up some pickpocket macros for your cheap shot, and garrote too.
---
It brings me great satisfaction to know the horde players experience is getting trashed on at this server to the point where they may need to also leave.
---
I love that during Onyxia phase 2 I can heal her current fireball target by just literally mousing over her current target.
---
My personal goal was a modified goal of my old goal playing wow, which was to get some shadowcraft and do MC and Ony once. This time around I‚Äôve actually just achieved my prebis shadowcraft set! And I ran my first MC and Ony. 15 years of waiting to complete wow :D. 
---
I play on Sulfuras - my new goal is to own Eviscerate (infamous horde rogue) in a gank or 1v1.
---
We‚Äôre thieves by nature I guess.
---
One ally for four hordies ? Sounds like some LoTR shit
---
Pack it up boys, the 1% outlier is now overwhelming evidence that horde is not the problem.
---
I'm Heartseeker alliance and I hate this.  
---
I came from Skeram where I was constantly camped and killed and told to git gud, so I took the transfer to Heartseeker back when it was still medium pop, only to see ally doing the same thing to horde here, and this was before honor was out.  It's only become worse since they released phase 2.
---
It doesn't make any sense to me.  Part of what makes the world feel alive is the random encounters with opposing players.  This just encourages people to dungeon grind or just quit the server altogether and makes the game feel boring.  Also, do people forget that AQ requires effort from BOTH factions to open the gates?
---
You are exacly in my situation. I wanted to be a tank, guild was full on tanks, they force me to DPS but they still know i want to tank in the future in case a spot gets available. In the meantime, i'm farming dungeons as Fury and doing O K dps in raids. We'll see what the future brings.
---
I follow icy-veins guides a lot so: https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/warrior-dps-pve-spec-builds-talents
---
Just using Improved Cleave for the dungeons which is good since there is always a lot of AOE to do.
---
I‚Äôll always find a reason to complain.
---
what? :D
---
It's actually under "Legacy" not under "Feats of Strength".
---
Here's mine from Tichondrius R13.
---
And we would routinely make an all rogue gank squad and camp the tram from IF to SW. Or sit in IF for hours...
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/tichondrius/mnemloch/achievements/legacy/player-vs-player](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/tichondrius/mnemloch/achievements/legacy/player-vs-player)
---
Ok, now of the nine other servers that were allowed realm switches, show me another one where that's the case.
---
I am thankful everyday I transferred off that server first chance I got. Will the last alliance english player turn the lights off?
---
Just so you know, you meant ‚Äúveracity,‚Äù unless you are questioning the post‚Äôs appetite.
---
Well yeah, but why would alliance transfer to a server they are the minority on. I would probably rather quit than staying or transfering to a horde dominated server. 
---
The big problem here is that the server sizes are alot larger than back in classic so Even with a balanced server most areas will be over populated. If they made them smaller it woldnt be hundred of opposit faction in every single zone
---
First thought - wow that's really cool.
---
Second thought - your UI is absolutely disgusting!
---
How can you get that information?
---
If you‚Äôre selling mats, even for 50% off market value, that‚Äôs literally tens of thousands of gold earned. What is the guild using all the gold for, if not to help their raiders craft gear?
---
No offense, but a system that requires raiders to buy EVERYTHING from the guild to craft pve upgrades sounds corrupt as fuck. Those raiders already earned the materials by participating in the raid. Someone is getting rich, there‚Äôs just no need to charge that much.
---
counter spell is good for keeping targets in combat even in sheep
---
I just leave my main in dm or zf and farm for 20 min before switching back
---
still good for PvP
---
&gt; What you‚Äôre looking for is retail
---
You keep repeating this trite mantra but you don't seem to understand that classic content, classic balance, classic lore, and classic raids are all very different components from retail. If you want to change one component, you don't instantly want retail. Give it a rest.
---
&gt; Idk man this isn't really important to me so I'm going to leave it after this
---
Good morning!
---
All of the realms blizzard allowed xfers to are dead servers basically. Despite the horde situation I'm glad I weathered the storm out.
---
Hmmmm...
---
It's the preraid bis mainhand dagger (until tomorrow, when Alterac Valley comes out).
---
I am giving you a real response you‚Äôre just giving me the classic ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like what im hearing so i must be right and keep responding to a conversation that really doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù. I raided in retail. I raid in classic. Retail is a dumpster fire. Again you can‚Äôt compare them. They are vastly different games. Just because you don‚Äôt like the answers given doesn‚Äôt make it not real.
---
Clear Naxx and get Atiesh.
---
Protip: if you can write "you are" instead, "you're" is the correct spelling. Otherwise use "your"
---
You can't realistically maintain an advantage even at a 60/40 split.  Yes, you can push and win individual battles and temporarily regain control of certain chokes for a while, but the faction with 20% more players will always inevitably regain control of key points.  WoW isn't a real life war - when people die they respawn, they don't just die forever.  Groups of PVP are not lead and controlled by a single entity that can out-strategize or maneuver their opponent. WPvP in WoW is a game of numbers - its that simple.  A 20% advantage in a game of numbers is massive, especially when you account for the overpopulation of the servers.
---
They would of just quit lol.
---
What do you think is a fair price to pay?
---
I'm not saying things are great
---
I'm saying pesism, on this sub specifically, makes the problem worse.
---
I'm right there with you. I followed a bunch of friends to play on alliance Skeram and now I'm stuck raid logging. The unfortunate part is they love it and have way more time and the want to pvp. They're all looking for 13 or 14. I can't be bothered, especially as a priest to go out into the world alone.
---
I'd like to reroll, but I just don't have the time to level a second character to 60.
---
Thanks! I'll try this when I get home.
---
The good part about language is that it's up for interpretation. The bad part about language is that it's up for interpretation.
---
This is an argument over semantics and I've gone out of my way to underline my intent.
---
&gt; Are you doing ok or just trying to paint a picture of something that isn't there... 
---
What's not there? Horde players that aren't killing lowbies? Are you honestly claiming there are no Horde on the server killing lowbies? Otherwise, I don't know what you are accusing him/her of. He/she is simply stating their experience on the server.
---
Answer: convert races into factions and allow horde-on-horde PvP.
---
\*hides\*
---
That's like saying "I win fights by not getting into fights in the first place". It's totally illogical.
---
&gt;Most players are 60
---
Source?
---
Ah, gotcha. I'm guessing because of it receiving a larger portion of attack power and higher top end damage for larger backstabs?
---
I think you just outed yourself.
---
This right here. this 100% is the point I'm trying to make but in so much less words lol.
---
Yeah i spam my macro often. Which guild are you in?
---
where‚Äôs the joke?
---
Respectfully disagree.  Alliance has at minimum 7 world boss kills, probably more.  Versus/TB got both 1st's.  Enigma/Relentless had them locked down for a a few spawns.  And a couple were downed by Alliance pugs.  You've missed some kills.
---
U sound upset
---
Ashbringer EU is a full server, why do you keep saying its low pop?
---
But why have you no confidence in current dev team? retail is a different game with a different game philopsophy and class balance is made accordingly. You can say it's bad but it's not by accident.
---
Do you think it's really that hard to make balance in the line of Vanilla/TBC? you just don't give self heal and AoE to everyone and try to keep classes with a strong identity and it's fine.
---
Then why did that faction suddenly, for the first time since release, have more active players than the other?
---
Now is there a way I can set shamans from pink to blue? I get WHY it's pink, but it seriously throws me off.
---
They did this with Wintergrasp in wrath and it pretty much sucked.
---
If you play alliance ofc you're not going to be corpse camped by alliance or witness fp camping unless you're doing it yourself.
---
I tried to roll Alliance on Flamelash, unfortunately I don't have access to those servers.
---
You‚Äôre not giving an answer you keep repeating ‚Äòthey aren‚Äôt comparable‚Äô and won‚Äôt give real points because you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. If the conversation doesn‚Äôt matter then why are you responding just to keep saying nothing?
---
Very generous offer. Thank you. I‚Äôll surely keep it in mind! Just started pulling down some great bis stuff though, so with BGs coming I‚Äôm gonna stick where I‚Äôm at for a bit and show the 10v1 clowns a good time when it‚Äôs suddenly 10v10 :)
---
People didn't play like they do now. They didn't know as much and very very few people were hyper competitive with ranking. Some certainly were, but it was a tiny percentage of the player base and so people didn't camp and grief in vanilla the way they do now.
---
Half the server is Orc Warriors and Undead Mages.
---
Stop hiding chat. So fucking lame when people do that.
---
Maybe they should put a hardcap on number of logged in per faction instead of faction wide.
---
Would suck to be in the 80% horde/alliance but would atleast balance out the logged in users.
---
In WoW I honestly think it's more commonly "this person said something in /world that I didn't like so they're blacklisted."
---
I played a 29 balance Druid back in the day. Told myself I wasn't going to do something so silly again and then an acrobatic staff of arcane wrath dropped and so I have started leveling up my Druid. Dead zoning hunters will become life again.
---
What are you talking about? they're providing content for the other faction.
---
They're literally making the game playable for the other faction.
---
You want the highest high end wep damage possible for your abilities. In addition, for horde, it procs wf
---
With AV coming out tomorrow, I would definitely think twice about farming Barman Shanker. The dagger at Revered is slightly better, and the dagger at Exalted is a lot better than Barman Shanker.
---
The worst communication was from 3drealm with it's done when it's done
---
Which part of my post comes off as making me seem upset? I don't think responding to dumb made up scenario about a forum poster who ganks in IF makes me seem upset.
---
None, Huhuran as others have said is the first boss where you'll need (nature) resistance.
---
It‚Äôs ok to be mad
---
Nice straw man. Again I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a pro gamer for winning. Didn‚Äôt mean to trigger anyone posting this :)
---
There‚Äôs going to be a queue. There has always been a queue.
---
You think it does. This is classic not Pservers. 
---
Either way this is a dumb conversation to be had. Every guild that is raiding should be able to have enough cloaks for their main raid team. If they haven't be raiding very long and don't have enough cloaks it probably means they wont be clearing Nef week 1 of BWL anyways.
---
I had a similar thing happen in SM, thought it was just a bug. Everything was foggy and dull, then after the reset it was back to normal
---
Lol if all you want is to wear gear to flex I'm sorry to say everyone will have tier 1 soon.
---
Flex on the meters, and no, tier doesn't beat shadowcraft lol
---
Barrens (mid section), Feralas (above mojache), uhhh Tanaris (by bones area, away from questing hubs), etc.
---
Im bored at work and have literally nothing else to do.
---
The rage meter was nearing full capacity, I was indeed giving up lol.
---
More like r/Projection
---
You like getting your city camped 24/7? Gtfo outta here wihh that
---
&gt; but it's a PvE server so there's no ganking grief.
---
except for Escortfailed, the rogue that kills/ganks the Defias Traitor all day, lol.
---
Really nice logic... they outright grief and harass the Alliance players and expect them to just lie down and accept being a prey? This is basically like blowing out your allowance on ice cream on the first day of summer and then crying that you can't have any more ice cream. The horde are equaly childish in this scenario... I hope that they get stuck on their server for a long time and get extra long queues in BGs. Maybe, just maybe will they then realize what they had done wrong...
---
Tomorrow is the day classic wow officially becomes retail 1.12
---
that's not healthy at all
---
Once you look at the possible places bt can spawn at. Try to position yourself in the middle of the the places and stand there using eagle to eye to search the areas where bt spawns instead of riding. Theres a nice little hill people like to utilize for this reason, you'll know what I'm talking about once you try it
---
It's both. Plenty of people on both PVE and PVP servers are getting incredibly bored of having nothing to do except weekly Ony + MC. This was of course always gonna happen.
---
wow relax
---
TBH at this point just stay MS.
---
You didnt factor in vast majority of horde will que for bgs its not true for alliance which will make the imbalance apparent in the ques
---
project harder bro
---
AV is a pve BG
---
I love how you‚Äôre getting downvoted instead of responses because alli players know you‚Äôre right and have nothing to say
---
Because most of us have been playing wow since vanilla and have slowly watched the team dismantle the game into unplayable swill. It didn‚Äôt began as some ‚Äúwere shifting the design philosophy‚Äù nonsense or whatever you‚Äôre spinning. They made changes they thought would be fun and over time the game got shittier so most of us stopped playing or went to private servers.
---
Hehe. Every wow player.
---
Yeah and you also don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about either.
---
well correct me if i am wrong (not really sure on this)but if he would get rank 3 to get discounts he will only pay 35g per respec.
---
i swear that i have respeced 3 or 4 times since i got rank 3 and  its stuck to 35 g... but then again i am not playing this game in all my good senses if yk what i mean.
---
Lol again. The q won‚Äôt last long enough to make it back to if from uc.
---
Not really.
---
Faction side ques could be a decent answer. Mayne even merge a horde heavy server with an ally one..idk if population size.would.be an issue then also way more horde  heavy servers than ally
---
Oh I think I remember you. I'm the paladin Divineshield from insomnia. Yeah, tich was 1000000% exactly like this in vanilla pre bgs.
---
I never played on pservers.
---
Tell him that lol
---
So i was able to get to 8k health 5.8k armor and 200fire resist. I got all world buffs(mainly for threat purpose) titans flask/mongoose/fire res juju/blasted lands buff/ungoro buffs/elixir of shadow power/Black rock spire fire resist/gae/elixir of fortitude/elixir of superior armor/stam food and drinks chugged a stoneshield on pull as well. But honestly some trash buffs dispelled some important buffs so by the time we pulled i was only at 7k health and then hots dispelled some more and put me down to 6k. If i ever wonna do this again i deffinitely want to prioritize buffs so i wouldnt hit the buff cap. She doesnt hit that hard so if i would prioritize buffs correctly i could pop a supreme instead of titans for the extra threat. Thanks for the comment man!
---
Sorry buddy, its just so I don't get random words popping up in my videos that some people might find offensive
---
This sub is literally nothing but alliance tears, and has been for months, but we're supposed to believe its somehow not skewed toward alliance.
---
&gt;If you reroll you'll be missing on the experience vanilla was designed for.
---
Oh man, who would want to miss out on being stuck in a zone with no HS and no flight master to escape and all the choke points controlled?  Who would want to miss spirit ressing because you have no other option and then instantly dying again?  It would be awful to miss out on spending an hour dying 15x trying to corpse run to BRD just to be able to run a single dungeon.
---
Yeah, WoW was really designed for WPVP gank squads completely running the server.
---
The pre-made echo chamber is gonna shake the sub apart lol. They were bad enough back in the day, and that was long before the years of min/maxing in private servers. Where are all those stupid death squads gonna go? It's a shame, because it'll probably significantly haircut my ability to get back into BGs, which used to be a blast, but oh well.
---
I am glad you are enjoying it and wish you the best.
---
It is 99% Blizzard's fault, though, so it's perfectly rational to blame them. The world is not designed for even a quarter of the players inhabiting it the consequences of layered megaservers were predicted months ago.
---
I'm not sure. Cant imagine dying instantly or close to instantly in the stomach was the intended behaviour tho
---
Naxx Clear and R14 on my hunter. TF on my warri twink.
---
This, you give me an ultimatum as guild leader? You better be my no.1 main tank because else i‚Äôll kick you out for even trying it.
---
I refuse to negotiate with terrorists
---
Ele shamans don't go oom after 1 cast and have on demand 3k damage (chain lightning + earthshock), purge, grounding, fear totem, 6 second interrupt. Bubble is OP, but  to think that pallies have some huge advantage over shamans in group pvp is silly.
---
Oh awesome, thanks for the help! Now I just have to hope there aren't too many Horde looking to kill people doing exactly this.
---
Just turn all servers normal, add warmode! Now you can opt for world pvp whenever you want! /s
---
Whatever makes you feel better. Yes... you... a person who has no idea about my gaming background must know more than me. You must be 100% right. /s just fyi. You‚Äôre never gonna change my mind. =]
---
Does tidy plates allow you to color code the plates differently for mobs you don't have threat on, based on whether that enemy's current target is another tank?
---
Yes and no.  It is beaten in all area by fellstriker from ubrs.  Ignoring that though as it's under 1% drop the Shanker has the highest max damage from all preraid but the bleed debuff is a negative for raids or pvp
---
&gt; Hunter never runs out of mana spamming R1 Wing Clip, Warrior runs out of Rage.
---
Indeed, warriors only get the necessary rage for constant hamming around P5-P6. Also, any good hunter will use max rank Wing Clip :)
---
I remember trying to get the initial quest done for AV on various alts, where you get the trinket to port back to base.  I would have to run straight to it and do my best to not get too tied up with NPCs as the game might end before I get to the objective and back.  This is as a lower level 50, trying to get the really nice blue weapon.
---
I do wonder what's the scale of "endlessly ganked", because statistically, an alliance is 2 times more prone to be ganked and/or in larger numbers.
---
There is also a big difference between being farmed by an organized raid group and just circumstantial outnumbering.
---
E.g: I woke up today at 8am to go mining. Only about 15 allies in IF. I fly thinking that it won't be camped. Surprise! I was wrong. Well, it was only a single priest in the boat. I can take that, but I got stuck on the boat loop, maybe a fellow ally will get in the boat and help me. I managed to jump out. When I reached the coast, a rogue and a druid jumped on me. 
---
But like, they weren't there when I passed for first time to board the boat? If the priest was with the rogue, he would be healing them instead of being alone in the boat, and rogue already had his druid bud. This meant these guys were unrelated. Another surprise came from theramore with a warrior and mage. In the time I waited for an ally to come (technically came, but only lv 20s questing), 4 more horde appeared to take over menethil. And I recognize some names because some allies use menethil (our own hub) to farm gankers that are apparently here 24/7. I found baffling how even in Mondays at 8am Menethil is owned by the horde. The fact that we *need* organized groups to even hope to have a chance while they just come and come in mass is baffling to me.
---
Ahh.. well good luck. Not a fan of hcc at all. Those guys are assholes. They go out of their way to troll people.
---
Roll tide
---
Space vs underwater, scuba vs spacesuit...it's a weird, nonsensical analogy.
---
I run on max game settings, do you?  I wonder if that has something to do with it.
---
You do know that we are at minimum likely getting the ability to party queue for BG‚Äôs right? Meaning only one person has to hang behind.
---
i have unsubbed and waiting to see how things unfold two weeks into p3 to decide whether i wanna resub again.
---
Reposting because you reposted:
---
So the issue that comes out of this is that you end up with players who are basically raid bosses and one shot enemies which means that no matter how many players you throw at them you lose because they have double the health and do double the damage on massively unbalanced servers.
---
They tried tweaking it a lot with it eventually just becoming a health buff..  but it still made some classes so powerful... and healers... imagine a pally healer with 10k health...
---
Best PvP enchant for Finkle‚Äôs Lava Dredger? I‚Äôm a pally
---
If you have extra dense stone, thorium shells are an easy sell
---
I suppose it's possible, and there will always be jackass sociopaths who kill for glee and not honor, but I really think most people seriously trying to farm honor will be in bgs. At the end of the day I think the honor gain is more efficient there and it's just plain more fun than riding around a zone in circles picking off lowbies for a fraction of the honor. I'm hoping then we can go back to little skirmishes in the world that are a lot more fun than this current crap.
---
can't tell if you are joking or not, and I really hope you are.
---
Because trapping players inside capital and killing them constantly is not playable.
---
Yup, everything maxed.
---
I'm leaning towards me just not noticing.
---
They... they aren't. As in, it's against the rules.
---
This is just a cathartic way to beat up rule-breakers.
---
Incredible. That‚Äôs a unique experience at least. Did it take forever to down every mob?
---
I must admit as shazz main I'm leveling backup character on PVE realm while this shitstorm is happening. I'm raid logging or when my friends are around I got PVP. Horde is dominant, but not at the point where I feel like quitting.
---
Sul'thraze and Netherwind, the realms they opened transfers too, are no better off than Thalnos in terms of population. Last I heard Sul'thraze Alliance AH had only 900 items on it.
---
Iron forge is a barrel, and alliance should be the available fish
---
Yeah, no. Anyone who spends their free time camping people in IF doesn't have a lot going for them.
---
If you're worried about people not staying for loot, ask for a gold deposit for each time. If you have an organized loot master and another organized raid leader it can be a very efficient system. The gold is returned after the raid ends.
---
Repair bots aren't selling well yet because nobody is really getting broken in raids.  They will when BWL starts though.
---
You lose all of the gained time during the gcd anyway. You don't gain any reaction time. The only thing thing that could be argued for is more time for movement.
---
I played with mouse over (back in tbc), and it didn't change anything. I switched back after whatever addon I used (I don't remember) wasn't updated for wotlk. Nothing changed in my performance.
---
But don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with click healing, but it definitely is not that big of a game changer.
---
A small tip is that you can still fear someone through shadow reflector with Howl of Terror. Just watch out for kick obviously. Grenades also work well as a small guaranteed un-reflectable CC. Also, try using the reflector duration as an opportunity to cast immolate/searing pain to get some damage going.
---
2 OEB? Thats luxury-level loot!
---
Casters have it so damn good in our raid, we've had atleast 5 dominance, 3 mageblades, 3 spelldaggers, only 1 aurastone hammer though.
---
seems like most people don't want a fair fight, they just want to outnumber the other faction...
---
For the record this has been unbearable as a well-geared 60 as well.
---
Just focus on leveling.  Gold grinding becomes much easier at max level.  For rogues, BRD pickpocket runs are pretty lucrative.

Enchanting is a noob trap. Mining is overall pretty valuable but can be annoying to level. Herbalism is easy to level and high level herbs will *always* be necessary, but some herbs aren't worth crap. Skinning is a fresh server thing when there's no market. Since there's a market for ores/bars and herbs, you're just shooting yourself in the foot taking skinning unless you're leatherworking or going to overtake the devilsaur farming.
---
As far as gear goes i'll send you a link once i get a minute. But mainly did this since i got the pvp gloves that reduce pushback. Though it would make it a bit more viable. Wore mostly pvp gear in general. Next time i could prolly go for more threat i wasnt sure how hard she is gonna hit so tried to overkill it.
---
If I played a PvP server that was affected by a change such as this, myself, and I'm sure many others, would be absolutely livid that they'd be forcing us to PvE or re-roll if we want to PvP. That is a stupid decision. If you want to drive people away, force them to do something they don't want to do.
---
We prepare consumables for later phases because not everyone is stockpiling Elemental Earth for Nature Resistance Potions (AQ) or Fadeleaf/Gravemoss for Shadow Resistance Potions (Naxx). That stuff will be very expensive later on while we should be able to provide them for free to the raiders.
---
How do you have gold for pvp consumables if youre not farming?
---
Yeah, same. I just can‚Äôt see sitting on somebody‚Äôs corpse waiting for them to respawn being fun, like... at ALL.
---
I wouldn't worry to much about it as it will probably be done in the first few hours
---
no such thing as a fixed hard crit cap. it depends on too many things
---
Hello, fellow Westfall reroller!
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Been challenger in League on and off consistently for 7+ years, still think WoW arenas is much more pure fun and just as challenging although the skill level is lower due to less competition as a result of less arena tryhards. Even OSRS as much as i think that game is turning into trash the PVP requires serious skill, u don't know shit.
---
wPVP has always been trash. There‚Äôs a reason it stopped when they introduced BG‚Äôs. No one actually likes it except for the vocal minority of people that suck at the game and enjoy 5v1‚Äôing people that are questing.
---
+55 healing. 
---
Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves...
---
To any low level horde on heartstriker: send me a message I‚Äôm just a 60gnome mage but I will come with you help you killing mobs and try to bring my fraction to leave us allone. It‚Äôs not much at all, but talking to the guys in orgrimmar doesn‚Äôt change a bit..
---
&gt; Odd you should say that. 
---
Is it odd that something happened on a server that differed from what happened on your server? Doesn't really surprise me that much when it comes to Vanilla honestly.
---
Well you said it: they made change on purpose because they thought it was fun not by accident. 
---
If you tell any game devs to make changes in line with Vanilla with TBC as example of good rework, unless they are completely stupid, they can do it... You really have to think that they are total morons to think that it's impossible
---
Nope, there is PVP on my PVE server pretty much 16 hours a day. What you don't get to do is use your HOJ on a lowbie or on a random coming off his flight path, you will only use it against other PvPers that are ready for a fight. The quality of the PvP is higher on a PvE server.
---
Now I have a job and family I wish I went PvE. My already limited playing time is 50% getting exploded 10v1 by Horde using consumables ... Great fun
---
Because you are in a giant guild, and you don't know who has pissed off who else. Also, some people have a damn low bar for their blacklist.
---
As a former GM, I would say that if you are seeing a guild's members acting like dicks constantly, talk to the GM. They don't know and can't deal with their people if they aren't communicated with. I certainly wasn't there for every activity my members were.
---
Then again, if it is the GM that's giving you trouble, there isn't a lot you can do.
---
A lot of people join their friend's brothers guild and don't interact with the members a lot, they just level and pug stuff. You really want to punish that guy because some dumbass pulls some shit that he's never seen and isn't even aware of?
---
The 8 hour maintenance scheduled for tomorrow is a pretty good indicator.
---
I think they‚Äôre total morons.
---
Servers are dying already...open up paid transfer and merge servers. Problem solved.
---
Design flaws that weren't a major issue and definitely part of the vanilla experience...  And "make worse" by making a massive change.
---
get a rag 2h so u can pvp too =)
---
I hope BG's can lower world pvp so I can keep playing on my PvP Server without getting dominated by honor farmers when I level up alts... been strongly concidering switching to a PvE server for my alts, but I'm gonna wait until after BGs to see then üòä
---
The peaks are Probably towards the end of the billig Periods (months/6months)
---
(X) Doubt
---
Druid tank itemization is still garbage, paladins can't be viable tanks because they have no taunt, and priest poh being self only are all examples of common complaints stemming directly from #nochanges. However, the community generally doesn't complain about them because we know *why* they are there. OP is challenging that status quo though.
---
On a separate note, the biggest complaint right now is faction imbalances, which has less to do with #nochanges and more to do with shitty server management. So that complaint is voiced, and recently quite a lot. A common counter-argument is that vanilla servers were smaller and somehow a smaller population makes a faction ratio imbalance more palatable (but notably still very imbalanced). It's at best a baseless assertion though; WPvP is dictated by ratios, not population.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with a guy making money if he‚Äôs the only one with the pattern? You want something only he can provide and lionheart is bis forever. It‚Äôs worth the 100g. It was 250g on my server.
---
Even if you aren't much of a PVPer, just take the +100 HP. As others have already said, a dead DPS is no DPS.
---
Spotted the griefer.  If your idea of a fun game is not allowing other people to play it, you‚Äôre a loser.
---
And as an added bonus, when you log back in and res, you're an honorless target.
---
Tornado chasers exist.  Tornado chaser fans exist.  Those Tornado chaser fans may even excoriate people who flee Tornados.

But most people still prefer to avoid Tornadoes.

Ive been getting all my alts around lvl20 and starting stonetalon with 4 of them, everynight I play my alts theres gank squads of lvl 19 ally twinks roaming stonetalon which I cant even dent them theyre so geared, every night I get killed by them. Green man bad.
---
Can't find it, would you have key words for me or a link?
---
I love this üòÖ
---
It‚Äôs better with 2H and arms.  Uldaman and onwards you‚Äôll have to throw on a shield though.
---
Those seem like realistic prices for those services. The closest thing to a mafia on our server is the collection of undead rogues that live in the buildings of IF.
---
We have O that organize and run jump runs. We help gear alts and the guild gets the arc crystals for TF for our MT.
---
Yeah CRAZY right? I'd rather spend my play time getting corpse camped. Getting things done is stupid.
---
Consistently scheduling a video game is not something easy to do for a lot of people. It often gets disrupted by higher priority tasks.

---
You need to go fury for raiding to do any decent damage.  I would make sure your guild doesn't need another OT though, as you could probably go 31 fury / 20 prot and do ok damage.
---
But, honestly, once you get past MC there isn't much point in running 5 mans anymore, outside of farming certain consumables, and for that you can easily just rock the full t1 you have accumulated in MC and tank with 20 arms / 31 fury without much trouble.  5 man content is ez mode with mc gear, and you don't need to be prot, unless you are bringing along a bunch of low levels.
---
This entire thread is horde tears so I don't know what to tell you.
---
"But he was prot" isn't really a valid excuse when Swifty chooses to PvP in that spec and also was the one who initiated this fight (also didn't pop shadow pot right at the beginning).
---
However, OP's being a little bitch so i can see why everyone gives him a hard time
---
There's nothing wrong with charging to make something nobody else can make. He leveled the profession required to craft it, and he downed the raid boss that dropped the pattern. Why should anyone be entitled to reap the benefit of his work for free? I don't think he's greedy to have charged 100g to craft that helm with your mats. He could have charged 200g and still sold plenty. It's BIS for a LONG time and a lot of people would have paid that.
---
uh..
---
earthfury-US is getting close to 70-30 in alliance favor. Litterally a 20% swing in 2 weeks.
---
all the QQ you see coming form alliance player here... you see the same stuff in the horde world chat
---
Thats all I'm advocating for.
---
For many players it's a foregone conclusion that tomorrow won't help. Thanks for keeping an open mind
---
DM N, last boss
---
Outright lies, netherwind is doing great for activity and has good pop balance.
---
Don't know about sul'thraze and can't comment.
---
I'm an adult with a full time job.   I have 2-3 hours a night to play MAX, if that.  I'll be damned if I'm going to spend half of what little time I have corpse walking due to world PVP.  Never been happier that I rolled on PVE.
---
  If I was on a PvP server dealing with that shit I would have quit out of frustration a good while ago and can totally relate to the people who already have.  I'm not in my teens anymore.  Ain't nobody got time for that.
---
Jesus, the entitlement in this post. First lionheart helm pattern  could be sold easily for 3-5k gold. Or more, not a single doubt. And you really believe that he's greedy charGing 100g and that he should make it for free. What you describe is not a mafia buddy, is putting a fair price for patterns that are extremely rare.
---
So we can all conclude that, without the optimal conditions, warrior leveling is crap.
---
I mean it's well known and only hipsters would say leveling a warrior is a piece if cake.
---
Warriors 2nd. Lmfao for real.
---
earthfury. 2 imbalances
---
I think it just attracts bad people
---
She carries over aggro from P2, anyone with aggro reducing abilities should use them in the start of p3. If your healers are getting aggro, it can be worth it to get them to stack on the last fireball before p3 to drop their aggro.
---
Discount doesn't work on respec costs lol
---
All I hear is bitching from people on pvp servers and all I can see is the meme with the kid putting a stick in the front wheel of his bike and crying about server balance. 
---
The only reason to have a PvP server is for people who want to be tools and gank or have an unfair advantage... I‚Äôve gotten something like 3000 HKs on my pve server and haven‚Äôt once had to worry about being ganked or killed while afk in a city. 
---
Don‚Äôt play on a PvP server and bitch because things aren‚Äôt working to your advantage, god damn.
---
You get rep with capital factions and random greens and blues as reward, it's not worth doing for most materials except runecloth bandages though. It's cheap rep for getting other races mounts though
---
could you PM me your hamstring/charge macro? Interested in taking a look at how it works
---
&gt; You just want the illusion of challenge
---
The problem here is that 1.12 was not a challenging version of WoW.
---
You're right in that it's a simplification. But you'll have better luck getting blizzard to change retail to fit your idea of a good game than get them to fix classic. The whole point of classic is to have a vanilla wow experience. 
---
&gt;If you want to change one component, you don't instantly want retail.
---
Fair, but if you want to change one component, then you don't want classic. Except for lore I guess, I'm not sure what you mean by changing lore.
---
If you want to change the content, then you thought you wanted it, but you didn't.
---
If you want to balance classes, then you thought you wanted it, but you didn't. 
---
If you want to change the raids, then you thought you wanted it, but you didn't. 
---
These changes would all potentially be post phase 6 in a hypothetical classic+. After all of the content and raids were done with the classes as they were. If you think blizzard is going to change that, you're crazy. You're 100% better off just petitioning them to change retail, where they're working on a new expansion as we speak.
---
60/40 means nothing; 60s balance is what matters and no one looks at that data
---
Holy fuck I feel bad for you.
---
My main is a hunter and it is useful but far from a prio piece. (Before Dire Mail released it was the 2nd BiS for alliance hunters due to lack of options) I still just haven't done LBRS at all so no General Drakisath trinket yet and after less than thirty total runs I won it on a greed roll. (Similarly with that Golem Lord tank trinket, made solo content helpful due to the lack of said other decent trinket)
---
I also have a feral druid alt at level 52 that for some unknown reason has been taken along to two BRD pugs so far. I won HoJ on my second run as a need roll. 
---
Now admittedly I've never seen the Savage Gladiator Chain drop in the Arena and only seen the relevent boss three times but I prefer the 3-sey bonus of black dragonscale anyway.
---
&gt; I don't think anybody is questioning whether a ret paladin is better for keeping the Nightfall proc up on a boss than a warrior. If they are, they are wrong, a ret paladin definitely does have better uptime on the debuff.
---
Hi Darth nice to meet you again :)
---
The answer isn't that simple. Yes, paladin higher uptime but this is assuming other classes don't have WCB or a warrior is not catering to keeping up Flurry (you can do weapon swap tricks, crit parse, etc...). A warrior with WCB and flashy Flurry tricks will surpass Paladin uptime. And as patches progress it gets better and better for warriors.
---
P.S. there is the paladin atk speed trinket, which is nice for short fights I'll grant you that.
---
does this actually work?
---
Idk, might be that they are outnumbered and literally can't even stand AFK in their own city without constanly being rammed in the ass by brainlets. 
---
Nothing wrong with fair PVP fights but would you really enjoy not being able to do normal tasks in Orgrimmar without being stunned / slowed and then killed by a bunch of virgins over and over? 
---
Also funny how you cry about griefing in another PVP game (Apex Legends) while glorifying it on ClassicWoW
---
Navaos 2 days ago:
---
"Wow that's a really new level of being a fucking griefing cunt and ruining fun from gaming..."
---
Well he didn't say anything defending the master loot claim. That's why people are shitting on him I think.
---
Where's all my kurrinax alliance bros? Menethil harbor is a death zone that we just accept. Get to the boat and die, that way you can revive on the world switch.
---
What site is this
---
60/40 is a 50% advantage to one side, not 20%.  For every three red, there are only two blue.
---
A 20% advantage would be 55/45, which actually sounds reasonable, but as you state, is still a huge advantage when it comes down to it.
---
How does a 60/40 faction imbalance not matter? It literally means the other faction has 50% more people. It doesn't matter if they aren't all online, because all the alliance isn't online either.
---
I‚Äôd have still killed him lol, but warlocks win this match up in general. Though I have seen swifty beat warlocks before on stream
---
So OP is showing a picture at  one point in time and asking why we are not talking faction balance. And it is a faction balance, his server is rare to have a large  alliance side
---
If only game mechanics provided a solution for that problem and an explicit reward for solving it.
---
If you are alliance and on a pvp server level to 48 in feathermoon's cave, feralas,  by slaying naga. And get some golden pearls while leveling
---
You can‚Äôt do anything from this on an abandoned server.
---
no you wouldn‚Äôt, no one would play in the middle of the night right before wed reset if BGs came with weekly maintenance for EU
---
Hmm I guess I would be talking about yellow hits and from behind, so no parries or blocks (or dodges?).
---
&gt;  like resto druid will not become the best healers at any time
---
I actually don't understand this. Druids are very formidable healers when played right. Their only shortcomming is that their mana regen is kind of bad, but that's the whole point of innervate. People back in the day used to assign their innverates to priests. While this does provide more utility for the raid overall because innervate scales best with the huge priest mana regen, it also stole the druid's primary mana regen ability.
---
If you let druids use their own innervate, they should be as effective as any other healer.
---
Crusader is still 10g on my server and a ton of people have it.  20g for some enchants seems reasonable to me.  +SP, +Heal, +4stats, etc...
---
He didnt use my real name, dont really know why he called me brennen
---
Asmon loves you guys for keeping this popular and giving him content to use in his stream. Good job guys
---
2x Tarnished Elven Ring vs Blackstone Ring + Tarnished Elven Ring?
---
If Blackstone + Elven which goes when/if I get Band of Accurai?
---
boy are you in for a surprise
---
I have developed an immunity to their knowing that I know.
---
Have all your warriors bring a shield. She doesn't hit hard so any warrior can efficiently tank her.
---
It's very difficult for the inital tank to have aggro on her by phase 3, especially if your phase 2 lasts just a few seconds.
---
Yes you will, and the fact that the inmense majority of servers are PVP help me to prove this point.
---
I know it's suspect. That does go both ways though, severe imbalance numbers are suspect too. (apart from the most shocking examples ofc)
---
I'm just advocating an open mind as an alternative to the mood around here the past couple weeks.
---
You're locked to a certain ID as soon as you enter. If someone already is locked to an ID and he enters first, everybody else will also enter his ID and be locked to it. If someone fresh with no ID enters first, he will generate a new ID and anybody who is locked to another ID won't be able to enter.
---
That said, it is most likely in your case that someone got an ID with some randoms because of entering (e.g. after getting attunement) or whatever. Then at the beginning of your raid he entered first causing all of you to enter the exact same ID and get locked to it.
---
In the meantime someone else from the random grp which generated that ID could have already cleared it.
---
In order to prevent this it's common to not allow anybody else than RL or at least someone who knows what he's doing (and has no ID yet) to enter first creating a fresh ID which will not grant access to anybody who is already saved to another instance.
---
Point of that the almost entire community and playerbase changed, evolved. They want to grind as fast as possible even tho they might lack having fun playing the game and avoiding pvp (yea pointless to deffend as minmax grinders).
---
If I am ever going into 60s wsg and playin against mid-grave farmers, im bugging the flag using the spacebar until some of those retailers find out way to kill my naked FC. If i ever cross the mid on my own, yet 1v9 for hours doable. 
---
PS: FU MinMaxers : )
---
Um... huh?
---
20/31 - do you have a spec for this? I'm looking at one that is 17/34 ?  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LhhxzhbZVV0VgxoVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LhhxzhbZVV0VgxoVo)
---
I have a different experience, and you can check his past streams and clips. While his YouTube is full of Asmon for sure, his twitch stream is not focused on him, provably.
---
I highly, highly doubt they would use the retail queue unless they foresaw what the BG's would be like otherwise.  If I can give you a hint - they didn't foresee the shitshow wPvP on it's own has been causing entire servers to collapse.
---
In retail you can join rated BG's with larger groups.  They separated the two options, not just removed one entirely.
---
They also literally ended twinking around mid 2019 by removing twinks from the general BG group and putting them into an entirely different queue on their own, making queues take hours to pop.
---
These types of options aren't available in classic wow, and while I think allowing a max of 5 to queue would be healthy for BGs to avoid the issues I've outlined, and as much as I would like to see it, I highly doubt they do it.
---
Not to mention, the private servers worked off a system of just a line-up.  One person would enter the BG to make sure it was a fresh one for the group, but sometimes your "group" of people queuing at the exact same time didn't get in to the same one.  Sometimes a few were put into a different BG depending on how the timing lines up.
---
I can't remember how vanilla worked though, so this is why I think it will be interesting to see what they end up doing.
---
In any case, yes it will still be premade galore.  If they limit it to 5, the premades will make multiple groups of 5, be on discord, and queue at the exact same time to often (but not guaranteed) join the same BGs.
---
Yeah yeah I meant epic srry.
---
its 1.75x honor though
---
Well I think it's quite arrogant to think like this but I won't change your mind...
---
As in, it wouldn't make the game or people experience better.
---
This is a retail thing that carried over. Not many people noticed this but I used it tons in retail and it carried over to classic. I'm surprised people just now discovered this.
---
My dots go boom boom boom on Ony, I love that fight. Our tanks are fantastic, so I never worry about threat until P3.
---
If your guild won't be doing progression the moment a raid is released, not really necessary. At best I'd have it on a fury tank assuming there's many casters in the raid.
---
I am a GM here of my guild, i have experience running a guild in vanilla before classic released.   
---
I had multiple members want this item. I told them if they farmed up the mats they would get it. It took a warrior 2 weeks to farm the mats and he will be getting the first one. No one else is even close so it made it easy.
---
Yeah I just entered Tanaris now and pretty worried about the crazy amount of horde out ganking. Play on Kirtonos so not the most balanced server but hopefully less people ganking once bg's come out tomorrow.
---
He is talking about the passive +5 bow skill, reducing the hitcap to 6% + the scope with 3% hit (bizznick) and you just need 3% to be hit capped
---
O'brien, one to beam up!
---
There can be other reasons as well. For example, when I stream (rarely) I hide my chat because I don't want everyone who might be watching to read the guild's officer chat. Other private guild-related things could also be discussed. Just because I might be streaming, I don't want to be cut off from the guild and my duty as an officer to handle shit by having a chat window showing neither open, just to be "stream safe".
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even close on the first one.
---
This is pretty funny to me, I laughed out loud at work. I play Alliance and our guild is new player friendly, so we have some members that have literally never played WoW before. This is what they be like sometimes.
---
Is the shadow weave set one you wear until you hit 60?
---
In this phase, hit is approx 10 spell dmg. 
---
It will also help with resisting banishes and curses (waste of a gcd). 
---
As your spell power increases, hit becomes more valuable. 
---
So you probably want as much as possible for min max raiding.
---
Get hit capped by wife you try again. You can‚Äôt afford missing a scatter if you‚Äôre kiting. The bugs shouldn‚Äôt bother you, just turn on nameplates and stay far away.
---
Theres also the fact that hunters easily get hit capped and get plenty of gear all to themselves in MC. 
---
Theres also the fact that hunters dont scale.
---
Well it's not a very good PVP weapon.  Maybe it's better than what you had, perhaps.  "Best" is defined by what you'll be doing with it.
---
It has caster bonuses so there's an assumption that you'll be healing with it, but for that you'd be better off with a shield for the extra armor.  It's got a fast swing time for a 2h weapon so even if you like the bonuses, it's not going to hit near as hard as a slower weapon.
---
For a paladin this looks very PVE.  A boomkin maybe could use it for PVP but there's probably better.  A resto druid would probably be happy with it.
---
U sound like nolifer op; no sympathy from me; invest your time to relevant stuff that doesnt all lie on ones company server
---
As a horde player on Shazzrah, it doesn't feel like a horde dominant server when I run through Feralas to get to DM.
---
You're delusional but good luck
---
Lifelong horde player.  Never really been that big into pvp, I just always liked the horde classes, starting zones, and major cities.  
---
Acting like the pvp issue is unique to the horde is just dumb.  Both sides have players who want to rank, right now the only way to do so is open world pvp, which ends up with being a gank fest with the dominating faction destroying everyone.  There's posts on the front page about an alliance dominated server doing the same thing.    
---
The issue isn't Horde = Bad, Alliance = Good.  The issue is faction imbalance, although it seems like there's just way more horde players than alliance on pvp servers, so there's probably no real way to remedy it.  Hopefully BGs help.  
---
Anyways, it's annoying seeing people unironically hating on the horde for being bullies.  I'm just some pleb who likes running around as a badass orc.
---
Doubtful... You'd have to be able to take on multiple elites as almost all pulls in an instance wouldn't be 1v1.
---
I think you'd have a very hard time regardless of class and with the consumables, etc... to buy to help support it I think it would cost more and take longer than just leveling in the open world.
---
&gt;I know it¬¥s an US thing to throw your principles overboard if it enriches you
---
What principles lmao, it's a fucking video game.
---
I believe Herbalism and Alchemy complement each other better. Use Herbalism to gather herbs and Alchemy to convert herbs to consumables and sell the consumables on the auction house. People need consumables more than enchants.
---
We'll see...
---
In the pserver lingo there are two different kinds of premades: premades and shitmades. 
---
Premades just roll over everything, bruteforcing their way to victory. Shitmades to keep competitive honor wise have to resort to scouting, dodging, wintrading etc. to gain every advantage they can muster.
---
Pally here. It‚Äôs crazy how much gear I‚Äôve been getting. Got both judgement pieces my first run in MC and Only and basically full tier 1. There are like zero Paladins anywhere
---
No you‚Äôre just a moron who doesn‚Äôt understand the ranking system
---
There's a macro for targeting the closest and only the closest target. I know some PvPers bind it to tab as a replacement.
---
Errr...this behavior was most prevalent after they started cross-server BGs.  So it would be more accurate to at least say different behaviors on different server clusters...
---
Streamers definitely have a different persona when on camera. The problem is when you do it for 8h+ a day you become that person.
---
And to think I just refilled on earth fury alliance because heartseeker horde was just unbearable with the 75/25 pop split lol. Hope I‚Äôm on the majority at least this time. But hey so long as 75% of the server isn‚Äôt the enemy I‚Äôll live lol
---
and when blizzard tried to make changes?

How is what he said wrong in any way? She does carry over aggro from P2
---
I *am* a priest, but I'm pretty far from being raid-ready. I had to swap servers from a PvP server to a PvE server just to not be corpse-camped everywhere I went. So I started fresh and just hit 30 last night. 
---
However, I do plan on speccing into PI for the possibility of raiding, so this information is indeed helpful.
---
From LBRS shadow hunter
---
On what website can i look This up?
---
If you have any issues with full clear members let me know. We take our guilds reputation on the server seriously. However, I can‚Äôt fix a problem I don‚Äôt know about. Also, screenshots are best because he said/she said isn‚Äôt viable.
---
I hate twinks and twinking, it basically ruins engaging in BGs until 60 and then you're still running into the equivalent of premades stomping and dodging.
---
So I'm looking at the later brackets, 40-49 because it still feels like sub-60 fun with less twinking, and 50-59 since then you'd might even be borderline competitive in honor gain.
---
That's... not the issue at all.
---
I cant see other peoples flair and i cant figure out why :/
---
So the majority of people leaving the game is because of the sheer amount of WPVP griefers, and this is not even direct PVP, on PVE servers there are packs who do not care about honor, who rack up DKs like they're pez to kill quest NPCs/auction NPC etc..  
---
These people will not be doing BGs, they'll continue to do what they've been doing - trying to drive the other faction to quit. Neckbeards who can play 24/7 and have nothing better to do than to harass people by making the game, literally unplayable, are not going to suddenly be like "YOU KNOW AFTER COLLECTING 25,000 DKs, I feel like ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH MYSELF"
---
Me, on my lvl 47 gnome mage alt doing some quests in Feralas. I get jumped by a 49 orc warrior while i fight a mob. The warrior dies cause mage vs warrior... Five minutes later, same warrior, two druids and a mage jump me while im fighting a mob. I die. Warrior:

Sow and jow is just going to make me spend 400 mana to help my dps 
---
How will it help me be efficient im not gonna punch many bosses
---
Because in raids, theirs hots (which are one of their big power) are being erased by other druids and... it makes them sub-par and a bit boring.
---
Now of course it's not that bad that you can't play them but that's one of the reason it's the least played class of the game: because people know it's just the way things are and it will never change.
---
what? yes.
---
enchanting is a huge money sink until you get those rare high-end pattern.. and even then, the price you can ask drop pretty quick once few people have them.
---
This is what I get for trying to help people haha.
---
&gt;*Not really, you can check people comment histories and figure it out.*
---
...if they actually mention it. Most don't.
---
Hmmm. Faerlina feels alliance heavy to you when it's actually horde heavy as well. Now imagine playing a server where the enemy faction actually outnumbers you, some servers more than double.
---

---
Paying to be a corpse on an MMO whilst you watch YouTube... Mmmm
---
Anyone who has threat when she lands needs to be trained to move her into position if they gain aggro. Dps needs to completely stop during the transition and should only start after the tank calls it out.
---
If they are trying to rank, I agree with you.  But as your name suggests, some people will 100% still do it for the lulz.  They might not do it for an hour, but even 5-10 minutes of them feeling like camping the gy for shits and giggles will suck when you are on the receiving end.  This will 100% happen, but it won't happen 100% of the time (which is why I said "might").
---
HOTW/NS Druid Question:
---
I just hit 60 for the first time playing wow and spec‚Äôd HOTW/NS and I love it. I feel competent as a tank and healer. 
---
But, I‚Äôm interested in how people manage two sets of gear, plus some extra for solo questing.. do you carry it all the time in case you want to jump into an instance with friends? Do you only take the set your planning to use and leave the rest in the bank? I‚Äôm using item rack and all that, but I do feel like half my bag space is always gone with gear and consumes, and that‚Äôs not even counting quest items... 
---
TL:DR: how do you manage bag space with all your different gear  as a HOTW/NS Druid?
---
The best way is to borrow it. 40 gold seems like a lot, but it's less than an hour's work for any 60 that knows what they're doing. Grab it from a friend or guildie, buy your mount, pay your debt over the next week or two with a few gold interest.
---
tomorrow everybody becomes a nameless face in the masses of bgs and the game world population drops overall but becomes even more imbalanced toward horde
---
This isn't heartseeker. But I agree
---
I joined heartseeker right after the poles came out that it was about 52-48 from the 90%-10% that was skeram I just wanted a balanced server luckly the server has become more balanced with the horde only transfers but still to many horde not wanting to move here from there 1 sided server not Ally's fault
---
Ally leave to do same thing
---
Its bis forever, a fee is a small amount to pay for that.
---
Absolutely. But that's also because the horde mantra of "organize yourself hurrdurr" actually works on Venoxis due to the rather small inequality. 
---
You cant really do that when playing on a sever with 75:25 (Skeram) or 95:5 (Flamelash) or 80:20 (heartstriker).
---
It really only is 12 bucks a month.
---
Most of us probably piss away 500-600 bucks a month on shit we dont need anyways. 12 bucks is literally nothing
---
It's amazing how defensive you PvPers get when people play on other servers. Someone can't say the full words "PvE server" before you fly out of the woodwork to scream about how everything is totally fine on your PvP server. Get a fucking grip  on reality and stop defining your life by your server type to the point where you get triggered when it's ever mentioned negatively.
---
Lol ok... enjoy sitting in empty if while everyone is in bgs. Farming honor in if will cease to be the move. Most horde on my server die before they can get a kill anyway.
---
...yikes
---
People advocated that retail WoW lost it's *realm community* and consequences for your actions when they introduced cross-server environment. People wanted realm communities and the feeling of knowing names on your server back.
---
And now cross-server battlegrounds have become the "go to" quoted solution for the heavy population imbalance on certain servers.
---
Does anyone else see just a hint of irony when one of the aspects that supposedly *broke* retail, which is the dissolving of server communities, is now the feature that's supposed to *save* unbalanced servers that were made terrible by their communities...?
---
Honor fixes 1 v 10s? Huh, TiL.
---
Advertise doing Gods work as usual. All of them should be perma'd
---
Power trip? Do a quick google search and see for yourself
---
Bro they will hire you as a writer for retail
---
I did. I didn't catch that, thank you
---
If you quit 1 week before P2 how the fuck do you know this?
---
My guild does two 1hr 20min clears and consumes/world buffs are not required for either raid... idk anyone outside of parse runs/speed clear runs who wastes consumes on MC.
---
GJ omitting the OP where he states he's thinking about rolling Alliance
---
What? Impossible! You take that back!
---
Yeaaaah, he ain't checking that out.
---
Same thing with full spell power ret paladin.
---
I didn't have any specific goals, I just wanted to have some fun, which I'm doing. Got a shadow priest I raid with and a rogue that just hit 60 and I'm enjoying gearing up. When playing them stops being fun and I don't feel like playing an alt, I'll just stop logging in I suppose, but in the meantime I'm having a lot of fun.
---
I have seen 24 hours to 5 days
---
As a DPS I think blackstone is marginally better unless you're really starved for crit.
---
As a tank, agility is better.
---
&gt;Blaumeux
---
Definitely not horde dominated. I'm thinking it's even slightly alliance favoured since several zones are impossible to quest in. Un'Goro, Gadgetzan, and BRM are camped by tons of alliance players at all times and it seems like every day there are raids upstairs in UC. It took me actually 40 minutes to get into BRD two days ago
---
If you're in the middle of logging out while not being in an inn (meaning it takes 20 seconds to log out), will a mage sheeping you remove the logout timer?
---
It just happened to me - I landed in Felwood, got jumped by 5 level 60 hordes instantly (I'm 55 btw) and when I got out of combat I tried to log out but the mage sheeped me again and my logout timer disappeared.
---
This is a bit disturbing to me if it is so.
---
Enjoy the journey :)  
---
Can try another race, so there's a bit of change in the beginning.
---
That's not a US thing, that's a capitalist thing. But if it makes you feel better to pretend it doesn't affect whatever country you're in, please continue to hind behind your edit.
---
Huh? I'm not on reddit 24/7, are you?
---
Did you understand what I wrote, this time, or are you still being obtuse about the *very complicated* math that goes behind the relation between server population and PvP raid numbers?
---
I'm on a dead server (sul'thraze) and only raid log.. Wanted to lvl an alt but the dead server just wasn't fun..
---
So i rolled an Ally on Westfall and i'm having a blast, already level 51!
---
Choose it cus i didnt felt like being ganked every single minute of my already limited playtime. No thanks!
---
Seems like others have covered this pretty well. 
---
Fire resist is just QoL when you can get it on pieces that already have good dps stats or make minor downgrades for it. I find that going 4/4 black dragonscale with a fire resist arcanum does a lot to help protect my world buffs on pesky lava packs in MC for example, but it's nothing close to required. It's just one of those things that you might as well do when it drops your dps by a few % tops, but dark iron gear is just too much of a dps stat sacrifice to ever be worth it
---
yes
---
They said they basically black listed the guy...
---
We were a casual guild so no minus dkp:)
---
.75x
---
Me and a few friends have just completely left the server..
---
Were alliance and one of the first few to hit 60. It takes over an hour to get to MC for the raids and you can move anywhere without being handled in town.
---
I've done some raid/group PvP and we get vastly overrun within minutes anywhere.
---
Completely stopped playing and now on a PvE realm. I'm all for PvP but it really is stupid right now.
---
We have more and more people either quitting or leaving the server day by day.
---
Thanks captain obvious.
---
ARGH
---
Over 60 runs and it didnt even drop yet. QQ. 4 swords eating up the loot table though
---
Get the talisman of spell power trinket on my warlock. Dinged 60 early afternoon and already got it. So now I am gunning for a Nemsis hood and felheart robe. Got my felheart belt and shoulders as well in my first mc run.
---
&gt; Combine the two, problem solved.
---
Now, how you will handle name collisions on server merge?) And guild name collisions. (because I'm pretty sure on every server there's CTR-ALT-ELITE and "Who pulled that" guilds :)
---
Players have been doing it since vanilla. It's absolutely intended to be possible.
---
You also need to consider that the slower the weapon, the more benefit its hits gain from AP. Every 14 AP gives 1 DPS to your weapons, but to find out how much actual damage that gives, you multiply by your weapon speed.
---
For instance, let's look at Frostbite and Lobo. For Frostbite, 42.59 DPS x  2.7 weapon speed gives about 115 average weapon damage for the axe. For Lobo, 47.2 DPS x 1.8 weapon speed gives about 85 average weapon damage for the dagger. If you're just auto-attacking, then the dagger is better, but for the sake of your WWs and HSs and BSs, the axe will give those abilities more punch. Now, this is just naked weapon damage with no additional AP; things change quite a bit when that gets factored in.
---
Let's say we're still comparing these two weapons, except now we're accounting for your current AP - for this example, we'll say 700 AP. 700/14 = 50 additional weapon DPS, which brings Frostbite to 92.59 DPS and Lobo to 97.2 DPS. The difference in DPS between the two weapons is still the same, but 4.61 DPS starts to matter less and less as you gain more and more AP. As for the weapon damage, the effect is even more dramatic. Frostbite now hits for 250 (92.59*2.7) and Lobo hits for 175 (97.2*1.8). If you use Frostbite, your autoattack DPS will go down a bit, but your overall damage will go up significantly. Lobo has a good chance on hit proc too that I'm not accounting for, but this was an exercise to demonstrate the power of slower weapons.
---
The difference wont be nearly as big as people seem to be saying
---
Then why are you arguing as if you do or will? The people in if right now are pushing for ranks. They wont want to be in cities anymore when bgs come out. Pretty sure you cant take a q when you‚Äôre dead.
---
Sounds about right. I quit just before it came out.
---
No, there is only 1 bracket. It's 51 - 60. But of course you prefer to play PVP bracketts at max possible level.
---
People are just throwing out random numbers instead of actual estimates.
---
If the pvp community is 40-60 horde favored, which is more imbalanced than many servers, then you will have about 50% of the average pvp game of queue. Average BGs will be around 15-20 mins, which means the queue would be 7.5-10mins for horde. 
---
I seriously doubt horde will have more than 10 mins queue.
---
Played on flamelash since start, we never had queues after the first week so definitely not why they let us transfer away
---
I'm not generally upset about being hit in the face by a tit, or even a nice pair of them.
---
&gt;I've been ganked more times than I've had sex.
---
So once?
---
Will it tho? Care to place a bet? Blizz does love to rush stuff!
---
Anyway, guild planing on start farming/saving mats for it, cus ou realm is dead and we can't transfer, only reroll.
---
What do you want here, a peer reviewed article? Dont be a cunt
---
"It doesnt matter if youre arms or fury"
---
Stop spreading lies.
---
Show me any PR-person who would actually say that as the reason in the blue post, ill wait.
---
Mad at me or just that youre the only ally that doesnt know you have an easier time farming honor than horde?
---
Warlocks. It's how I leveled for fun. You basically kite a lot with fear/geometry, and once you get banish you can really open up with what you can do. I solo dungeons on her at cap just the same. Not the fastest method but still pretty decent. Especially if you're playing as Heartseeker Horde and the open world is a death trap.
---
Beat me to it!
---
&gt; Nochanges means no changes, either lie in your bed you made or change servers. 
---
No changes would mean servers with a population cap of about 3000, unlike our massive megaservers now with 15000-20000.
---
Yes, it says they're an imaginative storyteller, unless you think people can only write from their own experiences, in which case: poor Stephen King..!
---
I'm way too protective of my conjured water to do this.
---
This reports are lagging behind.  
---
I think that there's huge influx of new Alliance players on Ashbringer, that are not reflected anywhere.  
---
Refugees from Horde dominated servers are running to ZandalarTribe and Ashbringer.  
---
This will screw balance heavily into Alliance favor and may push Horde from servers, creating one-sided servers once again.
---
Most people covered it here. Have a second tank building threat in P1 P2 but try and stay behind some DPS on the threat meter. 
---
Another good strategy is to let the Main tank pick up a couple whelps (1 or 2) and follow onyxia around using sunder / shield slam on her AFTER the Main tank gets fireballed the first time. This will help them build up aggro again. 
---
Stopping dots going into P3 really doesn't help a whole lot. Either that person is going to pull aggro or they aren't. If they pull aggro they need to run to the north point of the room immediately so they don't get the entire raid breathed. 
---
Another great tip. If you want to ensure someone getting threat on her in Phase 3. Have a paladin pop Righteous fury in Phase 2 and spam Greater blessings on a class that has the most people alive. It generates a ton of threat and you can just focus on keeping the paladin up. If you want to actually have a warrior tank it in P3 this is still a good deal for the paladin to get threat to ensure nobody gets breathed or cleaved and just have the warrior try and pull it off the paladin. 
---
We do split runs now of 20/20 for Onyxia and 1 group uses 2 warriors and the other group uses 1 warrior and 1 paladin.
---
I've literally quoted a blue post. Queues are the official reason. On ZT we also had almost no queues after the initial weeks and yet Blizz anticipated us to have queues in p2 and opened free transfer. Now we have no queues and balance from ~50/50 went to 60/40. Thanks blizzard.
---
Personally clearing bwl is my hardest goal everything else is just a bonus. Getting to MT OnY and MC already made my deans happen
---
What a strange gaming. The only winning move is not to play. Not taking Immortal's comment, but speaking as a person who has been punched in the face too many times, "I win fights by not getting into fights in the first place" is perfectly valid.
---
See you get it. Just be smart and stealth.
---
I‚Äôm not, I was responding to a thread saying BG‚Äôs are going to fix everything. You don‚Äôt have to be camping to know that they won‚Äôt. All that takes is common sense.
---
This makes me sad.
---
Well he‚Äôs not wrong. You have to do something for horde players on that server now. They signed up and pay for a PVP experience and they‚Äôre not getting it. Blizzard needs to come up with more creative solutions that don‚Äôt result in the death of a server. Perhaps merge 2 imbalanced servers?
---
someone's having a bad day
---
Please dont expect to make money with ur profs while leveling (u very likely just vendorsell everything u craft 1-300 and even skinning is usually a waste of time). Its almost equally good to just 1-300 level it at lvl 60 with your (epic)mount and/or buying the stuff to level at AH at 60. 
---
Like other proboly already said: u only need 1 skinner in a 40 man raid, 1 enchanter in your friendlist and then still u need a tip and big recipes to be worthwhile.
---
For gathering both herb and mining are good for dungeonfarming at 60 (dm east jumpruns, mauradon). 
---
Herb+alch is good,  leatherworking has 3 profitable specialisations with each raid-crafted items (even with just AH buying your mats). Engi is fun for pvp
---
I play a holy paladin I can't gank anyone. But it's very, very difficult to gank me.
---
No, killing them fixes people camping the cities and provides honor.
---
Well mega servers were a change and one I, and many people, were against from the beginning.
---
Many people's first Vanilla experience was the jacked-together code and ruleset of Nost, and thats what they were expecting. More realistically, lower server pop like Kronos (despite the tuning) were what people should have expected. And Kronos would have been medium-high for pop iirc
---
Dope. Earthfury Reppin'.
---
Troll racials are literally better for sp pvp
---
Was kind of asking for that one aye
---
Gotta agree. I hated gnomes so much that I actually stopped playing alliance to reroll on the faction that kills them
---
Grief? He's ganking.
---
Same I find it really helpful to have both sets on me. Limits travel time. But then I‚Äôm limited to about 30 open bag slots max. Not sure if that‚Äôs way too small. I have three 16 slot bags and one 14 slot.
---
This is why I feel like the free transfers from Blizzard are to blame. Most alliance won't mind being on 55-45 H-A; when there are free transfers though the barrier to moving server is really low so you get a few people transferring because why not go to a server that's more in your favor? Slowly we get to 60-40, where more people reach their breaking point, and so it goes on until we get to ridiculous numbers like 80-20 or I think even 95-5 where it's only reasonable that everyone tries to get off.
---
Did people think that the horde would make some sort of truce because of this?  This is 100% blizzard's fault.  Once they saw all these problems they should've just bit the bullet and disabled honor before BGs came out or at least disable honor in cities/rested zones etc.  But #nochanges right?
---
So if I follow your logic - a person that takes the time to level a profession to 300 and then actually tries to make gold off of it is greedy?
---
It's all supply and demand - that person put in the work to either farm the pattern or farm the gold to buy the pattern.  If no one else has it at that point than they should absolutely try and recoup their investment and then make some money on it.
---
What would be the reason anyone would level a profession if it doesn't make them gold at all?  Your post makes no sense other than you are being sour over someone being able to make money.  What next.... will herbalists and miners be expected to give people herbs and thorium bars for free because they don't want to be construed as greedy?
---
This exactly!  Some of us actually rolled on balanced PVP servers, why would I want anything to affect me because people don‚Äôt want to do the extra work a lot of us did when we first realized the imbalance and rerolled accordingly.  It‚Äôs always been up to the players as to whether or not you want to roll on a specific server whether it‚Äôs balanced or not - why don‚Äôt people realize that?
---
go herb / alch instead. in classic vendoring greens &gt; selling enchanting mats while leveling and enchanting only makes money that can turn that balance once you have valuable enchants and are willing to spam trade chat advertising your services. alchemy way better you just list pots on the AH
---
75gold is quite a lot for me at the moment, but thanks ;-)
---
No complaints at all and not aimed at the situation on other servers, just a statement supporting the fact that Venoxis alliance seems to be rather healthy.
---
To begin with it‚Äôs a player created problem cause with all the ‚Äúmin maxing‚Äù nowadays everyone went horde to pvp whereas if no one had any info the faction balance should be 50-50.
---
If across all pvp servers horde outnumber alliance, there‚Äôs no way for blizzard to balance it unless they ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù some servers. It‚Äôs a player created problem cause too many people chose horde in the first place.
---
The only way blizzard could have solve this is FORCE players to play a faction they didn‚Äôt want, and I can see that making a shit ton of people angry as well. Imagine if your mates are playing horde and you just started, and blizzard has disabled any horde characters.
---
I read that the proc causes the same threat as 2 sunders. So basically any DPS that wants to spend fights dead.
---
until raid time comes and 75% of the people cant get on.
---
couldve got the summon before too
---
These are the same people who decided to just go couch surf on the dwarves instead of fixing their own mess
---
They will probably bring the servers down for maintenance and have an actual patch for the game and when the game comes up the BGs will be live. It doesn't matter if EU servers get BGs right before honor reset or w/e else people are saying. Honor is based on your server / faction.
---
Well not like anyone wanna do that for free :(
---
The best way to not wipe in MC is to not run MC. /s
---
Gets tiring trying to discuss things on the internet and having to point out every obvious aspect of your point or people try to poke holes in it.
---
&gt; I wonder If there is anything blizzard can do anymore to fix these servers.
---
People wanted the Vanilla experience, and well this was it. This was why every retail PvP server progressively became one faction only. Most private servers would get scrapped before faction imbalance got out of control and people also just didn't care as much as they would when it's THE legitimate classic servers.
---
Interesting... anyone 51-59 will get mostly decimated lol
---
Don't suppose you're at all familiar with how the low level zones are. I feel like they'd be pretty empty at this point.
---
Love it
---
Even when they're on an alliance dominant server I bet theyll still make threads whining about how unfair it is
---
Meanwhile the horde on that server won't whine or complain
---
Says the dude literally on drugs: 
---
https://reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/6qgfsq/does_anyone_else_like_to_look_at_themselves_in_a/
---
Same here. 2 pieces T2 and full T1 (ok chest is still missing because it didn't drop). Shame it's only useful for PvP and as a slotwarmer for other speccs.
---
Of course. That's fine. But in the context of this specific thread, it's completely out of place. Nobody was raising the question of who enjoys world PVP and who doesn't.
---
Can anyone recommend an EU server that has decent faction balance and also not long queues? I'm unsure if I wanna play on a PvP or PvE server.
---
Oh you can block it!?? Cool!
---
whts the buff track addon?
---
Does not get much better in both PvE and PvP at 60. Spam flash of light in PvE.
---
Spam flash of light in PvP + cleanses. 
---
Priest is just so much more enjoyable when healing. Only very few people enjoy being 100% defensive 100% of the time.
---
Priests have *very* satisfying abilities which are big fuck you signs to the enemy. Mind control, mofo manaburn, offensive dispell make priests actually fun to play. 
---
Paladins only ever enhance their own team which gets old after a while. Most people like to go on the offensive when the rest of the team is steamrolling the opposition.
---
Down Rag (which will happen tonight) and then probably just drop in each raid drop to re-experience it and call it a day with a dash of PvP here and there.
---
and there i thought Blizzard cant fuck up classic wow since they agreed on no changes oh boy how wrong i was. Enabling free server transfers ??? really Blizzard fuck everything up. Now you have servers that are either horde dominant or alliance dominant since you DID this. This is exactly how retail wow is expect people can turn on and off their warmod and they generally don‚Äôt care about pvp. That‚Äôs also why retail wow is so pve oriented game
---
Yeah that does make sense. &lt;3 Ret Pallys
---
Downvoted for being right.
---
Our offtanks all raid log so I'm 100% sure they don't have dps gear.
---
Lol what am I supposed to do about it?  Go scold them?  Follow people around?  Take screenshots and take to the forums!? I'll be sure to spend all my time crafting posts/messaging gms!  No!  I am trying to play the game here.  It's not my job to police the game.  This is truely absurd what you are saying.
---
Are you using max rank wing clip?
---
Now that's a classic!
---
It's funny because in kromkrush we have renamed the horde hiding stop in IF the Honor hotel any time day or night you can find a group of horde there just waiting to be farmed. It's nice when your honor comes right to you!
---
Holy crap, we have 16 debuff slots now, let your warriors go arms, they'll still be top dps and probably only affect the kill time per boss by ~20 s. 
---
So many people are over estimating the difficulty of future content based on experience from vanilla prenerf and private servers, stop trying so hard.
---
Neat. Enjoy your horde only server.
---
The purpose of my response was to ensure the person to whom you replied understood that dwarf priests do not have 2 fear breaks that are exclusive to their race/class combination. Sorry you took it as a personal attack.
---
You must be very tough ganking alliances outnumbered 1 to 5 I guess, why post to trashtalk?
---
1 - Mag, Baron, Shazz
---
2 - Ony
---
3 - Most of MC is spent clearing trash where DPS doesnt give 2 shits about threat window and goes ham every pull. Any time trash spends killing dps is probably their fault, but you can speed up the instance a lot by having better snap aggro.
---
Love it!

Personally had to switch off due to leveling zone quest givers all being dead after level 40. I'm glad it seems Alliance are putting up a fight at 60 though. Much more than you can say about a lot of the other 2:1 horde dominated servers.
---
The problem is even if you did do that. They would go back to having huge queue times.
---
This is essentially unfixable at this point and its blizzards own doing. Needed to have more than like 5 measly servers at launch so people would have naturally spread out more.
---
So in this situation 10 sappers beats out 40 sappers? Interesting
---
Interesting, so you don‚Äôt think that there should be any changes, but you disagree with the concept of nochanges. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure what constructive ideas you‚Äôre proposing. 
---
Like we have 1.12 right now. Are you suggesting that we go back to a prior patch‚Äôs itemization and balance with the next phase? Are you suggesting that we get a 1.13 with some changes?
---
The great thing about WoW is and has always been that there is no singular way to play.  You can pvp if you want, or you can never engage in combat with other players ever.  You can don nothing but fish if you want.  More recently, you can just log on to do pet battles, or tend to your garden whenever that was, or send your soldiers on missions, or just run old dungeons for xmogs.  This idea of a true classic experience is not a real thing.
---
Slap on some judgment of light and join the zerg in melee. If everyone is tanking you only need to keep 1 warrior alive.
---
If we're talking about proccing a weapon, the rank shouldnt matter? also its not like the boss will get slowed.
---
Alrighty...
---
Yeah, the fight is so long and dps so restrained by threat that 200 dps is quite alright.
---
If your server is busy enough, I seriously encourage you to sell boost runs. On my server, the going rate is like 3g / run for lib or arm, and 4g for cath. Just offer half off for a healer and you‚Äôll have no down time and clear the runs in 12 minutes.
---
I spent probably 15 hours solo farming it when I was trying to buy my epic mount, and a friend convinced me to start selling carries instead. Best advice - it‚Äôs literally twice the gold.
---
Take lib - you can make 11g / run just from your payments, then another 2g or so from drops (just leave it on group loot). You can do 5 runs in an hour, or 65g / hr. Factor in down time and vendoring, you‚Äôre still above 50. During busy times you‚Äôll have people lined up to join your group. Highly recommend
---
This is so much insane misinformation in this post ....
---
I understand. But allowing cross realm will allow faction dominated servers to still have quick ques. We have people on my server already coordinating BG groups.
---
But I agree that allowing some of the online anonymity will have a negative impact on interaction within battle grounds and possibly open world.
---
Pro tip: use a macro with cast sequence to cast both so the same button always switches you.  Spam that button.
---
Maybe he misspelled broman?
---
Womp womp....Don‚Äôt ask him how to escape poverty, I‚Äôm pretty sure his answer would be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be poor, duh lol‚Äù. 
---
Again, in a massively unbalanced server, literally every person in every guild you know wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand up to the two 40 man raids the Horde set up. There is no winning in this case, he‚Äôs basically just telling you to feed the Horde more honor.
---
Bruh, blizz ALWAYS increases pop caps before every major release, otherwise nobody would be able to get into the game other than the lucky 5k.  They even explained their logic behind doing it for classic too.  Same with launching with a small amount of servers.  They had dozens of servers on standby ready to go if things got bad.  Which they did, and then blizz responded accordingly.
---
The problem is that even after blizzard handled things, players STILL complained because nobody wanted to sit in a queue longer than 5 minutes.  Then blizzard PERMANENTLY increased the population caps and then added more servers TWO MORE TIMES.  They should hsve stopped at the first time, let people get frustrated and migrate to smaller servers when things were still early, but instead they caved, and kept adding more and more.
---
More servers means the total player base is even more spread out, which tends to increase the likelihood of large population discrepancies...
---
Im leveling a rogue right now and currently at 28, Im often confused as to what weapons I should use. Are there general guidelines I should follow? Im speccing combat for leveling up but currently have two dagger drops that have higher DPS than any sword Ive had. Should I put the higher DPS weapons in my main hand? And slower things in my off hand? I don't know what guidelines to follow.
---
Coincidentally that's also opinion of Blizzard who have an absolute power over you as long as you are still playing their game.
---
lol m8, i didnt even remember the aq gates. horde on that server is goin for a wild ride on that one ye :)
---
Blizzard had the transfer opened because Flamelash was high pop and it wasn't that imbalanced when it started. Thats why alliance could transfer. They did close it almost the same they the migration started. So ye, they definitely wanted to lock them in. Allowing players to escape imbalanced wpvp was never the purpose of the transfer.
---
Don't go PvP, unless you plan on playing a lot and being dead a lot.
---
When they do the next ban wave, like they've always done.
---
Ya I don‚Äôt see why people are acting like that
---
Yes, where do I go to file my complaint that all cities should be sanctuaries so I can afk in peace like retail.
---
So you are telling me that I should level on a pvp realm so I can try and steal a world boss that most of the playerbase are not hard core enough to dedicate time to tracking and competing for on spawn? Thats the best reason to play on a pvp realm compared to literally just getting to play the game on a pve realm? Hard choice bud.
---
Well the problem started way before the horde decided to sit in ironforge for honor.
---
They only end up doing it because their server is fucked with a 80/20 ratio to begin with. They'll barely find any alliance players in the open world and if they do the honor gets split among 50 people. So where else do you go?
---
I made like 2-400g or thereabouts on my alt from herbalism while leveling. A lot of low/mid level herbs actually sell quite well, like swiftthistle, wild steelbloom, goldthorn, stranglekelp, sungrass, grave moss, fadeleaf and firebloom.
---
When did I say that? Once he problem gets to IF then it is already in the end game for things like this. No one is going out in the world, people are just trying to avoid flags and are raid logging. Etc.
---
Dps die quickly when the tank isn‚Äôt there to keep aggro.
---
Logout?
---
Hes an orc my guy. ;)
---
Okay I'm not sure what part of what you quoted mentions the hunter class specifically? Targetting a player is something the everyone can do in WoW, not just hunters, are you maybe confusing the spell hunters mark with targetting an NPC or player nameplate, because that spell does put a big red arrow on their head, but it's still a separate thing from targetting.
---
Eh, it is an oversimplification but not entirely untrue. There‚Äôs not a lot most classes can do if a mage or rogue gets the opener on them. It‚Äôs an auto-loss unless the other person makes a critical mistake. 
---
Additionally World Boss pvp sounds great in theory but all the ones I‚Äôve attended have been massive lag fests with everyone unable to do anything.
---
Rockstar is way more tight lipped
---
Always a warrior, there are situations where you want to use 5-8 tanks so you will never reach a point where all the warriors have it.
---
395 dps on magmadar, green parse. Youre proud of that? I orange parse every single boss as 2h fury. Your best dps is barely breaking 500 dps.
---
These are pretty awful logs lol perfect example of arms being shit.
---
Wow what a great meme
---
Amen, completely dead server, plus RP is dumb - was getting ganked at the IF AH the other day by some undead rogue that didn't even have a backstory.
---
very ironic, this post.
---
Do you guys really think the horde players care so much ? Like why would they ? BGS coming out tomorrow so why should they care.
---
LMFAO there's no way this is real. You def were just a bad person in game.
---
Lol, when I was trying to get Ony Attuned, I had to Fly ratchet and take boat because Zep tower in Orgri was handled by Alliance...
---
Also, the narrow pass from Kargath to BRM area was ALWAYS camped by rogues and druids waiting to be in superiority to tank you.
---
Then you should have replied as such and not use a leading question that you already knew the answer to.
---
Heh, hello again Deal :)  And yeah, as I was reading this, it occurred to me that a warrior using a 2H wouldn't get enough rage to spam hamstring constantly. I'm alliance (thus the paladin discussion), so no windfury or WCB. I'll have to think about the best option for us, because I doubt a hunter will want to sit there and spam wing clip, haha.
---
Yes, that‚Äôs the point of the screenshot. That‚Äôs all Horde there. They absolutely outnumber the Alliance in ANY capital city, that‚Äôs where things are at with totally skewed servers.
---
It puts you in combat though. That‚Äôs why i said if you drop combat....
---
I mean its obvious that he's a troll when saying "group with friends" on a server thats 91% horde but the comment chain is entertaining on long flight paths :)
---
I quit retail at cata &lt;3
---
You can ask him yourself. I'm pretty sure his character is called Pss.
---
Who else would you blame?
---
You think you do. But you dont.
---
There's plenty enough for Rank 14.
---
its def step bros
---
53 average parse overall is god awful for even an arms warrior.
---
the most common raiding build at this time is AP / Frost which by necessity includes POM. It‚Äôs what my mage is specced right now. Definitely miss the survivability of frost in PVP but it feels fucking good to AP - Frostbolt - POM - Fireball and wreck someone lol. The single target damage is huge with this build. It won‚Äôt be the strongest in PVP but it probably could be a good hybrid
---
Question for horde: Why do you all go to the same faction and wonder why there's no balance?
---
Ok, understood. I'm fairly certain that the bleed debuff would be like deep wounds, and just get pushed off by more important debuffs. Most weapon procs which are just dots are like this.
---
Before p2 started, the faction imbalance wasn't that brutal on most realms. But since p2 started, a lot of the alliance chickened out after first ganks (migrating away or leaving their char and switch to pve realm), therefore creating the problem and deepening the problem by themselves. Yet they whine all around, blaming everyone around... But it's not horde's fault guys.      
---
Sure, Blizz could allow only specific faction transfers to prevent this or care more. But they don't really have dedicated manpower to Classic, it basically lives its own life in "lowcost mode".
---
Is that what a trimmer us for? Can't you really mess up a mower if you hit a root funny?
---
classic alliance player post
---
Oh no dummy. Ill tell you all day long how much of a dummy you are. 
---
Im not reading walls of text from you with frothing nonsense, but if you wanna stick around for abuse... be my guest. 
---
Tell me ALLLL about how server pop size DOESNT effect the average city raid size. Its one of the dumbest things Ive heard anyone say online in awhile. When you're done with that you can tell me that server pop size wont effect the amount of people raiding MC on a given raid night. Or how it wont effect the average amount of people in a given zone mining ore. Come on, keep frothing like a dummy. Im all ears.
---
Just really wanted to say it
---
Thanks, forgot to specify that this was for tanking purposes. I presume the agi is favoured because of the additional dodge and armor?
---
Dude, here i was, taking the time to read ur post, just to get faceslaped  by the amount of ur own cuntness :) (if dat aint a word now it is!)
---
Thanks for helping destroying Nucleus Pro, that almost compensates for the ganking.
---
And yeah, we might have had the numbers at peak hours... But some of you guys fucking lived inside the server, which is why u got the world bosses...
---
Spoiler alert to the idiot #NoChanges crowd: This isn‚Äôt Vanilla.
---
Don't listen to this dude, he doesn't know what he's talking about. You should absolutely buy the shadoweave set. It's cheap and a huge boon
---
&gt;The only thing missing from a PVE server is unwarranted PVP in the open world. It goes both ways. If you want to wreck people in the open world, you are liable to get wrecked as well in the open world.
---
This is exactly the argument I've been making forever, the difference between PvP and PvE is you can gank/get ganked on a PvP server. Anyone that lists that as a positive moves right to the top of my list of people who probably suck. Sorry, being able to grief people/get griefed by others is NOT a positive/beneficial thing by any normal thought process.
---
Ah, ok. That's right, I heard about that attack power normalization. But since instant attacks still benefit from a higher damage range, that's what gives the Barman Shanker the advantage.
---
It won't. I already know of at least 4 guilds on my server that will continue to camp the main cities. Why? Because you can and it's fun. There's nothing to stop it.
---
Well hop on shazzrah and start asking people to see if your false assumption is true.
---
If it's a patch bitch better have my keyring
---
Poetic justice.
---
Even then Flamelash was pretty balanced on faction ratio before the exodus (hence why it wasn't faction locked like most other server). It's just that the top Alliance guilds all decided to transfer off to the Alliance-majority server and all the other Alliance left with them.
---
Blizz should've handled transfers smarter than this by capping the amount of players that could transfer on any given day while allowing those that transferred the option to revert the transfer within a time limit in case they couldn't get all their friends over to the server.
---
Well, I understand what Op mean, but his point is still valid. He should be transfered to an alliance dominated pvp server, and have fun tasting his own medicine.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJXqk0lZA-4
---
You are attacking level 34-35 mobs with the weapon skill of a level 30. You should have a significant chance to glance those targets which is what you are seeing, I believe.
---
But thats horde territory, so you will be camped for no more than 5 minutes. 5 minutes of camping is basically nothing for alliance which is used to 1 hour.
---
Mis-targeting and extra pulls are stereotypical hunter mistakes.
---
Thank you for strangling the joke to death, cutting up it's body and dropping it in seperate trash bags in the ocean you comedy Dexter.
---
Yes.. now if we can just keep it out. Maybe a sort of tall structure with no doors.
---
Interesting since I play horde only for past 10 years, maybe horde players and ally players are not so different if you can't tell them apart
---
Good reply loser happy to dm you my character name, you must be a rank 4 peasant
---
This targeting system is from 7.2 Legion and was developed in conjunction with the "ActionCam " (which was never released but can be turned on with console commands, yes even Classic has the ActionCam ), and this targeting system is fantastic for retail when threat is not an issue, you know it was implemented, and the game-play is designed with it in mind, as shown here: [New Feature in Legion: Target Scan Enemy (Hold)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpvjxPXFHZM)
---
As an aside, here are the Action Cam commands: 
---
    /console ActionCam full
---
    
---
    Note: There are 4 options for this:
---
    basic - Basic ActionCam
---
    full - All action cam features on
---
    off - Disable action cam features
---
    default - Default ActionCam settings
---
I made several videos on this new targeting system during Legion:
---
Here I discuss how Rogues in retail can take advantage of this: [Legion: Target Scan Enemy (Hold) Combat Followup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aWhidCOQ6A)
---
however, in Retail combo points are not attached to the target, so in Classic this has the same ramifications as i discuss about tanking.
---
Here I discuss how during Legion people were having issues with targeting, and it was due to Blizzard not mentioning they completely changed the targeting system: [Legion: Scan Enemy Targeting &amp; Hold Tab Followup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBGxMB1zxhk)
---
This is an issue for tanking for me in Classic as a Feral tank as shown here: https://youtu.be/WysJr47Akvk?t=135
---
Here I explain how I try to use tab target in Classic to use Swipe, but this new non vanilla targeting system hinders that: https://youtu.be/WysJr47Akvk?t=214
---
Here is the entire video: [Is Tab Targeting Working As Intended In Classic WoW?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WysJr47Akvk) yes I now know that people don't want to sit through 6 minutes of me explaining why it sucks in Classic, [my original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dztlld/is_tab_targeting_working_as_intended_in_classic/) was down-voted, hence the cued times above.
---
There is also a separate keybinding (Target enemy Scan Hold) that works slightly differently.
---
Here I discuss the differences between the Tab target and the target Enemy (Scan Hold) keybinding and how this may offer a solution: https://youtu.be/WysJr47Akvk?t=252
---
Ultimately my solution was to program my Razer device to never let me hold the tab key, I programmed a macro that releases the tab key 0.1 seconds after I press it. This means that I am not able to hold down the tab key and fixes this issue for me. If I ever want the hold function I can use the other keybinding Target Enemy (Scan Hold).
---
Bye
---
I just have people calling me the n word a lot
---
Nah, just one reason. You're obviously not having fun doing pvp, I obviously am. You couldn't pay me enough to play on a boring ass PVE server with no sense of danger or war across the realm. It's literally what the game is about.
---
So you can keep having fun playing PVE (which I think takes less skill, is boring, and detracts from the game environment) and ill keep having fun on PVP.
---
Btw I'm not horde, not a mage, not a rogue.
---
if you are corpse running might as well not let them get any honor. this is the point, doesnt matter they care or not.
---
You should quit now so you don't have to read them.
---
You mean you don‚Äôt wanna know about what‚Äôs going on over at flamelash today? Or you don‚Äôt wanna know about little Timmy getting killed in IF?
---
Lets hope for the wintrade bannwave on day of BG release :)
---
&gt;Flamelash was high pop and it wasn't that imbalanced when it started. Thats why alliance could transfer.
---
Yes it was, I commented on the server being dogshit 2 months ago(this was before census was broken) https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d3sqvu/blizzard_please_start_tackling_faction_imbalance/f04xasu/
---
The server was trash from day 1, I am honestly suprised people stuck around as long as they did.
---
&gt;  you get to smash your Mace on your opponent's skull twice next time he bothers you. In a PVE realm you pretty much only get to use it in an instance...
---
I get that killing a boss in MC at this point is a forgone conclusion and killing a player isn't, but I'm not fixated on whether or not I can kill a boss. I'm instead interested in how much better I can get at killing said boss. Last week I parsed a 42% on Majordomo - pretty lame, I know I can do better than that. This week, I came with a few more upgrades like HoJ and more consumables and a better idea of what to focus on and boom, 74%! This perfection of execution is largely what keeps me playing WoW, but I understand that this isn't for everyone.
---
I suggested the same thing in another Flamelash thread and got downvoted to shit. Probably because I have a Horde flair. /Shrug.
---
&gt; The logout timer stops once you are attacked. 
---
I'm not sure about being sheeped, but the logout timer does not stop when you are attacked.
---
I personally have seen myself be attacked twice by players while logging out (3-5 seconds left on timer) and I took some damage and then logged out. Later when I logged back in I was still alive at the same amount of HP.
---
It also works the same with mobs. I watched a mob attack me with a few seconds left and I still logged out.
---
I'm surprised the hardcore PVPers would leave, considering that crossrealm BGs are coming soon and since there is no alliance on the server they don't have to bother camping FPs while waiting for the queue to pop. Hardcore PVEers I get because I wouldn't want to get gated out of AQ for far longer than the rest of the servers.
---
Absolutely nothing. Its just 2019 and were paying for the game with official servers that feels weird because of the delay.
---
Few random dude made a server in their free time that was smoother.
---
Nice site, if it is accurate that is!  
---
The worst part of all this is, that there are actually almost 50:50 Horde to Alliance in total, but as the Horde's racials are superior, most PVP'ers are Horde.
---
&gt; How is that better than simply having a warrior tanking with, you know, defensive stance?
---
It's not meant to replace or be better than a warrior.
---
According to this [guide](https://classicwow.live/guides/836/dodge-rogue-tanking-in-vanilla-rogue-tank-guide-by-caperfin) it's merely something to do once a raid is on farm, which seems to be very fast in ClassicWoW.
---
This makes me kek extra hard, and I want to see it happen unannounced.
---
Who cares if theyre in IF when thats one of the only ways to get honor on a horde dominated server?
---
Dont blame the players, blame blizzard for letting it happen.
---
This post is a 2 IQ take, OP
---
Hunter dps &gt; ret dps. Holy paladins all day but a hunters gonna do more dps than a ret easy.
---
Weapon skill at not 60 is kinda wierd. It can be useful if youre against something 2 or 3 levels above I suppose but the hit chance stat is more important.
---
Amazing that you care
---
what if i also miss 100% of the shots i do take?
---
&gt; Fair, but if you want to change one component, then you don't want classic.
---
I didn't want vanilla exactly, but the current classic is far closer to what I was looking for than any other game. I'm enjoying it quite a bit.
---
&gt; then you thought you wanted it, but you didn't.
---
Ahh yes, trading one trite mantra for another. Big brain move right there.
---
&gt; You're 100% better off just petitioning them to change retail
---
Why not both? There's fun things I'd like to see in classic, and healthy changes that I'd like to see in retail. Reddit is great in that I can hold discussions in multiple subreddits if I so choose. Isn't that amazing?
---
&gt; If you think blizzard is going to change that, you're crazy.
---
I don't think blizzard is going to change anything. I still like entertaining the idea though; it sometimes leads to informative discussions about a broad range of topics surrounding the original idea. For example, I now realize my personal preference is Warmode &gt; PvE &gt; PvP, and this can be applied to other games too.
---
"Wpvp most fun part of vanilla" what is this guy smoking
---
Well he/she's not wrong though. Venture were everywhere.
---
Close the door when you leave, it's cold out there.
---
I play alliance on Incendius and it feels just as bad on my side.  The boats are a sure 2-death expedition, and usually only one auctioneer in IF is actually alive.  Frequent AE spam death bombs in the bank and auction house...  I think we're just lucky that the server is semi-balanced.  Running to BRD has become kind of a coin toss but it feels like it usually ends up that horde control Thorium Point.
---
Certain zones are still OK to quest in but at 51, I think I'm about at the point where dungeon grinding will be the only option.
---
How do I make baron rivendare drop robes of the exalted? Or gorger drop the living neck? My RNG with UD strat must be cursed, I'm on 10+ runs now without seeing either drop :(

WHERES THE LINK
---
It runs between 200-300g on Pagle (A)
---
Krol Blades run about 300g, for another example.
---
No it wasn‚Äôt. The servers weren‚Äôt nearly as overpopulated. You may have had imbalance, but a 60/40 imbalance resulting in a 10v15 person fight was hard, but doable with gear/skill/coordination. 60/40 resulting in a 60v40 is no longer doable. 
---
The no changes part should have included small server pops. Blizz changed that, and the result is a ruined experience. Granted, the TryHard losers are also a big part of the problem, but they‚Äôve always existed. Blizzard should have planned for them. Instead, they‚Äôve made the problem 100x worse.
---
Since when?
---
It was on the 1.12.1 client for sure
---
I want to farm BWL and hopefully get full tier 2 set while it's relevant. I really want to get my Tier 2 helm as I raided Ony a lot in vanilla and never got it. It still evades me but I did get my tier 2 pants recently so excited about that.
---
I just dont understand why ppl complain about not having fun playing while they are not playing to have fun but play "the most optimal way" it's almost like if you are not lvl 60 in week and full BIS in another one you playing the game wrong. If you hry to have fun just goofing around you will have fun regardless of the a/h ratio
---
Back in vanilla yes, however I'm gonna say that it'll make almost no difference now. I think AV is gonna get even faster. Most people are in preBiS, tons of people already have hand of Rag, some guilds have 2.
---
Not being at least 58 cuts a lot of endgame options for you. A lot of people are paying for Stocks runs right now to avoid questing in the world. People charge 2g a person per run on my server, so you could potentially make 8g/run, 40g/hr with this method.
---
Dogshit
---
POM PYRO thru the door.
---
This is the pathetic kind of person who thinks beating up on people who cant fight back is the "most fun".  I'm sure we've all known some of these classy individuals irl
---
What does 'reset on Domo' mean? I see it in trade chat all the time, but don't actually understand it.
---
I'm in a casual guild that runs MC with another guild. Each guild has 2 prot warriors designated for tank loot and we all roll. WE are allowed one a piece of gear per lockout, unless we all get a piece then it resets.
---
We all typically get at least one piece of gear per lockout, sometimes 1 or 2 of us will get more. it works well for us and we haven't had issues with killing anything in MC
---
I hear you. To me, I love PvP because it‚Äôs a whole extra dimension of the game that makes PvE more fun too. Without being able to attack other people in the open world (or be attacked), I become increasingly more aware that I‚Äôm just doing a long grind to get to 60 so I can get good gear and grind more. PVP breaks that all up for me and adds more depth. To each their own!
---
However, this is obviously a travesty.
---
I've always found the insult rediculous, carebears are awesome. Like trying to put down someone by saying they are lesser for valuing teamwork and friendship just makes you look like a douchebag.
---
no need for talent, just max rank.
---
Even though he is easier, if you just kite him around the ruins/stairs and use r1 wingclip from time to time. He only casts his fear, if immobilized.

Plenty of videos where to kite.

Run ally run, HORDE WINS FLAWLESS VICTORY
---
Except you're 100% wrong - Blizz has _never_ handled customer service, ever.
---
A completely separate company, not owned by Blizz,  called Volt Services in Cedar Park, TX does all of that, contracted by Blizzard.
---
So, again, you're 100% wrong.
---
Blizzard absolutely enables this behavior with their choices. Both are to blame.
---
Vanilla was not remotely this bad, entirely because of a significantly lower player populations on each of the servers. Gankfest PVP obviously existed, but it was essentially contained to STV.
---
Needed two tries? Good job.
---
Can't you get 3% from scope? Not really cheap but if you're already comparing full t1 and t2 gold shouldn't be an issue.
---
just keep track of the gear for ur rogues and how they perform in raid. try and help them get their dps up, figure out if rogues want daggers or swords or if they even care.
---
The server populations ARE a change.
---
gotta seal twist and use items that proc from seal of command/righteousness. 
---
really satisfying to have frost oil, weapon shadow bolt fire off 3-4 times in the span of those 2 button presses lol.

&gt;Where did you get those numbers from?

Pulled from his ass, apparently.

Yeah I've been taking Darnassus Portals to farm DM or Mara(less horde in Desolace) and hearthing back once I'm done. Other than that I just raid log because I can't get anywhere. The boats are terrible, neutral town guards suck - don't even mention Morgan's Vigil - and getting to dungeons takes more time than running the dungeon itself. Hell I even got killed after porting to Darn once.

My guild has become one big raid logging machine that tried to get into BRM as a single unit, yet we get killed before we even enter BRM and thus we have to corpse-jump it.
---
 It's horrible and we can't leave. Horde only, but why would they?
---
I think it is difficult to compare from a first person perspective. You need larger sample group than a "I've also gotten killed many times" approach. 
---
It hurts more getting kicked in the nuts than it does kicking someone else.. If you catch my drift ;)
---
Ok since no one is mentioning it, Tailoring is kinda the default with priests, although it often gets dropped at 60.
---
This is because the BoP crafted robe, Truefaith vestments, is BiS till AQ40, and requires 300 tailoring to learn.
---
Also, as a priest, you really don't need to use bandages while leveling; so it's very easy to throw all that extra cloth towards bolts instead. Mail all of the crafted greens to a level 5 bank alt with enchanting and you can DE them all.
---
Lastly, I personally like to have 1 char with tailoring so that I can do something with all the extra cloth from alts (but I prob level too many alts). Just being able to make cheap silk/mageweave bags to give out to lowbies and alts is kinda nice, and mooncloth is ok passive gold income if you're not playing much.
---
Bullshit, my account started a few weeks after launch and it was no where near this on Shadowmoon.
---
I mean those of us who played vanilla and pservers tried to tell them... ‚Äúbut its 2019 the retail mindset will take over‚Äù they said. Now they qq.
---
Even the 3 piece is very debatable. There are better items, I wouldn‚Äòt put too much emphasis on acquiring t1
---
Assuming everything else is preBIS? It depends on the pieces IMO. The 5 set isn't awesome, but there are a few pieces that I'd still prefer the stat heavy t1 pieces over. (especially since you're 21/30 so the spirit heavy t1 pieces are weighed more in your favor)
---
There are more people who speak English than don't, its honestly never been a problem for me or anyone I play with. It makes things inconvenient at times yeah, but people made way more of an issue out of it in the beginning than it actually was. That's my experience, others may differ but I think a lot of people who still play on the realm would agree with me.
---
I will be probably spamming BGs so hard I wont have time to check ;) but jokes aside, the problem is most of the nice ppl, the ppl I wish to chat with , already left too, just by watching the reactions to my post which meant no harm proves my point
---
Will holy pallies need to stack more MP5 for BWL? Or should we continue to focus on +healing?
---
Ni
---
Well some servers actually have bracket caps meaning people farm after reset and stop around sun/mon/tue, this means you can actually have plans for tuesday evening as a bracket 1 ranker, those plans are now ruined
---
Also this will make bracket stacking literally impossible since people will no life the bgs until rank update
---
What a sick trick! A corpse ganker can waste 10 minutes of your time, but with this trick you can waste 30 minutes of your own, that'll show em who's boss!
---
Don't even need multiple accounts, just link up with other tryhard guilds on sister servers using a mutual discord just for AQ opening. Have all the ones on Horde from Server A create an Alliance on Server B and vice versa, then carry on as normal with neutral AH. Open each other's gates and don't even need to spend more money.
---
You‚Äôre probably not doing 1:20 clears with NO consumables and world buffs.  They may not be required, but plenty of folks in your raid are using them anyway if you‚Äôre clearing at that pace.  There‚Äôs only so fast you can go without the additional speed you get from consumables/buffs.
---
"but wPvP is the most fun part of Vanilla"

*camps an alliance capital city with 500 other horde*

Reddit has always been 99% crying bs drama, and 1% useful or note worthy posts.

I'm glad you finally caught on.
---
Both are inaccurate as fuck as total population goes anyway. We have no statistics as to how much of the playerbase even raids MC/Onyxia.
---
Where am I gonna get the 9 friends? They‚Äôve all transferred off.
---
i have a rare birth defect where i grow teeth in my asshole. my dentist got tired of pulling the teeth out of my ass all the time so he just put braces on them and told me "you're on your own". atleast if i ever get raped i can bite the dick off and poop it out.

they dream to prove "u think u do but u dont"

Well it's nice to see the ally advantage curbed somewhat. They get a really easy free jump into the base and limp dick towers

This isn't *exactly* WoW related, but I bet someone could use this conversation today. Someone out there loves you! You will be missed. Whatever you're going through now, you will get through it. I love you. The WoW community loves you &lt;3

It isn't only the population imbalance that is the issue, thats half the story. It looks much worse if you look at the last 30 days and compare..

---
I was the Rogue CL and now got "promoted" to officer...
---
This is what you have to do:
---
HELP YOUR ROGUES! How?
---
1 - Keep an eye on the logs and see what builds/gear they're using;
---
2 - See what consumables they're bringing to the raids;
---
This is mainly it. Do it while not being a jackass or arrogant, try to actually help them.
---
I had a lot of luck since 90% of our Rogues were the most dedicated players i've ever seen!
---
They were never late for any raid and aways brought all consumables required, managed to stay top dps (loosing to some warrs/mages in certain fights) and just being nice to each other.
---
Anyway the CL is kinda like the "supervisor", it's your job to mantain the Rogues working fine and also work as a channel between the players and the officers so both sides can bring any needs/complains and solve it all peacefully.
---
Bullies? No.  I'm hating on Horde for creating the faction balance problem in the first place.   You all had a choice.  Help the faction balance problem or get all of the overpowered racials.  It was no secret that there would be a faction balance problem.  I blame blizzard first and foremost,  but horde players are not blameless.
---
Thing is even if you don't play optimally, by now you've probably still done everything. You can do MC with your eyes closed. You don't *need* full pre-bis so more casual players will probably wonder what the point is when they can clear MC in greens. Many casual players have realised this and left. 
---
&gt; fun regardless of the a/h ratio 
---
While the issue is exaggerated, it is definitely not fun for people on servers like Flamelash where the Alliance population has vanished.
---
Not worth, very slow.
---
Dude. It isn't a win if the ratio is 30 to 70. This isn't an Alliance or Horde thing. It's whichever faction had the significant numbers advantage kept griefing the opposing side until more and more people left. Eventually they  whittled the numbers to such a point where they invaded capital cities. At somepoint the game becomes unplayable and you leave.
---
You choose a PVP server with the expectation the ratio will be balanced. From my perspective this is mostly Blizzard's fault. Additionally, is it really PVP if you try to fly to a FP and keep being ganked over and over to where you can't accept or turn in any quests? Is it really PVP when a bunch of MC gear 60s sit outside BRD camping 50s?
---
And before you say why doesn't the opposing faction simply take it back? It's because in most cases the ratio is 60 to 40. That literally means there are 50% more players on one side. You just don't have the numbers, your forces are spread to thin, and no matter how organized you are casuals will start leaving the game and the situation becomes worse and worse until it's pointless.
---
Horde outnumber alliance 60/40 on your server.
---
They should, but I don't think they do.  Very few NPCs have the "Civilian" tag.
---
Auctioneers, bankers, profession trainers, innkeepers, pie vendors... all of those should have civilian tags.
---
Class trainers should hit like dungeon bosses since hey, clearly they're good at what they do.  Guards should be far more numerous and powerful to reflect the increased player base.
---
To each their own I suppose, but I've been having a great time with world pvp pre-BGs.
---
I salute your fortitude. I don't know how y'all push through the ganks, unless they aren't as constant as I think they are.
---
As a rogue, you want a fast OH to proc poisons as frequently as possible.  If you dont have any pts into a specialization then you can use any weapon you want, typically fast OH with stats (if possible) or just high DPS.  Mainhand you preferably want something slow in order to boost your yellow attack damage.
---
Depends on the guild.
---
Some guilds CL basically has to teach people how to play
---
Some guilds CL has to tell rogues what to do, like who kicks on sulfuron
---
some guilds CL have to keep track of rogues performance
---
some guilds CL has to keep track of rogues loot and what they want
---
some guilds CL have to distribute loot to the rogues.
---
Org to uc are both in horde territory. If you‚Äôre going to be pedantic, just say you can‚Äôt use zep when you‚Äôre in feralas because there‚Äôs no zep tower.
---
Once people mostly level past these, it‚Äôs gonna be misty twinks at low levels.  The amount of twinks I see running around ready for BGs is awesome.
---
&gt; slander becomes the tool of the loser...
---
Dude youve said tons of shit too. Like tons. You also downvote every single comment I make lol. Notice how youre downvoted to shit, though? Kinda sad. 
---
Honestly,  Tell me ALLLL about how server pop size DOESNT effect the average city raid size. Come on smart guy. Prove me wrong lolol. I promise I wont make you cry anymore.
---
they ban x account , day after theres like 3x bots ...
---
Mages can AOE level in the ZF zombie graveyard as early as level 42, although it‚Äôs a lot easier to wait til 44. It‚Äôs a pretty steep learning curve and you die really quick if you mess up or get distracted. If you are good at it the exp is unmatched though. Mages can also do worms in inner Maraudon at a bit higher level.
---
for it to be truly perfect, it would have to be slightly altered so that there were 10 Eric Andre gunman shooting the one Alliance player
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
The other day I was logging out somewhere in Tanaris and shortly after I clicked logout some warrior popped out of no where and started attacking me. The timer kept going, and I logged out before he managed to kill me.
---
The movement speed enchant is actually overpowered as hell. More than worth the few gold
---
My entire office just gave me the "wtf" stare.  Hey, its lunch; im enjoying some 10/10 entertainment here.
---
LOL it's the most accurate one out there my dude.
---
I definitely moonfired a mob across the room rather than the one we were engaged with last night. Embarassing to pull an extra pack that way, but yeah, why would it tab like that?
---
...what?
---
This
---
When it comes to faction balance, ironforge.pro at least gives us an accurate raiding statistic, which is the most accurate we can hope for atm after Blizzard changed /who.
---
Afaik you need to have +heal gear on and then equip sword. It Will ‚Äúlog‚Äù that setting until you swap weapon again.
---
Do test it :)
---
Directly into the trash
---
It is an amazing server!
---
I would say Herb and Alchemy is a better match.  Enchanting is expensive to do while leveling also because you will lose out on all the greens you can sell/vendor.
---
Tailoring would be somewhat helpful if you are going Holy (not so much for Shadow) - Also if you have a main (or mains) you could get something that is a little more complimentary to what those professions are.
---
Maybe he wanted Classic to release on the 1.1 patch and progress to 1.13 at the same pace as it did back then. But I don't think this is possible since Blizzard didn't have the proper backups to release 1.1 for Classic.
---
Hand of rag isn't a dps weapon.  It's a good weapon but just requires money after the eye is dropped.  Not a guild wide gearing effort, like a gear check.
---
Even at the height of 1.12 in vanilla, we had T2/3 common place so pre-BiS isn't exactly going to change things.  Still didn't have fast matches.  30 minutes common.  20 minutes not unheard of.  But still a lot of pvp.
---
I think there is some sort of underlying message to that but I cant quite put my finger on it
---
I've never been this happy in my entire life
---
I mean, hey, they did that for NA for the mega servers.
---
So they did do it for some.
---
After the Wednesday maintenance perhaps?
---
https://i.imgur.com/hbBOh3g.jpg
---
Yeah, I'm definitely close a raid logging state, since I have almost all the upgrades I need outside of raid and so just farm mats for raid consumables, but I've come to terms with that. My first journey to 60 - as I haven't played vanilla before - was truly amazing and I'm very happy to have joined with the initial wave of players at launch. I don't really want to do that all over again, though, because the magic won't be there anymore. Who knows, though, BGs might be exciting too; if not, then I have other games to play!
---
ugh, typed all of them out but they didnt post with the picture. about to drop a comment.
---
Ya, out of the 2 realms netherwind was what most picked to transfer too. Its all a giant leap of faith at the time that's for sure.
---
You really should expect someone waiting for you, when you go to raid.  
---
My guild is taking every precauting before even going to searing gorge/burning steppes.  
---
We drink up GFPP's and send scouts upfront. We all have engineering and have sappers/free action potions ready. We have pvp gear on.
---
Before phase 2 it was two alliance guilds of Flamelash that was camping BRM, Venture and big dig mining. Which ment getting to raids or BRS/BRD as a horde player took quite some time.
---
In phase 2 this changed completely to horde controlling BRM.
---
And in the end it was the alliance guild that first starting with the BRM camping that transfered off the server first, Venture.
---
It was imbalanced already, and migration was open for at least a week, but I'm pretty sure it was weeks.
---
Can anyone ELI5 the whole Ally leaving thing?  Here from R/all for the memes and I'm lost.
---
This narrative needs to die.  The no changes people didnt sway blizzard one bit.  The last time blizzard actually listened to their community was around 2007, so why all of a sudden would they do so now in 2019?   The no changes people are idiots but I honestly would have preferred their version of classic than what blizzard decided to do.  I almost think Blizzard gets some sick satisfaction by making their player base suffer needlessly.  Some of the shit they fucked up could literally be hot fixed by the end of the week, faction caps and normal server pops for starters.
---
&gt; Suppose some people forget feral is a 2 role spec. Nobody has ever called bear a meme. Not to mention I've only ever seen feral tanks called bear tanks. I'm sure even you can see what's being pointed out...
---
ahhh I see. I was so under the impression you intended to say feral druid tanking is a meme. Because I couldn't possibly imagine you intended to say feral dps was a meme, which I assume means, bad? But I now realize you use the term "meme" even for dps, which is sad since they do WAY more than the required dps to kill a boss.
---
No?  Because nochanges can't exist, because the game is already super different than vanilla?
---
There will literally never be a classic wow state that is similar to vanilla, thus there is no real nochanges impact.
---
This was my talent path for arms and post 40 prot talent leveling.  
---
4/5 Parry.  1/3 Imp Rend. 5/5 Tactical Mastery. 1/1 Anger management. 2/2 Improved OP. 5/5 Parry.  3/3 Imp Rend. 3/3 Deep Wounds.  1/5 2h mastery. 1/1 sweeping strikes. 5/5 2h mastery.  2/5 Axe mastery. 3/3 Imp Hamstring. 1/1 MS. 3/5 Plus Defense Skill. 2/5 Shield block %. 2/2 Blood Rage. 5/5 Shield block %. 1/1 Last Stand. 3/5 Defiance. 1/3 Extra rage from blocks. 1/2 Improved Taunt. 4/5 Critical Strike %.  
---
You can take out points in Critical strike if you want more threat in defiance.  I'm not sure which is better, but I wanted the 1/2 imp. taunt for the combo of casting taunt, mocking blow, taunt to keep 12 seconds of aggro on anything tauntable.
---
Or perhaps you should have been clear and consistent with your answer. It's always easier to blame others.
---
Meanwhile on Faerlina, /1 in MC is all CLC trying to recruit and **everyone** else throwing shade at them for being colluding assholes.
---
Thanks. no one wanted it and I didn't back out so I got stuck. I'm not a leader type but I do help out so I didn't mind. Someone said it can easily blow up in your face so now I'm left going "wtf man". All our rogues are really good so I didn't think much of it till afterwords.
---
If a guild: is known to steal loot, is abusive verbally, is generally toxic, has garbage leadership, you blacklist.
---
There was one guild that had a member that was so verbally abusive they had to tell anyone who joined what words to avoid saying so no one would trigger him. I'm not even fucking around on that. It was amazing how garbage that guild was in managing their own community. Guilds like that you perma-blacklist as you do not want to even associate yourself with a cesspool like that.
---
Griefing is fun for some peoples. And this is a world problem, not just wow. Might want to check out Alice Miller work to understand how a person start to. Associate groefing with fun.
---
you had me, and then lost me with the Comic Sans combat text.....
---
‚ÄúPretty much ‚Äú

‚ÄúToxic‚Äù
---
Spriest farm Mara easily. With a little gear you can solo jump runs which is where the real money's at
---
Flamelash is an EU server, Heartseeker is a US server. You dense motherfucker.
---
Nope. Because we were all talking in party about how they are no longer even receiving honor since they are up to 5 kills. Rogue was camping our priest and the second he spawned he killed him. We couldnt go out and help because there were 2 rogues plus whoever was coming in and out
---
Anyone want to explain why people find camping cities fun? I camp people in the open world for a few kills if  I can, but just sitting in one spot all day to farm honor seems boring and stupid
---
Simply not true, 100% completely false.
---
World's longest tenured Grand Marshall, Nodomino on Terenas, did no such thing.
---
Stop it with these lies. Just because you are a cheater, doesn't mean everyone is.
---
But that is the PR/official reason like the poster above you said, does not necessarily mean it is the true reason. We didn't have layers for several weeks before the transfers opened and still 0 queues. I've played on peak hours more times than I can count. I don't think they open free mig because of queues if there has been a 2-minute queue once in the last 2 months
---
Yeah. Bear tanking involves a \*lot\* of tab/maul. It's obnoxious when it prioritizes the mobs not in melee.
---
Correct
---
&gt; Healing touch's cast time is significantly longer than priests
---
3s vs 2.5s? I mean you're not wrong about casting order, but "significantly longer" seems a bit much.
---
Be quiet fan boy.
---
They won‚Äôt care until alliance are gone there too. Think about the buffalo population in the US. No one cared about their population until they were borderline extinct.
---
Horde Thalnos here
---
The numbers are skewed, BUT ally does a nice job of organizing and fighting back.  One or two days ago (Sat night I think) there were multiple PVP groups all over the world wrecking horde.  
---
BRM is nightmare tho =P  Totally horde dominated almost all the time.  I do feel bad for you guys.  It was unbalanced from the beginning too, at first I had fun ganking while leveling but then observed over time that it was usually heavily skewed in horde favor.
---
Well I am the type of player that trys to find the fun in the game. I doubt there is single person that trully "finished" the game. There are plenty classes, races. Tons of skill trees ( doesn't matter if you tell me melee hunter is stupid I WILL DO 1-60  melee only) so many profs, millions of quests and the world is so  huge full of items that you don't even know exists since they have no reason other then for fun. Did you try taking weaker equip just to challenge yourself? Did you try doing low level dung as an overleveled holy priest just because I wanna see if I can solo it ? Did you try all of this and all the countless other options you have in the game? No you just picked one class finished one quest line most dungs just once or not even once cuz they are far away and nothing for you drops there.
---
My dude. I'll risk the troll bait. What is 50% of 40?
---
What is the difference between 60 and 40?
---
hahaha this is great!
---
Let him be Anathema!
---
I'd take it as a holy prot pally. But I wouldn't pay for any mats lol, I'd rather it be guild funded and in the hands of someone who would actually benefit the raid, even in a reserve tank capacity.
---
Edit for clarity: A fury war is the reserve tank, not a healer.
---
I don't play anymore :)
---
Usually it's pretty easy to get around the people camping BRM. You just corpse run back, then line-of-sight and run away/into the portal. Most of the time that works.
---
I lead one of the top raiding guilds on my server so i think i can do it. I hope so anyway.
---
I play ally and get ganked in IF daily but I don't think this guy is doing that. There's 25 horde in IF. It's so empty it's safe so a bunch are just hanging out there, im sure they're ganking but this isn't indication they were a regular ganker.
---
those people need to watch a history of old school runescape video. OSRS will last for another 10 years easily because of the way its run, and its not even ran all that well lmao.
---
All these websites scan using /who command that Blizzard has nerfed heavily to stop people from doing this exact thing. Because of that, getting a correct read on faction population and balance is not possible. Ironforge.pro uses warcraftlogs to determine, at 60, how many characters are raiding and being logged to the site. If we assume that both factions on a server have an equal interest in raiding/logging, then with that you can see an accurate representation of, at the least, the balance of a server. When it comes to the # of population, no website has the correct data. That is why I like to use it over the other sites.
---
Lots of servers are heavily Horde dominated and in order to gain PVP rank during this phase you can only kill people in the open world (no battlegrounds yet).  The Horde on these dominated servers have been camping Alliance major cities and outside of dungeons in order to farm honor because of the lack of Alliance players.   It's essentially made it impossible for Alliance players to do anything productive.   Blizzard allowed transfers from these realms and a lot of the Alliance population has left, worsening the already horde dominated faction balance.
---
Lol ow
---
and cookies
---
I think they were still reducing the server cap at the time and were opening transfers on servers that didn't have queues but still had more players during primetime than the target server cap meaning they *would* have queues later. 
---
But hey, if you ruin the server then you don't have to worry about too many people playing there so... win?
---
Horde Thalnos here-
---
Emotes can be an effective way to communicate given the language barrier =p  But yeah it's tough. 
---
Sometimes I'm like "QUEST AQUI" or something similar to try and get my point across.  But many speak portegeuse (BR) instead of spanish.
---
You literally just said the same as the parent comment...
---
Their data is old
---
What does you being eu have to do with it?  Flamelash is an eu server anyway
---
Same hapened to me..
---
They choose me for the position cus i'm always checking logs and discussing the raids in the chats + the fact that i'm very pro active player and organized most of our dungeons, our realm is DEAD so we're forced to only group with guild members and etc..
---
Anyway, Rogue players are almost always good at the game, so there isn't much organizing to be done.
---
I am on Stalagg, I am sure &lt;Washed Up&gt; and &lt;Grizzly&gt; will be powering through.
---
Laughing in retail
---
Did you take census data for your server? No, then you have no way of knowing if it's accurate.... My sever was 70-30 till I started taking it. Now it's 50-50 yet I know for a fact horse outnumber us.... Unless multiple people are uploading these stats are skewed.
---
it means that if you get an item and you are +1 you can still roll on Domo and Rag as if +0.
---
It's restricted to warrior and rouge.
---
What kind of training bra do you wear when you play your pve server?
---
The problem is you see it as a waste of time. It‚Äôs fine. But for real pvp server players it isn‚Äôt. Most people playing on pvp servers aren‚Äôt those kind though. They just started there because they thought it is the cool thing to do.
---
 [This is the guy you are talking about](https://imgur.com/a/UbHMqUl) 
---
And look at this honor kills, how can he possible be killing all alliance in IF?
---
Get your facts straight before you start a witch hunt for this man!
---
Nope. I mean pservers weren‚Äôt 100% right. But that doesn‚Äôt mean 0% right. We know some stuff that won‚Äôt change. Player mentality is one of those things.
---
Haha that's awesome
---
Role playing as good players. They probably think they are the shit too. Like grats buddy you killed a guy in blues with your BRE and three healers on you at all times
---
Not sure that you can accept in combat, but if you are not autoing the mage in block or after a poly it is possible combat dropped
---
Correct talent is not needed. Idk if his enrage effects his rooting? I started by pulling him into frost trap. This cancelled his enrage. I feigned to reset, placed explosive trap, drank and opened up on him. When he hit explosive I rooted with WC. I did all of this with Curse of Recklessness on me, which makes this fight a breeze. I did all 4 demons on Saturday morning so I doubt anything has changed.
---
200 for a paladin. Not for a normal player
---
There's not a lot of good necks available early on, but that one at least has 8 stam and 8 int. SoR judgement does use spell hit as well, so that's an extra little bonus. It's basically a grab whatever you want slot until darkmoon faire is out and that spell power neck becomes the obvious entry level choice.
---
Only fight mobs 2 levels under you.  If you are fighting yellow mobs, you have moved from green light conditions to yellow light conditions.  Change zones (countless leveling guides out there.  Try classicwow.live/leveling if you can't be arsed to look) unless the quest you are working on has an amazing reward at the end.  Do not go into dungeons unless you are within three levels of the final boss.  Just check wowhead to see the final boss level.  WHile you are there you can browse through the quests for your faction and try and complete any pre reqs and pick up all the quests.
---
And that's the point, people that want the illusion of challenge don't care about such things, most of them didn't even play vanilla at launch, they just want to believe in a narrative where all vanilla players exaggerated difficulty and they are so uberleet that they've come into classic and completely demolished content that was of similar difficulty as it was in vanilla at launch.
---
Im on Thalnos. I hope we can get as many scarab lords as possible.
---
Thank you!  I take is server Flamelash is the worst case?
---
This makes a lot of sense. I'm only thinking in a PvP server situation, thank you.
---
Best is to go herbalism or mining + skinning, then get Engineering, Tailoring (if u want that robe) or Alchemy at max lvl.
---
If you are lazy, you could replace one of the gathering proffs for one of the 3 mentioned at the start, but it may cost you some time, and earn you less gold while leveling.
---
Also on Whitemane, and I must admit I've grown to hate the server. The balance is such that alliance deathballs will roll pretty effectively, but horde are omnipresent at all times. If you aren't in at least a 3-5man group, you're going to get ganked constantly in any endgame zone. Even full raids going into BRM get harassed by 5-man horde groups that aren't afraid to pick off stragglers because they know the raid can't turn around or else the 120 horde idling in both steppes and gorge will have time to collapse on you.
---
Patchwerk is absolutely fine.
---
People who seriously complain there need to be real with themselves and realize they actually want to play on a PvE realm.
---
&gt; Renew is a lot better than Rejuvenation in Classic/Vanilla
---
How so?
---
Or like humanity now and humanity in 30 years when the oceans no longer yield edible food and crops can only be grown in select areas of the world.
---
Absolutely. If a rogue stun locks me, my only hope is to trinket and pop a free action potion. Otherwise I can just get stun locked to death if the rogue is good.
---
If the rogue leaves even a slight window though, I'll be mashing my Psychic Scream so that will go off and probably buy me enough time to shield, renew and kite.
---
They are banning bots, the ones Ive farmed for honor then reported are gone. You have to realize that people are going to bot, and they will not get banned right away. Maybe blizzard could ban them right away but they want to botters to think they have a chance so theyll buy more membership to bot another when the current bot gets banned. Who knows, but they do get banned.
---
Flamelash is EU, Heartseeker and Arcanite Reaper are NA. You people really are thick and will grasp on to any made up narrative to shift the blame to the victim. Flamelash Ally transferred to Earthshaker, which is still mostly balanced because many Flamelash Horde followed them.
---
There are many of us on the same situation... i have only 2hs / day on week days
---
Why the map in center
---
/r/outoftheloop
---
This sums up why I refuse to watch streamers, and youtube videos. I don't even know who this Asmon person is never seen em. See alot of the name or variation of the name on here, but refuse to look them up. 
---
Plus id rather spend my time playing games then watching someone play them.
---
Yup. I'm on a pretty balanced server. Died 8 times trying to get to BRD this weekend as horde. Died the same amount of times trying to get to DM this weekend as well. Just get ganked and run to the limit of my rez distance, run as far as I can get and get ganked. Rinse and repeat till at portal. Its so dumb. Wish I had rolled pve.
---
Server imbalance and server transfers arent just isolated to flamelash.  Its caused problems on many others.  US and EU.
---
Haha love it
---
People are stupid, camping IF is not a big deal.  Just stop flagging in town.  We have allies in org all day, they are getting good honor but they are not so disruptive as you say.
---
The big problem is the imbalance everywhere else.
---
horde attempt at retaliation at all the anti horde pvp memes.
---
Yellow and white. Crits would rarely happen at level 28.
---
There is a level of fun to it.  Spent several years on a retail PvP server that was balanced.  Being cautious to avoid being ganked was interesting but grew tiring after a bit.  But you know what?  Would not go back to it because the negatives outweighs the positive and I can still PvP on a PvE server.
---
I think you are miss targeting some rage right now.
---
 It was a joke, which is clearly part of the group of mobs over there, not the one you just pulled.
---
About 90% of the joke was the jump to conclusions, Tom Smykowski.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a trite mantra. But I guess those are your words of the day.
---
‚ÄòYou think you do, but you don‚Äôt‚Äô was a response to a fan question asking about blizzard releasing old patches as standalone games. 
---
It‚Äôs like someone asked for vanilla ice cream. Blizzard opens up an oldschool ice cream shop that sells vanilla. They don‚Äôt have all the same old ingredients as the recipe was developed, but they do have the recipe as it stood at the end before they discontinued it. 
---
Now, the community is asking for blizzard to swirl some chocolate into it. 
---
If you want your vanilla-chocolate swirl, ask for it to be a new flavour in the new store. The vanilla ice cream is for the people that wanted vanilla ice cream.
---
Can someone catch me up on what is going on? Some server had the alliance basically stop playing??
---
Yeah of course because most of us have quit
---
It's more of a disconnect that the "allies" they're farming are just other players, not so dissimilar from themselves. And they just happened to choose the other faction at character creation, not signed up to be NPCs for farming.
---
Faction imbalance isnt fun for none of the sides, I hope it gets better with bgs.I miself know it, leveling on stranglethorn I constanly see +40 even +45 horde players stomping on lv 30s allys and even Its funny for me to deathball them with a friend or two I can be objective on that because im a rogue in midle 40s with high end gear and not only in advantage I choose my fights, the frustration on the chat is what I feel is normal for the alliance levelers. On the side of horde I doubt getting deathballed by a group of allys farming honor (us) is also fun because when i do farm I kill everything that gives honor on sight, just my opinion. I might see your post was kinda irony.
---
he is top dps throughout most of that video...
---
Please God no. Guard shenanigans are bad enough on pve servers where world pvp is basically which side is better at baiting the other into spawning a million ads.
---
Staysafe does this all the time.  He turns the stream to cam only to hide it, but that's what he is doing.  Then declares how "uncampable" he is.
---
Dude we arent just talking about flamelash. Stop being so dense.
---
Popping a fap and to run the flag is bs lol
---
&gt; Unless you can break the top 1.4% of your realm
---
Top bracket, the one providing enough RP to get to R14 is 0.3% of the active population, actually.
---
&gt; Being ahead of others is worth nothing if you cant keep up the lead at this point.
---
Being ahead is worth exactly 1 month of farming. Which is roughly 1/3 of what you need to get to r14 if you can keep top bracket.
---
So you can say it doesn't matter, but it does matter, for those who want to rush r14.
---
Did you not read? It makes perfect sense since If they just banned people insta it wouldn't be hard to pin point down how they get identified. In The end you wont be able to tell it quite as easily, which means yoy lost even more.
---
that really depends, at what point does the queue time for the horde make WPVP more viable? 20m? 30? if its as bad I I think ( I HOPE) it will be for them, it might not change anything.
---
Guild name? Logs?
---
just for aesthetics. puts all my needed info in the center of the screen below my character. i felt having all my other stuff on the bottom and keeping map in top right corner looked off balance. took me a few hours to get used to though.
---
But why bring them when you could leave the slot empty? It would be almost as effective and reduce loot competition.
---
When I started raiding, I had 8/8 valor set, made the main tank in a pug, and I did fine. The only trouble was rag  and baron geddon because I didn't have any fire resist gear, so make sure you have some of that to switch to for MC.
---
This entire post and comment chain are about Flamelash specifically. You bringing up unrelated shit does not change the fact that Flamelash Horde fucked up spectacularly and now want Blizz to bail them out of their own idiocy.
---
The collective wooshing in this thread caused a sonic boom.
---
&gt; Rogues also have a passive threat reduction, so they‚Äôd have to seriously outdo other classes DPS
---
Assuming the rogue is alliance and human it's easier than you might think.
---
You could just make an alliance character then a horde character real quick and never play one.
---
yeah and if you watch the video he is top dps in most of those fights
---
The overall population is really not that imbalanced, so depending on if they do all servers or battle groups, it really won't be as huge a difference as people claim
---
3 month old ...
---
Except the Neutral AH's are in pvp cities.  As soon as 1 auction is sniped, they converge and kill the solo alliance player forever.
---
can‚Äôt wait to see this posted again next week
---
K, obvious troll is obvious
---
does it?
---
Is there a respawning time addon for general mobs or quest items? I ran a quest yesterday and the mob didn't spawn for nearly 20 minutes.
---
Imagine going this apeshit once someone mentions he plays on a pvp server with a little of his opinion in less than 2 lines.
---
Lol sometimes thats how it goes. As more raids get better gear they will need less of those
---
I don't think you're very good at telling jokes. Maybe work on that.
---
Nah I did it after getting rid of his enrage, still didn't work!
---
Figures haha 
---
Ty.
---
&gt; The party of 5 who sit on one guy for 45 minutes, teabagging and cannibalizing his corpse after every pathetic attempt at corpserunning, only leaving when he hasn't ressed in 10 minutes and its apparent that he logged, are something else.
---
Pics or didn't happen (at a massive scale to make a whole faction quit, there are always some sociopaths everywhere).
---
I mean, this all started when honor got released. Who would spend 45 minutes of their time ganking 1 person when they can be farming Honor? If that is "the norm", why it didn't happen before honor?
---
What is likely that happened is that people got killed 10s of times because they were in the zone with other people and the other faction were killing indiscriminately to get as much honor as possible, not tracking who they've killed already.
---
That only works if the overall player population figures were balanced, and they're not. There are basically just too many horde players across all servers.
---
then say sorry to the prot paladin and leave before he reckbombs you into next thursday.
---
That would only work if you were not able to have characters from both factions on one account, as it was in vanilla. As it is right now, Horde players could just make Alliance characters to "balance" it out so that they can make a Horde character. And vice versa.
---
You're wasting 30 minutes of THEIR time. You're doing chores with your own.
---
Multi box ret in raid. I dare you.
---
Hi, /u/BooTheRPGHamster

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8d2uh/please_recommend_eu_pve_or_rp_server_with_healthy/).
---
We honor farmed in capital cities before honor was released in Vanilla...
---
How can you pretend that it isn't "intended" when invading the capitol city and killing the faction leaders give major honor?
---
You think that doing that is going to not involve killing all the players along the way? Or that would be an isolated event? Or that rogues/druids wouldn't infiltrate cities all the time to see what the population would be like? Come on now, think it through.
---
Rofl you think Im salty for stating the facts? You think Im crying for improving my situation and leaving that mess? Fuck off horde kiddie. Im not braindead enough to stick around in something that just is plainly not fun. Ill wait for bgs and play some enjoyable pvp.
---
NTA.   He definitely was.
---
No it absolutely will not
---
If I remember there were people in vanilla trying to game the system and rank but it seemed like a lot of people were participating in the PvP not too terribly concerned with how ranking worked back then. 
---
Now it‚Äôs all laid out for every turd to get and their whole guild and the rest of their server will have aspirations of rank 12-14. Some will fall off but it has turned into the shit show of honor hungry zombies roaming every corner of the world looking for fast and easy fights. They say they want PvP but they only want honor, ranking points and whatever else goes along with it in the most painless and time efficient manner there is.
---
That data is very old
---
When does sylvanas say this
---
they were supposed to be since day1, who knows now though
---
He's talking about PVP meta.
---
I'm gunna need those Un'goro crystals one day
---
But you don‚Äôt NEED to be ganked. Alliance have 0 options, horde has 1
---
On the opposite side, I was recently inside SFK and it was like a sunset view, was very nice. Dont think I ever saw it like that before
---
Similar situation at Noggenfogger. World was in complete lockdown until recently, now lower zones are somewhat playable and most PvP happens on the 50+ areas, I even saw Alliance hold LHC for a while few days ago and some killsquads giving some payback to horde.  
---
It's silly how I've seen Horde characters just afk in middle of roads or next to farm spots since they took over everything so hard they haven't had a threat for a while.
---
K
---
We get it mate, you play mage.
---
Fun?  Also if you're the type that would rather have an empty slot versus a ret paladin or enhance shaman... you're not the kind of person I'd like to be around anyway.
---
Orgrimmar is asshoe
---
Yeah, sorry, bad habit of mine. I was rephrasing it so it made sense my head :P
---
Yikes.
---
nice! lots of info on that UI.
---
This is absolutely false. The only reason you say that is because you assume everyone cares super hard about rep/gear.
---
I loved old-school AV (minus the rampant botting that existed) and the massive zergs because it's the only way you could get that type of combat.
---
Yeah it means the rep grind is slower, but I care more about having a fun, unique experience in AV than grinding rep like a job. If I want cleaner PvP I'd play wsg
---
no mod I'm aware of but Wowhead comments are generally the best resource I've found. Its mostly accurate.
---
You have very different memories of the nerfed AV that we are getting. I remember horde and alliance running right by each other on opposite sides of the match and going right for bosses. There was very little PvP compared to a single match of wsg
---
You are definitely not the asshole. Your LFG and comment were very typical and appropriate for guild chat.
---
Since you replied to someone talking about a toxic guild saying that you are the guild leader in question (you aren't), that is why you are being downvoted. If you actually were the guild leader, you'd be downvoted for being a shitty guild leader/lying about your activities, but since you mentioned you actually aren't the guild leader in question you're being downvoted for posting an irrelevant reply to the comment. Your comment should have been a top level comment in the thread, not a reply to someone talking about a different guild leader while also saying that you are the guild leader in question. 
---
On Reddit people usually downvote for the wrong things, but downvoting off topic replies to comments is actually Reddit's intended use of downvotes. Downvoting someone for denigrating others would also be improper use of downvotes, if the person denigrating others was still on topic.
---
In the Shadowlands' expansion trailer
---
Good for you, buddy. Go ahead and do what you want but coming onto Reddit to have a cry isn't achieving anything.
---
Rank 5 requires 15k RP
---
Rank 6 requires 20k RP
---
Rank 7 requires 25k RP
---
If you are ~25% through rank 5, that means you have ~16,250 RP currently. After decay, this will put you at ~13,000 RP.
---
So in order to skip rank 6 you will need:
---
25,000 - 13,000 = 12,000 RP gain after decay
---
You are correct regarding that.
---
That means you will need to be in bracket 1 or be the top of bracket 2. Note that if your estimation of current RP is a slight overestimate (i.e. actually 24%) then you will definitely need bracket 1 as it will be slightly more than 12k gain after decay needed.
---
I play on Incendius horde side so I can give you a rough estimate based on my experience so far on the same server.
---
Not sure what it‚Äôs looking like on ally side but from what I‚Äôve seen on horde, the top 2 brackets are shaping up to be higher than your estimate. I believe those people are doing 150-200k per week. I‚Äôm personally only doing 40-60k and that has been putting me in brackets 4/5 so far, depending on the week. I would guess you will end up in bracket 3, probably towards the bottom, and gain around 10-10.5k RP.
---
That being said, I don‚Äôt believe your goal of skipping rank 6 is realistic unless you are pushing 150k+ unfortunately. I can‚Äôt give you an accurate estimate if you are alliance though. Best of luck to you!
---
I would recommend downloading the honor spy addon or finding someone who has it currently up to date in game. They can give you a more accurate reading of how the brackets are looking currently. It hasn‚Äôt been working for me but other people say it‚Äôs been fine.
---
Yes it is related. Because server transfers have affected other servers. Other servers have griefing problems with the opposing factions. I'm glade yall have a balanced server now, on US the only thing server transfers have accomllished is created more unbalanced servers.  Discussions can branch off. If you dont understand that then move along.
---
That happened twice to me.. first time around another hunter managed to get to him before me, second time a lv 60 just killed it and walked away.
---
If you want a tip: if you see someone else kill it or tame it, come back in exactly six hours or so. I did that, and it spawned \*exactly\* 6h30m after it was last killed. A lot of people on wowhead claimed it had a respawn time of 6-8hrs, so it seems like a good start.
---
Good guess but no.
---
Its currently over 80% alliance.  We need more horde.
---
and paladins and ~~rogues~~ hunters
---
Stupid team was just farming hks and they just walked past with the flag!
---
Why wont they cap the flag instead of farming us in the gy?!
---
Cant get anyone to come with me to kill FC!
---
Target the healers!
---
Why didnt you heal me (hybrid class)?!
---
If you would have healed me we would have won that!
---
Hunters have too much range!
---
Mages are broken!
---
Paladins are broken!
---
Warriors are broken!
---
Etc....
---
No it isn't
---
One of the best feelings in the world on your first character, honestly. Felt like an absolute Chad strutting around the mountless in Org when I got mine. Now I moved over to the Alliance and know how to make and save gold, so the magic won't be there when I get a horse. Hell of an experience.
---
I could be wrong, but I remember at some point they changed AV to the point where all the non-zerg rush the other side's boss strats became irrelevant. They didnt take out the boss or the PvE parts of the map, just made it so that they didnt matter and you essentially just needed to join the zerg.
---
Don't forget the fact that SW blacksmithing area is all the way back in the corner, whereas IF blacksmithing is right next to the FP and not that far afield of the bank, AH, and mailbox.
---
I think they will let BGs go 2 months.
---
when there are three raid groups in a zone, thats where you pretty much talk the talk. You probably never witnessed some coordinated actions since all horde do is mindless zerging.
---
The amount of wrong in this is hilarious.
---
@edit 
---
And rightly so? 
---
you‚Äôre baiting reactions by unnecessarily tying a group of people to a specific trait that all types of people can have. You can‚Äôt edit complain when you get those responses, you should expect them for stupid comments like that.
---
Good luck my friend! Do you have any yet?
---
So then from all that I am seeing just starting out on classic should just role horde so I dont get attacked, or role alliance but fear of being on a empty faction server?
---
It's not their fault that that's the only way to farm honor. It's a fault of the game design to incentivize un-fun behavior.
---
U are either a really bad paladin or never played one
---
Razorgore is fine. I'd say theres more Horde than Alliance but the Alliance are far more organised.
---
Get the Shadoweave set, it‚Äôll keep u floating til 60. Depending on prices on your server, buy Felcloth shoulders and hands (maybe even the head too) when u get closer to 60, it‚Äôs worth it. Especially the gloves. Then go all out on your mount. GLHF!
---
Alliance did it first on Flamelash though. That's what set the tone.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!!!
---
PVP realms at high population will be like that, try the ones on medium or even better try RP PVP servers, they are more human. Deviate Deligth is good for me, 40 horde 60 Alliance
---
I too loved vanilla but I haven‚Äôt played Classic much at all.  Back in the good ole days I loved world pvp, and I played on a mix of servers (pvp, pvp, rppvp) and I don‚Äôt remember it being anything like what I see described on Reddit.  Why has it changed so much?  I‚Äôd get ganked on pvp servers in vanilla but the game was never unplayable.
---
Either way, I know there are some recommended fury prot specs that are heavier on the fury part
---
3 of them are alts.  https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/ZGFmdBCVhxQfWwrL#fight=last&amp;type=damage-done
---
Hell yeah!
---
If they were intended to be safe zones, why is the faction leader worth so much Honor, drawing large crowds to kill them?
---
Think bro
---
Bear in mind there will be PVE servers in the battlegrounds and those are largely Alliance dominated. The split should be pretty close to 50/50 overall especially considering Blizzard have all the data necessary.
---
It was a joke look at the picture ...
---
Best comment.  Lion king reference and circuitously called them hyenas lol
---
That's only possible on PvE servers.   
---
On PvP servers you are limited to one faction.
---
It would be a good system.   
---
People for whom it's not that important would sometimes opt for the other side, and people for whom it is important would opt to wait.
---
However they'd have to batch it, something like batches of 50 on both sides, and when one side's batch is full you have to wait for the other to fill. Then another 50, and so on.
---
They are just so boring to play. Best tank healers, best organised pvp healers, best utility, still noone wants to play them.
---
The most ironic thing is that if you want good world PvP right now, PvE servers are the best places for it. I'm always seeing players battling each other in Hillsbrad Foothills, usually it's very evenly matched too. Much better than being ganked every 20 yards just trying to get to a raid or a dungeon.
---
I don't believe hunters mark triggers combat.
---
Not sure how they would extend combat without doing damage.
---
you picked the beta mode faction and racials and you dealt with the consequences. dumbass ally everywhere.
---
I never said everyone did it.  I said it was commonplace on the server and groups that I recall from 15 years ago.  Obviously I have no way of knowing what every other server/battlegroup communities were like.
---
It's one of those things where if there are 5 HWL groups on the server, your'e forced to do because the group that *does* optimize their honor/hr will come out on top if the rest do not.  If there's only 1 group per faction, you aren't forced to do this, and you're free to waste more time.
---
Your example was on a PvE realm which likely had a lot less competition than PvP realms did.  It's possible that Nodomino was in a group that had little-to-no competition.
---
R14 is one of my goals as well! Starting tomorrow ofc
---
I see. Was it like that in Vanilla?
---
Not even close to an exploit
---
Likely any of them after tomorrow morning when all the people farming honor move to BGs.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
You are very welcome! Well met, paladin :)
---
Why does mage get 2?
---
PvE and PvP are clustered together? That‚Äôs surprising to me
---
That would be fucking hilarious
---
NASA has a huge map on its website that shows global temperature trends over the years. And the species extinction numbers over the past 40-50 years sort of speaks for itself.
---
people are not stockpiling flasks for bwl
---
Just roll PVE realm.
---
At least your tauren isn't a warrior tauren plus helm of might is an abomination
---
Lol it‚Äôs Pss. We all know him. He‚Äôs a loser.
---
They are puzzled by your logic and maths.  They can barely line up numbers 1-9.
---
And people will still vehemently defend this garbage honor system responsible for all these things
---
Wish I could see gear, did you kill before phase 3?
---
Well, there are 6 possible bosses and supposedly the one that drops this is the least common one to pop up. Once you do get him, this is the least likely item he will drop (of the main item drops). So anything less than a few dozen runs would be incredibly lucky.
---
Any PVE server would probably do you good. Or wait till tomorrow for bgs.
---
Because their contribution is minimal and unnecessary, a hpal brings the same utility as a ret pal while actually being relevant.

I would love to clear naxx.. but I'd be happy to make it through aq

In other words, it wouldn't make the game or people experience better.

They've always have had all the data necessary and look where we are at in both Retail and Classic.
---
Yes!
---
tWiTcH bAd
---
Blizzard should've opened more servers at launch, and there should've been more population restrictions. 
---
The best thing they can do now is keep up faction specific transfers and perhaps merge imbalanced servers to help the population balance out. 
---
Also would it be so bad to buff flight masters or increase guard spawn rates in towns?
---
Deviate Delight is good. It's a medium sized server at prime time and low pop at off hours.
---
It feels like a legitimate "vanilla" server. If you wake up early before work you can get some good nodes in the world. If you do BRD at 8pm server time you'll run into some horde and if you're with your group you'll be able to fight back.
---
It's been good fun losing control of Morgan's Vigil and then taking it back moments later. Good fun over here.
---
Etwas lauter f√ºr die Spielverderber auf den billigen Pl√§tzen!!!
---
Been playing since mid vanilla, and on and off since cataclysm troughtout, it has always been toxic. Literally always. There are always people that rage because they are camped in pvp, people that bitch about classes in pve, literally always. And you can look up old forums posts, or the entire story of angwee or the other known griefers to learn about it.   
---
It's always the same circle.  
---
I don't even mean it as worse or better, I just find it hilarious that's always the same level of toxic by calling toxic by calling toxic by calling toxic. And so on.
---
You do it on login, not character creation.
---
Welcome to 15 years ago.
---
Lol your getting downvoted because of the servers reputation I guarantee it. But it‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs a decent ratio with the horde slightly outnumbering the alliance.
---
Damn how many horses does your server have that they outnumber players?
---
You‚Äôre 118 days late; must be using IE; Lul.
---
Just curious, Where are you getting the numbers 60/40?
---
&gt;  or 60s with enough  pre-BIS in your guild yet.
---
hahahaha
---
we cleared MC with gear that wouldn't even rank top 10 by todays BIS list. Any 60 who knows how to play is worth bringing to MC, even if they're not wearing anything from some bis list.
---
Class officers are largely useless always have been always will be
---
But that is are small scale individual choices. What happened here is just to human.
---
Yes, every player makes a decision to camp and farm the other side, but the player can rationalize that his individual action is not what causes the downfall. So the thinking is, well "I" camped the FP, IF or SW, but at the same time didn't camp any other spot. And "I" couldn't do anything against the other players in my faction who camped other spots(other than to scold them). So, in his mind, he is not to blame, lack of control. The other faction leaves, witch he even understands. To get rid of the last shred of personal accountability he blames the system(in this case Blizzard).
---
It reminds me of "a death by thousands cuts" like in big cooperations. The employees of an insurance company don't feel responsible when a customer doesn't get his life-saving medication. There are just doing there work and are only responsible for document 20aG, that document was not sufficient so it goes to the next employee who needs document 21bG, which is also not sufficient and so on.
---
I don't judge what happened here to classic or any player or faction. But I can understand why no one will take responsibility.
---
Its a 24 man so no. She wasnt in p2 very long. You can look at gear if you mouse over ilvl or something on the right.
---
To be fair, if blizz had 3 brain cells they would fix faction imbalance. Hell even Warhammer Online had a system to deal with it.
---
Post your logs, fuckface.
---
Think so. It was definitely like that in BC.
---
The warcraft series of RTS games is entirely based around a conflict (war) between the alliance and horde (humans and orcs in WC 1 and 2 and 4 factions in WC 3).
---
This is wholesome! Salute!
---
Am I the only horde player on Heartseeker that keeps reading these posts replacing Horde with Alliance and Ironforge with Orgrimmar and then it starts to make sense?

It‚Äôs probably been answered, but since there are no ally to farm, does that mean that people‚Äôs rise for their grind to 14 has stopped? Or does it still proportionally level? I know it won‚Äôt matter starting tomorrow but was curious
---
So literally, it is like political parties. Full on victim complex, the other side is clearly the aggressor.... And it turns out that the "victim" is going out of their way to discredit the other side and and use that as an excuse to erode the agreaaor's freedoms.... Neat.
---
Hahaha, you expect me to believe that Horde are outnumbered anywhere ever?! That‚Äôs not in line with the script at all!
---
no, it's our priest who just doesn't give a damn bout dkp :D
---
Thinking of going Horde fresh over there. 
---
Am afraid of getting left behind, should I worry? I'm not the fastest leveler, hoping for a month and a half to 60.
---
But you don't need to power game this content so who cares?
---
Just have fun.
---
it was for 6 weeks in vanilla

My bad, am on pve so I had no idea.

Ah I'm on my phone.

Hey! You guys won the war!

Battle for Azeroth is over!
---
Thanks man! :)
---
Edit: I think a decent assumption is that since Alliance is favored in PvE realms, a larger proportion of Alliance players are using warcraftlogs, even on PvP realms, and therefore the population imbalance is even worse than ironforge pro estimates.
---
Jesus man. Was this worth it?
---
On the same token, and this will be an unpopular opinion. What would you like the horde to do? It‚Äôs a PvP server. It‚Äôs still their experience too. They still want to farm honor just like everyone else on a PvP server.
---
Oof. the trumpcard.
---
tHiS iS hOw VaNiLlA wAs NoOb (Editor‚Äôs note: This is not how vanilla was at all)

Based on this person‚Äôs grammar, it‚Äôs not auto correct.

You can‚Äôt auto correct to a non-existent word.
---
Jesus play something else then lol.
---
Brilliant !
---
Cath about 40-50k xp/hr. ZF 60-80k . Brd gorshak for 50-90k was about my experience mage aoe farming with okay groups.
---
The population on a couple individual servers is not the population across all servers. According to comments in other posts just today the numbers are still almost 50/50 for overall population across all servers. That doesn't mean it's even on each server just that the global pop for the factions is a virtual 50/50.

Casting my vote for them to be added to twitch emote addons. For max win.
---
playing pala, can confirm they are boring as fuck. Might be a big reason why I've only raidlogged for the past two weeks, combined with the fact that leveling my hunter alt is horrible because of P2.
---
honestly, it sounds like you dont know how to play your characters. 
---
you have fun playing against NPC's, might as well play Offline on Lan with a couple of your Beta Allies. something tells me  you wouldnt join BG's because "the horde keep stomping us graveyard camping"
---
What a condescending comment to make and a gross generalization in general. It's very childish of you to insult people in a civil conversation.
---
I use it for tracking, aspects, crafting, and consumables. Frees up my bars a ton. It can be tricky to set up though. PM me if you need any help!
---
It's not a straw man. If you are being accurate, at worst it's a repost, but I never saw these previous discussions. Can you link me to an example?
---
Either I‚Äôm an idiot for understanding it another way or everyone else is?
---
My understanding of MS&gt;OS +1 is..
---
You are allowed two total pieces. 
---
One is a tier set item, which as long as your main/current/raiding spec uses that tier piece as BiS you can roll on it. 
---
The +1 is any additional item, usually a ring, trinket, cloak or weapon. You can roll on it if your spec uses it as BiS.
---
ANY good guild has their other fury dps use 1 sunder each on opener.  ANY good tank would ask for the dps to do so. It increases their dps from not waiting for the armor debuff to stack and it increases the tank threat by not doing a shit opener. Opening with 5 sunders, might as well be deep prot. 
---
Thinking you "can't beat" an absolutely awful opener....
---
If the consequences havent happened yet they cant be real! Besides even if something does happen we can just ignore it, when has that ever failed. /S
---
I (Hpal) did a live run with three fury warriors and a mage. We had a designated tank for bosses but the trash is basically free for all. Fast and efficient runs too.
---
&gt;NOOOOOO STOP MAKING FUN OF US PLEASE HORDE BULLS YOU ALREADY SLEEP WITH OUR WIFE IN OUR HOME CITIES AND reddit.com/r/classicWoW IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT WE ARE SAFE FROM YOUR BULLYING PLEASE DONT HURT OUR FEELINGS WITH JOKES YOU FUCKING BULLIES REEEE
---
I mean, you get to play the game right now, you get to do dungeons and go to raid without the extra 45 mins of corpse hopping. You get to pvp when you want to and quest when you want to. You still get bgs and every other aspect of the game. The only thing you miss out on is everything taking significantly longer and being murdered by a group when you land anywhere contested or try to use a boat. I guess you can feel real happy that your realm is dead for one faction purely because the other one has 3x as many people, because at least that means you are " a real man" or whatever. Lol gj.
---
I would but i think everyone knows what the default ui looks like.
---
But every1 who rolls pvp gets ganked
---
Or you could try giving the explanation to defend the point you're trying to make.
---
F
---
hey, if it works for you there's nothing wrong with it!
---
wait you can skip ranks?
---
i always  taught  after rank 4 you can only gain 1 per week
---
nice projection
---
Yea, It was challenging, fun, and most of the fights were pretty even but they just kept getting the upper hand. Nothing compared to some of the horror stories you hear about.
---
Theres a guy in my guild who does 1 mil xp/hour pulls in brd. Obviously its not a million xp but they basically pull everything in the tunnels at the start and aoe it all down at once.
---
What a stupid take
---
I quit that server because it was imbalanced, and I thought the allies playing there were mostly complete pussies.
---
I tried to PvP in phase 1, attacked every dipshit horde I saw. But too many of the alliance players just stood there and watched, and that annoyed me. After all, it was a PvP server.
---
So I am not suprised the server ended out this way, and to be honest. They had it coming.
---
Yep. Any time you can inconvenience a griefer it‚Äôs a win.
---
Judgement of wisdom is a waste of a debuff slot, and even if it weren't, lasting judgement that holy paladin takes makes the judgement last 40 seconds, much more efficient than having a ret pal slap mobs with their 90dps.
---
If he's only camping the spawn at altar I don't see him getting more than 1-2 a day, and that's camping 24 hours 
---
There's 10 spawns in steppes, meaning there's an *average* of two spawns per day at each spawn (assuming the spawns are completely rng and eventually balance out) and the only one you can get without pulling a ton of mobs at level 40 is the one at altar. 
---
I hunt for lotus quite often, when I see someone camping one spot I chalk that up to a victory. If it spawns on their head, so be it, not much you can do unless you also camp that same spawn (but that's a waste of time), just keep looping and hope that the odds don't do you dirty
---
the fuck you talking about, it literally is or was before the ban almost 100% about asmon..... I dont know whats wore the fans that follow asmon or the ones bootlicking advertise. Hes literally making his career based off asmon and you DENY it? dear fucking lord....
---
Class Leaders normally take on responsibility for their Class. Some guilds have Role Leader instead. 
---
They'll be responsible for maintaining sufficient performance from all the rogues that are engaged in guild activities. That varies from guild to guild, it might just be checking they're aware of boss tactics, it might be checking they're appropriately geared, it might be making sure they're using the appropriate consumables. Normally that only extends to Raids, but in some guilds it might extend to PvP too. 
---
They may also be in charge of recruiting for that class, deciding who gets raid spots on that class, deciding who on that class gets priority for loot, and so on. 
---
I do a lot of that for the Priests in my guild, with our Healing Lead. Mostly I just check they're gearing, check they're aware of down ranking, check they're healing their assignments instead of healing whoever, and try to provide build advice if they want it. I'm not some great expert, I just read guides (mostly only the Wowhead ones, which are pretty basic) and try to make sure the rest of the Priests in my raid are too. On rare occasions I explain to people that if they don't improve they'll be risking being benched / loot banned, but we'd rather offer up the carrot and develop our guildies before doing anything like that.
---
Man and here I am seeing one on my faction and one on the opposing faction ever! Maybe you are on a larger pop server I love seeing those feathered laser cannons!
---
wtf are they triggered by? rolling alliance all day 24/7?
---
Meanwhile this entire sub has been ruined by 300 daily posts about a shitty dead realm that was going to die anyways.
---
There has to be a cap to rp decay or else hitting 14 would be mathematically impossible. I read that it's 2500 on an old wiki page, but I don't know for sure.
---
IIRC your SS should be procc'd immediately after your MH attack. I don't think the energy part has a golden rule
---
You reap what you sow. Shouldn't have been a bunch of insufferable spawn camping shitlords. I hate the toxic mindset of "They did it to me 10 years ago, so now I'm going to do it to them!"
---
Spoiler Alert: I did, and so did most of the others.
---
So youre the one killing me at ashara fp :(!
---
You are wrong
---
You should probably take a look at the picture before commenting.
---
I was able to do this on my rogue in WC/SFK, but I'm not sure how possible it would be as any other class unless you over level the dungeon and go back which in turn hurts your XP gain.  Having Evasion on a 3minute CD was what allowed me to do the "bigger" pulls, as well as being able to stealth and pick off elites that are by themselves.  I was also able to easily farm most of the bosses in both places, which is the reason I was doing it in the first place.

But... you can pvp on pve realms. And it's better pvp, lol.
---
Yep this is exactly what I said
---
Well next week is free to play and double xp, try for yourself instead of watching youtube videos that claim it is the worst game ever made.
---
Good meme. I think it should be allowed to stay up.

What do you expect them to do honestly? Not farm honor? "Dont play the game so that maybe you can play the game later"

Netherwind yesterday night had more than 9k auctions alliance side. It's a very even realm with healthy population, in mornings it's a bit quiet but afternoon and peak hours it's as busy as the rest of the healthy realms.
---
&gt;It makes as much sense as letting druids have eye of rag
---
Exactly, in both cases, who gets the legendary, once the ones that actually need it is sorted out, doesn't fucking matter.

You could make a case that Hand of Rag is BiS fire resist gear for feral druids, so w/e.

Some servers are gathering the mats for both sides.. transfer it all via the neutral AH etc.
---
That would be good too.
---
Analysis Andy.
---
Exactly. Says the horde player. I dare you to go play on a massively faction dominant server, as the underpopulated faction and NOT get trbiliastic after 2 weeks of the worst time you will ever experience playing world of warcraft. Trbiliasm is human nature, so is your perception since you have not been affected or felt the displeasure yourself. YOU are literally sitting on your high horse having not experienced the unpleasantness of the last 2 weeks and having a moral ego lmfao, I think you're pathethic, go do like Jesus and put yourself in the situation for  2 weeks then come back and say the same thing. Listen, we're all logical, we get it, there is no difference, apart from what you click on the character creation screen, but we're Human, we have nothing else to blame or vent at so we create the most logical explanation, It is tribal, Humans are Tribal, Technology has evolved far faster than our biology and psychology.

**He actually hasn't done this yet at least. this was actually a big reason why him and mcconnel had a falling out he wouldn't give mcconnel all the gear that dropped. whenever he gives things to specific people he has made a point of making sure everyone knows ahead of time. like with mcconnels judgement crown run or his own shameless runs. everyone going in knows where the loot is to go.**
---
He does ninja loot all the time. There is even a video on advertises youtube of his apologist friends trying to defend him, and then he joins the call and just admits he ninja‚Äôd a bag. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgyLRELJgNE
---
**the sarcasm in his voice when he does is pretty thick if you cant hear it idk what to say.**
---
No it wasnt there is a vod of him being unironically happy and supportive of a ninja looter [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AFtAmvl2SI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AFtAmvl2SI)
---
**yeah this is hilarious and true. dude thought he had way way more pull than he did, most of his audience loves to watch him suffer not help him so he misjudged that in a huge way**
---
So you atleast admit this is true.
---
**and everyone in those situations is doing so freely, he isn't forcing anyone and in response, he crafts things for anyone with mats for free. he has crafted tons of free lionheart's helms**
---
You are missing the point. The point inst that he is forcing people to do these things, the point is he cried for ages about having having classic back and wanting the game to be more like how it was(challenging, meaningful, progression, real goals etc) but now that it is hes basically choosing to play it on lfr mode. None of his achievements mean anything since he gets everything for free, which is unbelievably hypocritical since asmongold is the epitome of a wow elitist.
---
**this is on his warlock, he admits to not knowing much about warlock and warlock bis is blues and greens the purples he is wearing are for pvp and his gear would be improved by more shadow power greens and blues (seems you may not know the mechanics)**
---
This is a fair point it was on his lock not his warrior. 
---
**are you talking about advertise here? I havent heard about asmongold invading other discords...but advertise was harassing him, he made his living off of stirring up asmongold drama. without asmongold advertise wouldnt exist.**
---
Advertise doesn't invade discords and hes not harassing him. Advertise makes videos criticizing asmongold for legitimate things like asmongold did to taliesin&amp;evitel. Advertise doesnt stir up hate or drama, thats like saying the media stirs up hate or drama for reporting the news. Everything Asmongold gets shit for are things he has done or things his guild does that he condones. 
---
**yes yes he does a lot and i agree its pretty shitty behavior. I understand that he doesnt want future fuck ups but yeah he gets a bit heated and rude to his own guildies at times. but i have seen him be just as harsh on himself when he has fucked up.**
---
Being rude to yourself and being rude to other people are two different things. Just becuase you are harsh on yourself doenst mean you get to be a cunt to others. Stop being an apologist. 
---
**Swifty did this is he toxic? asmongold hasn't done this and transfers have ended so now he cant do this. He chose the server over himself in the end, but swifty did not**
---
Well swifty didn‚Äôt start off saying he would own the server and decide when the horde raids and does dungeons. Swifty also didn't start a whole federation of guilds. The difference is Asmon antagonised the opposite faction and made himself the main character on the server whereas swifty just featured on it and is into pvp. 
---
**TBF the things people on Herod were saying about him were far worse than the things he was doing. people hate him far more than he deserves because of a few out of context clips etc. a lot of people do not get his humor and dry sarcasm. also he hasn't done this except for a short time on herod as a joke to anger the snowflakes who hate him so much.**
---
Whats your point here the guy said ‚Äúhe jokes about rolling the new toon on a different, non-streamer friendly server just to piss those users off**.**‚Äù and you admit he did this. You litterally are agreeing he is antagonising other servers for fun. 
---
**this is just false he has tried to distance himself from it, he just uses humor and sarcasm to make fun of the situations in a lighthearted way. when royson was accused of ninja looting asmongold made him duel for the item and when he lost made him give it up. he has pushed**   
---
**for fairness and openness in his looting. he tells people when its a shameless raid and they join of their free will. when mcconnel whined about not being given loot rather than cave asmongold doubled down and almost lost a friend over it choosing fairness for his guild first. this seems like you are just regurgitating talking points but dont actually know what he does on his stream‚Ä¶**  
---
This is all wrong he doesnt distance himself from anything and even if he didnt give mcconel loot this one time he admited to ninja looting before and he said he has no problem doing it again. He even said he would wait until loot droped then decide after to say he would ninja. You are just being an apologist here. 
---
He doesnt clearly state he will ninja, if you annoy him or he wants something he will just ninja the loot after you kill the boss. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgyLRELJgNE
---
4 times? Mate I deal with this shit at least 10 times a day. If I land in a contested zone, alliance are there to FP camp. Our server is 60% alliance so they have a slight advantage. Not to mention the Horde on this server refuse to help lowbies that are being ganked and instead only care about if they can get honor out of helping.
---
Reaching
---
I love how much u complain on reddit about others crying and then u cry about other people hahahah
---
I read 2500 as well as a cap.
---
If it makes you feel better, if you're a rogue or druid just out in the world doing your thing (farming, etc), you gotta be very on your toes rn to pick your own fights, as well - to the point of slowing everything down. It's just a blood bath out there.
---
I want you to know that I did not read this entire thing. But I did skim it and saw all the important arguments. I agree.
---
If it was a bigger problem more people would grow their own food/have farms. There is plenty of unused land in the US, most of the population lives in a handful of cities let alone states. It wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for long if there was one.
---
THANK YOU
---
"Just outplay 5 people killing you as soon as you land." Real high IQ plays buddy, maybe I just dont know how to play my character in Baby's First MMO with a total of 3 buttons and 15 sec windows between spells to decide what button to push. How stupid can you be? 
---
Everyone is waiting for bgs to actually get some good pvp with same size teams finally. Oh and hey moron, Im just advocating for rolling PvE. My main is still on a pvp realm, collecting dust.
---
Wow I remember that pic from over a decade ago.
---
Yea probably
---
BSB is fine.   Largely non-toxic; layering wasn't exploited much back when it existed, so the economy seems fine as well.  I'm on ally side.  If you have more detailed questions, let me know.
---
edit: the guild I'm in has several (5-10) refugees from PvP and RP-PvP realms, and they seem to be relieved and enjoying themselves.
---
Nobody does
---
Batching effects healing also. I've had heals not count because of spell batching and the person died. Like nature's swiftness and max rank heal and they simply die even though it should've saved them and the mana is used. It's dumb to have an arbitrary lag handicap for the sake of being absolutely authentic.
---
Its always funny seeing a DPS UI, because a healer UI would be half raid frames. (at least in the old days).
---
I was looking at an old screenshot and I was wondering why my ui had a giant gap in it, and then I realized it was the slot for raid frames.
---
Greedy loot councils ofc
---
Are you talking about the Jokered issue?
---
How do I set them to keys or numbers though? I never click abilities only press buttons.
---
Simply, I felt it was clear they were heavy handed with their penalties because of their subservience to China‚Äôs market.  Companies of course need to try and keep the Chinese market - it‚Äôs massive and not acceptable as a Fiduciary (the board and upper management of Blizzard) to turn their back to that.  But it felt very much to me like China was like ‚Äúyou gotta make an example of them‚Äù and then Blizzard‚Äôs response felt like ‚Äúyes sir of course sir anything you want sir.‚Äù
---
I guess I‚Äôm principled.
---
&gt;No one is saving the mats
---
This subreddit is great.  At the same time people are posting screenshots of banks filled to the brim with black lotus stacks, other people are like "There's probably not even 5k thorium bars on the server at one time right now".
---
You're out of your mind.
---
How many fireballs averagely go out from phase 2. Count that and then add 2-3 and that‚Äôs where your off tank should be sitting with threat so it‚Äôs an easy taunt. When my guild does phase 2, we only get 1 fireball. So we have him sit around position 3-4. Everyone stops dps until tank is in position and he has her attention for 10 seconds or so and then we start dps again.
---
Any chance you could link me what website(s) you used for your info? There was great information here and it made me realize how much I dont know about the honor system.  Would be nice to read more, specifically curious about what the rank tiers are and what is the maximum attainable rank based on which bracket you finish in.
---
Lol same bro. Losing motivashawn for even that
---
I just like to play the game, and I play classic wow similarly to how I play OSRS.
---
I just fucking grind until my brain turns on auto-pilot, and then I watch tv series at the same time.
---
I have no aspirations to raid (since I've already done it) so I am just kinda doing whatever I feel like. And right now my loose goal is to reach 60, and kill as many horde scum as I can on the way there.
---
IIRC this website is not accurate at all, and depends on players using a specific addon in order to be counted in the census.
---
I've checked the past 7 days on my server before and got a 93/7 A/H ratio. There's simply no way my server is that unbalanced, we're one of the ones closer to a 50/50.
---
Leveling as a mage is great
---
Oh I know. Just my point was as a Lock, unless I land a full fear I can‚Äôt even LEAVE. Rogue or Druid can at least escape if they want.
---
&gt;	You could make a case that Hand of Rag is BiS fire resist gear for feral druids, so w/e.
---
No you can‚Äôt make that case but okay.
---
Fuck what are we gonna do?
---
It's nice not having to worry about raid frames too much. I put them in the top left corner and keep them tiny. Really, I just need to be aware of how many people are still alive lol.
---
Our guilds (Finta Kings) first Ragnaros kill, it was insane as we killed him on our first attempt to boot. 
---
Finta Kings - Kirtonos
---
You can, because it is lol.
---
I'm not arguing this is a good position to be in, but if youre on Flamelash and still farming capital cities, you're a vampire bleeding your food source dry.  Excusing it because you're on a pvp server is just willful ignorance.
---
We were talking about Flametrash so it‚Äôs not like you can do that much. If I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôll finally pay off some sleep debt.
---
You can skip rank, I did Scout &gt; Sergeant
---
I only went PvP because of my friends. Sometimes I dream of playing in the open world on a PvE server ...
---
#This world is a prison
---
People use the word griefing so loosely these days.
---
Flamelash is a EU server btw.
---
It's funny, reading the front page of this sub, you'd think that the *entire game* has completely collapsed. Many of the posts and comments related to this topic are written in such a way that they completely disregard the idea of PvE or other healthy PvP servers existing. As a new or otherwise inexperienced player, you may read some of these threads and leave assuming that the only way WoW gameplay is offered is via PvP servers, and that each of these servers has been rendered unplayable at the current moment. 
---
I couldn't imagine being one of these types of players visiting this sub for the first time.  To be honest it may turn me away from trying the game, or continuing to play it if I had already started but not invested "significant" time. From my own experience, this sub is a horrible indicator of the overall state of this game, and negatively impacts my own sentiment towards the game even though *my* *actual gameplay experience is completely to the contrary.*  
---
I don't know why I wrote all of this, but sometimes it worries me that the negativity brewed here could permeate, and be a greater detriment to the game than corpse camping could be.
---
Do you trust HonorSpy on its estimates for their "next week ranking"? I feel like the numbers of active pvpers is off really messing up the bracket ratios.
---
Yarr!
---
That doesn‚Äôt absolve the person of what they‚Äôve done, being a shitty person means your a shitty person regardless of reward. The game may incentivize un-fun behavior but the player still has the opportunity to either partake in it, or ignore it. 
---
When your earning Honor through HKs, you‚Äôre not just farming some NPC, you‚Äôre farming a Human Player who will most likely get sick of that shit.
---
Just because alliance players on some servers have no clue and backbone it doesn't mean it has to be like that on all servers.
---
You realize my entire point is based on the fact that not everyone flags. 
---
In fact, I would argue the vast majority does not flag. That alone negates your entire point. If half the server isn‚Äôt playing PVP, it does not replicate a PVP server experience.
---
You can cry, whine, beg, but when the majority does not flag, moving to PVE does not become a viable solution.
---
So no, the suit doesn‚Äôt work underwater. :)
---
High pop server and casual server are apples and oranges. Population has nothing to do with players mentality, if anything, less populated server would make you feel much much worse.
---
What's the hit cap for human warriors with Obsidian edged blade? I'm currently sitting at 8% hit (I know, way over for even fury), but with 313 weapon skill, what's my preferred hit cap? I'm holding off on going back to Fury until I can get a decent MH weapon since I was previously using Skullforge Reaver.  
---
Also, arms is absolutely crushing it in 5 mans. I'm averaging at least 400 dps in strat live, if you haven't tried arms in 5 mans after getting a badass 2h, you should really try it. Haven't tried Fury Slam spec, anyone have any experience in raids with the slam spec in pre-raid bis?
---
Not if full clear or TiB is there.
---
Mortal Strike does less damage than BT and also knocks off other debuffs.  
---
Your argument that Mortal Strike adds damage is questionable at best.  
---
1. If you knock off a more powerful debuff, Mortal Strike may have done negative damage.  
---
2. If you had Bloodthirst instead of Mortal Strike, you would do much more damage.  
---
So your justification that you are somehow better off with mortal strike on the boss is just wrong. You are sacrificing \~500 single target DPS to use a worse ability and decrease the damage of others in the raid.   
---
As a GM, you set a horrible example for your players. Putting up half the DPS you could while also nerfing other's dps, selfishly justifying your use of Mortal Strike in raids. Serpent String also "adds" damage to the raid.   
---
If everyone played with as much disregard for debuffs as you do, your raid would be unable to maintain any important debuffs on the boss.  
---
I bet you will steal the Rag 2handers and justify it based on the fact that you use a sub par spec, Arms. Ignoring that there are fury warriors in your raids that make the sacrifices necessary (respec) to actually perform in raids. Ignoring that a fury warrior in your raid would do way more damage with the weapon than an Arms warrior.     
---
Casual guilds that give gear to players for showing up as the worst spec just push away any players that actually put an ounce of effort into the game.
---
Is it cheating?  Again, I‚Äôm not in support of what advertise found Olympus to be doing, but are there rules the the honor system?
---
Well then you‚Äôll have to hope Blizzard is willing to ban the top 15-45 players on every server.
---
I'd stay fury/prot if you're committed to doing most of your leveling tanking dungeons - which is a very valid strat.  As another poster said,  full prot is actually harder to play as a leveling tank because you simply don't generate enough threat. I'd save going full prot until you're ready to start raiding and actively have a spot lined up,  and even then if you're an OT you may still want those fury talents, plus it'll save you the respec cost if you're still running a lot of 5 man content and questing outside of raids,  which you'll still do for a long time.
---
That's not how it works...
---
Just b/c there is a ratio doesn't mean that ratio is applied to all zones equally, nor does it mean that ratio applies to all situations (pvp) equally.
---
One could argue that due to the servers numbers that there is an imbalance of gold farmers and that it further skews numbers, or alts, or anything else that is throwing the numbers off in a zone.
---
That's like the oft repeated claim that "Horde has better pvp racials so it always has more pvpers, and alliance has more pvers"
---
So if you took that anecdotal claim and applied it to the situation, some would claim that in BRM for that server it was really a 1:5 imbalance.
---
But again, it doesn't work. Play times, zones, levels, etc all come in to play. Census has too many variables for you to make such broad stroke statements.
---
Yeah, maybe the next GM will be more cooperative. The vacation went 3 weeks and I didn't expect him to stop playing immediately.
---
your comment made no sense. you jumped to like 4 different thoughts in one paragraph, classic Beta Ally, use your brain, you might get somewhere. 
---
again, seems like you dont know how to play your character if youre only using 3 buttons and a longer global cooldown than everyone else "babys first mmo" is too complex for you, clearly.
---
Must be horde.
---
No, absolutely not. Showing the numbers and letting people decide is a surefire way to get extreme imbalances RIGHT from the start.
---
People will flock to the most populous side, great example of "you think you do, but you don't"
---
That's good. I had no problem playing with non english speakers. I just didn't want to be that guy that couldn't speak the most prominent language on the server.
---
You guys exaggerate lol
---
I suppose it's the same here, just skewed. That's good that it's even at least. We have a similar number of auctions, usually 9k-12k. Horde probably double to triples that if I had to guess.
---
You could completely avoid any sort of Player vs Player match in those games and complete the story about those conflicts.
---
Same thing with WoW. Alliance VS Horde was never *about* Player vs Player.
---
Its better by far on alliance. I‚Äôve heard horde is almost all br.
---
KEKW
---
Yea but they mostly stay in the same area anyway, so bad luck if you're killed in a zone with a lot of quest objectives
---
fact is phase1/2 is probably the most "balanced" 1.12.1 even tho it isnt, from now on it will go just worse and worse, but most of people doesnt know that : )   
---
once you are bored, consider playing 60pvp in lvl 49 twinks bracket, same gear forever, slight upgrades with new enchants, 11less talent points, no pvp set bonuses, missing on non-pvp alterac valley rushes, mounts, full engi/bs
---
Both sides A&amp;H as well as EU &amp; NA have already set solid playerbase for bracket with way more people comming later if they decide for alt.
---
Well that 20 days comment makes me feel a lot better.
---
I like having people in every zone, and not spending 3 hours to just find a group for a dungeon.
---
I also like to be able to pick between multiple guilds if I want to raid.
---
I for one am outraged at the lack of oversight.
---
Source on it not being intended?
---
Right. still nothing. It's a faction war game. Of course it was intended.
---
This is very true. There's definitely a better way to do this (correcting people on their spelling, not death HSing :D).
---
lmao..  /r/gatekeeping wpvp videos.
---
Your prio as tank is 1) establish initial threat, which means rage pot + berserker rage on pull (nearly capping rage) and dumping as much as possible. Usually this means 1-2 sunder +HS spam. 2) Once initial threat is established and 5 sunders are active, you use this priority:
---
Maintain 5 sunders &gt; revenge &gt; bloodthirst &gt; HS spam &gt; sunder armor spam
---
Having HS queued is way more valuable than spamming sunder, assuming your dps aren't threat capped. Sunder spamming is literally wasting rage if your dps aren't threat capped. If you can maintain threat AND do more damage, that is what you want to do. If you have threat issues, yes you want to sunder more.
---
&gt; Okay, let's use this ice cream metaphor to explain. I don't like chocolate ice cream; it's too one-note. Blizzard opened this experimental "classic" vanilla shop, and it's a whole lot more palatable. However, it'd taste a lot better with a bit of chocolate swirl, maybe even some rainbow sprinkles.
---
Do you understand how someone who likes vanilla doesn't want their flavor getting messed with? 
---
&gt;I don't think adding a few rainbow sprinkles warrants a whole new store.
---
It doesn't, but blizzard has a whole other store that they've developed over the years. Don't be surprised that people who like vanilla will tell you to go back to the other store when you ask for changes to the vanilla flavor.
---
&gt;All this being said, it really depends on what the mission statement of classic is. If it's to provide a vanilla experience, then they've failed; the patch they used trivialized all of the vanilla challenges, the original vanilla was frequently changed in organic ways (itemization and class balances) that classic will not, server populations are too large, layers, poor faction balance management... But if they've already failed, why are we still using "vanilla" as the defense for classic deficiencies?
---
So your logic is that if you can't provide a 100% authentic vanilla experience, that you should just stop trying to do so and throw the idea out the window? 
---
I don't think anyone was under the delusion that Blizzard would be able to provide the 'true' authentic vanilla experience without a time machine. 
---
But attempting to provide the closest thing is definitely something that they're trying to do. 
---
When you fail, do you just quit? No! You persevere and try again. 
---
&gt;You are already eating vanilla ice cream with extra toppings. I just want to discuss potentially better topping.
---
What toppings would you like to add? I listed a bunch of changes that I thought would be super fun, but I'd like to see them AFTER the 6 phases. A classic wow take on death knights would be really cool. But I wouldn't want that until after Naxx. Meme-spec tuning would be great. After we've seen through the attempt at the real classic experience. New raids and dungeons and introducing arenas would be A+ content. 
---
What changes would you want to be realistically added today that wouldn't be a further step away from 'real' classic?
---
Hybrid fury prot is fine for pvp.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what people are saying. I‚Äôm not surprised this concept seems crazy to you.
---
You don't need to min max as fury for MC, true. But you also don't need to min max as arms for pvp. I think there's a lot of spreadsheet, armchair experts that either never played as warrior in vanilla or didn't get passed rank ten and ant like you'll be obsolete as a fury warrior in pvp. It's just so silly. There's a 99% chance there's gonna be several other warriors in every battleground providing the ms debuff anyways, and with a team behind you you don't even need it for every fight. People are ridiculous about this conversation.
---
Are you sure you can't melee her in P2. I swear I was last night on my rogue. idk
---
This... I play on Sul'thraze, the Brazilian server, and it's dead cus the other Brazilians choose to stay in the US servers.
---
Btw, i don't blame them for staying, it was Blizz fault for not making the BR server at day 1.
---
What guild?
---
You cant eat your cookie and keep it too.
---
First of all, i assume u talking about ur white hits, because yellow htis dont glance, talking about crit cal for yellow hits have no meaning, because u will nvr reach that. Now for white hits, ur dw miss chance is 24.8% with a weapon skill of 305, now 24.8-6=18.8%. Now it‚Äôs easy, ur formula goes like this, 100-18.8-5 (dodge)-40 (glancing)= 36.2%. There u go, ur crit cap is 36.2%.
---
Guilds gonna need 8 tanks for Naxx, so the drop luck needs to be insane
---
To correct you because you seem to be confused about nochanges.  Classic WoW will never be impacted by nochanges because it is already quite different from vanilla.
---
I sorta been thinking about level 39 druid twinking. I long for the days where I can face roll troll people in wsg with green whelp armor and a long ass mp3 playlist to keep me motivated. Or does green whelp armor cut off at 35? (Edit just googled it. Maybe 49 it is)
---
It's blizzards fault 100000% lol
---
Well, isn't it what happened in the first place lol?
---
Most viewed? Top of the list of people streaming when you go into the Warcraft section.
---
One kill is 1.0
---
Second kill is .75
---
Two kills equals 1.75
---
I want to get that eskhandar's set and send the cat out on some boyzzzz
---
While I agree something should be done about the server balance, I think stopping someone from making a character based on faction isn‚Äôt the best move. What if you‚Äôre Alliance, go to make an alt, but you can‚Äôt because your server is 60% Alliance and 40% Horde? I think Blizzard wants to find a solution that is as unobtrusive as possible while still remedying the problem
---
Yes - but if you played on a low pop server I think your situation would be worse.
---
If you think it's hard to find a group with 5,000 people on line for instance - how much more difficult would it be to find a group on a server with only 1,000 online?  I think you are confusing population with progression.
---
Most servers the progression is probably similar in the sense that everyone is BiS and farming MC/ONY so the higher the population the better chance you would have finding groups while leveling or people still gearing up I think.
---
You're missing the point. It's an arms race between blizzard's ability to identify and ban, and the botter's ability to modify their applications so they aren't able to be identified in mass. 
---
Think about it this way. If blizz bans 2-3 bots (say, from your 'video evidence' for example) , the people running these bots will try (usually with some degree of success) to identify what got these accounts banned, and modify their applications to cover up these identifiers. 
---
It's a logistics problem. Banning in waves makes it much harder for the botters to adjust. Every time blizz bans a few bots, they're giving information to the people there trying to eliminate from the game.
---
 It is your duty as part of the local militia to take them down yourself. Stormwind wont do anything... Hail Stoutmantle!
---
Im a Demo warlock and run with Voidwalker out. Sac him for his shield the moment cheapshot comes out, spam a death coil and spin and the second cheapshot drops they are horrified, hit them with an instant dot, cast a fear, Fel domination cast another Voidwalker, more dots, shadowbolts. Sac the void again if you need it. Keep fear on them ;P
---
Edit: I cant do it consistently at my level because of the varied resists that happen. I've lost a fight with another 60 rogue solely because 1 fear got resisted
---
You lose 5% from not having dagger spec in combat is what you're not accounting for
---
Probably because if you played vanilla exclusively on retail servers, you had 2-3 years of experience, while those on private servers have 15 years of experience playing the same game in some cases. Pretty reasonable to assume then that people on private servers would have a much more intimate knowledge of vanilla compared to the average vanilla player.
---
you will see the point once you meet aq40/naxx geared ones against you
---
Exactly, the vanilla api had so few limitations on what addons could do ingame it was absolutely ridiculous.
---
Taking the obvious exaggerations literally just to be dishonest in your reply is the best you can come up with to insult me? Sounds a lot like you just suck dick and are a horde bandwagon kiddie. Rofl see you in bgs buddy, Ill be the guy who keeps outplaying you.
---
I along with many other people have altogether stopped trying to quest at certain times of the day. In the dead of the morning, it is safe to quest, outside of that, it's best to just grind dungeons and it has gone from being fun to level, to a chore.
---
I enjoy the PVP when I want to PVP, but having the constant threat of a mob of 5 - 60's coming around and killing you when you can't do anything about it really kills some of the enjoyment of the game.
---
You guys have completely got me confused now. If I‚Äôm a lvl 60 without an epic mount and have about 300g. What would be the best/cheapest option to get an epic mount? Farm gold? farm AV rep? Farm PvP?
---
Why would any noob out there pick the less populated side tho?
---
well you are fucking stupid :)
---
Totes dead. Don‚Äôt come here.
---
The Westfall Connection
---
You are correct, a trimmer would be a much better tool to use here.  But given that this individual is mowing the lawn with a tornado visibility in the distance, I'm going to assume a "zero fucks" attitude is in play here.
---
Really really dumb of you to blame them for playing the game lmao. I'm sure if you were on a 90/10 dominant faction through no fault of your own you'd be singing a different tune.
---
Blizzard royally fucked this up
---
these arent issues if youre horde, we dealt with our problems by straight fucking on all the beta Ally that were runnin around.
---
i get to PVP when i want to and ill be able to even more so with BG's, i get to dungeons and raids without corpse walking, i get to quest when i want to cause the one-2 ally that quest along with me get rocked, by me.
---
again there are no positives to PVE, you literally just dont get a feature thats already enabled in game.
---
While yes you are correct on that, the mats to make this weapons are obscene and a lot of the people that can use it better, might not want to spend hundreds of hours and gold on it. If a rogue wants to spend all that time and money, why stop him. (Of course this is after your MT has his weapon).
---
Hyenas were starving and living off of scraps. Then Scar let them live like the lions did and suddenly there was no food for either group. 
---
I can't tell if it's bashing socialist equality or capitalist greed. Probably just a children's cartoon.
---
Playing as alliance on deviant delight (good horde/alli split not an rper) and I‚Äôm finally getting to see the game from an alliance perspective since I‚Äôve played since vanilla but only ever on horde. Having fun doing quests and playing zones I never have. Plus it‚Äôs more fun than retail and things actually matter and have impact.
---
Come play on Grobbulus.
---
Sul'thraze player here.. Out AH has more than 900 items! Around 1200.
---
Realm IS dead tho. I'm only raid loging.
---
Both shamans and paladins shared the pink color in vanilla. It was only in TBC when shamans were given to alliance and paladins to horde that Blizzard changed shaman's colors to deep blue and paladins kept their known pink ones
---
Also keep track of who came and who sat for who and perhaps coordinating who's coming in for which bosses for certain loot (within reason of course).  I'm sure the second part happens less because there's at least 3 PuG MC's going on at all times.
---
So you are only useful if you stick right next to the other warrior?
---
Sometimes you need to peel while the other warrior is in the back lines. This just shows a lack of understanding of PvP. You can't just hump another warrior the whole time.
---
Also, many other talents in Arms outshine Fury in PvP. Like Sweeping Strikes.
---
I think you‚Äôre missing my point. I don‚Äôt give a shit how blizzard currently does it.
---
This is half the reason why I always argued that the "Take your time,  classic is about the journey!" posters were doing people a disservice.  If you get too far behind on leveling/prebis it can be a huge pain trying to catch up when 90% of the server's 60s have no reason to run 5 mans anymore unless you have a guild or large social circle willing to help you along.  The other half of the reason was the p2 rankers farming honor in the open world and we've all seen how that's played out.
---
With oeb (+8 weapon skill) my crit cap is 53.5
---
Any chance we could get a list? I recognize a few, but I like this layout a lot
---
How is the "griefer" the one inconvenienced though? If you aren't there anymore he'll just find someone else to kill. Not really an inconvenience for anyone but you, since you're the one whose progress got interrupted.
---
The longer each person's play session, the better. What you do during that time is irrelevant.
---
"Just out number them by population" you are utter garbage kid. Gj you played the faction everyone knew would have more people on most realms. Way to be good. Enjoy your 30 min queues for bgs.
---
Av rep mount will be about 640g probably the cheapest you can get one right now
---
I have no idea but I like to believe that, beside all the super hardcore players. Most people actually play to have fun, and I see this as one of the first choices we would have been making with my friends at least.
---
To clarify, I am not complaining as the server I play on is now pretty much 50/50 thanks to the transfers.
---
Does the math... check out?
---
Again, you are making this claim to argue a semantic, that druids should be able to roll on it. Yes, they can roll on it for your hypothetical, but there are much better options that don‚Äôt involve taking away that item from someone who can actually use it to its full potential. 
---
One can argue that since warriors can use staff of dominance, they should be able to roll on it. Sure they can technically roll on it, but that doesn‚Äôt make it useful or productive in anyway. You are trying to validate an outlier, and anyone with common sense would see it for what it is, irrational. 
---
Thunder fury is a weapon designed for threat generation. Classes like warriors and prot pallies can use it much more effectively than a rogue for its intended purpose. Simply because they can use it doesn‚Äôt mean they should have equal opportunity to get it over a class that can actually maximize its use. Just because they are willing to throw thousands of gold for it doesn‚Äôt make it a smart decision. wanting to meme isn‚Äôt a valid reason to give rogues equal opportunity to get it vs a class that doesn‚Äôt want it for memes. 
---
You are arguing a fringe hypothetical claiming this 1% situation makes your claim valid. It does not.
---
It‚Äôs blatant bigotry based on one‚Äôs place of origin. It‚Äôs normal to take it personally. Ironically it shows us your ‚Äúvalues‚Äù you are bragging about aren‚Äôt actually worth much.
---
Yet the bitching continues.
---
So I'm not horde, not a griefer, not playing a minmax PVP class, and you still think you can tell me that you can't have fun on PVP.
---
Nope, YOU can't have fun on PVP. It's not for softies I guess.
---
No Disney expects us to assign long convoluted meanings to their stories. In my next essay I will explain in depth exactly why scar was motivated by his repressed homosexuality and Mufasa would in fact still be alive if the lions supported gay people.
---
&gt; Tell me ALLLL about how server pop size DOESNT effect the average city raid size.
---
I'll try, yet again, using very simple words.
---
**If it takes more people to raid a city than the number we can get, we won't raid that city. When we have more people, we will raid that city.**
---
**Server size only affects how hard it is to get the number of people we need. It does not affect the number of people we need.**
---
Can you understand that? It's all words under 3 syllables.
---
Having a lovely time on a PVE server, PVP still happens but only when you set the flag. 
---
Best choice I made last month.
---
If you don't know what you're doing, err on the side of caution. People that heal 2h tanks comfortablyare epic geared priests healing their guilds MT while communicating on discord. If you don't mark, assume wildly weird wrong dps. If you won't tell anything, nothing will be cc'ed. The tank is the guy that sets the pace, reading that is more important than your perfect rotation or precise spec. Have a good time
---
I think you can just have a counter that says death counter and its just the number so you dont even need to see.
---
Healers have to everyone up, so they can decurse as necessary as well as heal.
---
A few weeks ago my Girlfriend was teaching me how to play a card game, she taught me the rules and we started our first game. She wiped the floor with me. She fucked me up so badly I never even got to do anything. At one point I just stopped trying because it was basically the same as trying. 
---
In a game where you need your opponent to keep playing, Sportmanship goes a loooooong way.
---
" On pull: pop bloodrage, rage potion, spam sunder and heroic strike. "  
---
This is your quote about how to do the rotation.
---
Your first GCD should be bloodthirst on any pull. You should follow with Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; Heroic Strike, the fury prot rotation. If you are fury prot tank, you should be popping death wish. If you aren't doing these things, you aren't putting out the threat that fury prot should. You aren't using the spec for its intended purpose.   
---
No competent tank would EVER describe an opening rotation as "spam sunder and heroic strike". Bloodthirst and revenge are far bettter. You are only an off tank, and it shows.
---
You do understand that if the goal is to get as much honor as possible and the best honor is in IF then people are going to be in IF. Its not like dominant faction players enjoy this type of content, but it is what you "have" to do to get honor...
---
We actually did well at the moment of tagging. Skull and X for casters mainly and even circle for sap in big pulls. Though sometimes there would rise the problem that once those are gone, the rogue (that in my experience is a class that pulls more aggro than any caster) would focus one while hunter focus another or even multishots. 
---
Leveling engineering will now be a priority though. I only meant to take it for PvP stuff but now that I have these tips it looks very valuable now.
---
Lol i still wouldn‚Äôt hand over gcontrol. Just give an officer the same abilities a gm would have in the rank menu.
---
Cries in druid
---
What is my purpose? 
---
You cast improved mark 
---
Oh god
---
Lol cool story. I don‚Äôt care how i come off to random internet strangers
---
What is important to know about the Seal Fate build is that you lose the 5% crit, 27% OH dmg, +3/5 weapon skill and BF/AR.  The 5% crit is a big deal with Seal Fate since the spec is dependent on crit.  Much less noticed are the other things.  Even with ACLG, you are missing out on quite a bit of lost white damage from only have 305 dagger skill.  On top of that you are losing the OH damage as well.
---
The Trade off is a shitload more points to hurl at evis.  The AQ set does give an additional 15% evis dmg on top of the obvious stat increases from being higher item level.  What is also very important is the Cthun dagger has +3 dagger skill which can bring you back to +8 daggers with the ACLG.  Those +3 weapon skill might not seem like a big deal, but it's actually huge.
---
True, spaced on that.
---
Pacific time zone
---
It was a shit graph even 3 months ago. Stonespine was considered a balanced server but one look at the level breakdown showed that a massive chunk of alliance numbers came from &lt;lvl10 characters and at level 60 the H:A ratio was like 50 to 1.
---
At this point ya.
---
I would immediately quit playing if that happened, and I‚Äôm alliance. 
---
Thank the lord you aren‚Äôt in charge of game design.
---
Dude it was literally me who uploaded the meme making fun of horde yesterday and I play alliance.
---
lol how can you tell?
---
Then you're leveling wrong. If you spend hours doing handfuls of quests and don't hit a quarter of a level, you're either 57+ or you're just not killing enough.
---
Blizzard has never addressed faction imbalance. The closest they'll come is doing something like switching Perception for EMFH because racial imbalances drive faction imblanace much of the time. 
---
Not locking transfers is their tacit way of admitting the game is unplayable for a lot of people and they're hemorrhaging subs. Its the same reason paid PvP ---&gt; PvE transfers will eventually come out.
---
The faction imbalance across pretty much every PvP realm (including Alliance genociding Horde on Heartseeker and its EU equivalent) is not fixable anymore.
---
&gt;Your post was about capital cities
---
So you're telling me that you're so narrow minded you thought my post was *ONLY* about capital cities and cannot extrapolate that if the server is so bad the capital cities are camped into corpseyards that other areas are as well?
---
You're just spare parts aren't ya bud?
---
&gt; I'm not on Flamelash, direct your faux rage somewhere else.
---
Me neither. I just find it funny when people cry "Git Gud" not realizing how bad it reportedly was.
---
if you dont have a problem getting onslaught or flameguard then why dont you just wait until you can get Viskag/Deathbringer/Brutality Blade? if gold is not a problem and patience is running thin for RNG - id get a quel cus u can repurpose that for tanking while a Krol is just gonna sit and get replaced.
---
Take a look at stonespine.
---
And the initial point of the dude was that once the tanks are sorted out, it doesn't matter who gets it, because they won't use it in a raid setting. So I'm not sure why you're arguing with me, 'cause this post is basically agreeing with the initial statement here.
---
As far as Hand of Rag goes, it is a meme weapon that is BiS for meme specs, so whoever is willing to spend thousands of gold for it should be allowed to get it. Similar to TF once every warrior tank is sorted out.
---
also :
---
&gt;prot pallies can use it much more effectively than a rogue
---
It makes as much sense to give TF to a prot pally than it is to a rogue, maybe even less so.
---
Shoutout to Granje and &lt;Ninja Looters&gt; on Felstriker.
---
I am on BRD angerforge run #68. bad luck happens.... f for respect maybe? :(
---
The next line says, "once at 5 sunders."
---
Getting 5 sunders asap is literally the biggest impact in the start of any fight. It increases raid dps by a ton. Anyone saying otherwise is straight up wrong.
---
I would delay revenge and bloodthirst if there aren't 5 sunders literally every time.
---
You can say what you want, but let's see your logs and we can compare lol
---
Yeah, I mean, I get that getting ganked when you're just trying to run dungeons etc is annoying, but c'mon. They exaggerate quite a bit.
---
&gt;"They're always in UC/IF ganking!!!" 
---
Well, guess what? You can just hide until you're no longer flagged and then they can't touch you.
---
Are these BFA retail players making all these posts? Cause it was like this during original vanilla too. At least on my server. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!
---
Rofl holy shit he keeps going. Whats the matter dude? The warchief needs you buddy! You gotta win classic dude!!! You gotta win WoW!! Put that shit on your resume dude! YOU PERSONALLY WON WOW BY JOINING THE POPULAR TEAM DUDE HOLY DICKS GOOD WORK. Fucking lul
---
I don't even follow him or watch streamers, I just looked into it after the drama. It's all there on twitch for you to see.
---
Alternately, world PVP in Hillsbrad happening everywhere around level 33 me while I level my herbalism.
---
Exactly this try leveling as a horde on whitemane in stonetalon it's impossible without being ganked every few mins in town. This has always and will always happen to both sides
---
Are there any add-ons or settings that can set enemy overhead health bar lengths to be proportional to other nearby enemies?  For example, a 2k max hp enemy would have a health bar twice the length of an enemy with 1k max hp.
---
We are aware. Come to thalnos if you wanna see alliance whoop up on some horde.
---
I was leveling my alt in Westfall when a group of Horde killed me. I had probably buffed someone to get flagged. I let my guild know that Horde was killing in Westfall and a few showed up with my main to removed them from the zone. They then went and cried on the server discord that we didn't fight fair because we had 1 or 2 more 60s there. Regardless of faction, these people just want to ruin someone else's time and not have the same happen to them.
---
Hit 60.
---
The way I did it was waited until a server reset and parked my toon right near where he spawns. Right when the server was back up, he was there.
---
Is that unusual? Genuinely asking
---
Amateur. Hardware advances and the downward trend in LCD prices allow you to have a multiple monitor setup without breaking the bank. Having a second monitor allows me to not miss a single moment of hot girl on girl action while I autoattack mobs.
---
Green Whelp Armor affects players under lvl 50 so you can do same in 49s.
---
For sure druids are godmode fc in 39s, while 49s open the most balanced bracket and versatile (one say everything is viable) Why? Talent points... Destro warlocks are viable, for druids Innervate as example, Mortal Strike warrs... and mounts balance gameplay as well.
---
Yet 49 requires more effort to make, it is the one to go if you like 60-ish pvp
---
You are already behind if you are just starting tomorrow....
---
ive been using beta to tilt this subreddit (mainly this guy with the misspelled "Nemesis") it seems to work incredibly.
---
although i dont have an excuse for the grammar, i felt the grammar was a-ok, but i could be wrong
---
Looking for alliance players, I'm on EU server Pyrewood Village and playing as night elf rogue (lvl 12), for questing and such. Take contact with PM :)
---
What, for the epic mace ?
---
Yes it would because one of them is EU and the other is on the US.
---
And people engaged in deforestation in the Amazon are just playing the market.
---
Just because you can do something you benefit from in the short term doesn't make it a good idea.
---
If he grinds to rank 11 the mount only costs 90g plus riding, and I'm not even sure if you need the riding skill.
---
Alliance is the harder faction in pvp. 
---
The racials are so much better for pvp on the horde. 
---
Undead orc and Tauren racials are great for pvp
---
Want to be the best shadow priest? You have to be undead for an extra shadow dot
---
&gt; They have killed world PvP as it was in vanilla
---
I'm curious what you mean by this. I expect there to continue to be MMO's with world pvp, but implemented differently. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because wPvP in vanilla certainly was never perfect.
---
We have 3 2h wep users in our raid, and the MC weapons are already rotting. Some of the really nice plate dps gear like Onslaught Girdle is going to be extra competitive, though.
---
Sorry didn‚Äôt mention. For HoJ.
---
#carebearpride
---
That's the situation before alliance guilds have made mass exodus from flamelash. 
---
BTW, 60/40 balance was expected for PVP servers but that was before transfers.
---
Like the horde could resist killing them trying to help there war effort.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the people who say it‚Äôs thriving or at all balanced. We transferred our guild off about two and a half weeks ago. We couldn‚Äôt do anything without getting team ganked by a constant party of 60‚Äôs. You literally can‚Äôt take a boat anywhere without dying multiple times and if you‚Äôre not fast enough back to the ship it just respawns you again back alive. 
---
We tried, we really tried, but after playing for hours on our 50‚Äôs and not being able to even get away from a gryphon master without being camped, I finally had to say enough. 
---
I liked the server and the community - when it was alive. We moved and I‚Äôm so glad we did. The economy is so much healthier, players still pvp regularly, and I can travel to theramore without dying.
---
Its how most of us do. I normally dont kill any alliance when I am out leveling, but as soon as a random Night Elf druid ganks me when I am fighting mobs (Its always a NE druid) its game on.

True and screw the jackass who downvoted you because you know what you're talking about.
---
Look up Adibags. I prefer it big time over Bagnon, and I've used Bagnon for as long as I remember. It auto sorts everything and you set how it sorts. It's my favorite addon.
---
Stop trying to feel good you addict
---
If you want to use specific numbers, do research. Not whatever you are doing here.
---
This.. I NEVER give money.
---
B-b-but the media told me to think of Pepe as a symbol of hate. My NPC programming is overloaded with conflict.
---
What site do you guys look at these stats?
---
I am well over 30 Ud Strat runs for my Lightforge leggings.
---
I pissed of the Chinese once on Illidan on the Legion expansion once because of the armband quest. Armbands were selling at 8k to 10k so I crashed the market for a few hours. Had all kinds of Chinese dudes demand I sell all to them on chat lol.
---
Oh there are tons and tons of books. That Lore was just stuff I noticed from the game, but I know blizzard has a huge and continuous collection of wow books.
---
I agree! I have always viewed other servers as alternate timelines to my own. It's cool there is a "timeline" where the Horde has literally conquered Ironforge.
---
Nobody is arguing the numbers are perfect but when you have 3 separate census sites roughly projecting the same numbers, it gives you a pretty good idea where certain realms stand.
---
Elaborate.
---
Ah thats a killer, I remembered seeing live population metrics on wow severs when I used to play retail back in the vaninall/tbc days. Any idea where a guy can get more accurate server metrics?
---

---
Yes because its story is based on a series of RTS games of the same name. You know, that genre where players choose factions with pre-determined units and tech trees and PVP is always equal-numbered. Maybe go play that genre instead of a game that launched with 5 man and raid PVE co-op content, but did not launch with organized, equal-numbered PVP content.
---
Best community I‚Äôve found so far is bloodsail buccaneers. It‚Äôs an rp server but people aren‚Äôt rping 100% of the time. I think I‚Äôve only seen rp happen twice so far.
---
No, it was 60/40.
---
&gt;And the initial point of the dude was that once the tanks are sorted out, it doesn't matter who gets it, because they won't use it in a raid setting.
---
Again, fury warriors have more fringe chances to use TF because they can potentially tank when necessary. So if you are going to go about ranks here, the reply to the original comment was right. Tanks should get it first, then fury warriors and after that, any class that wants to meme.
---
Not really sure how youre trying to justify meme builds having same priority as offspec classes that can actually use it.
---
Lololol total pop is 47/53 percents but nice try
---
Lionheart helm was 300g for a combine on my server.  Lots of people paid it.  Now we're down to about 150g for a combine.  100g for a combine of that thing is not greedy, I guarantee he paid a huge sum for the pattern.
---
It was only added about 3 years ago (Legion). It gets reposted in this sub every month or so.
---
It was kept in Classic because it's very useful for accessibility (e.g. disabled or motion limited players with alternative control schemes).
---
This wouldn't do anything. The majority faction would just camp at FPs (Morgan's vigil, Thorium Pt, Felwood, Winterspring, etc) to avoid the mega death guards.
---
that jokerd video was actually the one i was thinking of when i said he ironically supports it. I dont see how you can think he isnt kidding there... mind boggling to me that you see that as genuine. also all your links are to hour long videos without time stamps i am not going to watch through the whole thing to maybe see something you claim is in there when i already know you are seein what you want to from linking the jokerd clip
---
&gt;You litterally are agreeing he is antagonising other servers for fun.
---
what i am saying is that herod antagonized him and he responded
---
&gt;he admited to ninja looting before and he said he has no problem doing it again. He even said he would wait until loot droped then decide after to say he would ninja. You are just being an apologist here.
---
the part about doing it again i would need a clip to believe i have seen him say specifically that he would not be able to ninja loot now even if he wanted to because if he ever did the clip would be the top 20 posts on reddit all at the same time. the fact that there has not yet been a huge asmongold ninja looted clip on reddit shows he hasnt really done it. also in reguards to the ony bag iirc he accidentally looted it to the wrong person he didnt take it for himself and didnt mean to loot it to the wrong person
---
Is there a missed connections a la craig‚Äôs list on the WoW forums for fishing buddies?
---
Easier to just go get your Might set. I bet youd have it done in 4 runs of MC
---
At best, they will be very behind as they need to raise Alliance resources as well then trade them across the neutral auction house.
---
At worst the gates will never be opened.
---
Sounds like childish edgelords who pack-gank all day ruined the REALM.
---
Makes me laugh when I don't see a single thread from my server complaining yet we are worse off than both Flamelash and Shazzrah and just as bad as Skeram and Stalagg.
---
Thalnos-NA
---
Arms is absolutely the best dungeon spec. This is known and agreed upon.
---
Your hit cap is 6% and anything above that is completely wasted and useless.
---
Slam spec is fine, especially with the new macro that allows you to cast slam without resetting your swing timer. It's still worse than pre raid gear dual wielding. Im not sure that slam with OEB even beats dual wield on human wearing thrash and mirah let alone Dal Rend, but im not sure on this because I play horde and it's completely different.
---
Despite all my jumping and best efforts to melee her, even as a Tauren with larger hit range than other races, I have never been able to melee her while she's in the air. I can use abilities all day long as long as I have rage. Since rogues get energy back passively they can sit on her and use Sinister Strike + Rupture/Evis the whole time too. I would caution a bit though because SHE can melee YOU if you get aggro (i.e. don't be under her unless you've had your threat cleared first).
---
I think you're missing the part where he said "all npcs and vendors in IF are usually dead.
---
So congrats, you've just gone afk and unflagged IF? Now what do you do? Cant go to the AH, the Bank, any vendor or trainer and you cant leave IF. Oh and all you're friends are dead or offline too. 
---
Just try playing the game that way. It's not fuckin fun. 
---
Horde players acting like they have some leg to stand on with "oh it's a pvp realm, you signed up for this". That's bullshit. It's a game, and if I'm not having fun, I'm not playing. Outside of wow it's a pretty well understood concept that if you treat your opponent poorly, they WONT WANT TO PLAY WITH YOU. 
---
really like a preschool level concept here.
---
I mean coming from Grob, I was horde, switched to alliance and I gotta say, I regret it. I loved experiencing alliance for the first time but I find that most alliance seem to complain about the horde all day, I don‚Äôt know if I am the only alliance player that thinks this but I don‚Äôt mind death running and things like that, once YOU go out and WPVP you realize how boring it really is a lot of the time, itbreally depends on the person.
---
I'm always a holy paladin when somebody asks.
---
I just dont understand your thinking. This is how the ranking system works, this is not something players of the game created, how can you blame the players for being optimal within a system that is clearly flawed? When BGs are out, and horde has decent queues this will stop, if horde still has long queues, this will continue ON EVERY SERVER ACROSS THE GAME.(If alliance dominant server its obviously the opposite, but its the same)
---
&gt; Firstly, its not about gathering as much eggs as possible LONG TERM. Its about having more eggs than every other horde on the server, for that week.
---
[Maybe you don't understand how the honor system works?](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview)
---
* A quick way to estimate your rank is taking your estimated Honor earned for the week and multiplying it by 5 - If you earn 2,000 CP per week before accounting in for ranking decay, you will arrive at 2,000 * 5 = 10,000 CP, the minimum ranking required for Rank 4
---
 * **minimum ranking required**
---
Ranks have a **MINIMUM** requirement. If you overfarm honor, and chase people away, you will fail to have enough people to meet that minimum because nobody is out there for you to kill.
---
&gt;You are telling me not to play the game, so that I can play a better version of the game in months? 
---
I am telling you maybe tone it down if you want to be able to keep playing. Maybe thing about your long term enjoyment instead of short term highs.
---
Let's try another metaphor. You're in a marathon race. This race is 12 laps, because it takes at minimum 12 weeks to reach the end (Rank 14).
---
You sprint your horse as hard as you can to get a lead. Your horse has a heart attack and dies after 5 laps. Do you still win the race?
---
&gt;But I wouldnt flame the people that do, because that would be fucking stupid
---
Except now those people are crying crocodile tears because they get to reap what they sow. They have no one to blame but themselves.
---
Who is gonna take that transfer though?
---
I didn't see it 2 month ago, btw.
---
Rip Role playing set
---
If you're gonna use your fury warriors to OT fights, which you eventually will, then absolutely, nobody said anything to the contrary.
---
Nowhere am I justifying to give priority to meme specs if there's still people that can use it, except for the case of Hand of Rag where it's effectively BiS for ret pallies and enh shamans, and should get priority over it; warriors have much better options.
---
It's likely that Horde is going to have long, long queues. People interested in getting maximum honor possible will probably still be in their gank squads.
---
The main problem with Alliance is a majority of max level players sit in IF. Hell I'm only lvl 50 and engage in WPVP as much as possible and look forward to raiding Xroads among other horde towns and cities but jesus they complain when they could just make it fun and join the fight.
---
Horde bad.
---
I didn‚Äôt say they WOULD do it. Just that they could.
---
Grobbulus should be fine for you.. I just got an alt to level 40 and didn't have many issues at all other than a few random one-offs you'll get on any server like a sad level 60 Rogue who came to Lakeshire and killed people for an hour or so.  STV was even not as bad as I would have expected so far.
---
On horde at least 2H fury is competitive if not better on the cleave boss fights in MC, which is essentially half of the fights which makes it a pretty compelling option. It doesn't need BRE to do this either, OEB and Spinal reaper both do very well and beat dual wield on cleave bosses.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I disagree. Ever since P2 has dropped its been nothing but a shit show trying to do things. BRM is cancerous, E/W PL is cancerous. All because 20+ try hard 60s are sitting around with their fingers up each other‚Äôs asses. And I say this as someone on a fairly balanced server (Sulfuras) who enjoys PvPing when it‚Äôs not 20v1.
---
What's it like on Heartseeker? Please send videos
---
That's weird.  I think you are overthinking it, and I think he is over-reacting.  He just has to choose not to run ubrs.  People will run dungeons for all sorts of reasons.  It's a bit of an appeal for generosity, but that's not really a bad thing.  What else are guilds for if not to play with one another?
---
Right, and this is good insight. I do try to keep this in mind, but I guess my main concern is that it could effect newer players who haven't yet made this realization.
---
Yeah, but that max speed is still really fast. Last week my guild full cleared MC without skipping any trash in like 1:45. Maybe 8 of us had Ony buff? So much of the trash is skippable that I‚Äôd be shocked if we couldn‚Äôt get 1:20.
---
yeah that goes both ways- an organized raid will DEFINITELY clear out the randoms!
---
Herb/Tailoring is a pretty good choice 
---
Truefaith and self sustain (in terms of consumable acquisition)
---
&gt;I mean when the tank's are sorted out, It's pretty much up for grabz imho.
---
This was the original comment. You agreed with it. No where does that say, "after tanks have been sorted out and after fury warriors who may be needed to OT receive theirs, its up for grabs.
---
That is my entire point, that even after tanks are sorted out, there are still specs that should get priority before the item hits "meme build" territory.
---
The biggest problem with No changes imo is something people don't tend to talk about. It gives Blizzard the biggest excuse not to do anything.
---
They can literally choose to not fix bugs or address any problems on the go because "that would go against our previous mission statement".
---
Why did everyone give Blizzard an excuse for not needing to change the game?
---
Indeed.
---
Are we talking about a 1v1 here or are you asking how to survive against pressure from a warrior?
---
Regardless, having things like engineering helps so you can nade stun into a beefy heal or buy time for another bubble. Bubble is priority #1 because it rage starves them. Pay attention to their CD's so you can time a fear. Plague + SWP is heavy pressure and they are almost guaranteed to let you freecast Mind Blast.
---
I played Alliance on one of the top servers Mal'Ganis (which was also dominated by Horde).  Vanilla WPvP wasn't as bad as Classic, but it wasn't much better.  Some zones like STV were still off limits, the imbalance still would have drove people off but it would have been a slow bleed rather than something as abrupt as what we're seeing now.
---
Faction imbalance will always be a snowballing effect until Blizzard directly intervenes at the login / creation screen.
---
Get back here and take your beatings, I hit you because I love you
---
Just make sure you don't cap energy.
---
Have a 60 of every class in pre raid bis.
---
&gt; If it takes more people to raid a city than the number we can get, we won't raid that city. When we have more people, we will raid that city.
---
So what. More than one group can raid a city at a time. 
---
&gt; Server size only affects how hard it is to get the number of people we need. It does not affect the number of people we need.
---
Again, city raids are not instanced events. They are not capped. More than one raid group can raid a city. It happens all the time. 
---
&gt; Can you understand that? It's all words under 3 syllables.
---
Oh totally. Youre a moron. I understood that from your first comment. Do you even play wow? Dude thinks city raids are capped at one group lol or require a set number of players. 
---
I raided Org last night with 17 people. I guess that was impossible considering you think you need a fixed number. Poor lil dummy.
---
Sorry I did forget to mention that I am on horde. I've heard that Windfury and spamming hamstring may be viable as well. However based on jtreezyy's comment I may switch to DW now, since it appears to be better by a longshot.
---
classic. good projecting. lmfao. beta AF.
---
My initial goal was just go clear MC, never been in a 40 man raid before because I was late to vanilla and always behind in level until I quit in Wrath. Level 51 now
---
Nah dude - Grobbulus is dead now and will be gone in a month. Would be a waste for anyone to reroll there.
---
Let's be clear here, the population of horde players griefing alliance into leaving the server have legitimate mental issues that are causing them to lash out in a video game. This is the outlet these sick people have chosen.
---
I've been reading up on Alterac Valley reputation and trying to figure out how long it's going to take me to reach exalted for that sweet sweet Lei of the Lifegiver...
---
I know there are different approaches that probably change how much rep you grind per run...so I'll frame the question this way:
---
1. What is the estimated rep earned from a zerg run?
---
2. What is the estimated rep earned from an extended battle? (e.g. 2-3 hours)
---
They're going to go down tomorrow onwards probably though, so I'd sell now..
---
I‚Äôd like to see it through up through Naxx.  If I remember correctly, Razorgore destroyed my guild, then princess in AQ destroyed my next one.  Then the broken promises of Vanguard: saga of heroes ripped me away at some point.  I‚Äôd love to see classic from start to finish.
---
Yes, it is definitely possible to skip ranks after rank 4.
---
Anyone who is in bracket 1 every week will skip ranks 1-3, 5, and 7.
---
It is possible to skip other ranks too depending on your current RP and RP gain after decay. After rank 3, it is a consistent 5k RP between each rank. It just becomes increasingly difficult due to the fact that decay is % based so the higher current RP you have, the more decay you will have. I believe it works out to be mathematically impossible after rank 9 though.
---
How does one wPvP on a PvE server? My understanding was you just straight up couldn't hit the opposite faction out in the world. Can you still attack people in neutral zones?
---
There are 2: [wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/) and [ironforge.pro](https://ironforge.pro/).
---
man if only every single class had the ability to stealth....
---
isn't it possible the guy is in ironforge now because there's no other place to find ally on the server?
---
Rolling late on a ganking server, like you did, is a mistake.
---
Reroll on a normal server and type /pvp when you want to world PvP.
---
‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt Alliance be NPC‚Äôs for us???‚Äù
---
Im apart of grob, but honestly yeah my point has been proven alliance players complain too much, you got your transfer, just play the game! TBH it isn‚Äôt the horde‚Äôs fault for the alliance leaving, its the alliance‚Äôs fault for calling it quits when the odds are impossible against them. Do you know what Orc rogues do on Grob? They camp the IF port room and inn. Do you know what horde does out in thorium point? camp bodies flightmasters and spirit healers. While I can‚Äôt say the horde actually getting into IF with ease is bullshit, I think a majority of alliance players complain too much lol coming from someone that switched from horde to alliance.
---
We could fix all these imbalance problems by 'resurrecting' the forsaken.
---
Seriously, I was soloing the Elite Dwarves in front of Uldaman last night and this friendly Troll Shaman (probably 60) helped me out.
---
PvE was definitely the right call for me since I don't enjoy ganking people anyways.  If I want WPvP all I have to do is go to Hillsbrad and flag for PvP.
---
I have been lucky. I finally found a gamer tag I really like and it's my third one since I started gaming online in 2006. Every new game I join. Whether I'm late or whatever it's never taken.
---
&gt;So. The "Risk" of one of these dropping during a full run, is roughly 30% ( give or take).
---
Ehm, no.
---
The behavior of the npcs in the game acts completely against that quest's text.
---
There are many quests in several zones that directly tell you to engage against the opposite faction.
---
Try harder.
---
That's RNG - happens sometimes.
---
Not only that. Horde can hop continents without flagging up, alliance has to either use a portal to ~~Africa~~Darnassus or go through a contested zone.
---
1200 stacks. For alliance its 122.1k total turn ins.
---
Lol negative 19 for pointing out people made decisions in a game and then blamed blizz
---
thanks man appreciate this
---
But they did.
---
Mmm, you have plenty of mana and sometimes need to have higher output.
---
Orc &gt; Tauren Shaman.
---
I do this in combo with not fighting back at all when I'm at a clear disadvantage. Part of their fun is watching people squirm, but I will just stand there and perform no action other than spitting on them. So far it's working pretty well, allies don't seem all that interested!
---
OTs are tanks, like what the fuck
---
Not sure if you're being purposefully dense for the sake of arguing.
---
A guild that manages to get 5 TF understands that more fights down the line require more than just 2-3 tanks and would therefore still give their bindings to warriors.
---
You saying that says you sit by and let it happen. It is your own community on that server. Either try to fix it or quit.  No one with a stable server should have to suffer shared bg ques with a server your faction ruined.  If you do not like it then reroll or quit like everyone else has.
---
He wants to think that this behavior doesn't make you a game ruining shitcunt. Because he doesn't want to think he's a skilless game ruining shitcunt. You're not going to break through that cognitive dissonance any time soon. I applaud the attempt though.
---
Yep!  Totally crazy they didn't envison at least ~5k portugeuse / spanish speaking players and give them their own server.  There is still friction on Thalnos given the language barrier but at this point I don't see why people get upset- you've had a lot of chances to go somewhere else if you want.  It's an unfortunate reality.
---
122.1k total turn ins for alliance. Who has 122.1k inventory slots?
---
You disagree with what? Lol.
---
1.) It is conjecture, until you pull some sources out of your ass.
---
2.) We did it then (we is collectively as the people doing it now that was around then, I linked my armory showing I was someone that went after Rank before, not doing this go around, but I at least understand the mindset)
---
3.) We all knew - I guess you could argue this but I did add that anyone who didn't was thinking about the game with rose colored glasses.
---
for #3 - maybe you played on a partial bluebie server that didn't go hard. Servers like Tichondrius and KT went hard. And it was like this.

Bgs will actually be cross realm and since the overall population is pretty much 50/50 queues won't be too long for either faction
---
Sorry man, I'm the semi-afk rogue at the end (Fuktigafrank) &lt;3
---
Depends on what Legion patch you're talking about. When they first added scanning, they broke regular tabbing in a lot of ways, but they sorted it out eventually. Long before Classic got forked.
---
Not sure why OP needs the data exactly, but getting boosted by a P1 bis tank seems out of the confines of worst group -&gt; good aoe group.
---
thank you based OP
---
Spell damage as a stat didn't exist. It had nothing to do with MC gear aside from being included in "all gear".
---
Ya, I think I'm going to unsub. Loving classic, hating this forum.
---
Yes you need the exalted reputation as it required the riding. In vanilla pre riding changes you did not need the skill for the pvp mounts. The mount was the cheap part and the riding was the expensive part, but the pvp mounts didnt require riding skill. Then once they made the mount the expensive part they required the pvp mounts to take riding skill.  
---
When they changed the riding if you already had the mount they just grandfathered you in to have the skills iirc.
---
We can all nitpick which server is worse, and everyone will say theirs is the worst and that is so far from the point
---
It's not like I expect him to lay down on the floor and AFK, I just want to fight him 1v1 and i'm confident af because ive fought him 5x a day everyday since p2. not that hard to blastwave sapper ae down his multibox comp as a mage.
---
Do you just walk around huffing your own farts by linking to old threads you made?
---
lmao no horde sit in TB anyways theres bound to be more people in darnasus that thunder bluff lololol
---
If you think things like stoneform/escape artist are on par with hardiness you are in your own bubble of denial.
---
To be clear, again. Stoneform is really good, escape artist is situationally really good. Hardiness is both stupid good and more applicable to more situations. It has no cooldown (internal or external) it's 100% passive, and it makes you 6 times better at resisting stuns than other races. (base is 5% it add 25% for a total of 30%). You just don't notice it because it's passive power. With escape artist/fear ward/stoneform you push a button, see a thing, and think "wow that is great". With hardiness you don't do anything and don't see anything, but the people fighting against you see that "resist" on their Stun and know that is when they lost the fight. Not becuase you saved a CD and used it correctly, not because they made a mistake and didn't recover. Simply because you picked Orc at character creation.
---
The ability is so broken it was consistently nerfed and changed to where it is just a duration reduction on live, and it is **still** considered to be a really really good PvP racial.
---
A lot of enchanters trying to lvl their skill will give out decent enchants for free/very cheap . Keep an eye out in major cities. I wouldn‚Äôt pay much for enchants until you have you BiS, or pre BiS at least
---
&gt; Horde players on flamelash no-lifed the game so hard and camped / ganked alliance players so bad in their desperate attempt to ~~rank up the fastest for PvP gear~~ take out their crippling mental disorders on someone the alliance all transferred off the servers.
---
FTFY
---
Twisting Nether-EU. Played there TBC/WotLK, it was something like 95-99% Horde.
---
It's Blizz fault in the end.
---
You hurt my hand!
---
Mal‚Äôganis Horde here! Represent! Though not that far back. 
---
Yeah I get that. STV, Hillsbrad being off limits? Expected. Encouraged. Cool as fuck tbh. I like the feel of danger zones.
---
But when I land my level 35 Alt in DESOLACE and immediately die and can‚Äôt spirit rea because the GY is camped, too? That‚Äôs not normal shit. In vanilla I NEVER ONCE saw a GY camped. Letting people eat a spirit rez and hearth was not only the last shred of human decency, but a bigger and better victory than frustrating them off the game, imho.
---
What do you think is wrong? Probability doesn't guarantee a drop, but the chances of this happening are about 1.3 in a thousand, and it's perfectly reasonable, and generally human nature, to complain about getting the short end of the RNG stick.
---
Nobody has said horde is hard mode, show me one who has been saying that. Just tired of alliance screaming about being gimped when you're not. If you really wanted to min/max for PvP you'd go alliance, just due to how much better paladins are in organized PvP, that'll become obvious in a few weeks(And cleanse&gt;Purge as a support role). BoPing mages should win you every BRM fight, but that requires your lolrets to start thinking.  
---
So you're losing to people who min/maxed when you didn't? That's on you, there's no reason why you can't min/max on alliance side.
---
Nope, you're wrong. Period. End of story. Since you don't have any sources, and I do, it looks like what I said is right, and what you said is what you're hoping reality will be.
---
Have a nice day.
---
You should be saving 350 for your dreadsteed first. Then be prioritizing end game gear. I,E: Chants,Crafts.
---
Chances are this guy still is young, so the rest of that diatribe, while funny, is mostly irrelevant. Either he will grow out of it or he won't and prob turn out as you describe.
---
Amazing that you don't.
---
What they really need to do is allow ghosts to run to dungeons and resurrect via dungeon instance instead of having to go through the brutal corpse camping.
---
You do need the lv40 riding skill, but getting to rank 11 without an epic mount is going to be much slower and more miserable than getting the av one
---
That works in retail but I didn't think it worked in Classic. I'll have to try again when I get home, but you might have an add-on doing that for you.
---
Every fury warrior is always considered an OT? First time ive ever seen this opinion.
---
Battlegrounds come out tomorrow, you will absolutely get to use them on other players no matter which realm you are on.
---
This is basically how things went. If you want a real world allegory from it, it‚Äôs more similar to large scale corporate farming creating the dust bowl in the American Southwest when they took over land after a century of sustainable and profitable family farming.

LOL, good lord

&gt; My guild has extremely active PvPers that barely raid and are mostly out in the open world hunting Horde.
---
I mean nothing against PvE Servers and all that, but this just sounds idiotic. What exactly is the plan here, run circles around him until he flags himself?
---
We had the weird stuff on raggy. Our logger was usually a priest tankhealing in 1 side of the room. I was on the opposite side raidhealing (hereunder melee). I had a bunch of mages and locks close to me, which it never recorded any healing onto. It did record the healing i put on the melee, but never the ranged standing next to me. Healing on onyxia has always been abysmal, so I havent really looked at those logs at all.
---
You seem real quick to delete your comments that get downvoted because you look dumb.
---
Typical beta behavior
---
Thanks for ur input
---
They obviously know they're too shit to win in those scenarios.
---
Speaking as horde, almost all communiation in world/lfg is english.  There are a few large BR guilds.  As a tank running dungeons often occasionally there will be a language barrier but usually you can keep things simple.  "Sheep moon" is one type of phrase that's pretty commonly understood.  The in-game emote system can be used handily too as that translates between the english / BR client.  A quick /flee, /charge, /healme can work wonders sometimes.
---
I don't know the exact values, but Horde will probably get more rep/hr for extended battles due to queue times being longer. The first few days will probably be extended battles due to people focusing on quests and turn-ins.
---
From my experience his comment is very off base. The best overall MC dps parse has been warriors with 2h fury for a while. And a warrior with a 2 hander from MC almost always beats a warrior with pre raid weapons dual wielding, so if going 2h gets you a weapon faster it very well may be worth it. 
---
In my guild (far from hardcore, we clear MC in about 1.5 hrs), the best overall warrior uses a pre raid 2 hander and beats our warrior with Deathbringer. 
---
If you like 2 hand and think you can get a weapon much easier that way, there is tons of data out there showing that it competes at all skill and tryhard levels and even comes out on top in the best guilds in at least a lot of fights.
---
What is world pvp, really? Is it honorably fighting every red nameplate you see? Is it deathballing around BRM? Is it corpse camping a lowbie? Is it griefing people on ridiculously designed escort quests? Is is just kinda ass?
---
They are horde friendly mobs if memory serves. Killing them should flag you.
---
Every warrior in raids should be ready to off tank whatever, yes, it isn't outlandish.
---
Unrelated to WoW (sometimes): I‚Äôve always thought the same thing about being called a ‚Äútry hard‚Äù. I *am* trying. Hard. 
---
Should I be lazy just because someone else is being lazy to be cool?
---
It‚Äôd be like someone trying to talk shit by calling me educated. Or having a job or owning a house. I don‚Äôt see the put down there...
---
Most guilds don't really care about getting world-record MC clear speeds. I'm playing to bask in nostalgia and the content is too easy to care about min/maxing to the point of determining which characters people must create.
---
The mace drops from Emperor Dagran Thaurissan. General Angerforge drops Hand of Justice.
---
Which is funny, because as anyone on Herod can tell you, Alliance control Blackrock Mountain and Dire Maul regularly.
---
Well... yeah.  It's very clear what you're trying to do and they can tell you haven't released.  I still feel your pain, corpse camping is low.
---
yes, the addon actually just right-clicks every item, so if your bank tab is open the set gets deposited from your bag instead of equipped
---
Your talking about the alliance right? For repeatedly flagging so  can get camped in an alliance zone?
---
I‚Äôve seen it closer to 1/10. If you have decent gear, you can 2 man it with a healer friend. Our main tank is going fury prot and needed it for his threat set. He would pass on all items (we were only doing arena, so not too many), do 5 resets, log out right outside the instance entrance, and come back an hour later. We would play alts while we wait. Might not be your cup of tea but we got it eventuslly
---
8/8 T1 is terrible
---
Blizzard let them kill each other for honor :p
---
Old Blanchy seems solid to me as a horde on it. I see plenty of alliance.
---
Ah fuck you're right.
---
Its is a good aoe group. 1 mil xp/hour is a lot.
---
You can't. The tranfers were closed a few days ago.
---
GRATS!
---
Found the source thread. 
---
This reddit post increased the traffic on that WoW forum post by 500%. I love you guys.
---
Blizzard should offer $1 faction swaps and server transfers. Also post number of players per server with an accurate census and let the issue resolve itself.
---
There were over 150 hordes waiting at the entrance to the burning steppes this week. We were with our full 40man raid. We crawled up with AoE spam with our locks and mages, once we came close to the doors over 30 mages and sappers jumped on us with the rest following suit. 
---
The week before we went with 40 from thorium point, we were greeted with the same amount of players and the same idea.
---
There is no 'preparing' for that.
---
&gt; If you dont sprint the whole marathon, it will take longer.
---
And if you sprint the whole time, but kill your horse on lap 5, you will never finish.
---
&gt;Answer me this, if I wanted to get rank14 in 12 weeks on Flamelash horde, how do I do it?
---
In 12 weeks? You don't. Sorry Charlie, sometimes things just aren't possible.
---
* If you try to do it in 12 weeks, you kill your sever and will never get it.
---
* If you instead be patient and say "I'll try to get it in 24 weeks" you could maybe have achieved that.
---
Again you reap what you sow. And these players in their shortsighted bloodlust have killed their horse, and now can't finish the race, and they have no one to blame but themselves.
---
Their crocodile tears are:
---
&gt; WAAAHHH Alliance got sick of not playing and actually just stopped playing! Why won't they let me push their shit in? Can't they think about **ME** for a second and my *RANK*? WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I don't think you can, free transfers were closed on the 5th.
---
Oh, for sure its not going to be complete. Was actually happy to see it and just hoping I could find my old guild on it. Thanks for sharing the link.
---
If I were you I would open a ticket and see if a GM will help you switch your quest reward. I would explain that you misclicked and meant to choose a different one. They may say no, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask. In the past they would help people out with stuff like this.
---
love the enthusiasm hahaha to each his own!
---
Half the people who have posted didn‚Äôt even read the question fully. 
---
MT should have gear priority and he will Typically  take the most damage and needs to have the best gear. As you enter into BWL with your raid and the MT and OT are similarly geared, this becomes a slightly less of a big issue. 
---
The set bonuses on T2 are not amazing for warrior tanks, so spreading out the loot and allowing the MT/OT to discuss who gets it is important. Big upgrades like NeF head and shield/weep should go to MT first unless you were lucky enough to get a Thunderfury! 
---
Overall, let you MT and OT figure out what they need and who deserves what, if they don‚Äôt have a good working relationship, then things won‚Äôt go well for the guild overall. It‚Äôs important to have that relationship established early.
---
There are some posts here that are confusing.
---
I grinded to Rank 11 in Vanilla. I bought both the epic cat and the epic horse (I am human) because I needed to be exalted with Darnassus to buy the ~~Tiger~~ Nightsaber riding skill.
---
Mounts were 90g (I think, definitely sub 100).
---
So YES. To ride another faction's mount you have to be exalted.  You can still buy them all, so if you derank, you still have the cat banked. You won't be able to go back and buy it if you derank. But you can ride it any time after you purchased it.
---
I mean, pretty sure that Mufasa chased the Hyenas off his land. There's basically no way to sustain both the Lions and Hyenas no matter how well you manage.
---
I was HOTW/NS starting around level 50 (I finished resto talents on the way to 60) and it was no problem at all, provided you have gear. 
---
You want to maximize your 5SR ticks, and given that oyu have relatively low +heal, +spi you generally want to heal the target close to full, then wait a bit for 5sr, then heal it close to full again.  You might find rank 8 or 9 is a good fit to keep them relatively safe so they don't get too low hp, and you don't risk overhealing too much. 
---
Avoid regrowth as best you can. 
---
Aggressively innervate yourself if you see a pull going bad.  
---
You'll be fine tho, I have close to 300 +heal and tons of int/spi now at 60 and I haven't mad a specific effort to farm any heal gear, just to do a ton of dungeons with guildies so that I can take any extra heal gear that drops that the actual healer doesn't need.

I have 7/8 lightforge Kindof just collecting havnt see the chest drop once
---
I got approx 1:115, how did you get 1.3:1000?
---
Again I'm not arguing the scale between the two is similar, I'm just saying that the underlying causes for faction imbalance were always there and having to choose been a flesh wound vs a gushing one doesn't make me feel good either way.  The flesh wound is what led us to one sided servers and then War Mode on retail after all.
---
An alliance that‚Äôs higher level than you flags, issues a duel challenge in an attempt to trick you into flagging, then spams /chicken when it doesn‚Äôt work. Or they flag and stand on top of mobs you‚Äôre trying to kill haha
---
Wait are you joking right now? No, they absolutely do. You need full world buffs and consumes for it to happen, but it's easily doable. They do competitive DPS, but not with warriors who know what they're doing.
---
Edit: Also warriors never beat a mage with rolling ignite.
---
If Blizzard tried to "fix Classic" the #NoChanges crowd would lose their collective shit.
---
There was no balance originally and now there's even less.
---
The Horde have demonstrated they won't leave and honestly, even if they did want to theres nowhere to to go besides Heartseeker and Arcanite Reaper if we're talling Alliance heavy PvP realms. A coordinated Horde transfer would blow up those realms ratios with mininal impact  to a megaserver.
---
Its unfixable now. The options are to let people transfer off PvP realms entirely or watch the game wither.
---
How is griefing players a part of the game?
---
Would you play if you got camped? Ofc not. Why would you expect someone else to do it?
---
its the default font for MSBT
---
Jesus christ how delusional do you have to be. So players on these specific servers should just not try to farm honor for the cutthroat rank grind in order to not grief the alliance too much? Again the problem was having 10k instead of 3k on a server, and blizzard doing next to nothing to make sure the faction balances early on did not get to these levels. Blaming the horde for playing the game is so fucking funny in these thread.
---
one other trick you can do - one of the crystal thingies in un‚Äôgoro crater gives you a thorns buff that can help a little, if you don‚Äôt mind farming those once in a while.
---
yeah, after the X it will devolve a little, but usually it matters less then since you have had a little more time to build threat by then, you have fewer mobs to juggle, and the fight is almost over anyway.
---
it‚Äôs not easy, though - tanking is just whatever you can do to try to control the chaos. but i think that makes it fun.
---
I have 100% haste uptime in every boss in MC and on Ony P1 and P3.

MCP is my weapon and it‚Äôs forever bis. Any feral who can‚Äôt be bothered to farm them should roll a less demanding class.

so because the story is based on a different game " WITH THE SAME STORY"
---
there shouldnt be PVP in this game? im not quite sure what the fuck youre talking about. your logic has no fulcrum at all. 
---
all you did was breakdown what an RTS is for some reason like we are talking about Warcraft3, what does any of this have to do with "not entering capital cities in a game based around a world of war."
---
Money isn't the problem.  Money itself simply represents a system of lawful distribution based on input value and not "the power or right to otherwise take it outside of consentual transactions." 
---
The primary reason we have starving people is because systems of money, E.G., where trade and access are respected outside of mere political authority and corruption, are constantly under attack by war, corruption, and other power interests.  
---
The advance of "money" is what's lowered starvation and poverty drastically in the post cold war "pax Americana" era.

Okay. Your response is indeed a perfect example of a straw man.

&gt;Who is this real life person who advocated for #nochanges, but was vehemently against the concept of progressive patches? Who is this real-life person who advocated for #nochanges that specifically wanted everything to be exactly how it is in-game now?

Please point out where I made claims of either person existing in my original post. I didn't. You are making a straw man.

I appreciate the detailed info Mind-Game. I will do some more research and consider all view points. 2H Fury seems to be the place for me once I can get a Raid Weapon (Currently using Dreadforge Retaliator).

If you wanna get really min-maxy, it's actually high roll on a world drop that is bis. I am wearing a +37 shadow wrath head piece on my warlock. If I am remembering right, max roll is either 40 or 41 on 59/60 req greens.

I went out of my way to kill dustdevils when I was leveling through westfall, they drop magic dust which is valuable for PvP and they go for 3-5g on most realms, got 7 of them while leveling through westfall, but probably spent an extra hour in the zone.

Welcome to reddit, where the grammar nazis read your punctuation and not your comment, to score points in a game they made up
---
OK, well let us know when an MMORPG starts having predetermined tech trees and player characters of equal level &amp; class all have equal HP/mana/stats and PVP always occurs in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. Because that's when we'll expect WoW to be = to WC3.
---
WoW launched with 5mans and raids aka organized PVE. It did not launch with BG's or Arenas aka organized PVP. That alone should tell you what Blizzard envisioned the game to be as they were designing it. PVP was always the side dish to the PVE main entree.

AQ40 full clear is my goal. By the time Naxx rolls around, there‚Äôs gonna be too many raids unless MC/Ony gets dropped or my guild gets gud

I'd like to clear all PVE content as a fury or prot warrior, and perhaps rank 10 on my ret Paladin. Would love to clear TBC as well someday, let's hope that happens. I got to rank 8 / ZG in vanilla, rerolled a bit late so couldn't make it much further!
---
It's more that warriors have better options as far as 2h DPS goes anyways. OEB and probably BRE parse better than HoR for warriors.
---
The bankers are civilians, no honor farmer is killing them. Attacking auctioneers spawns unlimited guards. And five  lvl 55 elites patrol that area. You're just making shit up now.

Flamelash was a 60/40 server when alliance left, Ironforge didn't get fucked up until they did. It was their own faction that brought the Ironforge problem onto alliance.

You can dps endgame dungeons just fine as arms. In fact, it's probably superior due to sweeping strikes. Stay arms until you're entering molten core.
---
8.7 in a thousand, by my calculations.
---
I'm alliance, so there aren't any shammies who can use it and when it comes to Ret pallies in raids, there are rarely more than 1. While it's not the best weapon for warriors, any warrior who does not have BRE (and since we aren't in BWL yet) can still benefit from HoR. For at least this tier and progression into BWL.

Combat daggers is worse for PvE. How much worse depends on your gear and how well you handle your rotation.  On this content, the difference can be close to irrelevant if you know what you are doing. 
---
Hemo spec with swords is also good for PvP, it just operates differently.
---
My favorite thing to do is logoff and login right before I resurrect, so I get a fresh 'honorless target' buff for 30 seconds. They don't have the patience to look because their precious honorspy can alert at any time.
---
Once I attempted this trick on a rogue, I immediately on top of him after reconnecting, they did a ton of burst damage to me and then realized I had the buff. They then attempted to stun/slow lock me until the buff ended. He missed once and I managed to cast Hellfire. The self inflicted fire damage ate up the rest of my HP, killing me, but I denied this guy honor for a second time, so I see it as a win.
---
Look up arcane frost build, it's the highest dps for us through BWL for raiding and can be fun for pvp, it's not as impactful as pom/pyro or as safe as deep frost, but its worth trying. I respec weekly it's good to mess around and learn your class.
---
If you can even get that to cast ;)
---
They've been doing this shit since like 2004, they will never stop them.
---
If you flipped a coin 10 times what is your best guess for the out come. 50/50 or 5 of each. Same with loot from different bosses. 
---
Loot from the same boss is different or the odds of two independent events happening in a row.
---
There is no guarantee for an independent event as no event changes the odds of future events. Not seeing either was very unlikely in that many runs.
---
This picture is classic

I had so much fun prior to P2. Never played this much in like 5-6 years.

Thanks.  I‚Äôll stick with the 60 stacks of thorium and 30 stacks of arthas‚Äô tears that I have already then.

1.3:1000 would be the probability of getting both to drop in your first run.

Which would make it one of the more balanced pvp servers. smh
---
Herod has some old PvPers from Shattered Hand. I know the Server First Grand Marshal is over there and so is one of the Major Horde Raiding Guilds from Vanilla but switching to alliance. I wouldn't be surprised that they are holding down the fort. Go Shattered Hand!
---
Melee running out **at all** for WoR is pointless unless your MT is lowest 3 GUID, in which case another tank should be MTing Rag anyways.  Running out at that point you're just forcing your tank to get punted for no reason and also slowing down the fight too much to kill him before submerge.

LOL
---
Yes.. yes it does. It's a video game not plowing bodies into a furnace at auschwitz. Blizzard is at fault for their decisions on layering and server sizes, as well as handling pre and post launch faction balance as servers were filling up. The players will play the game and interact with the systems to the extent they want to. You guys really like to absolve the blizzard fucking up here aspect just to get your hatred out on somebody who corpse camped you one to many times. The amount of people crying about mean people and accusing them of mental disorder is hilarious.
---
Oh, orc, you forgot the orc - 25% chance to resist any stun.
---
He has world buffs just buffs that you got before the fight starts dont always show up.
---
I have 1100 dps on a 1 min long kill.
---
Its just using bt and ww on cd , keeping HS queued and using death wish /reck/mighty rage pot at the right time.

Also proper armor debuffs on the boss.

It has to be consensual, both parties enabling pvp.

I murdered that dwarf 73 times, 4 drops lost the first 3 rolls.

Paid server transfers were introduced late in Vanilla, but it was still Vanilla. Hard to imagine Blizzard turning down the opportunity to make a bunch of money just by flipping the switch.
---
I do not get the math here, 5 runs at 4g for cathedral and you get 20g? Never done a boost run, do you offer it to 4 people and they all pay?
---
lol get fucked horde!
---
Lol masterlooter
---
Sexymap i think
---
No... it didn't? It was still just making comparisons and I'm still convinced you haven't engaged actively in retail in ages considering you said '15 extra' when people are pugging heroics with 30 and mythic is only 20 which is a pretty 'hmmm' moment. Also the fact that you think there is even the slightest difficulty getting people into discord when there is a literal option to show 'voice required' on PGF groups. Also hinging on things like 'months of gear' when pugs are at their peak in the beginning not later.
---
Funny, I feel like I saw someone else earlier doing the whole 'I know what I'm talking about but won't actually say anything' argument earlier. Pretty convenient.
---
Again, Im not playing on Flamelash, but your argument is dumb. There will be plenty of rank14 hordes on many servers come the 13th week, and some of these servers will die, and others wont. But blaming the PLAYER for playing the game is stupid. How do you not see that?
---
Your horse analogy makes no sense at all, stop. And if bgs were out earlier this would also most likely have prevented server deaths, or lets see. If blizzard would not let people transfer of the servers from the less popular faction would also prevent server death. If the honor system was released with the game, together with bgs, this would also prevent this whole thing. I seems so weird to me that you wanna control how people wanna play the game, so that you can play the game how you wanna play it.
---
The biggest problem facing PvP servers: overpopulation.
---
The world was not designed to support this many turbonerds. It's a Malthusian trap.
---
2nd problem would be how ass the honor system is.
---
Yo whatup man! Yes it is. I‚Äôm an orc warlock on Mankrik these days, how about you?
---
Faction imbalance doesn't go away when you pretend it doesn't exist.
---
Also, when players are spread out in the world there will still be more players from the bigger factiin in a zone on an average basis (especially if it involves endgame content). That's literally how ratios work. *It absolutely does matter.*
---
Alliance ran into an Alliance dominated server to avoid Horde dominated servers? No shit
---
At the time the only options to transfer to was a medium/high pop alliance favored realm or a low pop realm. I didn't transfer but can't blame anyone for choosing where they went. I wish I did. Being outnumbered 3-1 isn't fun
---
Yeah you get 4 people all paying. The xp is split based on average level, so having 4 lowbies is best
---
I think theres a glove enchant with agi maybe from AQ. I remember having an agility enchant from AQ back in vanilla.
---
Distracting shot, scorpid sting to name a few
---
I'm not absolving Blizzard. I literally just said the system is bad.
---
They made the awful decision to put the game in your hands and you wiped your ass with it.  Now you're blaming Blizzard for your decision. 
---
I hope Classic becomes nothing but Horde players. You and Blizzard deserve each other.
---
It's blizz's fault, they opened up realm transfers to already skewed realms because some casuals didnt want to leave behind their lvl 14 hunters to get away from queue
---
Sit on your molding throne and gaze upon your kingdom of ash
---
You snoozed and loozed
---
All this over complicated advice. Have your raid pop a LIP when she lands, except the tank. Have the tank use recklessness and death wish (if fury). Job done.
---
So the imbalance is actually far worse.

---
I promise u all major alliance guilds on Shazzrah will migrate the second we have the chance. And then you will see. And i know this for a fact.
---
Alliance Shazzrah is borderline unplayable.
---
I mean what s the point of having PvP servers at all if the losing side is just gonna quit or transfer away...seems like they should just bite the bullet and fix the problem with the open PvP like theu did in retail. The argument can be made that it didn't exist is vanilla but that same argument applies to free transfers. Just because you lose. They should just make warmode for classic and do away with server types all together at this point
---
&gt; How does one wPvP on a PvE server? My understanding was you just straight up couldn't hit the opposite faction out in the world. Can you still attack people in neutral zones?
---
Either start up a raid against TM/SS, astranaar/crossroads sun rock retreat, and chances are people will come and word spreads that 'hey guys, there's this really fun wpvp happening at &lt;zone X&gt;" If people are interested they'll come. if not, they won't. WPVP on PvE servers is basically like a pseudo-battlegrounds, with none of the being camped til you log for the day because you can't quest.
---
Never said there shouldn't be PVP. I said no one should go into the game expecting PVP to be what Blizz balances the game or their server status on. Because ultimately it's a sideshow freak attraction for ADHD kiddos to get their jollies off on outnumbered ganking, because they aren't good enough to play games that offer actual balanced PVP. Ie SC2, WC3/Reforged, DotA2, etc.
---
I think that was my problem. I relied on Regrowth like a crutch in BRD runs. Focusing more on Healing Touch is going to make a huge difference.
---
...playing the game?
---
Deathmatch is only fun if everyone starts with the same gear.
---
It would have been fine if they never opened server transfers to the lvl 14 casuals that didnt want to reroll to get away from queues
---
Flametrash was just full of bad allies who don‚Äôt know how to pvp and found it better to cry and leave than learn to play.
---
I downloaded the version labelled -classic.   But seems that was wrong.  From curseforge I downloaded the version linked on the right side midwayish down the page, that one under classic worked. Think it was 4.2.1
---
This feels wrong as I usually grab her going into P3 without having put more than a few sunders into here during P2.
---
You‚Äôll never have the same spec for raids and PvP using either daggers or swords.
---
I don‚Äôt think that has anything to do with ‚Äúinternet culture‚Äù. What you‚Äôre describing and the chain of current events that‚Äôs happening in Classic is following the exact same trend as it did in vanilla. 
---
Pre-honor wPvP was for fun
---
Post-honor wPvP was a meat grinder where towns and detain zones (Ashenvale, Hillsbrad, STV) were in a constant state of war
---
Battlegrounds will largely kill the meat grinder as everyone jumps into BGs to farm honor
---
? Hand of Rag is actually good for feral druids. It has 30 fire resist which is really damn good, especially since I can't think of any other weapons with fire Res. This is a bis tanking item for feral druids in MC/BWL.
---
I had a 62 healing head piece and couldn't get anyone to buy it for 20g :/ just gave it to a guildy.
---
I think that‚Äôs the point: you can fill it however your existing biases prefer.
---
T1 can heal quite a bit if you are willing to farm MCP, at least at private server proc rates it could keep up with healers, not sure if it has been tested yet for classic.
---
I‚Äôm playing an undead rogue still on Atiesh named Birdy, dealing with this win trading firsthand. Dreamwalker and a few others are with me

---
Yes. Which is why i said Ironforge.pro was garbage in the first place...
---
I think you're both taking this too seriously.
---
Um....u dont ot? Im doing 400ish dps and i‚Äôm very close to ot looking at threat meter....and i have ony buff, mongoose, juju power, elemental sharpening stone on off hand, wf mh from our shaman.
---
Really depends. Killing a "lowbie" lvl 55+ Sgt gives \~200+ honor.
---
That takes a raid geared rogue what, &lt;10s? Seems pretty efficient honor grind to me while you wait for BGs to pop.
---
Sounds like care bears who thought they were hard ruined this realm
---
You opt-in, by having to manually flag yourself for PvP, instead of always automatically being flagged.
---
You can only attack other people who have also opted in. 
---
You can also opt back out (but you have to wait out a 5 minute timer of not engaging anyone in PvP combat).
---
I think you also get automatically flagged if you enter territory owned by the opposing faction... or it might just be capital cities. Can't remember.
---
I mean, its whatever faction has the higher population of jerks.  
---
Its not faction imbalance.  
---
Its not horde, or alliance exclusive.  
---
Its not PVP server exclusive.  
---
Its a morality imbalance, either you have a large group of people who dedicate the vast majority of their playtime to making the game less enjoyable for other players, with the end goal of literally removing their ability to play the game, or making them quit outright.
---
Do you do this a lot?  Come in to conversations and start talking about something different and declare yourself a winner?
---
That site's horribly inaccurate, especially the 7-day stats. Last week it was telling me my server was 96% alliance. We're solidly horde-heavy.
---
This wouldn‚Äôt surprise me in the least. I worked at a dining hall at my university for a couple years, and the amount of food people took but didn‚Äôt eat was disgusting. We composted almost all of it, but it shouldn‚Äôt be necessary.
---
Damn what how did I get wrangled into a pvp server that sounds legit
---
It boils down to queue times. 
---
In vanilla I was in the underdog faction (we were one of the few servers that had Alliance as underdogs). That means we had instant joins. 
---
I was in a premade. I'd say a very good premade, because there were at most 2 (later 1) Horde premades to which we occasionally lost. And our fights were 50min+ in WSG against those groups. 
---
One day, after seeing one of those guilds as the opponents they just stood with /salute in their flag room. They let us win. We asked them why on IRC and their answer was "We can fight you for 60min. Maybe we'll win. It's a 50:50. Or we quit, requeue, and gain way more honor in wPvP and the next group of randoms we'll farm". 
---
And that was the mentality of Allies on my server. You join a BG and as soon as it goes south you'll leave. Just wait out the deserter debuff and you'll instantly get a new BG, which will yield way more honor (potentially). 
---
Compare that to Horde players who waited 20min+ for their BG queue to pop. They could not just leave as soon as shit went south. They fought to gain that little bit of kill honor against other randoms / shit premades. Of course Hordes also quit when facing a well known premade they knew they would get 0 honor. 
---
Vanilla BG PvP always boiled down to the honor grind. How to maximize honor. 
---
If you have instant queues, you'll rather leave and hop into the next BG. 
---
If you have to wait, you'll fight until the end if you have a chance of winning / turning the BG. 
---
And that mentality changes winrates of factions.
---
It will be the same tomorrow.
---
OK, that's a good explanation.   A guy below commented "Game Changer", or something like that.
---
In what world would that possibly solve even one problem?
---
you can probably get rank 3 next week, then +1 or less per week after that
---
Difficulty getting people in voice in CLASSIC.
---
Idk what to tell you mate, if you wanna get on retail I'll link you achievements.
---
Found the alliance player
---
You're not good in the thinking department are you? I think fundamentally you just don't enjoy pvp and didn't know what signing up for a pvp server meant, which is true most of the crying in this thread. I think even if the servers we're 3000 player cap, and 50/50 faction balance you would still cry about the ranking system and getting killed at a flight path. I don't think the game is for you, I'm afraid.
---
The shorter the fight lasts, the more uptime you have on key buffs like recklessness and death wish. Only way to really parse numbers like that.
---
I know this question gets asked a lot. I don‚Äôt want to come off as whining or complaining , and I‚Äôm not here to start an argument. I‚Äôve gone through all stages of grief I just need advice. I‚Äôm a lvl 56 ally on sulfuras and I can‚Äôt quest in wintersping, epl, wpl, Felwood. Searing gorge, or anywhere atm. I‚Äôm not sure if bgs will fix this. I die in average of 10-15 times on a good day going into brm. I know I could live in instances but I feel like I‚Äôm missing so much in the game . I would love to git good but even when we hold something it‚Äôs not for long. I tried grinding in Silithus and I tried grinding naga caves but I‚Äôm a social player and it bores me to tears. Me and my levelling partner died more times than I could count in the blasted lands, winter spring and Felwood and I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I‚Äôm a dungeon healer and I feel like the skill level has shot through the roof once we got into brd . I‚Äôve already got mostly preraid bis from whatever I can get in brd. Am I ready for dire maul? I only have four more levels to go before I am 60 but at the rate I‚Äôm going it will take me two weeks. I‚Äôm being farmed and I just want some quiet zone where I can do some quests to get me out of dungeons for a little while . I‚Äôm an officer in a huge and active guild so we group up often but our numbers only hold out for so long .
---
There is no nitpicking, Flamelash is by far the worst. The picture above is based on old data.
---
It cross server queues. So it probably won't be bad times for anyone...
---
neither, but thanks for playing
---
PvP is as Pvp does
---
Lmao PvP elitism is so stupid. What happens in PvP servers, corpse camping in Iron forge, is more comparable to an adult repeatedly hitting a 5-yr old with a dodge ball.
---
They had a bigger philosophical impact, but not a bigger impact that makes MC functionality easier than it was 15 years ago.
---
And that's either someone lying, or being completely clueless.
---
It was horde favoured before, Flamelash ally transferred in, it was maybe 5% Ally favoured. Then Flamelash Horde came in and made it horde favoured again.
---
You'll note that there are two kind of servers: Normal, and PvP.
---
Guess which is the core mechanic?
---
The irony of it. All this started allegedly because "the horde are bad hurr durr".
---
Then this guys comes along:
---
&gt;I hope those assholes are stuck at the gates forever. Fuckin fuck face weenie-wackers.
---
Giving example of how "good and nice" alliance are, haha.
---
Also, 
---
&gt;When a person enjoys the rage of other's, they have really reached the lowest point of their life.
---
I'm sure that guy also qualifies, right? Hoping for people to get stuck on the game?
---
And you statement only makes sense if the rage is not self-inflicted. People raging because their own will are amusing in almost all situations. Look at this guy, so salty because he decides to hate another group of people with no reason, haha, is hilarious!
---
70% of the replies in this post is a horde player, "ohhh its not that bad". Bullshit. U try being locked up in Ironforge 30 days a month and pay a subcription for that shit.
---
&gt; I mean nothing against PvE Servers and all that, but this just sounds idiotic. What exactly is the plan here, run circles around him until he flags himself?
---
This only sounds odd because you likely havent played on one. Flag yourself on a PvE server and run around. It wont take long before you are under attack. 
---
* Overconfidence
---
* People just wanting some honor (ranking is WAY easier on PvE realms)
---
* Rogues being rogues
---
etc etc. You will constantly get attacked. And it spreads as others wander into the area. There's a significant percentage of people on PvE servers that aren't adverse to PvP, they just want to be able to take a break from it when they want. Theres a big difference between the two.
---
A big favorite of mine is to just flag and go farm the heavily contested Felcloth. A war will break out in NO time, lol.
---
Yes.  You're right.  Tears of casual alliance players who rolled on pvp servers not knowing what they were getting into.  I play on one of the most horde dominated pvp servers as alliance and do not have the problems the majority of this sub speak about.  I'm not bragging about shit.  I'm saying the people crying are casual players not willing to put in the time or effort to play on a pvp server.  Let alone a faction imbalanced pvp server.
---
&gt;especially with the new macro that allows you to cast slam without resetting your swing timer.
---
This is news to me, can you shine more light on that? 
---
And yeah, I'm a dumbass and sold my thrash blade, so right now my DW is Argent Avenger and OH Dal Rend, I've ran UBRS about 70 times now, still haven't seen MH drop so I'm taking a break from it for a bit to see something else other than Blackrock Orcs and drakes. I've been scouring the AH for a few days for Sword of Zeal, but the one time I found it for 300g, couldn't farm quick enough before it got bought out.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs awesome seeing literally the exact same emergent gameplay now with Classic as it was during vanilla, complete with the exact same complaints for the same reasons. 
---
What I find funny is the the people who think any of these issues are even remotely unique or new to WoW.
---
Oh if I trinket or FAP they're fucked
---
I suggest you join the mage discord and look in the aoe leveling channel a lot of people talk about how to zf gy
---
I don't think many would but then they'd have no right to complain. Maybe if they'd get some guilds to transfer.
---
Probably, ah well bgs are soon upon us and pvp will be fun again. Hopefully the world will be less camped and I can finally level my alt.
---
Clear naxx. It's the only one I didn't get to in vanilla. Atiesh would be awesome but chances are super slim. I guess anything can happen in a year though.
---
people who do that are fucking shitty
---
How?
---
well theres only like 5 lol so ya hes top I guess. but theres enough asmon hate that he found a niche and is exploiting it big time. This guys a one trick pony, if asmon does leave then this guys out of business.
---
Well I haven't been one of those whining, I totally understand where both sides are coming from, but world PvP in vanilla wow was always a shit fest and expecting it to not be that the second time around is just unreasonable.
---
&gt; It was NOT designed for server populations of this magnitude..
---
this is my main thing
---
the sq footage of the lvling zones didnt get any bigger
---
the amount of honor farmers went up 20 times tho...
---
That's concerning since I do prioritize raids over dungeons since its obviously better loot.
---
Kind of in a tough spot where 2H Fury is worse than Arms for dungeons, but 2H Arms is worse for Raids since Mortal Strike takes up a debuff slot, and 2H Fury isn't as good as DW Fury for raids.
---
I am on horde so hopefully it will be more viable.
---
I'm playing Horde i that server, and Alliance is atacking cities (rogues), raiding in wpvp, and control zones; it obligues us to coordinate groups in chat. It's NOT the same situation in my opinion. It seems like some of you wanna see another server dies.
---
Most pve realms are bc 70% more ally or so
---
Doesn't flamelash have their own subreddit for this spam bullshit?
---
Depends on your server I guess, but there are regularly MC pugs every single week on most servers and I've never seen an MC pug that inspects gear beforehand. A lot of them fire with less than 40 people so they'd be happy just to fill another spot.
---
Ah just read and saw you're more concerned with people not doing the content. MC will be pugged for all of classic. People have alts and everyone wants their legendaries.
---
One of the Kolkar centaur quests have an option for a stack of unique arrows but they're shit.
---
Somewhat unknown but maybe not on Reddit is that you exchange thorium bullets for thorium arrows 1:1 with an NPC.
---
ITT people that cant read graphs.
---
/party Using Innervate on %T
---
/cast Innervate
---
Nah it's fine, either join a guild that does weekly runs (2-3 hours or so), or find a weekly pug. 
---
Even with BWL/ZG/AQ, people will be doing MC so there will be no shortage of groups.
---
I'd take an art sub over people repeating the same jokes that have been slightly "tweaked" for 2 years straight. I think the bigger takeaway is that broad, large, faceless "communities" have a very high likelihood to be garbage.
---
Nicely put. It's why I avoid high end content. I'm much more enjoying the cooperation of  Classic. I chose a server with a name that I knew would attract my faction so that there would be brisk trade on the auction house. I will help any Alliance player I see and am having a lot of fun. I really feel sorry for all the people who are so dissatisfied. Human's always seem to want it all. Me...I'm happy to have 5 gold in my bags right now.
---
"THEY'RE JUST DOING IT BECAUSE HORDE DID IT FIRST"
---
You realize that nobody forces you to maximize the honor farm by any means necessary without even stopping to think 2 seconds about the players on the other side ?
---
No matter what the system  incentivize, you are the one making the conscious choice to push the limits beyond what is morally acceptable. You, not the allies, not the rewards, not Blizzard. You.
---
Edit : Are you stopping to think that you are ruining other people enjoyment and make them quit the game just to have a bigger number on your character's armor ? Where do you stop ? Where do you put the limit of what you would do for pixels ?
---
Retail PvP is better than Classic too, more balanced and interactive, more skill required to be good at retail although thats not saying much. But at least Retail works sort of like a fighting game with abilities and counters/outplays. Classic pvp was just a last minute thought with no real balance put into it. Game was obviously meant for pve originally.
---
This is why I love classic wow: juicy juicy realm drama
---
Got it on my second try! Positioning was way more important than I thought. The tip about leaving the packs once they got to Eris made the difference.
---
I mean, you can PvP on PvE realms if you decide to flag yourself for PvP and want to give someone the advantage of getting the drop on you, which, at least to me, isn't better PvP (or if you happen to walk by someone who decides to flag themselves for shits and giggles). Plus, when I used to play on a PvE server, I found people just opted out a lot of the time. I personally don't like that; no more than I like people ganking relentlessly on PvP servers.
---
I personally enjoy knowing someone can get the drop on me or me on them if we're not paying attention. It adds an element of danger to the world you don't get from PvE servers because you can just choose to eliminate that danger with flagging off.
---
You *do* realize not everyone plays at the same time or does the same things right?
---
You also realize that the census data is pretty imperfect (while there is big imbalances for sure) there is also PvP servers that are now 70/30 Alliance thanks to the free transfers...
---
So ya. Thanks for the sky is falling weather forecast, but until probably 2-3 weeks we won't know what real queues look like.
---
I feel ya with Gorosh. I've lost count of how many runs I've done without even seeing him.
---
But on 2 lines... mobile formatting won‚Äôt let me :)
---
The entire point of Classic is to preserve the latest patch of vanilla, not to emulate vanilla 100%.
---
If you want "changes and new content", go play retail.
---
Best dungeons for exp, 58-60? I did live strat the other day and seemed to get from 57.5 to 58 in 90 minutes, was blown away, all double exp btw. Anyway, last night I did a full BRD run, 2.5 hours and only seemed to get 25% of the 58 to 59 exp. Maybe it is due to first half of BRD lower level mobs giving less exp, maybe the higher geared 60 players doing live strat just cleared quicker. Is there a preference of best dungeons for gaining exp? Scholo? LBRS?

---
Aaa yeah, that's what I forgot about :/
---
What's that addon to put information on the top?
---
BASED
---
&gt; The factions aren't at war in vanilla.
---
The extent of the war in vanilla is basically hardcore border struggles, that neither side is really in position nor desire to go full war on.
---
Really boils down to the hours and days you're available on most servers.
---
How do you level bows as a non hunter.  Do you have to sit there an manually hit shoot each time??
---
You can't just wantonly boot people, unless its an extremely small number, in Classic. Or unless its early. Raidlocks aren't dynamic like in retail. If you kick 10 people before Geddon, you got issues.
---
You probably aren't 30 manning bossed in a pug and now good luck getting people to come in because you've already killed 4 bosses. Your ability to enforce discipline is reduced by this. Yes, Mythic works this way in retail but the commitment to the game by a person pugging MC is far less than that of someone doing Mythic in retail. 
---
Those same people are going to be the ones pugging BWL, AQ and Naxx. Do you think they'll suddenly get exponentially more invested in the game? 
---
As far as reputation goes, you may have a point. Depends on what population is like. I'm stuck on a megaserver right now and despite people's claims and best efforts, there's too many people to really have a reputation.
---
Except the Hand of Ragnaros Paladin who loot funnels himself and then had a video come out of him bubblehearthing away from a fight he started with a rogue. That guy has a rep.
---
&gt; Its one of the reasons why MC is so fucking easy
---
Hate to break it to you, but even on private servers with overtuned bosses and 1.2 itemization, MC still dropped in first week.
---
Benediction! Feels pretty balanced, horde probably PvP a BIT more (maybe 55/45 split?) but not much. Plus with BG‚Äôs being released, things will get better.
---
My question to you is, why would you not roll on a PvE server then?
---
It‚Äôs a pvp server. Stop blaming the Horde. We all knew even before launch that there will be imbalance.
---
Where are people geting this data? Id love to see one for my server.
---
&gt; says PvE servers go against the spirit of the game
---
&gt; Blizzard literally designates PvE servers as ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù
---
That's a way of looking at it that I didn't consider. Won't that just make city invasions worse?
---
Man, wtf is with classic right now?? While the horde shit on the game at the 60 level camping anything with a pulse, alliance are pumping out bots like there's no tomorrow the day before BGs drop. Smh... ^^^^/s ^^^^pleasedon'thurtme!
---
rank 9 healing touch is ok if you predict properly and aren't over healing too much which wastes mana. 
---
Also having some consumables like scroll or spirit and having nightfin soup/sagefish delight definitely help with mana and are relatively cheap. using these definitely makes a huge difference for quality of life
---
Except the Geneva Convention and Martial Laws, but ok
---
God i wish there were herbs for me to fight over but the farmers and farming bots clean house too much =[
---
Realistic? Sure.
---
Should you? Questionable.
---
Everytime I go to DM to farm, it's always camped by Horde. Only seen Alliance control it once.
---
My highest PVE char is 36 and the zones are all still busy. I'm still grouping and making friends everywhere. Not everyone rushed to 60.
---
Belief isn't required.
---
For combat all your procs/abilities tend to rely on your main hand (I can't think of exceptions at this moment) so a higher top-end damage is going to make the biggest difference. As soon as you get Sword Specialization (if you're speccing swords), that talent is busted and you'll want a sword MH for sure.
---
OH it really comes down to what you can get your hands on. Since stuff relies on MH typically, even sword rogues get a very good benefit from daggers in our OH for the poison applications so it's fine to use one in your OH. I'm not sure on the math to calculate out which OHs are best.
---
&gt; Spell damage as a stat didn't exist
---
Yes it did...? There were plenty of spell damage items in 1.1, just not as many as there are now.
---
Because while Blizzard made a poor system, the horde, and alliance on alliance-heavy servers that does the same, chose to use the awful system and take it to the extreme with no regards for cause and effect.
---
Literally as my comment said, "Average honor-hunter player doesn't understand simple cause and effect. It is too hard to comprehend for them."  
---
Congratulations. You just 100 % proven my point. You have no understanding of how cause and effect works. You make a choice and said choice has an effect.
---
All you are proving is that Blizzard made a mistake by giving players like you freedom. You simply can't handle it without fucking up and going "WTF BLIZZARD!"
---
I can't even walk to the AH without tripping over their lifeless bodies, oops.
---
So here‚Äôs how you fix this problem.... become a warlock.
---
Seething
---
&gt; It's like Blizzard wants classic to fail so people will go to retail. But eh it's pretty conspiracy.
---
It's why they give you a free level boost for hitting 60.
---

Back in Vanilla I had a Horde Buddy (playing Alliance).   
---
At first we fought against each other a ton of times in BGs.   
---
But we started greeting eachother and cheered and then in a very long AV we started dancing.     
---
From there on each time we saw eachother in BGs (which happend very often in vanilla) we just went to a save place and exchanged emotes for 5min straight and danced with eachother.    
---
Kinda stupid but it didn't hurt anybody since both teams basically lost a player for a while and it was a nice reoccurring event now and then within the exausting honor grind :)
---
Old Blanchy! Having a great server experience.
---
Although Arms is the best dungeon spec, whats the point of being the best dungeon spec, when you got raids to do a couple times a week. Would you respec to fury and then when you're done respec to arms? Seems like a lot of gold.
---
This has been my experience too. I think the best thing we can do as priests (I‚Äôm shadow) is to try to not be noticed in the back while we dot, heal, or mb. 1v1s we get smashed, but if they can‚Äôt reach us in the back then we‚Äôre golden.
---
Energy ticks only really matter for making sure you're not energy capped and lining up with your swing timer.
---
SS should always be used immediately after your MH swing timer so you don't reset the timer halfway through a swing.
---
&gt; Then give Forsaken undead versions of the eastern kingdom capitals and the horde get a stump version of Teldrassil. Would be a really cool 'alternate timeline' deal
---
And then the server just gets deleted then the AQ event comes up around.

I'm guessing Math isn't your strongest point I see.

Sure, maybe your math checks out forwards and backwards but what about side to side?

Lol yah kurrinax horde are a pain. leveling a 50ish paladin right now and there is no safe place to level it's painful. The booty bay boat is safer lol
---
Delorian
---
Honestly, this post isn't very deathsquad of you.
---
Imbalance is one thing. Making the game unplayable for a faction is 100% on the Horde playerbase.
---
Yeah for the first match of the day, but when your game is done, and you requeue, you get in behind everyone else.
---
Get a Minor Speed enchant on your boots, it saves so much fucking time from Lv1-40.  It's well worth the 1-3G cost
---
Hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but yeah... If memory serves only hunters get "Autoshot" which lets them AFK it.
---
For everyone else... Start tapping your Shoot button...
---
I use Mass of McGowan for my MH, its equal to the other pre-bis options (same dps as Krol), and I am human so I have the weapon skill. Got one for like 60g on my server
---
Obviously this is just "high thoughts" and will never happen - but you would replace the alliance with Forsaken. So you could still do the AQ event.
---
Yes there us a mailbox limit though. You can get to a point where you can no longer mail stuff to yourself.
---
Reading this it doesnt seem like you and me disagree at all. I hope the queues will be reasonable for horde, and that it will get better. 
---
I just wanna say, ofc it doesnt help Ally pop when horde are IF killing people, my point is just that Im not going to blame the horde players for "abusing" the system, doesnt mean I want the system to be abused.
---
It kills me you can't tab target people behind trees and mountains even though they technically are los and can shoot you through them.
---

---
I wouldn't enjoy it because its fucking boring. I'm in a decent guild and I've gone out in a PvP raid a couple times. Its fucking boring. I had way more fun fighting other Hunters over Mazthoril and the like. But I also don't give a fuck about honor because I'm not delusional enough to think I will ever get r13/r14.
---
You should also calm the fuck down because I haven't called you a sociopath or psychopath and I never made any threads of the sort. I think that's actually an asinine claim when others do make it. Acting like internet behavior is a fucking DSM IV intake is some eye-rolling normie shit.
---
Yeah and what if instead of characters you see being players blizzard just added bots until every server was 50/50. And what if it wasn‚Äôt even WoW, what if it was Star Wars instead??? Because the Star Wars lore and universe is way more interesting. And being just on PC is stupid, it should be on consoles too. And make it free. Right??
---
So....just like Vanilla then?  Mission Accomplished! ;)
---
The problem is, is your spell target always your Target? or do you have Mouseover or Cascade of targets.
---
If you always have them as targets you could do something as simple as
---
    /use Innervate
---
    /ra Attempting to Innervate %t
---
If you want to use mouseover macro
---
    /use [@mouseover,help,nodead]Innervate
---
     /run local name = UnitName("mouseover"); SendChatMessage("{daimond} "..name .. " has been innervated! {diamond}", "RAID") ;SendChatMessage("{daimond} You been innervated! {diamond}", "WHISPER", name) ;
---
The problem gets worse...
---
If you have no target, it's someone you can't help, or they are dead, the spell doesn't go off but the chat does.
---
you could try something like
---
    /stopmacro [@mouseover,noexist] [@mouseover,nohelp] [@mouseover,dead]
---
to stop the macro before the message goes out..
---
But the problem gets worse...
---
Innervate could be on cooldown, or out of range, or you could be stunned, silenced, or locked out.
---
In which case they get spammed but no innervate anyway.
---
If your using a cascade of targets, you need a script that can figure out the name of who the macro would pick as a target,
---
Then stop if it isn't going to be successful.
---
Then use the name in the raid and whisper commands.
---
Running with master looter all the time is entirely reasonable. Swapping to master looter before a specific boss is concerning.
---
&gt;lol guy prob has a neckbeard and a horde tattoo
---
A loooot of horde have unironic horde merch/tattooos.
---
As a literal carebear, from *roleplay* server land, This makes ME cringe. and I play extra-pretend.
---
That‚Äòs gonna be me tomorrow
---
It's just the enemy capitals where you're auto flagged. Although I haven't ran through any small towns so not sure about those.
---
Those are amazing.  TO THE TOP WE GO!
---
60/40 isn't balanced at all
---
People are easily killing rag in quest items with a handful of 60 dungeon blues.  Has nothing to do with min-max.  I got 3rd in dps on ragnaros with a thrash blade and we killed him before the submerge.....
---
There's no fucking way anyone would roll warlock with 1.0 balance.  Some things *had* to change.
---
Still no fun! Im on stalagg and it think its 35 or 30 ally. Lucky for us we have Grizzly who is an extremely good guild and they do fun things.
---
Write you the tank ?
---
Compared to almost every other PvP server, yes it is. If you were expecting a perfect 50/50 balance you're naive af.
---
You should still be using a GFPP before the fight starts. The buff lasts an hour and potion CD will be off before fight starts
---
&gt;But it wasn't the pve players of alliance that transfered off the server first, it was the hardcore pvp guild, Venture.
---
That's not true. At least three guilds transferred off before december 3rd (Momentum, Loot Dispute, Bear with me), and Booty transferred before Venture - at least the guild was established on Earthshaker before Venture. Venture also deciding to leave was probably the tipping point for the remaining alliance since the server then lost a huge amount of players.
---
Kurinnaax all day
---
This is it right here. 18 damage from the proc
---
There are very few PvP servers more balanced than 60/40 ... so tell me why Flamelash was so special that made it the only server where 85% of one faction left ?
---
Straight up spellpower did not exist at the start.  Phys scales on str/agil but casters don't get anything but mana and a tiny bit of crit from int.
---
Until you realize they are also doing irl stuff and chilling and their spy add-on dings them when you're ready for killing
---
It's true, I play alliance and hate gnomes haha.
---
Vurtune was soo good. I will keep getting my ass kicked as a elemental mage until one day I don‚Äôt suck. Also, one piece of raid gear might help ha
---
I played vanilla and I've literally never heard of anyone selecting a server in order to play on the less dominant side. People weren't thinking that far ahead when they created chars and they weren't rerolling to do so once they'd hit level cap. What people did do was join their friends, adding to imbalance as the only places people wanted to go was where there were more people.
---
Damn these autists are coming at you hard
---
Dw fam i thought it was funny
---
Blizzard should have had everyone leave that server and then close it down.
---
They re-itemized a lot of stuff for spellpower though.
---
Nothin beats the default set up if you ask me. Looks fantastic.
---
Hey, it's pretty fucking accurate.
---
Since November I've been playing 14~ hours per day with semi-automatic /who scans.
---
I've also enlisted a bunch of people from horde side to run the same scans, at least for Shazz the census is pretty accurate.
---
Haha really? This comment is just yikes.  Gosh I hope this raid that is SO HARD that people have to sacrifice just to bring a ret paladin over an empty slot.
---
Get off it and grow up.
---
Brilliant, better watch out, the writers might steal this!
---
&gt; This loser RPs being a fucking orc irl.
---
Actual carebear from RP server land here.
---
...Yikes. c'mon guys, we RP'ers have this concept of IC and OOC.
---
IC is for in game. OOC is yourself.
---
Don't fucking mix the two, it looks fucking terrible.
---
Garr strat is to tank all the adds and nuke Garr down.
---
Rag strat is to literally burn him before Phase 2.
---
I haven't yet killed Rag after he went into Phase 2. Not once. That is "functionally easier" due to the game being in Patch 1.12. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Its too sporadic to be worthwhile, though. Ironforge provides a grim enough picture that is harder to dismiss without looking like a fool.
---
Twitch fanbois bro, same reason that one dude Ahmedgold or whatever is so popular.
---
Hi, /u/Bobthebaker998

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8f510/cyclonian_server_smolderweb/). 
---
&gt;Or maybe they're just hyenas doing what hyenas do, and it bears no implication to humans whatsoever.
---
Perhaps.  But just because Tolkien differentiates 'applicability' from 'allegory' and does not prefer the latter does not means it's not a widely used literary technique.  This is just the position of a single author.
---
Yes but we have changed raid leaders and we still see the same druid boots every time.
---
I force my casters to only wand until she's in the air. All Warriors to wear plate and be shield ready. Unless you nuke her asap at the start of 2 and the end of it. Your MT will take too many fireballs to get threat back. Make the MT go on whelp duty  on p3 and bandage the raid between fears. 
---
If you're Alliance only Salvation the casters and BoP the highest casters when she comes down if the Warriors didn't get enough threat from phase 1.
---
Same in NA. Grob has been legit one of best servers
---
It should, talents that don't stack with others will generally say so.  For example, Paladin's Pursuit of Justice (+8% run/mount speed says it doesn't stack)
---
Nope. That's how world pvps works. Blame blizzard for large servers/no faction queues or yourself for not rolling on a pve server. Not people who pvp on pvp servers.
---
It probably will!
---
It's ironic that PvE has better wPvP than actual PvP servers (Unless you're on Pagle or something) but that wasn't entirely unexpected either.  It'll be one of the few places people like Pss (who I assume this rogue is, since they're relatively notorious on classicwow) can actually go and get honor... though it'll be a fair fight so maybe he won't.
---
Bloodfang. Kinda balanced realm but not overcrowded.
---
Oh hey welcome! Glad you went horde, we could really use more! Great server though :)
---
What guild did you join?
---
This is inexcusable. Blizzard needs to get on this ASAP or gold farmings are going to take over all the servers. I mean can you say cross faction collusion wtf blizzard? What do you have to say for yourself? I pay $15 a month for this game and I can‚Äôt compete with these farmers. I mean, there‚Äôs not just enough hours in the day. EXPLAIN URSELVES
---
Not by raids full of random noobs who haven't played WoW in 10+ years..or EVER...
---
Exactly what I thought too lol. Sounds pretty awesome
---
the only way to fix pop imbalance is to eliminate X-server BG's
---
You've already been proven wrong, and these things you demand I do, I have already done.
---
&gt;It's not their fault that that's the only way to farm honor
---
But it is their fault for doing it. BGs come out before honor resets.
---
Precisely the point I was making.
---
As another shadow priest, JoW is God tier mana regen. It can proc off each individual tick of a DoT. SW:pain gets back like half of its mana cost refunded and mind flay usually gets at least one proc.
---
I'm also not sure if I've even seen a single holy paladin with the judgement duration talent, it's really deep holy.
---
Advertise is extremely annoying and there's some evidence he's a stream sniper.  I recall Esfand finding Advertise sitting in his or Asmon's chat one time and Advertise suddenly showed up to gank them. 
---
Yes I'm aware of Advertise's "rebuttal" videos where he points to the instances where he had some random Horde in random parts of the world notify him that Asmon was there. Ganking after that is fair, albeit annoying when your entire persona is to "advertise."
---
I'm not usually one for tinfoil hats but 2 different leaders might have overlap in their loot seeds.
---
&gt;Arms is absolutely the best dungeon spec. This is known and agreed upon.
---
I must have missed the meeting where the council of neckbeards made their declaration.
---
No there would be "caps" to the amount of players the server/instance can handle before creating a new server/instance.  This would actually increase questing ability as it would spread players out.  
---
You wouldn't have the entire game die, just a specific instance.  So yes, if implemented wrong could lead to bad instances of TM.  but think of it more like this.  Say a TM instance can support 1000 concurrent players.  Allow an approx split 500/500 horde/alliance.
---
As alliance on Sulfuras, it‚Äôs better than some servers but still doesn‚Äôt feel close to being 1:1. I just spent 5 days in searing gorge (I don‚Äôt play enough to clear it in 1 day). And only 1 of those 5 days was controlled by alliance. The rest of the time horde were running loose camping everyone near Morgan‚Äôs Vigil or w/e it‚Äôs called. I‚Äôm also not going near BRM until bgs are released.
---
People always say that, but I'm 100% sure that there were plenty of resources back then on the official forum/ej etc that serves the same purposes as guides today. I remember complicated af spreadsheets and charts explaining weapon speed interraction with windfury or MH/OH, etc.
---
yeah whats raid ui mods are those?
---
29 agi = 1 crit for rogues
---
Probably found out giving 1k a month wasn‚Äôt such a good idea after all.
---
Yeah we're clearly on the same page (not surprised we both play shaman!)
---
Any idea, worst case, what we can do as a player base to help fix imbalance?
---
In my mind first thing is to get better data on actual active player numbers with a coordinately "/who" effort? 
---
After that maybe reaching out to guilds individual and getting coordinated transfers going? AKA petitions where no-one moves until 20 guilds sign on and then everybody goes at once?
---
40-49 Warrior/Shaman
---
All classes are fully fleshed out and have 90% of their abilities. Gear is more easily available and it gives more specs real viability on the battlefield in any phase. You‚Äôve got mounts, and most end game potions are available to pull off some real insanity. Just a great overall bracket to play in.
---
&gt; Now eventually hed probably find new way home avoiding yes? 
---
And then they find that path. "Oh hello there! We've missed you.."
---
And then for no reason, What so ever....
---
What it must be like inside your head.  I'll bite, how is this 100% the horde playerbases fault?
---
I play rec league soccer sometimes.  Im an ok player.  We joined the lowest level league last year and we were ok with that.  But for whatever reason, 2 of the teams in that league decided to sign up far below their skill level and just completely dominated every other team.  To the point of not fun for anyone.  Maybe those two teams had fun, we dont know.
---
Nobody signed up for the next season.  So those two teams can play with themselves.  Maybe they would have had a league left if they didnt kill it themselves.  
---
None of us signed up to get smashed by division 2 players in division 6.  We "knew" we were getting into soccer but not something this ridiculous.  Players stopped coming to games and we had no fun.  A couple of try hards ruined it for everyone else.  
---
This applies to all games.  Not just soccer or WoW.  Even my dog wont play with me if I never let him win the tug of war every so often.  My dog understands this better than most players on these servers.  She also lets me win sometimes when im chasing her or she knows ill just stop running!
---
Not even APES would be able to take that on
---
Doing some world pvp last night, the other side had a few rogues, a warrior, and a Druid. I make the call in discord I‚Äôm going for the Druid, then she fucking shape shifts into a battle chicken and moonfired the fuck outta me. It was a big shock lol, you never expect it. Kinda like the time I ran into a melee hunter who crit me 3 times in a row for 2800 damage...
---
there's also the case that no changes to a 15 year old game, cannot be healthy due to the fact the audience for such a game evolved over 15 years.  It would be like transporting someone from today back to the 1400's while retaining knowledge/information for the time between.  For example here are some things 2019 forces on games:
---
\- streamers/more accessible content creation  
---
\- websites/info on games older than a year providing fast track to end-game or wins  
---
\- culture of "min/max"  
---
\- toxic behaviors from immature gamers without rules/gameplay mechanics protecting and/or discouraging against
---
When a game first comes out, people are less toxic and are trying to learn the game.  As a game gets older, and more information is tested/shared, more and more people drop the community facade and adapt one of trolling because there is no longer an incentive to concentrate on learning the game/teaching others about the game.
---
And when you have a sandbox game, with all information available like WOW, and no way to control the toxicity of the gamers, it becomes rife with bad communities that water-down feedback to developers.  No changes or not, if you don't provide 2019 changes, 2019 problems infest all games regardless if the community wants changes or not.
---
Make it clear that you need it beforehand.
---
Why shouldn't they rank? Top rankers on my PVE server make around 80-90k honor per week.
---
People are people...
---
If you rearrange the letter in her name, you get a naughty word
---
It is actually better for the warrior dps to sandbag a bit, because they can offtank in p3.  Just slap a shield on and go, most of her damage comes from the breath.
---
Rogues also need to sandbag, so that they don't steal a fireball and save their vanish for the p3 landing.
---
So theoretically you actually can. You can potentially even be sort of useful. It‚Äôs just putting your team at a slight disadvantage and inefficient as hell. You do get xp for turning in bg commendation marks. So you can join AV and while your team zergs work on claiming the mines. If your team wins the Zerg you win anyway. If the game gets stalled out you just created a ground assault force with the mining resource that will help your team win. You can also try to free the wing commanders. Collect the shit to get the druids / primalists active. Collect the metal scraps to get your guards armor upgrades. And then when all that‚Äôs done just farm harpy‚Äôs but the xp won‚Äôt be great since you‚Äôre in a raid. 
---
You can also be useful by ninja recapping. Often times during the Zerg raids will just completely leave entire bunkers or uncapped gy‚Äôs defenseless that you can just walk up to and take.
---
And? Not all of us are scrolling Reddit 24/7 you know. I didn‚Äôt see that post but this one was very informative.
---
The obsession some Redditors have with identifying and calling out reposts like they‚Äôre some kind of war crime really does get insufferable at times . Downvoted your post for that reason, btw
---
Lovely rant. Cheers, and good luck!
---
You can dispel potions?
---
God I fucking hate this subreddit. Everyone is frothing at the mouth to be a fucking prick the moment they have any disagreement with anyone.
---
Maybe dont out em on rez, just say outright to any healer youre gonna roll for them as well.
---
You can't white hit her, only yellows.
---
Chances are there are healers who need the Animated Chain Necklace that will run the dungeon with you. When you start the dungeon I would just check to see if your healer already has the robes so you can avoid master loot whenever possible.
---
Are people here serious? Getting ganked nonstop ABSOLUTELY was my entire experience in vanilla. Battlegrounds did not stop or even slow it. As someone who tried to complete quests on the regular with a shitty computer it was awful.
---
Dont get me wrong. IF Pro has good data for certain context, like choosing a server that has an active raiding community. But as we dont even have stats like what percentage of pop even clears MC / Ony you cant just point at it and say its gospel regarding average active faction pop. Completely dismissing census data is foolish though.
---
Ah, I forgot about the pet tanking.
---
I've noticed we haven't gotten a perditions blade yet...which is shitty considering we have 8 rogues, and 4 of us are going daggers.  Same raid leader every week...either it's terrible luck or the conspiracy is real.
---
In vanilla the fight was longer, most dps probably get fireballed and so the recover is better.
---
When we do splits, i get fireballed 3-4 times.  But we never lose a person on the landing.
---
1000G per world boss spawn you'd like us to not try for. Yes I am serious.
---
Like I said, honor means nothing. 
---
It doesn't matter if you're getting shit honor right now. It only matters if you're getting enough to gain as much RP as you want. 
---
Bracket 1 is bracket 1. And if you are getting most honor during the world pvp weeks then your BG grind will take a shorter amount of time. I dont understand why this is so hard to understand
---
FYI it's census. "Consensus" is when pretty much everyone agrees on something.
---
Isn't there only one?
---
&gt; The one change I would advocate is making the flight masters attack like goblin guards and hit like a world boss.
---
Or, Kind of like when they are attacked, the FP mounts spawn to ruin whoeever's day it was. Say, 20 people fly to location X. From now, until 20 more people leave. Spawn 20 gryphs/wyvrens/etc. It'd be the same mechanic as a civilian who detects a raid. for the # of guards.
---
Is the spot open? Go for it.  
---
In most guilds finding dps isn't a problem though, so why bring in the ret/enhance over a better dps.   
---
There are lots of team games and activities that are "fun" based, if someone starts trolling about that can be fun but it can also be quite irritating.
---
you are SOL. At least you didn't actually craft the robe before realizing.. That would have been a much bigger loss
---
Are you on the same Fairbanks I am?  The one with BRM constantly with 200+ Horde and gank squads in Ironforge?  With LHC constantly camped?  Dire Maul constantly camped with 20+ Horde?
---
Yeah the rest of the world isn't too bad on Fairbanks, but if you want to run an instance get ready for an hour of corpse runs as Alliance.
---
The problem for shaman is that they are so clunky and can be locked down with a sheep. They need to stay close to a priest becuase thiere trinket does not remove it. Shamans are another type you heavily must protect. If you do though man are they dangerous!
---
I think some people dont understand whats so powerful about paladins. It's being a high hp plate healer with auras that cant be dispelled. On top of this paldins cant be cced with sacrifice. They just dont go down if played properly. Cleanse is also the most versitle dispell that removes blind, viper sting and other annoying stuff all in one.
---
Paladins can swing a battle like no other.

‚ÄúAnti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'‚Äù  -Isaac Asimov

Took 56 for me, I feel ya
---
Not gonna lie
---
No raid spec mage has iceblock.
---
Hunters should FD at the start of p2 and the start of p3.
---
you people really cant admit when your wrong can you?
---
Come back in 2-3 DAYS(weeks? wtf are you smoking)
---
&gt; there is also PvP servers that are now 70/30 Alliance thanks to the free transfers...
---
ok what a whopping 2 of them? 
---
&gt;You do realize not everyone plays
---
You do realize that not everyone on pve will queue for fucking pvp? dear lord logic just goes right out the window when yo refuse to budge eh?
---
Have they even confirmed is cross realm ALL realms? or cross realm pvp and cross realm PVE
---
What's a x-server BG?
---
Ahh yes, true. That was a typo.
---
As a ally mage on Incen, I really enjoyed this vid, and pretty sure Vox has killed me quite a few times in BRM!
---
Because the goal isn‚Äôt to create a new game or new philosophy but simply to make some tweaks. 
---
It‚Äôs really not that hard if the community has nothing against some bumps on the road (and if we believe that other guy, everybody like the shenanigans in Classic)
---
Except if they had legitimately changed nothing, such as not putting in layering, not expanding server max population 400%, then said problems wouldn‚Äôt exist
---
It‚Äôs like literally everything Blizzard did change fucked the game up in some way. Some of the changes are outright nonsensical, lowering player view distance for example destroys world PvP.
---
Wait are BGs confirmed for tomorrow? Or still just ‚Äòthe week of the 10th?‚Äô
---
There you go again, underestimating wow nerds.
---
I won't even bother checking your math, just assume it's right- 122,100 stacks.  My honor spy currently shows a pool of over 4k players on my server that have received 15 hks this week.  122,100 / 4,000 = 30 stacks per player.  Less than 2 bags.  When you have entire guilds of people putting in max effort, that number goes down significantly.  I never said that one dude was going to single-handedly pull it off all by himself, but one dude could absolutely have 5k thorium bars lying around to contribute 20% of the entire faction's thorium requirement.  When you have that level of contribution, those gates are going to be open in no time.  I would be shocked if the gates take an entire week to open.
---
Also just for reference, people thought Ragnaros would take weeks to kill after launch... he was dead in 6 days (with room to spare) on the first weekly reset.  These same people have a full year to stockpile pre-determined materials.  Don't underestimate these people, they're nuts.
---
Well I only meant the new elemental mobs coming out tomorrow with BGs will make farming elemental drops easier, and as the volume increases the market price is going to go down.
---
Fear selling is just a spike.  If you're waiting to sell high, today is probably the day.
---
It's a 15 year old game, we're not learning new things still haha
---
ishing
---
Yeah sure, if you don't mind getting blacklisted from pug runs.
---
Turn off x server bugs. Turn on server xfers.
---
I am an Alliance Warlock on Grobbulus and have already hit a couple of my goals! My first time playing wow and mainly just wanted to hit 60, get my epic mount, and raid MC and Ony. I have done all but, raid Ony since no one wants to help me with Jailbreak. I've shifted focus to getting my Twink Rouge ready for BG's and hope to just have some fun with my buddies killing Horde scum:)
---
I am well aware. Those whole hundred kills in a week you so viciously fought over are now maybe going to keep you from atrophy because of the 20%. My argument is why bother try harding so god damned hard that you need to no life as much as possible to hopefully get rank 14 as soon as possible, when  99% of these people will eventually realize they're fucked regardless?
---
On the first kill you get 100%, 2nd 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% for the 5th kill and higher. Resets every day.
---
Lol relax I was just teasing!
---
My thought would be if people haven't rerolled already to a different server then they still won't if their only hope is cross server BGs.
---
"you people"
---
Lol, you should include yourself as someone that is intolerable and shortsighted.
---
I say weeks b/c there will be a flurry at first so any queues (short or long) will not be representative of a true queue, but hey, good on you for catching on to that!
---
As far as logic... Cross Realm is being based on 1.12 cross realms.
---
"Q: Will there be Cross Realm Battlegrounds when those go live?
---
A: Cross-realm battlegrounds were a feature of 1.12 and are important for matchmaking, so you‚Äôll be seeing cross-realm battlegrounds in WoW Classic when Battlegrounds are introduced in Phase 3 of the content roll-out plan."
---
1.12 cross realm BGs were inclusive of *ALL* servers, so in short, yes.
---
Sorry you rain on your parade. How's retail?
---
Too many crybabies. It's the same content on this subreddit everyday. People complaining of dying every second to pvp.
---
They aren't discussed because it's not happening. It's incredibly disingenuous to suggest that there's some equal and beneficial change occurring that "they" aren't talking about
---
Was she stuck in a washing machine?
---
If you never got fireballed in p2 then this is exactly how it's supposed to work.
---
Because a small indie company like Activision-Blizzard can't afford proper servers.
---
Blizzard and everyone else KNEW this behavior was going to happen and did nothing to mitigate one side from vastly dominating until really late in. You're NEVER going to stop people from seeking out honor, especially when there are reward incentives for doing so.
---
If you blame players for their behavior(provided it's not exploitative), you're just completely ignorant, and you should probably stop trying to comment.
---
And if you think camping fps, boats, roads, and capital cities is exploitative, you have an EXTREMELY bad definition.
---
Thanks. Sounds like maybe a PTO day from work in the near future to make up for this may be in order.
---
Honestly, it just sounds like you're probably not good at PvP and don't know how to play the matchups. Escape Artist is a big deal vs Mage and Druids if you know what you're doing.
---
Lol please tell me this is a troll post.
---
"What if we just add sharding??" lmao
---
That's oversimplified advice.  LIP does nothing for the 6seconds if you aren't even her target, and often 6 seconds isn't enough for a tank to hold aggro.  You should only LIP if she targets you.
---
Also it ignores all the threat mechanics of the fight.
---
That's literally how we killed Garr back in the day (offtank adds, burn Garr, clean up adds after).
---
And the only reason my guild killed Rag around 1.3 patch timeframe was because we looked another guild's kill and saw they had like 10 rogues and fewer healers than we had. It was the first time we decided to try a balls-out DPS strategy. We told people to limit their fire resist to like 100 it less when previously we had been telling them to wear as much as possible. I was allowed to DPS as shadow for the first time instead of just healing despite being shadow spec. Our first kill barely beat the second Sons spawn, and by the time BWL came out a few months later, we were already killing Rag without sons. And trust me, half our raid had no idea how to do good DPS, even at that point.
---
The point being, even in Vanilla, long before the gear had good stats, before most talent revamps, and before more players knew how to play, people were already burning Rag down pre-Sons. This isn't some new strat only available because Classic has 1.12 talents and gear. It's just that people didn't understand how to efficiently beat the fight before. It was literally the first raid boss in the game that punished you for having bad DPS.
---
LOL.... The "Deathsquad" name just comes from me making that as a Gamer Tag when I first got my Xbox because my plan was to play first person shooters.  I of course didn't play them that much but just kept the name.
---
There was some bloke who farmed the raptor rep only to be told taurens can‚Äôt ride raptors hahaha 
---
Ahhh Good times.
---
Ah thanks for the addendum.  I don't play on Flamelash,  but I have seen some refugees coming into my server from similar situations elsewhere.
---
Well there are things built in to it that prolong it. Unless they only plan to have one person per guild then you have time. Which would be really messed up. Plus its gonna take a while to do the 122.1k turn ins for alliance. Thats stacks of 20 btw. Then when that‚Äôs all done it takes 5 days for the supplies to be moved to Silithus. Not only that the quest does take some time and usually only one person per week can get the raid quest items. If you‚Äôre on it you can possibly get it done so long as your guild gives you the raid quest items.
---
Thanks!
---
Got the Flurry Axe for sort of cheap, but I lost the HoJ the only time I've seen it to a hunter. I expect that Ironfoe will be the last, just because it's so rare and so far in. But that just gives me time to collect an entire aesthetic to go with it. ;)
---
if anything civ taught us as players, is that culture/economy are both VERY possible ways to win a game lol.
---
This tactic is one of culture.  "Want to troll my body and sit there while mommy makes you dinner? Cool im gonna peace out, set a timer, come back to see how much both IRL time and game time you just wasted trying to be edgy".
---
Tactic for economy win, if one faction is stronger, divide into two forces.  One hits up low lvl areas for ganking and the other tries to control the PVE raid consumables.  Beat the dominant faction from two sources in the economy, new players for onxy head/raid slots and control the consumable grind so that the other faction's pve players start to play something else.
---
People will often reset the +1 at Domo to keep people from doing this
---
Or just do it correctly and no one needs to waste lips.
---
Harder game than WoW!
---
The clashy colors make it even funnier.
---
They wanna milk classic as long as they can..  they're gonna hold off on releasing phases until people start unsubbing because of boredom or there are mass complaints on forums.
---
Well, you cant solo SM until you're 60 - even then you need to gear up. If you're talking about AOE leveling groups in SM I think 32 is a good place to start Lib and can move to Arm at 36 and Cath at 38.
---
Herod refugee here.  We noticed the cheaper AH prices too so you are not alone.
---
excuse me there was a sign in one of your parks that said 'do not drink the sprinkler water' so I made tea with it and now I have an infection. Are you aware that there is waste in your water system?
---
That's is a faction population issue.  It's not about laziness.  It's about there not being enough Ali in the world to find.  So you are forced to camp choke points to even come into contact with alliance.  
---
You also ignore the fact there were Ali doing the exact same thing on this server.  Venture had 3 rogs in particular that could be found at kargath for around 15hours a day after P2 hit.  It was by no means a horde isolated issue- there were just more of them.  
---
Finally with such a large pop I'm balance no you can't kill Ali without preventing their access.  Because after I kill you there are 5000 more horde waiting and not enough Ali players.  
---
The population imbalance causes the issues you are blaming horde for.  That is not the horde playerbases fault.
---
Yeah thankfully battlegrounds release in a day and a half, I really want to finally get to rank 3 so I get the discount.
---
Depends on your group. If you're in a poopsock meta guild, sure flash heal all the way and kill shit in ~1min. My guild has a lot more casual players though. This means fights are longer, healing is much harder, and efficiency makes a huge difference.
---
&gt; you're not actually getting anyone out of the danger zone
---
When people take aoe damage, they are rarely thrusted into the danger zone; they're usually at about 65% health for casters, and 80% for everyone else. This is the ideal scenario to spread out as much healing as you can with efficient heals specifically because there isn't immediate danger. [Here](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/chtMPVmLdbjKXvna/#fight=32&amp;type=healing) (I'm Knade) is the perfect example of such a parse. The bulk of my healing is from 56 casts of rank 3 renew.
---
A better solution would be to allow Horde players to transfer FACTION for free.  You would probably have entire guilds do that just so they could have a target-rich environment.  Blizzard would have to monitor it carefully and shut off the spigot once balance was achieved, but I believe this would quickly and relatively easily fix the problem.
---
I mean, blizzard did implement PvE servers for that reason.
---
they also have sharding with load-balancing on retail... but any attempt at offering modern solution to population problems got met with a huge wall of QQ'ing from the classic zealot crowd ( shardnig / layering).
---
there's also BGs, which will solve most of those problems aswell.
---
At this point, it's a player-created problem and I wouldn't blame blizz for anything... except letting transfer get out of hand, creating huge imbalance on previously balanced server.
---
Earning items on a PVE server is kind of diminishing the feeling of earning the item.  At least I have some competition other than scripts on a server.  I thought about rolling a PVE server so that other people in my friends group that desire to not PVP wouldn't have a bad time.  Then I thought about how bad I would feel for each piece of loot wouldn't really be earned.  There is no where to show off the item, because you can't fight the other faction.  There is no threat in farming materials for raids, you just hope you get the tap above an enemy player or they do and you cannot retaliate in any way.  It kind of is a droning mindless farm with no real purpose if you cannot be killed by an enemy.  
---
Since AC I've played RVRVR, PVP, and FFA servers in my mmos, and whenever I play in PVE it is easier and the feeling of advancing my character is hollow and doesn't feel really earned.  It is a carebear dream playing without any threat of being stalked and killed by someone behind a keyboard.
---
I think you are exactly right my friend. Staggered pvp rewards would have been a great idea.
---
&gt; For better or for worse we're playing CS:WoW and you're playing the Sims:5 MMO expansion pack.
---
And then, while you're being corpse camped on your way to BRD, we're already in BRD, done or just shits n giggling it up.
---
..And then the itch hits us. Hey, word has it there's a brawl happening in hillsbrad, or lets go fuck with &lt;zone X&gt; and spam the localdef channel until people get sick of it and comes to fight us.
---
..Or, if we're feeling risky. We'll just turn everyone into rogues, by flagging up, People may attack you. Especially if you're going for their shit, Best done solo, though.
---
We're basically playing an older MMO, with the occasional PvP, and then when people get bored of the PvP they back out, and send ggs or fus to people.
---
I assumed it was because Bloodvenom post, a horde post constantly camped by Alliance in Felwood, is so close to the cliffs of Darkshore that it shows as being in Darkshore in global defense instead of Felwood.
---
I've read numerous guides on both Wowhead and Icy-Veins, but I'm not sure what you think reading a guide is going to do to alleviate the things I mentioned above. The troubles I'm having aren't related to gear, spec, rotation, or anything like that, and other than listicles titled "best leveling zones", I haven't seen anything even remotely resembling some kind of best practice or strategy for leveling.
---
Either way, I wasn't intending on starting some kind of "right way / wrong way" discussion about leveling. I was just saying that I am really not enjoying it as much as I did the first time.
---
You do realize respeccing is a thing, right?
---
If people want to push through the raids faster, I'm all for it.  "No fight needs it" is dumb.  You dont need elixirs either, but they are cheap and can save a lot of time.
---
Are people still leveling there?
---
You're talking as if you HAD to hardcore pvp these past few weeks to hit rank 14.
---
I mean there are probably a lot of factors that played into this. I think the major one is the server size. Lightforge.pro had the server high at 5700, which gives the horde an 1100+ population advantage. That‚Äôs pretty crazy, which probably led to having every major flight point on lockdown, alliance cities, BRM, and boats. 
---
A week or two of this and all it took was a couple of guilds bailing and the there goes the dam.
---
That's probably true, but experience still isn't going to be great by any means. Probably a good way to farm AV rep and just slowly grind up levels. 
---
Think it would still be more efficient to hit 60 then go back and grind rep.
---
My wife and I just rolled on this server and are only low level, but it has been really nice so far! We don't get a lot of time to play and it has been very peaceful.
---
It's a message about coservationalism. The lions use sustainable hunting methods. The Hyenas were forced out of pride rock for them disregarding the circle of life and hunting for sport.
---
Lol.
---
When did you play on Mograine?
---
if it was overcrowded while leveling you were probably early after the launch
---
Atm It's not crowded at all while you're just trying to level
---
Even if you‚Äôre right you‚Äôre telling me guilds will be ok with only one person getting the title? That‚Äôs what you think one scarab lord per server?
---
Weapon proc prolly
---
&gt; That's exactly what we're talking about.
---
Nope.
---
To be completely fair, if you have a raid group, and the alliance create a raid to defend IF, it is a _lot_ of fun.
---
Completely useless if there is no one fighting back though, the you‚Äôre just being a dick
---
Np!
---
One raid having to go through 3 horde raids just to get to Onyxia isn't a "challenge". It's just annoying. Raiding already takes a lot of time and adding 30 minutes to that raid time for something so stupid is enough to make a person quit the game. Especially if they have family and simply can't add an extra 30 minutes to everything they do in the game.  
---
And honor at this point is nothing compared to what we get in BGs. I honestly believe that none of these farmers played in vanilla, because if they did they would have stopped at rank 3 and then just waited for BGs.
---
I did herb and mining for a bit. I think it‚Äôs worth. Also get a bank alt and keep a ton of silk mage weave and runecloth. You can then have a nice stockpile if/when you want to switch to tailoring for truefaith.
---
i will flame every single sub 60 throwing games by farming npcs.  just hit 60 like a normal person instead of ruining games for 39 other people
---
I would agree that the servers are overpopulated. Original vanilla servers capped out at around ~2.5k. Now we're pron 2 x that.
---
Liar, that weapon doesn‚Äôt exist
---
&gt; when I decide (for completely ethical reasons i promise) corpse gank someone i just watch youtube/videos on my second screen. So yeah, you aren't really out-playing them there ;]
---
then, as MrMagicFluffyman stated.. 
---
&gt;Until you realize they are also doing irl stuff and chilling and their spy add-on dings them when you're ready for killing
---
 #NoChanges would have been a much quicker death for retail
---
Guy appreciates it and just has a different sense of humor than you do. It's basically the same mentality of you giving someone a gift and them saying I could kiss you right now, they just are foul mouthed and voiced it a different way.
---
It all comes down to if you think a problem in the game arising from both factions playing the game the same way (because lets be honest alliance were steamrolling around wpvp in 40man raids but in less total numbers) should be solved macroscopically by blizzard, or microscopically by each individual player.
---
The people on this sub who think the horde faction should have somehow organized the amount of wpvp being done among thousands of players instead of blizzard enforcing changes are absolute morons.
---
Here‚Äôs my theory: the same people doing the hardcore camping to farm honor are the same ones who will be most impacted and upset by not having Xserver bgs, and they are the same people with enough play intensity to reroll. The are also the ones most likely to be loud and downvote this thread in general.
---
sharding, each zone is its own instance and there's lag when the game needs to pass your data to a different one
---
Oh yea, i‚Äôve played since launch for like a month, I don‚Äôt know how it is doing now.
---
Sixtyupgrades is decent for that.
---
Also worth noting that BiS is only best in slot when you have the entire set to match with it. Something like Maxdps (at least when I last went on it in like... Wrath?) just showed the best item for a slot, didn't account for anything else like set bonus', hit rating, etc.
---
There's 1 NA and 1 EU RP-PVE server.  I play on the NA RP-PVE server, Bloodsail Buccaneers on Alliance side.  BSB is a great server with minimal toxicity, a decent economy (there was very little layer exploiting back when that was a thing), and a good mix of guilds that are anywhere from 'MC/Ony on farm for 2 months' to casual/RP-focused.  The guild I'm in just rounded out our raid team; we've only been raiding as a guild for 2 weeks now but have no problem with Ony and no problems with MC except for Rag, who we hope to down this week.  Let me know if you have more questions.
---
Oh I wouldn't worry at all. I run a guild of about 200 people and we're all really lax with leveling speed and whatnot, just having a good time as we go. You should be just fine as long as you find a group on the same page as you are.
---
One of the most dominant alliance Flamelash guilds went to Earthshaker. They were really controlling the early pvp on the server until the tides shifted in favor of the horde. So if you want to play on a (supposedly) balanced PVP server with some great alliance guilds, Earthshaker is probably a good spot to be.
---
I believe that this is the same person, because that's exactly who would do that, but also covering the name means there isn't actually proof
---
Thread is derailing a bit.. But who cares..
---
I think they'll rush it exactly for that reason.
---
because you don't keep the entire world loaded in your memory at any given time.
---
when you swap zone, a old chunk of memory get deleted and you get data for the new zone.
---
it's a thing in every open-world game...we used to have loading screen in older game ( like everquest 1) but with modern CPU that loading time is negligible... sub 1s in my case.
---
are you sure you aren't pushing the limits of '' wow is playable on a toaster'' meme?
---
What does the {{ }} do?
---
Personally I just use a /Say Innervate Cast On %t line and it works fine.
---
Fury/prot is a 100% specialist spec for high single-target threat in Raids. It actually does decent dps but keep in mind that it has terrible threat generation on any amount of targets greater than 1. For this reason it is worse than either full fury dps or full prot tank for running dungeons.
---
Well, white hits are normalized. A slow weapon does make white hits bigger but also slower, so for white hits weapon speed is irrelevant to overall dps. It doesn't make the yellow hits slower, which is why the effect on yellow is relevant but the effect on white is irrelevant. There's no boost to white attack DPS due to weapon speed as there is with yellow. Crits are not the reason to choose a slow main hand.
---
You are missing the point. It is fine if they camp some zones and we others, we all need Honor and is a PVP world.
---
What makes this massive BS is that after being as grindy and ganky as anyone else, they jump ship, starting the whole exodus.
---
Yeah bit Wu is worth like 30% on his own. That crazy bastard.
---
Raid officers report to the Guild Leader. usually how someone who delegates work knows what the delegates did.
---
Life on a PvP server is one of watching your back and never trusting enemies. It's constant events where anything can happen. You can get saved by superhero 60, or you can get totally deleted by a death ball. You make rivals, you make allies. You sapper charge to take BRM 10 guys against 20, you coordinate targets in death ball fights, you camp douchebags who gank lowbies, they camp your alt (usually when you deserve it), and you try to fight their 60 on your alt anyway, cause fuck it, anything can happen.
---
It often feels more like playing something like a battle royale, where you cause some trouble and then have to rotate to a new questing spot before hell rains down on you. And the nice thing about Classic is that its open-ended quest structure allows you to easily do that. Kill a guy at panthers, move to goblins, kill a guy at goblins, move to trolls, etc.
---
And yeah, you die sometimes. But what's a game without risk?
---
- Was running around EPL with my guild death ball. I'm a hunter so I stay ahead scouting and baiting for the group. Rogue honor grinder takes the bait and opens on me, and I call in the airstrike and he gets wrecked. Maybe 20 minutes later I encounter him on his mount about 70 yards away, and immediately hunter's mark him. No way I can catch him -- just a simple invitation to duel. He accepts and dismounts, vanishes the mark, I drop my flare and trap, we fight 1v1, I win.
---
- Was on my hunter alt (I like hunters, okay) killing elite dwarves outside Uldaman with my mage buddy. Both low 40s. 60 warrior shows up, looks at us funny, I drop a freezing trap to prepare. He goes for it and we shrek him. He respawns, can't find us, aggros the first low 40 he sees, and the three of us shrek him again. 
---
- Was fighting pirates in STV. Buddy 1v1s a random 41 warrior (wins, since he's a mage). Couple minutes later warrior shows up with a 60 druid who had been fishing nearby all day. We almost killed the druid. Got him to about 30%. Good fight.
---
- Was running past the STV arena on our low 40s. A 60 lock aggros on us, we're losing bad, when a friendly 60 priest shows up and we kill the lock. The priest goes inside and then I realize it's 11:58, just as two more enemy 60s come by to kill us. Joke's on them, though. Ganking us made them late for the arena and the priest won it.
---
- Was sitting on a mushroom in EPL. Thought I was pretty well hidden, and it's tough to get up there, so I was tabbed out working on something. A mage starts casting on me so I  shoot him enough for him to back off. I bandage up and the mage comes back a bit later with a shadow priest friend. I aimed-multi-auto the mage and instantly kill him before the priest can even react. It was the funniest shit.
---
- Was at Zanzil ruins on the 40s. Three enemy players: priest my level, another priest a few levels lower, and a lock my level. About to leave, so yolo. Open on the same-level priest. They all fall on me -- turns out they were partied. Buddy gets away. Same-level priest decides he's gonna camp me. His camping strategy is to stand still on his mount, in my res range. So I res on top of him and drop a freezing trap, and mount up and ride away. Move off to the side and eat/drink in shadowmeld. Ten seconds later he rides past me, oblivious. Twenty seconds after that he enters the pirate area, encounters my buddy, and buddy 1v1s him, and wins.
---
- Buddy goes to Nethergarde and is heading to Swamp of Sorrows. 60 warrior aggros on him and chases him across the entire zone before another 60 finally shows up to kill buddy. If I was there we woulda killed the 60, no doubt in my mind. 
---
All of these stories happened *this weekend.* What kind of stories do PvE servers have? "Today I killed 10 pirates and found their plans?" "Today I killed a bunch of ogres?"
---
Unfortunately, no.
---
&gt; How does one attack without flagging? As in, your target is flagged and you are not?
---
Just, start revving up a spell on them, It's like the ol' shadowmeld -&gt; aimed shot, or mind control. just.. You can see it coming, but you can't stop it.. As if you're a faction guard standing there. waiting as that mage over there hardcasts a pyroblast from max range for whatever reason on you.
---
Warrior or druid, either way they should DEFINITELY save their AOE taunt cooldown for his 20% phase.  That makes it super easy to do.  The adds also have very little HP, except for the two elites.  I spammed Anger 50+ times tanking for friends going for the HOJ and we struggled the first run or two until I realized to save the AOE taunt for that specific time.  Even if you're only farming Anger, as a druid I couldn't do a run quick enough (since we did Arena too) where it wasn't always back off cd when we got there. 
---
Single-target dps should stay on anger and burn him down
---
AOE classes should AOE enough to kill all the little ones, then go back to single target on Anger
---
Tank should grab it all
---
healer spams heals on tank =p
---
it's very doable but definitely requires some coordination.  If the tank doesn't ahve the AOE taunt it's basically impossible to keep all the adds from going straight for the AOErs or healer.  Once anger dies, it's only two elite medics who are easy to deal with.
---
Here is a post in 2017 where blizzard is banning people for win trading for rated battle grounds, logic should apply here right?  
---
 [https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754437317](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20754437317)
---
It's a result of there being no alliance anywhere else to kill. When the world is so sparse the horde have to get more aggressive and go deeper into alliance territory to rank honor. It's hardly griefing when this kind of behavior is incentivized by the honor system
---
Yeah I understand. I killed only 1 person in the last 3 months but I play on PVE. I would never do the rank14 grind. Currently I have time and I could be rank 14, but why waste so much time.
---
Naxx and fun.

Oof right in the feels. I'm pretty sure that kid is dead :(

---
&gt;  I've been a big supporter of the idea of #nochanges but I'm really starting to see problems with the philosophy 
---
Vanilla-like server population was the MAIN #nochance feature. Everything, and I mean everything is based on population : the economy, leveling, questing, farming, WPvP, and most importantly, the COMMUNITY.
---
Blizzard did not delivered Vanilla-like population Classic servers, but mega-servers.Hence, everything got changed, and got changed to worse.
---
The game was designed to function properly with 2k to 3k concurrent players. What we got when layering was removed, was 8k to 15k concurrent players.
---
If the #nochanges camp would have been more vocal and bigger, Classic would not be in the state that is now.
---
And it is all 100% on Blizzard.
---
Do you feel like there are a decent amount of people on the server? I believe this server is listed as medium I was not sure how that would be.
---
" Essentially during the lead up to classic and discussion of what servers people were going to play on, some players decided to crowd certain servers in order to ensure a faction's supremacy on that server. "  
---
Rofl, that's just false. Flamelash was 55-45 in the first month. Just alliance stopped playing cause horde had 3 guilds that actually PvPed compared to alliances 1. That snowballed into more and more leaving and Horde having to go out of their way to PvP.
---
That‚Äôs what I meant by CS vs the sims. I Was trying to bash both sides equally. I understand where both types of players are coming from.
---
That made my day.
---
genious
---
There were resources and walkthroughs back then. People even made videos on PTRs and posted them on major guild sites. I definitely remember that stuff in BC, though I never got max level in vanilla (before YouTube).  I remember my guild always linked boss fights so we were all on the same page and knew the fights before hand. 
---
I think differences in patches are a MUCH better explanation for why MC is so easy.
---
But he literally said right after this that he misplayed. Are you also the warlock that was whispering him after this?
---
MC/Ony gear vs non raid gear is not that bad but once people start getting BWL gear, If you're still running around in blues you're gonna get destroyed and it's only gonna get worse as new raids release. The blue pvp set is decent but you really need rank 12/13 set if you Wana keep up with raid gear.
---
Well when you guild concentrates on quantity over quality things tend to fall through the cracks. Common problem to have. Perhaps you guys would have had server firsts if you paid more attention.
---
Yeah throwaway side account. Just seems like a lot of people feel that streamer = bad
---
So could the people in IF...
---
They'd just be Arms warriors with 200% weapon damage Mortal Strike using Arcanite Reapers and no weapon normalization holding them back.
---
Plus, they'd know that 1.12 was the final iteration so they'd still pick the best meta class for that so they wouldn't have to reroll later.
---
Same goes for mages.
---
yeah he is on heartseeker my dude.  The whole realm xferred.
---
How about you go learn the difference between to and too before you go online with your stupid opinions? :)
---
Kind of uncalled for, after she fucking destroyed me I explained my side to her and we had a ‚Äútutorial round‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs not always easy to recognize when you‚Äôre making a game unfun for someone else. But it‚Äôs important to listen to what the other players have to say instead of just saying ‚Äúlolkek sounds like pvp happened on a pvp server‚Äù.
---
Still learning new things about this game frequently. I love it.
---
Approximately 0 full clears. And as of yesterday I had like 2 or 3 resists, but they were all in bad situations to begin with. I haven't yet noticed any when I'm able to LoS what I'm trying to feign.
---
That said, I've failed it probably 50 times so far... It took me a while to figure out how to get past slipkik without pissing everything off.
---
And I'm still doing it in my raid spec (including Surefooted, though i'm not sure hit rating has any effect on FD resists.)
---
This is the way.
---
Jesus Christ thank you
---
As a feral druid, this is the least of my issues. Farming five runs of gnomergon takes literally minutes, and is the easiest consumable to farm ever.   
---
And most fights you don't need to burn consumables on anyways.
---
No one is forcing these dudes to turn their pvp server to pve. Actions have consequences. 
---
Yes, Blizz is mostly to blame but these people aren't blameless.
---
Be a warrior with fill valor armor and an arcanite reaper. Back in vanilla, that WAS end game and best attainable gear for people. Now in the hyper efficient game we have today it's nothing, but a realistic goal for a casual like myself
---
Didn't say that.
---
Gotcha, more victim blaming and deflecting with nonsense, because you cannot gripe with reality.
---
3-5g each?
---
If you think it's going to change things, I've got some bad news for you.  In before all the complaints about Horde camping Battlemasters.
---
So alliance is going to be locked down to the BGs as their only activity? Sounds painful.
---
&gt;Ally will continue to pve, or reroll horde.
---
So their only source of PVP aside from wintrading in hillsbrad is going to be taken out. Sounds like a nice suggestion, I highly doubt Blizzard will follow: especially since they announced cross-realm BGs since they expected the community to create faction imbalance like this.
---
They're not but you can bet Asmongold didn't read a single guide on how to play warlocks. Having the fundamental knowledge of how your class works goes a long way, no matter how simple it is‚Äîwell, unless you're raiding as a mage, in which case zero skill required.
---
I feel like OEB is standard issue for Horde warriors. 
---
Like you hit 60 and you get OEB via in-game mail with a letter from Thrall:
---
"Warrior, congratulations on completing your training. Here is a weapon that will aid you in your battles with the alliance. Gather 25 trusted friends and defend the BRD instance portal for 50 honor an hour. Best of luck on your quest to rank 4!" 
---
Like legit if I'm getting ganked by a warrior and he doesn't have OEB it's because he has BRE or sulfuras.
---
Depends on the BG. For AV you can be fury. There's enough people that you get lost in the shuffle. For AB and WSG I'd respec Arms.

[A month ago today, just before the honor system released](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity?dateFrom=2019-09-13&amp;dateTo=2019-12-09&amp;realm=4706_Flamelash) they had a 55/45 ratio at peak hours. That would be one of the most, if not the most balanced pvp server available. 
---
Two weeks earlier it was nearly a perfect 50/50 ratio.
---
Ignore the facts all you want, but it seems pretty damn clear that the alliance simply pussied out.
---
Still just "the week of the 10th" but seeing as it's the 9th and they haven't said anything, i'm hopeful and expecting it to be tomorrow!
---
Solution is pretty simple: Add faction queues and provide free transfers to factions with a long queue.
---
Didn‚Äôt say you did. I said it seems like that is the general feeling of this sub
---
Don't take the sentiments expressed on this subreddit or the official forums to be representative of the majority of players. Like most customer service forums (think product reviews) the loudest people are those with a problem. If you were to believe what you read here and on the forums, you'd believe that the game is already dead and nobody plays, but that's a load of crap. The people having fun (aka the vast majority) are doing just that: having fun playing instead of complaining anywhere and everywhere they think they're entitled to a soap box. 
---
I'm glad you're having a good time :)
---
I just find it silly that people have to resort to counter-camping strategies like this to make themselves believe they've "won" or point fingers at blizzard when PvP happens on a PvP server.
---
If you think you'll get frustrated due to PvP...just roll on a PvE server. It's not like you can't turn PvP on if you're feeling frisky on a PvE server.
---
Grats for being the slowest leveler on earth? :-)
---
&gt; It's easy, PvPers want to PvP, BRM is where people will be. Having an  epic battle and controlling that mountain is awesome, that there's 4  other horde guilds doing the same isn't in my control as a guild leader.  I just want to PvP on a PvP server, if that requires wiping your raid  off buffs then so be it.  
---
So people go to extreme lengths to find PvP,  cause the faction imbalance makes it impossible to do it in "neutral"  grounds. And that's where we are. 
---
I can't really unpack the amount of selfishness and entitlement necessary to believe something like this unironically.
---
Oh, certainly, but it is pop cap which creates such exaggerated camping.
---
Skullflame is ok, horde dominated, but alliance manage to break them on a regular base
---
how is Flamelash?
---
This PVP Server is the best what i have seen in Classic.
---
Spellbatching wasn't something most of us demanded. It was something Blizz put in to save money, and blamed on us. Nobody likes the current implementation of spellbatching. It doesn't feel normal, and the window for simul actions is waaaay longer than in vanilla.
---
Never listen to Reddit about any predictions dude The game experiences a surge of players that slowly tapers off with every expansion and classic is no different. In my personal experience there has been 0 shortage of dungeon groups or pvp since launch. Not a dad but probably too old to be gaming as much as I do ;)
---
Just use the activity function, instead of characters.
---
And then you can also see how often it logs datapoints
---
on the real though people who hate gnomes have small penises full stop.
---
Wanna add another shout-out to Mirage Raceway!
---
Pretty cool alliance faction in general with no super ultra major issues I've seen or heard about. Closest thing we have is basically a running joke of HUGHHEFFNER BEST PAPLY TANK EU.
---
Personally had three people come from a PvP server because they were sick of it join the guild I'm an officer in and they've said how much better it is after they took the hit.
---
Hit me up if you want to join a really friendly social guild on there. :)
---
Go away
---
It is empty. It is the end. The pvp server has lost its purpose of being *pvp* with this victory. Horde played a finite game, when they should have gone for an infinite game. They lost in the greater picture.
---
Law of very large numbers dictate that when you are grinding a lot of different items, the chances of you being very unlucky on one of them is quite large.

---
Omfg I'm crying right now. Thank you.
---
What choas?  You mean the game?
---
I think you have to be level 51 to join. And I would honestly hold off until like level 55. Unless you heal you're going to be pretty worthless tbh. And I bet you could still get exalted by level 60 if you just did AV. Soooooooooo, I would hold off for sure, It'll make it easier for your faction to get wins too.
---
I tried my best but I guess you can't help everyone.
---
If you are stockpiling for the market? Maybe, maybe not depending on what prices hit a couple weeks into BWL. If prices shoot up, people will likely start cashing out while the money is good. But I know multiple guilds stockpiling black lotus for personal use when BWL comes out, as a crutch for the first few weeks of actual raiding.
---
My point still stands whether the content is difficult or not. If everyone else was not doing their job properly and fucking as sub standard specs and otherwise not pulling their weight then the raid would not get done. So they are in fact carrying the ret paladin
---
What they want to do and what they will do are two totally different things.
---
I don't reserve but I just tell the healer I'll be rolling on healing gear. Usually they come anyway because tanks are hard to find.
---
Cringe..
---
Rogue is easy in PVP but not really for PVE. It's good but that doesn't neccesarily mean its easy
---
What alot of us do is remote in on our phones before leaving work soo a. We can beat the que boss on days it applies ( Tuesdays and thursdays on my server it seems) and b. Maximize what time I do have. 
---
Being 28 and having no children I no life 3-6 hours afterwork.
---
I play on Herod and while the tp and kargath flight points are dead most of the time. 
---
I don't find it that particularly obnoxious that I from time to time have to fight to the death for some herbs or ore. 
---
Half your time? That's a exaggeration.
---
The most annoying thing is this druid named pslams that likes to stealth on the zep. Most of the time he himself just gets killed by his potential gankees.
---
There is a solution, just a lot of work for blizzard and to admit they were wrong. 
---
May cause some issues initially with people bitching but it would solve the population issue.
---
Announce server splits. Say Hey in X weeks we are splitting Whitemane (Example) into 3 realms with a 5000 player population cap online at once. 
---
You will have X weeks to choose the split you are going to. At the end of X weeks we will move everyone to their chosen split. IF you didn't choose a split you will go with the split your guild master has chosen. If you do not have a guild we will randomly chose a split for you. 
---
CS could have a couple week grace period where they look into individual cases if people got split away from friends or family to move them over to the correct split. 
---
Bottom line is blizzard wont do this because it would cost them time and resources and to admit they were wrong but it is completely possible for them to fix it. 
---
You may say a few things "What happens when one of those splits die or the split is uneven and one server is left with 1k population"
---
Well you could take another giant server say Herod in this situation and merge 1 split from Whitemane with 1 from Herod. You could also do this if one of those splits died. 
---
You could also turn those splits into battle grounds instead of cross realm battle grounds you keep those splits in the same "battlegroup" like before. You may have to have 2 giant servers like Whitemane and Herod in the same battlegroup to keep queues normalized but it could work.
---
2 tanks.
---
1st tank will tank p1, while second tank gets mid way up on threat.
---
When she lands the 2nd tank does recklessness swaps to def stance and crits her from behind.
---
Gets hate pretty fast even if they got hit by a fireball.
---
Now this is the type of challenge i'd like to see.  1-60 walking only.
---
I can't believe people still can't speculate and voice their opinions, even from a philosophical pov, without someone telling them gO to rEtaIl
---
yet... sharding / layering was ( and still is) the obvious answer to queues, incessant ganking, overpopulation / overcontested ressource and so on... with just about no downside.
---
people's 'deep hatred for sharding and layering' is the reason we can't have nice thing.
---
Are Ally dominated PVE servers going to transfer to PVP?   No.  So why would Horde dominated PVP transfer to PVE?
---
Wow. You are still trying to blame individual horde players. I know you wont believe this... but... I get ganked and corpse camped on a regular basis by Ally players. WHAT?!? NO WAY!? GASP! SURPRISE! 
---
You are trying to turn this situation into direct responsibility on the players. How old are you? 14? You got a lot to learn about the world.
---
I made one for a friend that activates when his crit chance goes above 75%, as I'm fairly sure there's no 'visible' buff.
---
How do you sign up for those?
---
likely.
---
but it's easier to blame blizz than your own machine.
---
Those fuck me eyes she gives after they roll down the hill? Totally gets revved up, big time
---
Those guilds were megazerging as 40man gank squads already before the honor system came out. Not to farm honor, but just to piss of Horde.
---
"I want classic but I also want changes and new content!"
---
No, you don't want classic, you want retail.
---
Your still the best at it, go you :)
---
I switch between bear and moonkin. If there‚Äôs a piece of gear I want for moonkin while tanking I don‚Äôt reserve it I just say I‚Äôm going to roll on it as well before the group starts. Just tell your group what your plan is before you invite them and there won‚Äôt be a problem.
---
The chain heal base values are calculated for a hit and then crits are calculated for each heal independently. Pay more attention to the second and third targets, and if those never crit that'd be a bug, but most likely you just weren't noticing.
---
with this line of thinking, you should really not be on a PvP server. it seems you want the world to be completely devoid of people so you dont run into any conflict.
---
I‚Äôm horde at Thalnos. I did pvp for a total of 4 days and then stopped, the reason? It‚Äôs no fun, not at all. It‚Äôs similar to camp the spawns during the launch, you stay there waiting for some ally to pass, then 10+ horde attacks and if you are lucky enough to at least damage, then you‚Äôre good.
---
I refuse to do this wPvP, this is no fun for both sides. It was really funny before p2, many good fights.
---
How‚Äôs ally general chat about this? Many people rerolling?
---
I believe the confirmation to become saved to an in-progess (or cleared) RAID was not added until after 1.12, so if you zone in you quietly and instantly get saved to whatever the leader is saved to.
---
I've tested this once or twice by joining a PUG that had only a few bosses left and was met with no warning or notification that I was being saved to the ID, only the 'This instance resets in X days' message.
---
The bug/feature is actually more prominent in raid, specifically because warriors are rage capped. The bug isn't the ability to cancel HS, the bug is that your offhand inherits the miss chance of the yellow hit you have queued up.
---
So since you can have 100% uptime for heroic strike (or cleave if threat capped), you effectively have hit cap on both main and offhand, while also using instant abilities like bloodthirst and whirlwind.
---
Problem with that theory is that it assumes 100% of people on PvP servers care about pvp. A lot of people rolled on them because friends did. I remember in Vanilla a lot of people on pvp servers really didn't pvp.
---
He‚Äôs not right because back in the day (I actually played from around launch for several years) the server populations weren‚Äôt this high. There was not enough people to form a meatgrinder or block off brm for weeks on end like there is today. Also most people didn‚Äôt even completely understand the concept of grinding for honor in the world... they just were there for kills and fun. Like everything else in vanilla honor is being min/maxed and it‚Äôs ruining any illusion of fun.
---
I find if you're not paying much attention to your surroundings an RP server is just like any other PVE server, except the names tend to be slightly less horrible (there are still many bad ones). However, if you start walking around town and listening to people's conversations in /say and watching what people are doing you'll find lots of little groups of people doing RP stuff. If they aren't doing anything super "private" you can usually join in.
---
Or, you can look for the RP guilds and do more organized things. 
---
The event mentioned above was likely an organized guild event.
---
Ofcourse it's gonna change things, battlegrounds are king for Honor grinding. Horde can roam in between queues but it's still gonna be way less than currently. Also Please camp the battlemasters. I love getting free kills when I zone out of a battleground.
---
Yup now they have people grouped up even more. And the Horde queues will be longer.
---
Wow, this sub lets any shit get posted.
---
I admit it is their fault for playing the game to try to earn honor and gear. It is not their fault that the way the game was designed was that this is how you farm honor and get gear. They're just playing the game, and it's not their fault that the way to do that makes the game unplayable to Alliance. That's bad game design! I love the game, but I can still admit when some parts of the game are designed in a way that incentivives this bad behavior.
---
This post makes no sense. OP is a static image of a /who showing the ally player in IF.  Of course he is going to be IF at some point...

Just because a bug exists does not mean "blizzard is not fixing bugs".

What makes this even more hilarious is the thing you're talking about got hotfixed within 48 hours.
---
Haha thanks bud. I enjoy the heck put of those few hours I play every week
---
I did the SAME exact think as you, are you me?  I was an orc warrior on Skeram and all my friends split, some transferred and some rerolled.  I followed the people who rerolled and leveled a mage on Incendius.  Only difference was I was able to hit 60 one week before honor dropped.
---
32 here. I AM THE SLOWEST!
---
Yeah guess what you mentioned more than IF only, and griefing happens in many ways everywhere by much more than 30 people on the top ranks. Your argument is trash.
---
Right? It's zerg vs protoss all over again. When sc2 first released there was a general hatred and stigma against toss players. Now it has shifted to zerg players. Funny enough, not Blizzard. The players. Why? Idk... immaturity?
---
It's so moving... Brings a tear to my eye.
---
That site shows 36/64 for level 60s on Flamelash, which just shows how insanely inaccurate it is.
---
Laughs in rogue.
---
Exactly, the wpvp was soooo much better before p2
---
I want to turn off grey and/or white and/or green loot in the chat.
---
You never needed to be exalted with another faction when you got the pvp mounts. I also reached rank 11 back in vanilla and as an undead I could ride the raptor, without doing any rep quests for trolls back then, cause I didnt know shit about ¬¥that :D
---
Hard to say, but I don‚Äôt think a lot of them are having that much fun. They‚Äôre just chasing the pipe dream of satisfaction in a video game fulfilling them in real life. When they realize it‚Äôs not working the next best thing is to try and make people miserable and drop the game all together.
---
I wanna know what it would be like with the AQ gates talents.  Sadly they only had a back up of the final 1.12 build from their WOTLK backup data.  That is all we can live and hope for in a faithful recreation of classic wow.
---
Mark Rosewater, one of the most respected game designers of any community, gave a talk at GDC called 20 years, 20 lessons about 20 lessons about game design which he had learned in his 20 years of designing Magic the Gathering. Lesson 13 is one that you could learn a lot from. To quote Mark, "Lesson #13: Make the fun part also the correct strategy to win
---
It's not the players' job to find the fun. It is your job as the game designer to put the fun where the players can't help but find it. When the players sit down to play a game, there's an implied promise from the game designer that if they do what the game tells them to do, it will be fun. So most players will do whatever the game tells them to do to achieve the desired goal (usually win), even if that thing isn't fun. When the game is done, if the players didn't enjoy themselves, they will blame the game‚Äîand rightfully so!
---
It's your job as a game designer to make sure that what it takes to succeed at your game is the very thing that makes the game fun. Fun cannot be tangential; it has to be the core component of your game experience. I can't stress this enough. You can't hide the fun and expect your players to hunt for it. That's not their job. It's your job as a game designer to lead the players to the fun."
---
How do people have 2h of free time on weekdays? Shit, on my days off I only have like 2-3h of time available lol.
---
It was pretty balanced until the coward allies ruined this server.
---
Errr.... 1.13.3
---
Woah woah woah, those are step sisters stuck in those washing machines not half sisters.
---
Because your comrades who need to be in the world will be farmed to extinction and you'll eventually have an even unhealthier faction to work with, making the game more frustrating for you (and the other faction in turn) in the long run.  If you think you are done with world pvp content, you are sorely mistaken. You are done for the next month or 2 until p3 drops, and the corpse runs will begin again.
---
But you'll have less backup because all the geared alliance will have been in queues while the ones that should've been getting geared will have quit or rerolled out of frustration.
---
Solution is not pretty simple. Even if every single player on all PVP servers left it up to blizzard to reshuffle them in the most balanced way possible, you end up with 60/40 horde favored across all realms. There simply are not enough ally players period to have balance everywhere. 
---
The only way a 50/50 realm can exist is for some other realms to be fucked up
---
Not at all, with regards to what killed retail. BC still had all of the features that fostered an immersive, communal, rpg based MMO experience. Saying it was a radically different of a game is just silly. The abndonment of those aspects will kill the relevance of WoW no matter what form or era it decides to take. Which is exactly what we see in the sub trends when blizzard began to do that in Cata.
---
How can you get these stats?
---
This is not true. MMOs historically have always had a large majority of the players pick the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù race. This is why alliance was favored in classic, and why blood elves were added to the game to give the horde a ‚Äúhuman‚Äù race
---
The reason faction imbalances weren‚Äôt a problem in vanilla is because the servers were a reasonable size for how the world was designed. instead of the mega servers we have now.  Faction imbalance started to become a problem in Wrath when the servers were expanded a lot and then we got sharding
---
They're the ones most likely to be hit with sunken cost fallacy and be unwilling to reroll since they've invested more time than anyone else. All this will do is lead to alliance continuing to quit the game because the ally favored pve servers will experience long queues and the alliance on pvp servers will continue to be camped since the horde on their server is spending 30+ minutes in queue.
---
&gt;Yeah, unfortunately the ultra high pop is the reason why faction balance is going to always be complete garbage for you, or most who are super server alliance. The ratios of 60/40 always suck, but it gets to the point of unplayable for the underdog when you account for thousands of extra players on one side compared to hundreds.
---
But private servers managed to make servers balanced, so why can't blizzard?
---
&gt;But it does force you to depend on your comrades and work together more. I'm jealous I'm not alliance for your bg queues, but absolutely FUCK being alliance on any super server that isnt balanced
---
I rerolled alliance to help balance the game, so I found a server that was 43/57 ish(redeemable ratio), and joined the alliance to help striving for the holy perfect equilibrium.
---
Alliance lock in perticular for PvP is also complete garbage compared to being a horde lock. But aliance locks are superior in PvE at least.
---
oh these kind of ppl. may them rot in hell
---
I know, that's the rough approach our druids landed on when playing private servers too.
---
Just let the man have his fun
---
Yeah, this is actually true. I didnt notice he left until later. He was suddenly offline shortly after we cleared magmadar
---
Level 30 for me!  I love my 3 hour getaway every Friday night, look forward to it all week :)

With scheduled weekly maintenance in each region, we will update WoW Classic to version 1.13.3, which includes several updates to the game. We will deploy this patch with weekly maintenance starting at 7:00 a.m. PST (10:00 a.m. EST) on Tuesday, December 10.
---
World of Warcraft Classic Version 1.13.3
---
**Battlegrounds**
---
The fields of battle are open, and the Alliance and Horde are set to clash over Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley.
---
Warsong Gulch is a 10v10 game of capture-the-flag, with each faction attempting to carry their opponents‚Äô flag all the way back to their own base, while preventing the opposition from doing the same. Players fight in level-ranges in Warsong Gulch: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and level 60.
---
Alterac Valley is a large 40v40 tug-of-war zone, with many quests, objectives, and areas of interest. All players at level 51 and higher are placed into a single level-range in this epic struggle, with rewards via reputation as well as quest rewards. Some Alterac Valley rewards are highly sought, such as Don Julio‚Äôs Band, Lei of the Lifegiver, and Ice Threaded Arrows/Bullets.
---
The Alliance entrance to Warsong Gulch is in Silverwing Grove in Ashenvale Forest, and the Horde entrance is near Mor‚Äôshan Base Camp in the northern Barrens. The Alliance and Horde entrances to Alterac Valley are in northern Hillsbrad Foothills. Both Warsong Gulch and Alterac Valley can also be entered by speaking with the appropriate battlemaster in your capital city.
---
Battlegrounds are cross-realm, which means you‚Äôll fight alongside allies and against opponents from all of the realms in your region.
---
**Elemental Invasions**
---
Across Kalimdor, Blazing, Thundering, Watery, and Whirling Invaders now occasionally appear in Un‚Äôgoro Crater, Azshara, Winterspring, and Silithus respectively. The elementals appear to be seeing just how far into these territories they can penetrate before being beaten back by the forces of the Horde or the Alliance.
---
**Keyring**
---
The key button in your micro menu now opens your Keyring, an additional bag for keys only, that scales up to hold 32 keys.
---
**Additional Updates**
---
   - The lua API has been modified to prevent some addons from using communications channels in ways that are contrary to the spirit of the game.
---
   - This patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which may be enabled at a future date.
---
   - The World of Warcraft Classic executable file on your PC has been renamed.
---
   - Bug fixes.

Enchanting for the trinket
---
Lower overheal is the best mana efficiency tool you've got. Gheal is basically useless unless you're stopcasting it on a tank until you've got 8pc t2 and the ZG gheal trinket.
---
The real thing behind it is "The Tragedy of the Commons" iirc. Basically if you have something that is used by everyone, everyone can only profit by using it more. However, this leads to overuse and in the end to less gain than if everyone used it sustainably. 
---
Lets say there is a grass field and every farmer can put cows on there. The field can maybe hold 15 cows and there are 7 farmers.  First everyone has two cows on there. Farmer Greg now decides that he can put a third cow on there which will still be sustainable. But now everyone else also puts a cow on there, because "why should I use less of the field than Greg?". Now the field becomes unsustainable but it will take some time for it to die. But now Jeffrey thinks "Well if the field is already unsustainable, I better make the best of it" and puts 5 cows on there. The rest follows them and quickly the field is dead. Now instead of 2 cows everyone could have for eternity, it is no cow.
---
The methods to solve this are:
---
1. The field is split up and privatized. Now instead of one field for 15 cows there are 7 fields for 2 cows each and if someone doesn't sustain it, it is their problem.
---
2. The field is put under an overarching governing body who's goal is not to maximize short term gain but to keep the field healthy. Said body can then enforce a rule of only 2 cows per person.
---
3. The farmers on the field make a deal with one another to only put a specific amount of cows on the field.
---
Of course all 3 of these have problems as well. We can compare those to real life equivalencies on countries. Number one is what the USA did. They privatized everything, but did it become sustainable? Not really. Instead the people unsustainably farmed until the land was dead and then sold it as factory grounds to maximize their own profits.
---
The second option is similar to what the Soviet Union did. The big problem on this system is that the third party can be corrupt and disproportionally give resources to one person over the others. It can also be riddled with incompetency where there is a problem in the system that everyone knows about, but the thrid party either doesn't care or understand enough about the local area to really tackle the problem.
---
The third system sounds good on paper, however it can be looked at just like the UN. In the end, there is no good way to force one party to do what you want from them, especially if several of them band together. Just look at CO2, everyone says stuff needs to be done, but there is no country coming forward. And then some countries go completely against the course set by the others, etc. 
---
In Lion King the system the lions had in place was the second one, this system gave huge advantages to the Lions over the Hyjenas. Scar decided to get rid of that system and create deregulation, which lead to the tragedy of the commons.
---
KEY RING
---
After the maintenance, as they are deploying a patch.
---
Keyring wooo!
---
LBRS Is a real challenge to tank no matter what. Sounds like you were trying your best and no need for a priest to get you crap.  Your group comp is not easy, but you got to use what you can. Some thoughts for improvement:
---
Have Hunter place a trap down before pull. 
---
Ask druid to off tank in bear for large or harder pulls
---
Save use taunt to pull off of priest, if hunter and priest both pull agro, obviously use taunt on priest.
---
Ask druid to sleep a dog before pull. not much DPS but one less mob is always helpful
---
I dont love SAP but some swear by it.  Its ok when it works, but overall it messes with pulls and can fail. 
---
DM shout and BS in def stance is really good for mass rage. 
---
on spider focus on 2 elite's and ask DPS to kill little one first, mark large ones for kill order. 
---
Ask for a druid HOT before pull, this helps make your heals not so critical if priest is getting attacked.
---
the difference between Good tanking and bad tanking is all about those little improvements and being the leader of the group. Mara is a cake walk to tank on a princess run there is only 1 4 mob pull, LBRS is a much different animal, so its where you start not doing the little things and you might struggle.
---
I mean, we want it. But they listened the the small group of shrieking spergs from shitty private servers crying about no changes.
---
He was asking if anyone else noticed how good arms is in dungeons, and I was just letting him know that we have haha. Most raiding warriors are fury for that exact reason
---
Call me crazy but I'm actually optimistic about Shadowlands. People are falling into this dichotomy of classic is better vs retail is better when the truth is somewhere in between. 
---
Classic has a more immersive world, better pacing of leveling, more of a community aspect and distinct classes that truly feel unique. However the end game is extremely underwhelming, the dungeons are way too simple and the raids are really boring
---
Retail has a lot more endgame content and replayability, more interesting dungeons and raids, and more things to do in general to give people incentive to log on. However class uniqueness and sense of community are lacking. 
---
I'm hoping Blizzard can take the failure of BFA and the positive feedback from Classic to heart in their next expansion. A game that offers retail's endgame with Classic's pacing, class identities and sense of community would be spectacular. Hopefully the Classic experiment will let them identify what people were right to be complaining about and what was just nostalgia goggles
---
It boggles my mind also. How is it people can say ‚ÄúWell, Vanilla is easy‚Äù and in the same breath they min/max cookie cutter and shit on meme specs for not being competitive. Viable is not competetive, viable is par for completing the game, and these specs have been mathed out with current day knowkedge to not run out of mana and do enough dps.
---
You're telling me the song released in 1964 wasn't actually about the state of modern day Classic WoW? Sure, buddy.
---
you can turn off item loot, but not specific qualities of item loot.
---
At this point i don't even think they're trolls, there's like 100+ names i instantly recognize now because when a certain topic gets brought up they get so triggered they just fly about the thread leaving 30+ insulting comments and leaving thinking they've won because people simply downvoted and ignored them.
---
The community just has a ton of braindead trash.
---
That's just untrue. They perpetuated the issue with free transfers for underpopulated faction and now we have majority servers that are super unhealthy like stalag skeram and heartseeker. Faction transfers may be the only solution long term, tho it sucks.
---
Which is why I said use reck + dw.
---
&gt; To be fair, the Warlock runs were PUG runs advertised on steam as being shameless loot funnels and that he'd be taking any relevant gear.
---
Not tuned into streamer culture, but I can't for the life of me imagine wanting to be on some dude's stream bad enough to agree to this.
---
‚ÄúThis patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which may be enabled at a future date.‚Äù  
---
Wooo. It‚Äôs coming in the future.
---
If you upload your census data we can get more accurate representations! I also think it's because P2 is so ruthless for Alliance. If you see past week and 2 weeks there's a big difference.
---
Have you looked at what upgrades you'd like to target and where they drop? You might find, for example, Dire Maul East has three upgrades you want. In which case, I'd say to go there, even if Scholo has better XP.
---
This is canon now. Nothing else explains it so well.
---
Wondering if any of these people complaining have ever considered just choosing a better class?
---
I doubt it will, Horde will face much longer queues.  They'll still camp things.
---
Queues were bad in vanilla (30-60 min on Mal'Ganis) so even with cross realm I can't imagine it being much better.
---
&gt; Keyring
---
&gt; The key button in your micro menu now opens your Keyring, an additional bag for keys only, that scales up to hold 32 keys.
---
finally.
---
Their choice is farming honor, the game just incentivizes making the game unplayable for the smaller faction in order to do so. 
---
Considering how "people are responsible for their actions" why isn't blizzard responsible for implementing a fucked up honor system without any actions to balance it? What course of action should you suggest for me, a player whose server was fairly balanced untill flamelash refugees came and made the server alliance dominated and nearly unplayable for the people who rolled on the server? Keep in mind, I can't transfer to another server because there are no transfers available. 
---
Is this the alliance players fault? Or are they just playing a game which requires delicate faction balance in order to make wpvp work, and the developers of the game give no fucks about the experience? Holding the players accountable for the imbalance of the servers is just naive and does not address any issues whatsoever, hence a shit take on the comment I replied to.
---
400 dps is about what you will pull with pre BIS and proper rotation. 
---
With consumes, 500. World buffs, 700-800. 
---
Past that it‚Äôs on the raid.
---
FINALLY
---
So, for example:
---
Head: Hemlet A - 100 dps  
---
Helmet B - 95 dps  
---
Helmet C - 88 dps
---
Thunderfury, and it'll never happen.
---
It‚Äôll be interesting to see how bgs work on flamelash
---
Coming tmrw! Just announced
---
It's logical to those who don't want to PvP every second they're playing the game. Sometimes after a long day of work I just want to do some low energy things like level an alt or farm herbs. Or maybe I just want to do some co-op PvE content with friends where we can take intermittent breaks if we need to.
---
I'm not saying a PvE server is strictly better. I'm saying if you're someone who will get frustrated by PvP when you're not trying to PvP, just roll on a PvE server and turn on PvP when you're feeling frisky.
---
You're acting like no one goes raid spec for raids.  I'd rather farm gold for an hour or two and be good for respecs for a month than have a 3hr MC clear every week because everyone is pvp spec all the time.
---
You're basically arguing casual vs semi serious vs hardcore raiding though.  It's a matter of viewpoints.  I've been in a 5hr MC before.  I have no inclination to sit through that bullshit ever again.  I'd rather play with people who are at least a little bit serious about what we're doing, but hey you do you.
---
The first time I got ganked, I released spirit, went back to my corpse and watched the fucker who killed me. While waiting patiently in spirit form until he got in a bad situation, respawned, fucked him in the ass and then camped him for 20 minutes.
---
I think that guy might have deleted his character due to the trauma I inflicted on him.
---
At the same time, our current agricultural production is not sustainable. We are currently using the land at a rate that we would have to spread it over 3 times the area. This is why everything is becoming a desert.
---
So in actuallity to become sustainable, we would have to decrease food production to a level on which we can only feed 4 billion people, if we were to perfectly use up the food.
---
I am not hardcore about #NOCHANGES but the obvious problem is Retail is the result of these changes and Retail is exactly what we don't want. At least people who are mad about Classic can go play Retail. If they turn Classic into Retail I am quitting again. Classic isn't perfect but it is the only thing around like it.
---
Its fking hilarious that you are just copy-pasting that crap onto so many posts. You have no self-awareness at all.
---
You don't need a second CL because NT, LB, ND, CL deletes everyone.
---
Nah we're actually fine. Alliance on  a 45/55 server that's horde favored. Lots of alliance pvping constantly and controlling areas, it's great fun. You're delusional if you  think that battlegrounds won't heavily decrease world pvp. Also I personally have no problems with the state of world pvp, this is what I expected and this is what I signed up for.
---
Paid transfers but no paid faction change? I hope they will add a paid faction change later.
---
Every server has everyone going all out to farm as much honor as possible. On balanced servers, there are tons of alliance players in horde citites and tons of horde players in alliance cities. It's a good way to farm honor. They're playing the game optimally and by the rules blizzard set out.
---
The people (both factions) on Flamelash got absolutely fucked by blizzard ineptitude. The most 2 brain cell thing is to blame any of the players for this issue
---
Before being on the minority faction in P2, I thought this was the solution. However, I don't think it is anymore. If BGs are less efficient than the unfun tactics that ruin the minority faction's game time (camping FP, BRM, etc), then the majority will continue to do that. The minority faction almost needs BGs to be the best honor to get the people ruining everyone elses fun out of the open world and into their capital, where they can no-fun grind their r14 set without ruining anyone else's fun.
---
Well sir take my upvote in your efforts, o7
---
We make up for it by knowing the optimal strats. Unlike vanilla. Say what you will about retail. But at least the fights are more mechanically complex.
---
I have the least overheal of all the priests, and 0 overheal on GHeal. I know how to use the spells lol.
---
My worst overheal is renew (as you'd expect) at 20%. The thing is though that 20% overheal is worth it on a spell that's 200% efficient (w.r.t. flash heal).
---
‚Äú Always take the most efficient way of farming Honour as a currency. ‚Äú
---
Wouldn't it be infinitely easier with weak auras?
---
I really disagree . There is still some skill involved. I regularly out dps other furies in my raid by 200-400 dps and we have similar gear and buffs.
---
Even without world buffs can pull 600-800 dps.
---
if it was blizzard fault it would happen to everyone and you'd see regular QQ'ing about it on reddit / official forum.
---
you're pretty much the only one I've seen talking about it.
---
You really wouldn't want to play with pre-1.12 skills TBH, they fucking sucked
---

I think you are kind of discrediting your point. It‚Äôs either #nochanges or #changes. You can‚Äòt have #onlygoodchanges, because you can‚Äòt exactly know how your change will impact the game beforehand. BC had a massively different gameplay compared to vanilla: Resillience, Arena, Heroics, Flying mounts, Dailies, Quest hubs. Dot limit removal, massive class changes, making each spec at least somewhat viable in raids, shattrah, tokens, emblems etc.
---
Wpvp is for the absolute worst people. It's not pvp, it is deliberately chasing a unfair fight. They can't cut it in arena or bgs so they have ruin everyone else's day.
---
No. It wasn't. People thought it was because they thought they had to wear their "class sets" because they just assumed Blizzard knew what they were doing, but 1.1 "BiS" is a bunch of random level 45-60 quest rewards, crafted items, and dungeon drops, with a few +element greens where you can afford it, especially in the offhand because they mistakenly had like 4x the stat budget of what they were supposed to have. There were also blue dungeon drops with random affixes that could have +element damage that would require a ton of grinding.
---
It was pouring raining in Strat UD yesterday, not sure if I've seen that before.
---
All good. 
---
This system is very close to the current system in retail and essentially a sharding/layering 2.0. And if you dont or can't understand the problems behind those systems, maybe classic isnt the game for you. Retail is a good game and you dont have to like classic.
---
Its healthier than ever IMO. 
---
. 
---
IF YOU'RE ON A PVE SERVER HAHAHAHAHAHAHA SUCK IT
---
I think at this point it's easier to forget about the key unless there's BiS pieces you also want in LBRS. I absolutely lived in there trying to get those pants. I've run that place more than any other zone.
---
By the time I had all the gems for that key, I had my epic mount, every piece of dungeon loot I wanted, and was revered with AD just from occasionally taking a break from LBRS to run Scholo or strat. It's barely mattered. I think I've used it twice since, and if I didn't have it, there's usually someone selling key services for 5G.
---
Uh... #NoChanges is definitely about doing things differently. Cross server BGs was a very good thing for wow. There is a reason it has never been changed back.
---
No place is a bit strong. I'm not saying fury is equal to MS, MS is the clear winner. But fury is a viable choice for someone who doesn't want to respec every week for raiding. It's not the best, bit it's not dogshit like specing prot for PvP.
---
But it wasn't like this on live. How did they fix it 15 years ago but not now?
---
The number of times my max rank NS heal didn't land because of batching IS TOO DAMN HIGH.
---
Ah yes, blame the victims. Those damn alliance just needed to learn how to enjoy being a corpse. It‚Äôs World of Corpsecraft after all.
---
Oof, I tried tanking scholo at 59 and it was rough. Might be better to just grind LBRS to 60 then.
---
Paid faction changes were not a thing until Wrath. 
---
I know balance sucks ass, but we don't need this
---
So not only are the alliance significantly outnumbered but the 2 horde races with the best pvp racials are the most played, and the 2 alliance races with the best pvp racials are the least played. On top of that the generic "but alliance have paladins" statement is hardly even a factor as only 2% of the players play them
---
 Psss is a fucking moron from the looks of it.
---
you do not have an accurate view of reality / do not remember stuff properly.
---
no further explanation are possible.
---
Battleground are not server specific
---
Nice - I'm gonna have to farm BSH for my offhand.
---
Thank for taking the time to give more info &lt;3
---
Prot spec?
---
Most of the good players have been 60 for 2 months or so, and have BiS farming done. The new 'gatekeeping' about REQUIRING BiS to do simple things like PUG MC are likely these boomer dads that just hit 60 and think the game is way harder than it actually is. They mistake their lack of time to play for difficulty. 
---
Also they were Naxx raiders 15 years go, when they peaked.
---
I don't even use a single piece shaman can't use..
---
&gt; we‚Äôre making a change to disallow calling C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage with the CHANNEL ChatType. This will prevent addons from communicating over custom, player-created chat channels.
---
HonorSpy nerfed? Spy nerfed again now that it can't share data with other players?
---
I agree that TBC is the best *baseline* version of the game (mix of QoL features and keeping the spirit of vanilla) although my favorite version is WotLK.
---
I don't agree that flying is a negative feature though as someone who doesn't give a crap about WPvP
---
Lol nah.. itll be fine. People are only not logging in cuz wpvp. That‚Äôll change on Tuesday.
---
Tragedy of the commons kind of works if you think of the other faction as a natural resource.
---
"ACKCHYUALLY...."
---
Please don't be that guy, private servers don't matter.
---
If a horde players queue is 10-15 mins they can't really get much roaming in. Certainly not randomly camping boats, BRM, leveling zones like Tanaris/Ungoro/Feralas, FPs other than LHC...in between each queue pop. 
---
The majority of the open world will see a huge decrease in hostilities for most players, since it's the most hardcore minority of honour farmers who are causing the most chaos. And they will spend 75% of their time instanced away.
---
Yes, you just eat too much damage at 59, esp if you‚Äôre not well geared.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt paid transfers make faction balance much worse. Like why wouldn‚Äôt most of the ally on stalagg, Fairbanks, even Faerlina just transfer off? It‚Äôs not 15 years ago. Most of us are adults and can spend the money on a transfer. I just don‚Äôt see how paid transfers would make anything better
---
Yeah, sure, it's just cheaper to pay one-time fee than pay a subscription for the 2nd account.
---
You misunderstood me.  If you're not in a city, you won't be able to see people spamming LFG requests in Trade chat anymore with the addon.  Other than that, it doesn't do anything useful with the addon channel.
---
My keybinds aren't too aggressive yet, still re-adjusting to having a bunch.  Here's my current setup, slowly adjusting to adding in more keys:
---
I use 1-5, R, F, then all of those with shift modifiers
---
M3 is frost shield/evasion for my mage/rog
---
M4 is blink/sprint
---
M5 is push-to-talk

 With [the release of World of Warcraft Classic 1.13.3 9](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-1-13-3-patch-notes/384542), we‚Äôre making a change to disallow calling C\_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage with the CHANNEL ChatType. This will prevent addons from communicating over custom, player-created chat channels. 
---
Looks like honorspy will be broken by this. Potentially other addons? Not sure how KTM/recount etc. communicates
---
Also is this time same for EU as NA? They said it would release same time right?
---
Ten Storms is a really decent realm.
---
Do you really think that only bracket 1 players have been ganking Fps, boats, cities and brm endlessly ?
---
BG grind will take less time for those who are in bracket 1 and stay in bracket one. Which on a server like mograine as an example is 6 people on alliance.
---
Pretty fucking sure there has been vastly more griefers than what the top 3 brackets are.
---
The entire point is that 90% of the people who made the world unplayable to the minority faction are have 0 chance of reaching rank 11 or higher.
---
The only thing they managed was to recude player count on their server and make horde bg ques longer, congrats.
---
You want to punish everyone for the actions of a minority. When BGs come out you'll end up fighting people over farming spots, that easily ends with killing the same person over and over, you want to punish that.   
---
Server imbalance is the issue here, that's what brings forth toxic behavior, a full on punishment for killing players on PvP realm is not the solution.  
---
So, reroll PvE.
---
Except the huge increase to server capacity that allowed every single poi to be camped all day every day.
---
\#prettybigfuckingchange
---
I hope Spy is completely dead now
---
No one's arguing about the ease of the farm, it's more of the principle that knowing your BIS item for the life of the game is from a Lv30 dungeon is fucking terrible design
---
As a Warrior I personally hate having to downgrade to different Armor Classes because it feels bad but for some slots there are literally no better epic item options until we get to later raid tiers
---
Probably sitting in the back of World PvP. Sniping.
---
Well yeah it was a trainwreck of a run on my alt, but my point still stands.  Specs make a huge difference, the content is do-able without but it's disingenuous to imply they don't matter.
---
OK. It's to stop neckbeard rogues ganking low level players in towns. 
---
Nothing to do with the lore, simply a measure put into the game by Blizzard to stop stupid behaviour and increase the enjoyment of the main game for the people who want to enjoy it.
---
This is a pathetic example of assuming something about someone you know nothing about
---
IF ganking is quite literally the opposite of "beating up on people who can't fight back".
---
In IF, you can *only* fight people who *want* to fight. If you get ganked in IF, it was your choice.
---
Huh. Maybe you guys just have more 60s then. Or maybe our 60s are being tards and camping lowbie zones. I'd also take ironforge.pro with a grain of salt
---
That‚Äôs what it looks like. I believe this should stop honorspy
---
&gt; This patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which may be enabled at a future date. 
---
No Changes
---
You're under the false impression that the majority of the playerbase are hardcore raiders or have ever played the game at all before Classic.
---
wPvP hurr durr
---
just admit you have a micropenis already and save yourself the trouble of camping all day
---
I‚Äôm 2 bars from 60 and I was there for the chaos of launch day and the brutality when P2 launched. #slowandsteady
---
Btw they also changed how tab targeting works, which can lead to easier accidental pulls. It can target the next pack more easily now, at least that's what I've noticed. So it seems worse than vanilla tab targeting.
---
&gt; I just don‚Äôt see how paid transfers would make anything better
---
If Activision making more money doesn't make the world better then I don't want to be right
---
If you gank my 39 pally I‚Äôm gonna bring my 40 boomkin to fuck you up!
---
Omg its christmas already!
---
Many European countries (particularly the germanic and slavic ones) feature a mythical figure alongside Saint Nicholas called [Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus), which is basically a demonic, goat-like servitor who acts as Santa's "wrestling heel" and punishes and/or terrorizes misbehaved children. This appears to be a Christmas celebration with the bearded man as Saint Nick (who wears a bishop hat and often either pure white or a mixture of white and red in places like Austria), the two women as his angels, the grey-hatted man as‚ÄîI assume‚Äîthe woodsman, and then a cavalcade of Krampus costumers.
---
Christmas is much more interesting across the pond is what I'm saying.
---
Aside from set tier pieces is it really that terrible of a difference in gear stats? Anyone considering this transition would have to accept that not all their gear would be applicable anyways just given the nature of being forced to switch classes
---
No XP
---
caster damage is nearly double what it was back in real vanilla.
---
It appears that the comment I replied to is stating that players in that demographic are clearing MC this fast in classic.
---
Plus, didn't the revolt come about on account of not being paid?   
---
So, he's working with goblins now. Honestly, killing bad nobles, working with goblins, and prioritizing getting paid is every PCs life. He's one of us. Unfortunately, he flagged red.
---
Kodo ist the best Mount! My Undead mage is riding one :-)
---
I actually just tried this and they denied me, saying they couldn‚Äôt swap quest rewards. Based on your story,  I might try again.
---
Any serious BG premade running gank squads now is not the same as gank squads having serious premades.
---
Considering that there are more people in searing gorge alone ganking compared to what fits into to the 11-14 brackets its pretty obvious most people didnt think about this shit at all.
---
Or are you telling me that only 1.4% of the horde population took part  in the absolute destruction of Flamelash Alliance ?
---
you can, no one is going to be camping them inside cities
---
Make a makro for all aspects/traps. There are 4 relevant, which means no modifier, shift, ctrl, alt. 6 less slots you will need.
---
So? Stopping the other side from queueing even just on your server is still going to slow down the queues. Cross-realm isn't a magical solution for all queue problems.
---
Hard to really feel bad for this consider there is about 10 ally 20 yards away just deciding to do nothing about it. Not to mention you can be safe in your City if you just dont flag for pvp
---
It's generally frowned upon as you would likely be rolling against another classes BiS for you to get a "hold me over" item.
---
I mean, Blizzard also had support staff in Europe so what you're saying can't be true. Or do you think they flew out a bunch of French, German and Spanish people to sit in Texas and work European hours?
---
i really like your enemy health bars with debuffs on top!
---
It's actually impossible to trap players inside the capital, or kill them against their will.
---
If you die in IF as an Alliance player that was 100% your choice. Why is this so difficult for players to understand?
---
More Spy and HonorSpy nerfs here too. Addons can't communicate across custom chat channels anymore. They can post to guild, party, whisper channels but not custom, player created channels now.
---
Faction queues with free faction change. Want to not have to deal with huge queue times? Fix the problem yourself.
---
Agreed.
---
What I mean is that a total open world where you and the other faction can simply kill one another any time without restriction. It creates a unique experience that I was looking forward to having back but it's become quickly apparent that this won't happen. Players just don't act the same now as they did then, with so many only needing the excuse of "the game lets me so it's fine".
---
I mean for example as annoying as having a level 60 one shot you out in the world.. it made it a certain experience, a dangerous one where you always had to be on the lookout. If you were careful and sneaky you could get by in it. Big raids of the other faction were *exciting* rather than a sigh before logging out because why bother?
---
That won't come back. Other games will do what they've been doing for years and make more and more restrictive/opt in PvP experiences. They might be fun, but they'll never be what vanilla WoW was. It absolutely wasn't perfect and some of the shitty aspects we have today absolutely existed back then, but it was a hell of a lot more fun then than now.
---
silly laugh dude is my favorite ofc
---
Yeah we know that now.  No one knew anything back then.  sp was re-itemized later which made a big difference to casters.
---
yeah, bulwark was always my regular gank spot and in classic it's bad
---
I straight up said that they're welcome if it's room for them. 
---
Having too many memespecks ruins the fun for all, as it turns a terribly boring instance to an even longer session. 
---
I don't find there to be a lack of shamans, but that's anecdotal. All our shamans raid as 30/0/21 which is pretty much the optimal PvP spec anyway.
---
I mean, farming 1000g is definitely easier/faster than getting rank 11.
---
Couldn't I just buy it off the AH?
---
I dont think this hits honorspy. Maybe the honorspy print, but that is easily mended.  
---
This will break the LFG addon. It will no longer spam lfg channel for ppl.
---
&gt;This patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which may be enabled at a future date.
---
Ruining servers by not supporting anything that could have balanced out the population just to cash in when the servers are completely fucked. I see I see
---
Paid transfers were a thing by the end of vanilla.
---
very clean!
---
Yes if everyone set up a queue and got the bare minimum honor each week to guarantee a rank up this could have been avoided...
---
Unfortunately thats naive as fuck and blizz fucking up by having huge server caps are the problem not people playing the game within its own rules (farm honor if you want to rank)
---
If that were the case they would only engage after the rogue attacked a player, as they behave in neutral towns.
---
Yeah but I thought the point of PvE server was to avoid this, am I missing something? Which player is PvP flagged in your scenario
---
Cool contribution thank you. It‚Äôs been written down and made into an ornament for my Christmas tree I promise.

**Law of truly large numbers**
---
The law of truly large numbers (a statistical adage), attributed to Persi Diaconis and Frederick Mosteller, states that with a large enough number of samples, any outrageous (i.e. unlikely in any single sample) thing is likely to be observed. Because we never find it notable when likely events occur, we highlight unlikely events and notice them more. The law is often used to falsify different pseudo-scientific claims, as such it and its use is sometimes criticized by  fringe scientists.The law is meant to make a statement about probabilities and statistical significance: in large enough masses of statistical data, even minuscule fluctuations attain statistical significance.

**Statistics**
---
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as "all people living in a country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.
---
**Adage**
---
An adage (; Latin: adagium) is a concise, memorable, and usually philosophical aphorism that communicates an important truth derived from experience, custom, or both, and that many people consider true and credible because of its longeval tradition, i. e. being handed down generation to generation, or memetic replication.
---
An adage sometimes implicates a failure to plan, such as "do not count your chickens before they hatch" and "do not burn your bridges".
---
**Persi Diaconis**

Persi Warren Diaconis (; born January 31, 1945) is an American mathematician of Greek descent and former professional magician. He is the Mary V. Sunseri Professor of Statistics and Mathematics at Stanford University.He is particularly known for tackling mathematical problems involving randomness and randomization, such as coin flipping and shuffling playing cards.
---
**Frederick Mosteller**
---
Charles Frederick Mosteller (December 24, 1916 ‚Äì July 23, 2006), usually known as Frederick Mosteller, was one of the most eminent statisticians of the 20th century. He was the founding chairman of Harvard's statistics department, from 1957 to 1971, and served as the president of several professional bodies including the Psychometric Society, the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the International Statistical Institute.

RIP your faction imbalanced servers. Alliance and the heartseeker horde are going to flamelash the shit out of that paid transfer.
---
I‚Äôm decently geared, I have mitigation pre raid BiS for both rings, helm, shoulders, legs, 1 trinket,  neck and belt. Decent weapon and shield too. My threat may be somewhat low with all mitigation stuff on
---
WOOOOO KEYRING!!!
---
yep, I do suck. I dont have enough experience and practice, and I am basing my knowledge from skirmishes by level 60 players against my 50's ass.
---
But give me scenarios of how this can prove very useful. After nova you are still slowed, so even if you break out and intercept, it doesn't seem like a huge advantage but idk.
---
I didn‚Äôt camp too hard but once a 19 twink irritated me so much, I went to battle masters on my rogue and murdered them outright a few times
---
You're kidding right? Please don't be that guy. Have you not seen how much games have advanced in the last 25 years as the budgets have increased to the hundreds of millions?
---
So what you're saying in that Raid DPS increased over the 15 year gap because magically players improved at the game, and not because of patches that DIRECTLY effected HOW you play the game?   Yeah, you're one of those delusional WoW players you're talking about.
---
100% agree with you. Blizzard should have monitored the characters factions choices and lock servers before incredible imbalance issues like this occur.
---
raided with probably 30 different mages so far and probably 25 of them were arcane power. Weird how we have such different results haha
---
I'm sure it will. Rooting for ya!
---
There was nothing to fix 15 years ago, because individual zones weren't sharded. For some reason they are now, much to the detriment of my Mind Vision.
---
If you think it's because of my shitty cpu, that.. kinda literally proves my point. I have a top-end cpu. And this is something that's happening to everybody on my server. It's also something that did not happen back in the day when I was playing on a literal potato. 
---
So if this is your line of work (which I'm 99% sure it isn't), then you aren't very good at your job bud!
---
Peace ‚ô•
---
No mines but crap loads of herbs.
---
Nightwatch.
---
This breaks honorspy cause it uses chat channels to sync updates to the ladder
---
The topic at hand is the fact that 90% of all these pvp farmers arent going to come anywhere near the top 1.4% so making the world unplayable to minority faction was pretty much pointless.
---
Yeah it matters for 0.1% of the total pvp population, wupdi fucking doo. Do you think it was that 0.1% who destroyed annihilated Flamelash Alliance ?
---
OP says streamers sometimes use their audiences to get ahead. You respond disagreeing with him and saying you're frustrated. 
---
&gt;don't know why people are getting upset about this
---
????
---
Can you provide some examples? As someone who was there, none of these complaints existed other than the ganking ones, and even then they aren't of this magnitude or scale.
---
" The higher your potential dps (ap based) the higher the value of crit. "  
---
By the same argument, the higher your crit, the higher the value of AP. 30 AP = 1 crit is the golden rule.
---
I know that it's probably required given servers such as flamelash exist, but i wish we weren't getting crossrealm bgs.
---
Agreed. Only half of the people who play this game should be allowed to have fun with it.
---
I pray one day people realize there is more to your character than sitting at number one on the PVE dps meter. For example, rolling Fury warrior puts you at a serious disadvantage for world pvp. The beauty of Classic wow is every class has a role to play, whether its high PVE dps, Windfury, raid buffs, etc. Your point about everyone chosing Mage/War is only accurate for those who share the same in game goals. #Nochange is great because it makes classic similar to the SAT. Everyone takes the same test, but it is up to the player to be distinguishable, in whatever way they chose.
---
It is both but you really don't understand how bad people were back then dude.
---
Keyboard turning, not doing things that are seen as normal now mechanics wise, using trinkets, cooldowns, etc.
---
People have 15 years of gaming behind them, newer players are better than most normal even above normal players back then.
---
Also, and this is the biggest one, people have actual decent internet now. The majority of people back in the early WoW days played with I would guess average 100-300 ping. Which makes far more of a difference than you think.
---
Ah, that makes a ton of sense and I can see why the creators may have included it.  Or how it accidentally came through.  Unfortunate that it is getting pulled though.
---
Patches and updates are always on Tuesdays, so it's gonna be tomorrow 100%.
---
I didn't know saying something with a caveat is straight up saying something,  but that's besides the point. 
---
If your raid has so many meme specs that it ruins the fun for everyone else then a good chunk of your guild wants that.   I can see it getting out of hand if a guild needs healers or tanks or debuffs aren't done well.
---
But as long as we're talking 'reasonable' as in not impacting the completion of a raid then who cares?  So you bring a ret, a boomkin, a spriest and you'll likely finish at a very similar pace since a lot raid time isn't actually killing bosses, but trash.
---
That‚Äôs a high elf :)
---
More honor then BGs?
---
Thanks for replying! what does the M refer to in those last three binds? Mouse?
---
You‚Äôll need arcanite keys for anything that high
---
Can you link where you see it on logs? From what I remember it doesn't show up so you'd have to set a weak aura set around your crit % to see when it's currently up
---
In that case, all horde are poachers from what I have experienced.
---
Thanks so much for the reply mate!
---
The honor system was delayed to a Thursday, remember?
---
said the ganker.
---
Blizzard's control: 
---
"That'll be $25 plz.*
---
Blame the rise of esports for this. Arenas was a giant mistake due to it too, Blizz wanted to get in on the ez event and sponsor money. So now we have a sideshow of gameplay where players should hypothetically have equal gear and stats and differentiate themselves only thru raw mechanical skill, shoehorned into a game all about players making patient and careful choices to differentiate themselves thru character progression. Well but Blizz there is no inherent progression in killing randoms out in the open world for no reason other than epeen bragging rights! I know, we'll give them points based on how many kills they rack up and titles to whoever can kill the most people! WCGW??
---
I understand, which is clear evidence that the game is designed around the war between the alliance and horde factions, which was the entire crux of my argument.
---
They HAD to corpse camp people the entire run to BRM and sit on flight points every hour of the day?
---
Based on...?
---
And who is/was out while leveling, farming, raiding and 5 mans, and who is online from my faction. You can see and feel the server slowly deteriorate, and the more people you talk to the more people who are fed up with being rolled 24/7 you meet. WS/felwood/WPL/EPL/silithus/gadget/feralas and both sides of BRM have been unreachable for the alliance for the past 2-3 weeks. On P2 release you could actually stroll through some of these zones and find alliance resistance, nowadays not so much. IF is also empty compared to what it was at P2 release
---
Rank 3 HT is 2 seconds long... and heals for about 550-600 when geared. Also cost 90 mana, no one can out snipe me.
---
Look at the spreadsheet
---
Honorspy, not Spy.
---
AN EIGHT HOUR MAINTENANCE?!?!
---
That's what you get if a few people get ganked (hint: happens on both factions) and instead of deciding that it's because it's a pvp server and the honor system is severely flawed, they decide to blame it on faction balance. Why? Because it is there.
---
Then they decide it's still easier to whine on Reddit than to work around it and try to get as many people as possible to transfer to another realm.
---
With that, they not only make their self-claimed "problem" worse on their server, they also create the same problem, even harder, on their new server.
---
That time around faction balance is not a problem on the new server because they're on the winning side. It's not a problem then, for them.
---
It's a giant whiny farce.
---
DM West is hot garbage to try and tank. You can do it but I hate that instance. If you have a mage or lock for CC then north is fine.
---
Based on the actions taken within the topic area we are discussing? Yes, yes they are. I can break it down for you mathematically for you if you like.  Care to provide counter evidence beyond anecdotes?
---
However morality is a subjective measure so we can just agree to disagree on what is or isnt good/bad behavior.
---
Thanks for the extensive answer, I forgot about those 5% from dagger talents in combat tree. Yeah I see now that more gear is required.
---
really?   So, which of the recent games can you link to with massive budgets from blizz?  Titan?
---
If your on high pop server and you wanna take the day off then id get on early and get in the que if needed
---
:/
---
Right. That's a 36 second fight. Look at the buff uptime. You're not competing at a 1:30 minute kill.
---
Review the first 18 and last 18 seconds of your fight.
---
You might find your DPS similar to his.
---
Or not! There can still be stuff to learn in his rotation, like bers rage to not get feared first time round
---
I missed that. welp.
---
So does your mom.
---
With all the issues retail has; it is definitely better than every other MMO.  Classic though... is just a plain and boring dead end.  I have played since release, so maybe if classic is a fresh experience, things might seem different. But for me, I‚Äôve been there and done that.  It was fun back in the day, but nowhere near it now.
---
(I get the blip too, but people will just tell me how terrible my computer is so I ignore it)
---
I did ask once, and someone said "Zone Change" and I said "Oh"
---
I think people don't complain about it because its negligible unless you're fighting right at the zone change I guess.
---
This is not as foolproof as you think. It just makes nobody die for 6 seconds. If your tank doesn't get to #1 threat in 6 seconds it wont help. If your tank DOES do that in 6 seconds, you probably don't need the LIPs anyways.
---
I do think bringing LIPs is a good idea, but your comment is heavily over simplifying/misleading
---
Pristine Black Diamonds will go up when ZG comes out
---
I would prefer my 80/20 med pop merge with a 20/80 med pop and if I have to deal with queues during peak times, so be it.
---
I'm going to print this comment out and frame it. The last line is so on point, like a case study into the mind of your average redditor.
---
&gt;With the release of World of Warcraft Classic 1.13.3 25, we‚Äôre making a change to disallow calling C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage with the CHANNEL ChatType. This will prevent addons from communicating over custom, player-created chat channels.
---
So, ClassifLFG uses a player-created channel. So it won't be able to advertise to itself anymore. Will probably take an overhaul of the add-on.
---
I played beta and release. I‚Äôm loving it. To each their own
---
I tried this out one day and was was VERY unimpressed by the amount of gold I got. Better off farming ore/herbs if you have proff or farm mobs for drops. At least farming mobs has a chance to drop rare/epic boe items.
---
Blizzards ‚Äúfix‚Äù that has been confirmed in the latest path notes, is paid character transfers.
---
‚ÄúYour server has to many opposite faction players on it? Well, just give us 50 bucks and you‚Äôll be on your way to a new server!‚Äù 
---
Classic blizzard, making people pay for a solution that they should be trying to fix.
---
True. But note they said it's enabled for later.
---
Knowing Blizz that probably means next week though
---
I think there is just something going on with my discord permisons or something. When I click on the class icon, nothing changes.
---
You're mistaken on both.
---
It will completely gut honorspy, as it relies on p2p database syncing.
---
It wont break clfg, you'll still be able to get notified on chats you're in, as well as autopublish groups to the LFG channel.  It just wont be able to talk to other clfg users (to show you a group from /trade while you are out in the world, for example, but I think that's a pretty minor impact personally since /lfg is already global).
---
Thanks for the reply! I like having Q and E as strafe so i don't really have those two at my disposal. I'm generally not a keyboard turner but i tried rebinding both of those and moving strafe to a-d but it just felt weird as hell to me so i switched back. Thanks for the input tho
---
Classic is 1.12 (or 1.13 now). that's it. wow classic is a finished game, and you can play it forever. that's what I plan to do personally. don't alter it, have it preserved. or you will ask for a classic classic in 10 years.
---
I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre waiting to see if BGs stop the subscriber loss. The fact that they moved up BGs and the posts about Flamelash are basically proof that A) people want to transfer off those servers and B) they can‚Äôt take so much more of this or they quit.
---
IMO the people camping flight paths and shit will continue to do it while queuing for BGs at a rate that while less than it was before would still convince the remaining players of whatever faction to transfer off.
---
No its clear evidence that Blizzard want PvP in the world controlled and as you have been told before in this thread the alliance and horde **are not at war**.
---
Saying the incorrect thing over and over doesnt make it correct.
---
I do this. It's like passive-aggressive PVP ;)
---
this is super helpful, thank you
---
Those were fake anyways. They were marked as civilians but never gave DHKs
---
How dare you judge me fatty
---
CLFG (or other LFG addons), and honorspy syncing via custom channels.
---
I think the math is pretty clear vs a 63 mob. In particular, I‚Äôm a tank and 3% hit is huge for every ability, actual weapon damage is minuscule compared to threat from abilities. So swords almost always worth it, even if there is for example 10+ DPS downgrade to use the sword.
---
As well, getting 9% hit without weapon skill would require significant trade offs from other gear.
---
Vs a level 60 mob, how much hit do I get for 305 weapon skill? AFAIK it‚Äôs less than 1%, so a tank would still want +5% hit for optimal threat.
---
I guess that the +5 weapon skill reduces dodges and parries by 0.2% each, so my abilities hit 0.4% more often from the weapon skill. Besides this, does weapon skill give any threat advantage vs a 60 mob?
---
It's been hard to watch people trip over themselves laughing at 'horde' drawings of what are obvious caricatures of people with disabilities or mental retardation. I guess sad, desperate, lonely people are adept at being able to benefit from the strife of others. 
---
I always thought as a kid that horde players were a meme but this subreddit has convinced me that ally players by and large are depressing, angry sadsacks.
---
It's an 8 hour maintenance!! 10am EST to 6pm EST!! 
---
I know they often inflate numbers, but that is insanely long.
---
Hey, all decisions have consequences. Ya chose the wrong faction. Me too, ya‚Äôall wanted the classic experience. And you‚Äôre getting it. There are options. Figure it out, or just keep posting memes on reddit whining about it.
---
Also WoW forums have been 90% complaints since the dawn of time. People having fun are busy playing the game having fun not crying about how the game isn't fair.
---
It's not going to do anything to spy.
---
I didn‚Äôt disagree that streamers can use their influence to get ahead. I even said they are the new versions of power hungry GM‚Äôs. I‚Äôm trying to explain, as a whole, this sub tends to view streamers as bad in general. What‚Äôs hard to grasp about that? As a serious question, I legitimately don‚Äôt understand why that‚Äôs a strange concept
---
Tomorrow!!!
---
And if raiding is important for those people, retail is the better option.
---
You can do LFR and pug normal raids without ever having to schedule things.
---
How do you know
---
Why the assumption that the best of everything has to be from a raid?
---
Arguably not even just a feral thing right now, when PvP options are considered. Though R14 is kind of cancer, it is technically an option.
---
Server pop is the biggest issue, even with a faction imbalance, it wouldnt be as noticeable as everywhere you go, you are getting camped. Vanilla servers were so much smaller than what we have. Sure if you went out to actively wPVP against the other faction (as in it was planned by both factions) the imbalance would be noticeable. But the fact you cannot go anywhere without running into X times more of the heavy faction vs the lighter faction, is due to server size. The smaller servers meant you were not able to even have these 400v400 battles, all the while BRM is camped by 200 of one faction, WPL has anohter 80 of the same faction, etc etc. The world didnt get bigger, the population did, therefore there is always a huge group "farming" honor anywhere you go, and if there is not, they will be there soon. 
---
Its over crowded, and by doing that, the faction imbalance consequences are on roids (corpse camping all the way to BRM, DM, EPL/WPL etc) therefore it seems like imbalance is the issue (but like you said, no matter what there will be imbalance) but in reality, server size is the issue. 
---
Purely anecdotal since I played on a med pop server in Vanilla times, but no one was camped nearly this bad in that time. But i cannot attest to the high pop servers back in the day.
---
What did spy do in custom channels?
---
I think it‚Äôs a catch-22 situation. The only other option would have been Blizzard micromanaging server communities (which seems to be a frequent request here) . Which - how do you even begin to approach that can of snakes? Faction specific queues + realm transfers?
---
Horde heartseeker will be fine. Much less alliance in the open world cause they‚Äôll all be in BGs. After all, they scrounging for honor in open world whereas BGs, it‚Äôs there. 
---
Stalagg Horde and other massively overpop horde servers are worse. Long BG queues and nobody to kill in open world.
---
I did it first try with 1 mana pot today and nothing else. If you never wing clip him, he never uses his fear ability.
---
There are ruins near AQ with 2 'floors', you can kite him up all the way, then down 1 floor, then jump down to ground floor and repeat. Using this strategy it was very very easy.
---
I respecced to get pathfinder for that extra speed while kiting. 
---
Try searching Youtube for a video of this strategy, there was even one with a naked hunter doing it (0% hit I guess).
---
Here is a link to one: https://youtu.be/7nhh23WnwNo
---
You got to remember to use rank 1 arcane shot to keep him from reseting, sometimes when you jump down he goes pretty far, heard of people failing because of that.
---
Edit: before you start, you should lay down a frost trap, pull him to activate it then reset with feign death. This removes his 'enrage' effect and if he catches up to you he wont hit as hard.
---
For now at least, MC is easy enough that we just schedule 42 or so. If we only have 35 its not a big deal.
---
Yeah it's based on a "census" meaning it's only getting data from people running their addon. Not accurate at all.
---
OK boomer
---
Yes but they announced a few days before.
---
I mean, this is the obvious answer. 
---
There has to be a reason it hasn't happened already.
---
From what I've gathered, yeah. I wish they'd either fix Mind Vision or edit the tooltip. It's some pretty bush league shit to have an inaccurate tooltip.
---
Tbh if you're running with different PuGs all the time I'd roll on whatever I can get.
---
The chances of the eye to drop combined with you winning it against different priests all the time is pretty low.
---
Faction queues + free transfers are the only real option moving forward. Paid transfers will only make server death a real thing.
---
It doesn't use the addon channel in any meaningful way.  99% of its functionality comes from just parsing chat channels (which isn't being changed).
---
excuse me sir you forgot to put a period at the end of your sentence
---
 i win, bye bye
---
There is a significantly higher percentage of gankers this time around
---
Rip
---
&gt; The lions under mufasa took great care Of their hunting grounds
---
and the hyenas under mufasa were constantly drooling and chewing on fossilized bones like some starved GULAG prisoners.
---
I love being on a PvE server.
---
Will we only be queing against others on our server only?
---
Human fury warrior, how does a slow offhand effect dps. For instance Viskag/Brutality blade vs Viskag/corehound if we ignore sword skill.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work here bud
---
imagine thinking tone couldn't be written
---
ClassicLFG uses a user created channel to sync LFGs for all players, no matter location. Do it **does** use it in a very meaningful way. 
---
Have you ever looked into the channel to see what's going on? I have. I then learned how it works.
---
It doesn't JUST parse trade or other public channels...  
---
Setting a password on the channel broke the add-on for a sever recently. Just check the add-ons comments
---
My current experience as I'm leveling an alt is getting killed by (parties of) twinks.
---
At that point I basically log to my main and kill them for a few hours.. because they make it impossible to level through questing..
---
Had a lvl 19 paladin twink (nearly unbeatable unless you 4 vs 1 him) consistently farm players in Stonetalon for several days, to the point where most people recognized him. If I got wind of this I would log and destroy him for a while until he could manage to log out, at which I'd swap back to my alt and safely level again..
---
Really fuck the people who KEEP farming people who just want to level.. ONCE, at most TWICE, is OK by me, you got your kill, maybe a little fight out of it (provided your not a twink because you'll probably dominate then) now just leave me alone to quest.
---
But nope, they keep going on.. And I will keep coming back to corpse farm them on my main until they learn..
---
Generally speaking, I‚Äôm not super impressed with the community on my server. I‚Äôve seen a lot of edgelord meme behavior and rampant bigoted speech going largely unchecked.  I‚Äôm not sure these people have the empathetic capacity to work together outside of instances of immediate short term personal gain.
---
They looked for you on dc.
---
Isn't Flamelash the one having an entire faction pilgrimage away from it because people got tired of exactly that situation? It's not creating a fun gameplay environment for the enemy faction if you farm them for honor like that, dude.
---
Hilarious how many spy haters don't even know what the addon does
---
&gt;I think people don't complain about it because its negligible unless you're fighting right at the zone change I guess.
---
That's sort of been me, but I've now I've died to it twice lol. Your character on the server (and everyone else's screen) is still stuck in the past zones for a couple of seconds, so if you're being chased by a group of players like 10-20 yds out of charge range of charge and pass through a zone, their warrior can charge and apply hamstring even though he was nowhere near you on your screen. 
---
So yeah, I made this post in frustration of literally dying due to sharding, which it apparently is, which was indeed not in real vanilla.
---
please god no
---
&gt;Battlegrounds are cross-realm, which means you‚Äôll fight alongside allies and against opponents from all of the realms in your region.
---
First confirmation I've seen of xrealm bgs :D
---
ALSO KEYRING CONFIRMED!
---
Damn American brats get coal while European kids get raped by boomkins?
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Transfer mid 2006 is ~1.12, think you mean faction swaps
---
if you still want to be able to tank then go Fury/Prot
---
0/31/20
---
it sucks not having tactical mastery, but this spec can put out respectable DPS and still tank any end game content
---
Wtf how with the pixels?
---
Screen ratio or something?
---
You can just give it a queue rather than a lock. The queue applies to each faction separately. I think that could do wonders for low-pop servers too.
---
there's exactly 1 alliance favored server and the rest are horde favored (pvp). your idea wouldnt work beyond fixing 2 servers (if the pop sizes are roughly equal)
---
Surprisingly few of us auction house goblins. 
---
A bank has 28 slots, plus seven bag slots. In addition, you have 16 backpack slots and 4 bag slots. Assuming one wishes a budget bank alt, and only uses Runecloth bags, and doesn't bother to unlock the last two slots, each bank alt can store 170 items. 
---
So, storing 1.7k stacks of items is fairly easily acheivable. In practice, the main usually needs some storage forother things, but a \*great\* deal of additional munchkinry is possible thanks to the mail system and auction house. Each character can have 50 mail items displayed. However, total capacity is far beyond that, and I believe it, like auctions, to be arbitrarily large. 
---
So, technically, the answer is one. One account.
---
the shitshow that would come with everyone raging about having to change their names is prob the reason
---
100g is crazy cheap for lion heart with one pattern. We have 4-5 on our server and no one charges less than 100 and some are at 150 still.
---
When they revamped the riding system prior to TBC faction specific riding skill was no longer a thing, just the mounts themselves required rep to buy. This was the same time they made it so riding skill was a much more expensive and the mounts themselves were much cheaper.
---
Based on how thorough your recollection is I feel fairly confident that you're not full of shit. The other guy is either recalling how it was at the end of Vanilla or how it worked on private servers. (His description is definitely how it functioned on private servers.)
---
The problem is no ally are going to take a server transfer TO that server that‚Äôs already horde dominated.  
---
Ally struggle everywhere and they‚Äôre not going to go from one sinking ship to another. 
---
They would take a transfer to a 50/50 at worst or ally dominated at best
---
&gt;Why the assumption that the best of everything has to be from a raid?
---
Because the hardest content *should* reward the best items?
---
&gt;Though R14 is kind of cancer, it is technically an option.
---
Getting R14 is "harder" and more time consuming than raiding
---
I fully agree with faction queues. Faction queues would completely solve the problem on pretty much all servers.
---
I don't see the benefit of free transfers over paid transfers tho (unless you mean restricted free transfers like they had recently). Why would paid transfers make server death real?
---
every pvp server but 1 is horde favored. the reason is that there are just far more horde pvp server players than alliance. we can go into the reasons, but that will never change if they dont change the game to fix the imbalances (not likely) or add a queue.
---
Prioritize yourself and the tank and let the DPS die if you have to. They will either learn to chill out or they'll run up their repair bills.
---
Last night I tanked UD Strat with a bunch of trigger Happy DPS and it was so bad I just ignored them a lot of the time. As long as I'm keeping the enemies off the healer then I'm doing my job. The problem is that Healers will waste their mana on bad DPS and then they're OOM when I need it. That's when wipes happen. When the DPS die we rez them after the fight. When the tank dies, the group wipes.
---
No. That's not how math works
---
If I increase 100 dps by 1 dps, I get 101 dps
---
If I increase 200 dps by 1 dps, I get 201 dps
---
If I increase 100 dps by 1%, I get 101 dps
---
If I increase 200 dps by 1% I get 202 dps
---
Crit, which is a percentage increase, will scale with the damage you already have. 
---
Ap, which is a flat increase, will not scale with the damage you already have. 
---
It's really difficult to spell it out more than this. If you don't get it at this point I simply have to say you need to study math more, or stop answering theoretical questions based on math. You are spreading false information
---
To be fair STV is all about questing and pvp. 
---
However as long as you stay away from the hotspots you should be fine for moat of the questing
---
Provide the data source you would like me to use(so you cant use that as a cop out later) and I would be happy to!
---
also, tell me which assumptions you would like me to use/not use(like in a geometric proof) so again, you get to set the parameters so there are fewer cop-outs available to you later. I have given you all the tools you need to win the argument! Seems only fair.
---
Only one I ask is that we agree that, on average, 5 players will be 4.
---
Across all servers there are more Horde than Alliance. 
---
Horde will have to wait to be randomly matched against the smaller pool of Ally while Ally get instant queues since there will always be Horde waiting for a new game to start.
---
How long those queues will be in reality no one can say, probably 15-20 mins?
---
ppl already knew who he was, aint hard to find his comment on the most upvoted post on the forums
---
Man it's a fucking shit update from blizzard again.
---
 ‚ÄúThis patch includes client support for the Paid Character Transfer service, which may be enabled at a future date.‚Äù 
---
"MAY" be enabled... wtf man. They should release it right now. Atleast let us try to balance the shitfest out ourselfs now. I have seen to many people quitting. I want that to end.
---
BG's gonna be a total joke. With Afkers leeching honor and premades camping graveyards and no one will wanna participate in that aswell. 
---
If blizzard doesn't address the population problem they created here. NOTHING WILL CHANGE. 
---
And this patch is the last chance they have before all players who are discontent now will permanently QUIT the game. The dead of Classic WoW.
---
Just give the transfers this patch now!
---
thats the symptom, not the problem . stop complaining about players just trying to find pvp on a dead server and realise its blizzards fault for letting alliance migrate off the server. its so simple
---
Ah ok I thought they meant raid because I don't even think of master looter in the context of a 5 man. Definitely understandable in that case haha.
---
[Blizz when they open up Character Transfers](https://i.imgur.com/y5GKqwU.gifv)
---
Many servers will die on one side if not both, but Blizz will make so, so much money off of this that it's basically a guaranteed future feature.
---
Do you honestly believe this? How can anyone have such insane conviction about something they‚Äôre so wrong about? Paid transfers were in original vanilla.
---
I said twice already in this comment thread that its only use is for min max parsing :(
---
God, look at all those stupid ass names. Why does 85% of the playerbase think their names are cool or clever with names like Analgames?
---
Paid server transfers are a Vanilla feature. Maybe you're thinking of the expansion to that feature that allowed transfers from PvE to PvP? Although even that was Burning Crusade. Faction Change was Wrath though, I think.
---
Being the first in my friend group to hit 60. Then it‚Äôs on to BGs, couldn‚Äôt care less about dungeons and raids.    
---
Level 58 so far so looks like I‚Äôm going to get there this side of Xmas.    
---
Might look to make a Twink as well.
---
Patch 1.12 introduced battlegroups, yes.
---
Valid
---
Blizzard is the developer.
---
&gt;Anyone that lists that as a positive moves right to the top of my list of people who probably suck. Sorry, being able to grief people/get griefed by others is NOT a positive/beneficial thing by any normal thought process.
---
Damn, I guess the entire playerbase of Eve Online is a bunch of freaks with non-normal thought processes who suck at games
---
Nothing like using your personal preference and playstyle to make yourself feel better and more just than somebody else
---
this sub is embarrassing
---
What's fucked up is that Blizzard is the one that caused some servers to have terrible faction imbalance yet they won't do a dam thing to fix the issue. Players that were left behind on these servers will either have to quit, start over on 
---
a different server, or give Blizzard money to solve something they should be doing for free.
---
Too had that Classic WoW is such a good game (mostly) because it pains me to give money to such a terrible company.
---
I mean, there's no other way to earn honor so it's not entirely their fault.
---
One needs only to examine vanilla patch notes to realize that itemization is one of the biggest changes between Classic and early Vanilla. Gear just fucking sucked in the early days.
---
The fabled afterlife gank, what madness.
---
every class at 60
---
thus, anyone who rolls on a pvp server is signing up to get ganked
---
you cant complain about getting ganked on a pvp server, that was your choice
---
OK, don't be surprised tomorrow when it magically works as it always has.
---
&gt; chapo
---
Why did I even bother checking lol
---
ur understanding is wrong
---
Learn how to screenshot.
---
Is there anything that stipulates that BGs will be on the 10th in the US?
---
Came here to say this.   
---
There's also a blacksmithing trinket for 30 sec fear immunity, IIRC. Not nearly as essential, but situationally nice.
---
One's a game for fun, one is real life.
---
Nobody is disagreeing with you that not all streamers are bad. You're not making some argument that is going over my head. You're just strangely aggressive in general and towards the statement "some streamers use their audience to get ahead". Calling yourself a "WoW Classic streamer" means nothing because anybody can start streaming. Of course not all streamers are bad. There just seems to be a trend of streamers with an audience using it in WoW classic to get ahead
---
classic wow without servers lol. whats the point? i wish mods would delete dumb shit like this.
---
A lot of people don't want to waste excessive amounts of time in a raid as easy as MC. One of the easiest way to weed out players who aren't going to try, is to not invite the ones who didn't bother getting geared before joining.
---
Its not foolproof, but its a hell of a lot better than just inviting anybody.
---
I'd say, they will because MONEY.
---
But from memory, you weren't able to transfer to FULL realm back in the days. I just hope you can still go from PVP to PVE. Turns out, I hate PvP and my level 60 is there.
---
Personally i am still glad I rolled on a pvp server
---
I'm fairly new to the wow scene. I'm having a blast on classic. But it amazes me how much people complain about a game they either played before or knew about 15 years ago.
---
Me too!  In fact, I want Carebear flair for this sub!
---
&gt; RIP your faction imbalanced servers.
---
They could make the transfers unavailable if the character is either
---
1) in the minority faction on a badly imbalanced server or
---
2) the character is going to the majority faction on a badly imbalanced server.
---
So if your character is Horde on Herod, you can transfer it. If it's alliance, you can't.
---
If your character is alliance on a balanced server, you CAN transfer to Grobbulous, but if your character is Hored, you CAN'T.
---
unlucky, you should have done a tiny bit of research. They announced cross-realm bgs from the beginning, well before the game even launched
---
OK Boomer
---
Last night I did an UD strat and our warlock was lighting everything up and almost died a few times. I told him to cut it out but he wouldn't... that is until I reminded him that our healer was a Druid and doesn't have a traditional rez. Then all the sudden he cared about pulling aggro.
---
Nah it uses hidden custom channels to sync, without them it only communicates over guild. So the end result is that its only as accurate as your guild members actually encounter these players in the world (honorspy auto inspects everyone in 10 yards to snag their characters honor data)
---
What was your usual group comp? What'd you do? Arena/anger/golem?
---
That's a reason to be annoyed for sure. Would you rather play on a dead server though?
---
I always see people who disparage carebears as either a middle-aged man trying to relive his glory days of high school football or a teenage boy who isn't athletic enough to play a competitive team sport but still wants the glory.
---
Thank god for that
---
equipping directly from bank doesn't work, you have to take it from bank, close bank, then equip
---
In us maybe. In eu eng there is exactly zero alliance favoured realm.
---
Sounds like a LoL player playing WoW
---
You will still most likely have instant queues as alliance.
---
Ok boomer is the response you give when you're not clever enough to come up with a real comeback.
---
Damn I‚Äôm already 60 but I‚Äôm a sword rogue for my guild I just wanted a decent dagger to use for ambush crits I know raid daggers are op but I wanna know what‚Äôs good from the AH thx tho
---
That‚Äôs a good thing. That way EU won‚Äôt have 1 day of battlegrounds before the weekly honor reset
---
When i started my character there were 0 horde or alliance players on the server. 
---
When i joined my guild there were 0 horde or alliance players there. 
---
The first few months my server was a bit horde dominant. Like 60/40 but it was not a problem. Then the honor system released and most alliance players transfered away. 
---
Should i give up my character thats almost BiS geared has thousands of gold invested and in my bags with ~ 40days /played? My guild that i have made lots of friends with? All the other people i've met and made ingame friends with?
---
No i dont think i will.
---
Lets fucking hope not.  Let the people leave if they want to .
---
Considering that you do not compete with the opposing faction for ranks, only with your own. If you transfer a guild to Hearthseeker and get someone 100 HK in a week, does it mean if no one gets more than 100 HK in that faction, that person is going to get the max rank?
---
No. I would absolutely never play a game with any kind of login queue (aside from a temporary launch situation). That shit is utter cancer and I don't understand why anyone tolerates it. I specifically went to my server because fuck login queues. It is alliance favored and I am horde, but I don't care. It's fine. It's fun to play.
---
This game was never intended for these large populations all on one server. That is the real issue, not faction imbalance.
---
Lol
---
What'a a casting Druid? Is that a healer?
---
That sounds fun.
---
Yeah the fear is OP when you drop into a group and bomb... 30 sec CD too. Not every class can trinket fear, it's not always off CD and even if it is trinketed it's still a half second interruption that allows you to get that dot and flay going and a strong chance at a blackout proc.
---
Alliance players fuming
---
90% of raiding is trash my point is still the same- do u pop mcps for molten giants? Nah u use it on bosses like a consumable
---
That pains my heart to read.
---
Yes and no. At 60 this is easier to talk about. You still need 9% hit to hit things at your level but with weapon rating you can gain 3%hit with 305 as youe total weapon level, but this really dosent come into play until you are fighting bosses which are 63 and up. So you cant really substitute weapon rating for hit, it works a bit differently and that's why I said its kind of a wierd stat while leveling.
---
Sorry my mistake but yes I was referring to NA realms.
---
Lead developers confirmed it in an interview back at blizzcon.
---
It looks like theres 20 of them though. Are they that prolific?
---
Several posts in this thread providing links to confirmed BG dates.
---
Hyenas are scavengers irl they survive off the scraps after the real cats have had a go. 
---
Sometimes they may bring down a smaller animal on their own. 
---
The real issue is trying to find realism in a cartoon...
---
75g is too much...but plan on camping for this recipe? Even the most basic gold farms are 20g+ an hour and you can expect to sit there for days unless you get super lucky (hint: you wont).
---
Your time is valuable and personally I would rather spend it playing the game and buying annoying shit than sitting in front of a vendor for days worth of /played
---
It always differed. Arena anger if no one needed golem. Think I got a little over 100 kills on him so the rest were only arena + anger.
---
Only did it with guildies in the end. Didn't want to lose it to some random.
---
Why not just make it like Runescape, instead of being bound to a server you just choose one every time you log-in
---
Nice edit buddy. Anyways have a good day dude rofl
---
How am i supposed to read 3 paragraphs that you add after i commented lol
---
The reason I know paid server transfers existed in wow, is because I played on a very horde dominated server that had a couple very strong alliance guilds transfer over.  It ended up essentially equaling out the balance.  I honestly can't keep up anymore with people cherry picking what they think is a good or a bad thing as it relates to classic wow.  
---
I obviously don't support paid transfers, so I won't use them.  I'm on a server that by all census I've seen is very nearly balanced, so if anything, I'd expect alliance to transfer here mimicking my original vanilla experience.  And I won't complain if that happens.
---
Nah that would be easily possible if you had a correct comp (i.e. 80% of your DPS are Warriors &amp; Rogues).
---
The only question in that case would be can the tank keep threat. But if no DPS are consuming then the tank shouldn't need much if anything.
---
PvP server problems.  
---
&gt; Classic WoW is a fundamentally community-based game.
---
That's the real issue. The community has pockets of decency but it's a damn mess otherwise.
---
Battlemasters... lame.
---
True but at the end of the day if you tell players one race has even a 1% advantage in PVP, a large majority will take it.
---
Wow yea you're the first one to post about Classic +!
---
&gt;Am I the only one who would like to see a modified version of classic servers?
---
Yes, out of millions you are the only one.
---
because it is during the down time which is always on Tuesday on the US west coast and to the employees over there they were thinking in there time frame not internationally.
---
#**&lt;Tribute&gt;**
---
Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)  
---
Our main goal for **&lt;Tribute&gt;** is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.  
---
**Expectations**
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.  
---
**Raid schedule**
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.  
---
Interested?
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
&gt; I kinda doubt this would solve the problem.
---
This isn't a solution to anything. It's just there to prevent transfers from making things worse.
---
And they don't have to do it that way. They're free to just let some servers become monofaction.
---
Or maybe the Horde shouldn‚Äôt have camped as hard as they did. You can‚Äôt blame the company for the actions of its player base. 
---
Blizzard did the smart thing, here. They offered the free transfer in order for players to find a way out of their shit situation (created by the other faction being shitlords) otherwise, those players would have just left. Fuck, I quit playing because you cannot go to any zone and not get ganked by a horde death squad. WPL/EPL/Thorium Point/Morgan‚Äôs Vigil/BRM/Un‚ÄôGoro are all under horde control 100% of the time. Any time the alliance fights back another horde raid shows up and it‚Äôs completely outnumbered 2:1. There‚Äôs no fun it, the horde players essentially ruined the game for me and I‚Äôm not making another character and starting from scratch on another server.
---
No you weren't shut up
---
I never said anything about flasks or their relative cost compared to elixirs.  I was just talking about consumables/buffs vs. none.  
---
Agree that a 0 consumables person is generally not the type you want to raid with, because a couple of elixirs and some basic health/mana potions is a pretty basic requirement for raiding, and not at all expensive.  If you can't put in that little effort, I have no interest in dragging your lazy ass through MC, even with as easy as it is to do just that!
---
Thank you, I was looking exactly for this.
---
Rank 3 is about the only choice to try to avoid overhealing or cancelling, but gets less of a bonus healing ratio than rank 4+ . for raid healing druids really just don't bring much to the table. For single target tank healing they are fine but not having the 25% armor proc and not being able to stack hots with other druids makes me prefer a sham or priest even for single target
---
Turning in the marks(3per win/1per loss) gives xp and is repeatable.
---
No new ppl will join that server, therefore we would not be able to recruit new ppl
---
Oh no, an edited comment before you even replied, how dastardly.
---
Jesus Christ you are just a miserable person and it has nothing to do with WoW lol.
---
Go get a hug.
---
The best kind: big to small, just like timestamps
---
Was blizzard not holding peoples hands tightly enough? Aw, shucks sorry bud. You the player are the defender of your servers health, it is no one elses problem. Sucks to suck
---
It takes less than an hour/week to get full world buffs and consumes, not "4+".
---
Might be over an hour in phase 2 if you're trying to do it completely solo on a pvp server, purely due to ganks. But starting tomorrow that will largely not be a problem anymore.
---
The honorspy author legit just has to remove a few lines and it'll work. (It'll still work, but will just show Lua errors tomorrow)
---
Yeah, exactly. I'm sure that whatever guild /u/prokkn4h is in has several raid groups to go to BRM with them as body guards. Most guilds can't do that even with all of their members logged in, so it's really only the top guilds that can reasonably pull that off without paying another guild to do it for them.
---
4D chess.
---
They couldn't sell pets, mounts or gold so they had to find something.
---
Yes, lots of locks do Mara runs which has ghost mushrooms inside.  Also allows you to do DME Jump Runs as the flower picker.  I'd say it's a good choice.
---
I still treasure my haunted memento.
---
There are certainly worse tattoos out there when compared to a hobby you have enjoyed for 15 years but I get ya.
---
It's funny whenever multiboxing topic comes up, plenty of people foaming out of their ears saying blizzard is apparently milking it from &lt;0.00001% of the population having up to 5 accounts in most cases.
---
Here is the actual milking - blizzard running their servers like hot garbage and milk the playerbase for paid transfers.
---
Barman shanker from plugger spazzring in BRD its better than both those options for a main  hand dagger and i think rogues may be able to solo farm it
---
Shadowfoot stabber is  better than shadowblade for mainhand bc it will have better backstab/ambush hits
---
Locks can solo Mara/DM:E so Herb will be very useful there.
---
Sad how toxic people are and wanna lock people up in servers. Let them transfer pve if they want.
---
Doubt it. It will most likely be the same cost a retail transfer.
---
Hey dudes! Is fury spec better for levelling a human warrior on a pve realm? I'm always solo so will most likely by questing and grinding solo.. Thanks!
---
And BC continued the upward trend of subs. 
---
If you're trying to say paid transfers killed the game and not a myriad of other things I'm just gonna fuck off now
---
not sure I haven't been there yet :)
---
there are more alliance, horde just don't seem to bother with reddit as much.
---
r/woosh
---
Don't forget that they proc on sap, too. Fiery and crusader also proc on sap/ gouge, but the damage is applied before the sap/gouge effect and it doesn't break stealth or put you in combat with imp sap. Unfortunately, this doesn't help with dot effects.
---
All multi-target pulls are roughly same. If you can Charge:
---
&gt;Charge -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; Sweeping Strikes -&gt; Berserker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt; Defensive Stance -&gt; Demoralizing Shout -&gt; Sunder Armor
---
If you can't charge:
---
&gt;Shoot (with bow/gun/whatever) -&gt; Bloodrage -&gt; Berserker Stance -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt; Defensive Stance -&gt; Demoralizing Shout -&gt; Sunder Armor
---
Make sure you are in defensive stance before you do anything that causes threat, including shouts and shoot. Berserker and battle stance have a threat penalty, while defensive stance gives a massive threat bonus. The only exceptions are when you need to Sweeping Strikes or Whirlwind. They are your best multi-target threat abilities even after the threat penalty from being in battle/berserker.
---
Rend might as well not even exist when you are tanking.
---
The game is the exact same. You just aren't taking advantage of people who lacked knowledge anymore, because so many more people know so much more about the game.
---
What's the correlation between a shit 5 sunder opener and deep prot? What's best rotation for deep prot on a 4+ pack? Or a 1-2 pack?
---
You put enough time and effort into this game to get to max level AND get your profession to max level, all without reading tooltips?
---
Spy was already nuked weeks ago.
---
Oh, are you referring to the bit of "Tower Defense" the other day? Yeah, it happens sometimes, but 6/7 days in the week, Horde own BRM, for those reading.
---
Finally! Good job, gentlemen and ladies!
---
Never. There are ton of real farming bots on Windseeker.
---
&gt;Ap, which is a flat increase, will not scale with the damage you already have.
---
False. Having more AP increased the damage you get from crits. Having existing crit increases the value of AP. Do you have 0% crit? No. So AP is scaling with the damage you already have. Your crit.
---
im talking about PVP servers. pve are heavily skewed alliance. do some tests yourself.
---
edit: youre horde and think incendius is alliance favored? do you want me to do /who tests for you to prove you wrong?
---
much better site is https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true for ratios, not absolute numbers. you can also check AH listings, thats pretty good for ratios, too. but you can also just do /who, but it can take a while.
---
Interesting tidbit: the guy trying to break into the stall is none other than NHL hall of famer Cam Neely!  Seabass himself.
---
Try to use keys that are closer to where your left hand rests, 6-9 etc are bad keys unless you have very long fingers. Try to use Q, E, R, F, V, X, C etc for abilities in addition to 1-5, makes your reaction times much better imo.  Re-bind character frame and sit and those kind of abilities to shift modifiers.
---
Yeah, I really should try and push for it. I just tried 2-manning it, and had good success, except for the damn silencing bats, haha
---
Haha hopefully this doesn't transfer to real life midgets...
---
I'm with you though, they are so annoying in game. Maybe cause in a brutal war fantasy setting, a little ass gnome having any kind of power feels wrong ha. Magic I guess yea, but a gnome warrior? gtfo, my tauren should take zero dmg.
---
Also, all the top guilds and min/max players like gnome which just annoys me ha
---
I did this on every character from 51 to 60. I grinded on harpies in the caves. Then when I hit 60 I was exalted with AV and ready to buy my epic weapon.
---
Boycotted due to Hong Kong 
---
‚ÄúYikes‚Äù that Blizz wont take your money
---
That's what they did with world PvP + transfers.
---
Not at all, I wanted you to provide the sources so that we are both working from the same page and agree on the same information we are working with. 
---
Nothing is more annoying for a data presentation than someone saying " But X source says something different". Plus, it is a minimal contribution on your hand because quite frankly: Some random stranger is not worth the effort if they just expect me to do everything. 
---
If you are voluntarily giving up your ability to counter with alternate number sources than I am happy to do that as well!
---
Nice
---
Keep tailoring until you've made your Robe, then drop it. DM:E solo jump runs are your best gold farm. Mining is required for that, herbalism is a good chunk of it as well. If you want max gold, take both. If you want gold plus PvP, take Eng/Mining. Nothing else really makes sense on a main character.
---
and Undead Rogues. :)
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is all the honor I got so far won‚Äôt mean much...
---
Oh it isnt like 50 on retail? Or its 25?
---
If you join a server that is an anagram of "Horde" and play alliance you kind of have to blame yourself.
---
Almost exclusively flash healing through MC now, so i prefer at least 3-set, and 5 isnt so bad with all the +int. Only 40% of the healing power is applied to flash heals, so the stat is not as powerful as it is in longer mana-dependent encounters.
---
&gt; What context is this in? If you're in a raid, you have healers assigned to tanks that shouldn't be casting offheals and instead should be pre-healing. This is a non-point in raids.
---
That's wishful thinking. As a healer you need to be flexible. Tank healers can die or go oom. It doesn't even have to be a tank that's suddenly drops. Not all incoming damage is predictable. Being able to salvage a bad situation seperates a good healer from a bad one.
---
&gt; I don't care how fast you think you are, pressing 2 buttons is never as consistently quickly as pressing 1. If you press the button too early you'll heal the wrong target if you wait too long the target might die.
---
There is no way to know how close of a call your heal is going to be. Even 0.01 second delay could make the difference.
---
It's simply impossible for a clicker to be as quickly as a mouseover user due to the way WoW's targeting mechanics work. To target someone you need to click on his unitframe **and release the left mouse button**. 
---
You cannot press the heal button until you have let go of the mouse button.
---
Healing by clicking therefore looks like this:
---
Move mouse to target -&gt; delay -&gt; left mouse button down -&gt; delay -&gt; left mouse button up -&gt; delay -&gt; press heal button
---
Meanwhile mouseover healing looks like this: 
---
Move mouse to target -&gt; delay -&gt; press heal button
---
I don't care you quickly you can click, it will never be instant. If you want to be optimal mouseover is a necessity.
---
&gt; We weren't talking about PVP, but again, realistically this should be the tiniest of improvement unless you're bad to begin with.
---
An enemy might be impossible to target since he's behind a tree (which usually doesn't interfere with casting LoS) or behind other players. Tabbing is obviously not reliable way to target the right enemy.
---
In pvp every single heal class is also required to cast offensively and switching targets will might cost time or not even be possible at times.
---
&gt; It's still a crutch for bad players who aren't performing.
---
It's actually a tool for good players that care about playing their characters at the fullest potential.
---
Edit: It also allows you to target the boss and heal/see their current target. This is especially useful for bosses that will target players to use abilities on them.
---
You mentioned classic crit ranges yourself, so we're well within 15 to 30%. In this range we're looking at no more than 10 to 20% diminishing returns. Compare that to doubling your ap
---
The only relevant thing to factor in is recklessness, anything else is assumed to have a linear relationship to ap, factored by crit
---
So for 20% of the fight, crit is basically worthless. But Im still not buying that the value of crit is not significantly increased, going from 1000 to like 1500 ap or even 2000. I don't know where the values are exactly with raid buffs and proper gear
---
ya that two hours a week mages gotta spend farming to respec is worth it lol
---
probably same price as retail (25$)
---
Yep, I know a neckbeard who plays Horde. 
---
Like, literal 300+ lb fat guy, who ganks newbies over and over again. Whenever he finds a target he just camps the graveyard. Then, on his alt account, he'll message said Alliance player. Tells them to "Get Good" and other shit.
---
If that player messages him back, he instantly files a petition for harassment against that person.
---
Literally, wash/rinse/repeat...
---
...he's one of those guys who now complains about the lack of Alliance on his server.
---
This week's class highlight is warriors - tons of great resources on the next sticked thread down.
---
That being said, most recommend arms until 45+. Get a guildie or a friend to run you through the hurricane quest line as soon as you hit 30 - without dungeon rewards you'll be using that axe for 15 levels.
---
Edit: whirlwind, not hurricane.
---
No. 99.9% of addons use RAID and PARTY channels.
---
8 more levels and haven't played in a week. Ungoro Horde are thirsty af.
---
The point is that you go fury prot to pump more threat. But if you spend the first 5 GCDs using sunder anyways, you aren't really getting much out of fury prot. 
---
You should be using your major threat ability (bloodthirst or shield slam) on CD. Then you use the rest of your rage on revenge &gt; sunder &gt; heroic strike.
---
If you are on a 4+ pack in a dungeon, it depends because you often dont get enough rage in dungeons to use all your spells. You end up tab sundering, but that is because of limited rage, its not the optimal rotation. In raid you don't really tank 4+ mobs.
---
you need like 11% hit to accomidate 40% crit. Crit cap is a thing.
---
&gt;But my question remains, if you were Horde on Flamelash, what could you have done if you wanted to PvP? You can't be blamed for having more on your faction. In my experience: I have no reason to do dungeons, MC is 2 hours every week, the rest of the time everything but PvP is both boring and futile, should I just not play the game then cause the other faction doesn't want to PvP?
---
I'm trying to put myself in your shoes for this question, and to be honest I'm finding that I have difficulty doing so. I'm still leveling while you seem to be 60, so it's a wildly different game space. On my perspective, I have PLENTY of objectives I want to accomplish. I have quests to complete to get the last few levels to hit 60. I have faction reputation grinds ahead of me. I have to gear up and run dungeons. I spent 15 years of Classic on a PVE server, so I just don't think of PVP as some vital necessity in the way you seem to.
---
The best answer I can give to "what would you do in my situation", is that I'd go out in the game world and find something to do besides sitting around waiting for players to gank.
---
In planetside 1, they had like XP bonus for joining a side that had less players in it. Wow classic could\should do  something like that. It‚Äôs a little late but free transfers would help.
---
I'll trade you my Skeram spot for your Heartseeker spot. Neither of us can play the fucking game, and I think both of us would take a carebear server 9ver that!
---
So much man...
---
I thout it would be cool af with 40 man raid but nah.
---
Turns out it's just a pain in the ass actually getting 40 people to show up regularly.
---
I really hope we get tbc at some point.
---
&gt; Aliance players so salty
---
Actually you sound pretty salty my dude. Every post on this sub shows just how salty Ally are. You can call Horde a lot of things... but at least they aren't salty.
---
Do they have region specific twitter accounts?
---
Yep they will never stop them.
---
Rage generation comes in slower chunks with a slow offhand, which (usually) means you can't use Execute as often sub-20%.
---
If you can generate rage quickly enough to use Execute on every global cooldown in the Execute phase, then there is no difference between a slow and fast offhand.
---
I have no idea why I was downvoted, but yes, I'm pretty sure you can. As far as I know, you can dispel anything that is a magic effect. Not all potions are this way. The easiest way to tell is by hovering your mouse over your buff in the top right corner.
---
If the word "Magic" displays at the top right of the tooltip, it can be dispelled.
---
[Here's a picture of the FAP.](https://imgur.com/C7deKmi)
---
You can see the "Magic" label in the top right. If I were to hover over that green elixir on the right (Elixir of the Sages), it would *not* have the "Magic" label and therefore is on you until you dismiss it, it times out, or you die.
---
If you've done the Molten Core raid, this is also evident during the Garr fight. He uses an Antimagic Pulse ability that strips buffs with the magic label off, but *not* the ones that are nonmagical.
---
I hope that explains it! This is how I understand the mechanic at least. If I'm incorrect I would hope someone would correct me rather than just downvoting.
---
It took me a while to get used to A/D as strafe but it was worth it. You might walk funny for a bit but you're getting two very nicely placed hotkeys for it and WASD for movement feels more comfy than WQSE anyway.
---
Pretty sure they referred to themselves as blood elves in WC3 Frozen Throne
---
I mean if what little alliance is left and all they are doing is hiding in capital cities then what else would you do if you wanted world pvp? Go to the capitals for world pvp.
---
This thread, and your comment, are proof of the contrary.
---
Is there a macro conditional that I can set where the macro won‚Äôt attempt to execute if I‚Äôm stunned?
---
Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôve got an FD+trap macro that includes /petfollow so my pet wont hit something and put me back in combat. If a rogue opens on me, I want to be mashing this macro in case there‚Äôs a gap between cheap shot and kidney. However, since I‚Äôm mashing, I‚Äôm also mashing pet follow, which means my pet isn‚Äôt hitting the rogue for the 8 or whatever seconds that I‚Äôm stunned.
---
Seal Fate is only viable with the set bonus for evisverate from AQ40 rogue set. Otherwise go combat.
---
To run seal fate now you need to guarantee world buffs stay on you otherwise dps performs sub optimally.
---
He means the tornado quest line at 30
---
Yeah, how many people create new characters that they barely play. It would need to be another measurement.
---
Pretty sure it's the first actual client patch yeah.
---
" For the raid metrics though, it seems clear to me that the Alliance are winning the server "
---
Pretty sure this is expected.
---
Time zones are hard mkay?
---
41 here, still too poor to buy a mount
---
Uh, no. Usually it's the other way around.
---
All I can say is look at which faction keeps trolling the subreddit about the ganking, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to be Alliance from what I can tell.
---
Of course that chump is being overly dramatic, but they‚Äôre probably still salty as hell over being camped for hours.
---
Pretty sure you can premade a 40 man in vanilla av
---
its "normal" its the same just minus the auto flag
---
I don‚Äôt understand. If some link is with PST time and will take us to US forum they won‚Äôt translate it to cet time either, especially if it is related to us only and not to europe.
---
cry me a river, hordecel
---
I know the answer is "it's a change so no!" but I really don't see why they don't just re-expose threat levels and let add-ons devs make the nice UI, we get pretty much exactly accurate calculation anyway, just needlessly sending more data between clients in the pretence of vanilla like.
---
Or honor rankings, honorspy exists because the ranking page doesn't, why not save effort and bandwidth and expose actual values instead, and have the ranking pages again?
---
I'm thinking of rerolling to a PvE server on EU. Which one do you guys reccomend?
---
&gt; you‚Äôre joking
---
So you are just going to pretend that there is... cool. Have fun in your fantasy world!
---
They can't take care of themselves, they make huge messes they dont clean up till they absolutely have to, they both encourage toxicity in their communities, I would use more flavorful language but classicwow mods dont like it when streamers are being insulted but dont care when its used against each other?
---
yeah, this is the thing i'm worried about. healcomm is the one thing that keeps me sane when healing in my raid where there are 0 assignments + a few more healers than necessary, lol.
---
Goodbye community
---
Cross-realm BG is a joke..
---
How can I enjoy owning the same people over and over now?

Definitely true, but the dynamic of making it into raids with your world buffs surviving is pretty interesting compared to pve where you can just stroll right in

The boat situation is the worst. I‚Äôm lucky because I have engineering, so I just teleport between continents, but the boats are an absolute shitstorm. There are exactly zero (!!) useful guards at the boats, and the boats are the only way of traveling between continents for alliance besides teleporting. The boats on my server are perpetually camped by 5-10+ hordes. It is absolutely ridiculous that Blizzard has not yet patched in guards like they did on Horde zeppelins (which are in a non-contested area...).
---
I guess that just opens the door for them to rebalance specs then too?
---
If we want to cancel paid transfers based on the merit of no changes already being ruined, let's just open the floodgates

lookingforgroup isn't a player created channel though. So don't see how it hurts the LFG addon.

 **GOOF \[A-Grobbulus\] | NA RP-PvP | Raids Every Day | Semi-Casual to Hardcore | Varied Loot Systems**
---
The first Alliance guild on the server with kills on both Azuregos and Kazzak, GOOF is one of Grobbulus‚Äô largest and most successful guilds in PvE and PvP. 350+ unique members. Five successful raid teams, (with a sixth one in the works), means that GOOF likely has a raid team for you. Server 3rd Molten Core kill times. Near unmatched dominance in world PvP.
---
**Do you want to be on the winning team, or watch from the sidelines?**
---
Raid Times, PST (subject to change):
---
Team One: Tuesday, Thursday 5:30pm 
---
Team Two: Wednesday, Monday 7pm
---
Team Three: Saturday, Sunday 7pm
---
Team Four: Friday, Saturday 6pm
---
Team Five: Saturday 8pm
---
Team Six: Sunday, Monday 5:30pm
---
Currently we are mainly recruiting raid ready players for team six, with a particular need for Druids, Hunters, Mages, Paladins, Priest, Rogues, Warlocks, and a MT Warrior, though players with other classes, (including ‚Äòmeme-specs‚Äô), and availabilities are still heavily encouraged to apply. 55+ preferred. 
---
GOOF also has a history of successful guild mergers, (we keep guild communities together). Joining the GOOF team means benefiting from our huge level 60 member-pool and organization, without sacrificing your friendships and connections. 
---
24/7 PVP groups and Discord activity. Top 10 rankers. Helpful community with a great sense of humor. You never have to go it alone.

hell of an emotional roller coaster! im going to have to come back and watch again when i can listen to it too
---
Looks like you are in Rebel Camp not Nesingwary's
---
Your reading comprehension is so fucked. 
---
Literally the priority for every warrior is get 5 sunders. The tank is always the first one in, and can have 2 sunders before anyone even hits the boss oftentimes. It impacts 70%+ of the raid's damage (and threat) output.
---
If you have threat issues, yes spamming sunder over heroic strike is obviously the play. If you don't have threat issues (which you shouldn't at this tier if properly geared), spamming heroic strike while maintaining 5 sunders is the play.
---
You are making 0 sense.
---
Do you really think only those getting in the top bracket (which isn't 1.4% btw) should be allowed to rack up points?
---
You could just spam the macro right before cheap shot is going to fall off, then wait 4 seconds if he gets kidney shot off and start spamming it at the end of that. Literally zero reason to spam a button through a 5s stun...

This is peak horde logic.

Awesome! Thank you!

I've only watched two of his videos but goddamn I hope the voice is an act. Cause if not, I feel bad for that kid.

Some people raid as a way to have fun with friends for a few hours a week. 
---
Other people raid as if it's a job where you only get paid if someone else doesn't.
---
For people in the first group, taking Mike the shitty ret pally might be worth it because he's a cool enough dude and you're all friends/guildies. Once I'm geared up, I'm still coming because I enjoy shooting the shit with my buddies.
---
For people in the second group, fuck Mike, he might take *my* weapon. If we don't take him, thats just less competition for me to get what I came here for. And you better believe I won't come here anymore if I can get better odds or a faster kill time elsewhere. Because god knows I don't do this shit for fucking fun. I do it to get geared as efficiently as possible, the fun will come later if ever.
---
It actually can, this change only breaks custom channels.
---
That's some crazy mental gymnastics. They are corpse camping you, Dude. Accept it and move on. You aren't getting back at them for going AFK because they're alive with more honor in their pockets and you're dead.
---
Could I get these individually with transparent backgrounds? They need to be added to discord servers.
---
The point is your data will be vastly less accurate if you can't sync with every player on the server using the addon.
---
;D
---
Nice, thanks for doing the math!
---
Probably would've quit already if I was on a PvE server. Rolling around with 5-10 guildies and pvping whether we lose or win has been really fun
---
i think thats +25 agi to 2h, there is already +7 agi to gloves in the game
---
And I pointed out that top bracket is 0.3% v can you even read? Because sure as hell you can't make sense
---
So how was it?
---
They are in a play with thousands of other people, and are the only ones who have the benefit of acting as a character.
---
Sorry I should specify - Sinister Strike proccing an extra attack through something like Sword Specialization (Talent) is what resets the timer.
---
Everyone here posts about how easy AV rep is to get (which is not what I recall at all personally, but I‚Äôve seen it enough here to make me think otherwise). I would just use what you have and if the rep goes quickly enough you‚Äôll have saved the cash and can get the lobotomizer fairly quickly.
---
I'm not calling for handholding, but please go ahead and be condescending. 
---
&gt; You the player are the defender of your servers health
---
Again, what am I supposed to do when a perfectly enjoyable server gets ruined because of blizzard's poor decisions? You address none of my points and tell me to git gud when I have 0 incentive in gathering a raid to "fight back", since it gives me fuck-all in the way of honor and will do nothing to the server balance. The only way I can and will fight for the server's balance is to unsub and tell blizzard why, unless my enjoyment of the game is rekindled by BGs (the first reasonable course of action taken regarding wpvp). You're being childish for defending the company making poor decisions, which shows by your reply descending to level of insulting rather than addressing any of my points.

Hadn't thought about him in a while but as far as I remember Swifty and Critical are the only two *famous* streamers I can think of that aren't total shitbags of human beings.

Pretty sure Biggles has a really high ratio of horde compared to alliance. Since last I check at least. I started my first few toons off on Biggles but ended up switching servers.
---
Yep
---
Imagine thinking people aren‚Äôt the same on both sides
---
Though the change only has a minimal effect on CLFG.
---
Not true.  Barman is Not very good for PvE.  
---
You shouldn't sacrifice that much weapon dps for base damage in PvE because so much of your backstab damage doesn't come from your weapon, particularly in a raid setting.  
---
Pretty sure even scarlet kris is better in PvE.
---
Even though it's PVE, Pagle is all alliance. They destroy Horde in pretty much everything.

---
If you are not poor then I would recommend using dynamite to get agro, solid dynamite is super cheap and dropping it on yourself should generate around 325 threat on all mobs within 5 yards. It is a lot easier than SS+WW followed by weapon swap, it generates more agro and it hits all mobs.
---
RS players still gravitate towards certain servers, only because of community - but you can just jump to another if mobs are taken or in WOW-case, you get ganked to much.
---
Runescape is more of a social game than WOW, imo

I am in same boat. I am also severely let down by how poorly even shadow does in pvp. Then again it could just be I don't understand how to with a spriest.

No, I assumed you were joking because it‚Äôs a very well known fact that Horde play the game on easy mode... better racials, better controlled locations on the map, better levelling experience, more players...
---
When you said ‚Äúhow come no horde players ever complain!‚Äù I thought you were joking because horde players literally don‚Äôt have anything to complain about lol?
---
The only people you have to justify your enjoyment out a game to is yourself. Let the dominant factions reap there own caused consequences.
---
To add on to this, it makes a difference for crit damage scaling on your off hand, but it's also less punishing to play poorly with HS -queueing
---
So you have to be sure to stop dots at 44% ...every ranged dops needs to get hit by her fireball. Non tank melee dps needs to do the same but since they can't hit only in p2 it's really not important. The fireball hits reset your threat. Past that it's on your tanks. If you don't have a hit capped tank your dps is going to have a hard time out threating your dps
---
The pugs I've been in seem to just struggle with stopping dots at 44 and it just wipes because the tanks can't do shit.... A good contingency is having anyone that pulls threat run to your tanking POS ...if the die, they die but they don't wipe half the raid.
---
Edit: best thing to remember is that only isn't a dps fight, it's a threat fight.
---
For the alliance!

They're is a leveling guild on Allie xv you could join loads of low levels, see them in storm wind

In all fairness, I remember one time in the original timeline that something went horribly wrong with maintenance and it lasted over 30 hours. They gave everyone 2 days of credit as an apology.

It's an ideological argument in favour of elites controlling society because if you just do what the masses want they'll just ruin everything.  They need to have an elite ruling class - the Lions - in charge and the masses need to be suppressed and satisfied with the pittance the elites give them - ie the Elephant graveyard.

My guild is using an addon called Group Calendar to coordinate guild events &amp; raid signups and the addon uses a custom created channel to sync events. It was quite buggy to begin with and we had just barely got it to work consistently this past week. Now we'll have to find a new alternative all over again.
---
Nowhere does it state the end time of the maintenance in this post just that it starts at 10am...

Level 43 alliance priest. It‚Äôs great to hear other people here are still having a good experience. The game isn‚Äôt really fun for me anymore unfortunately as I only have a short time to play in the evenings and much of that is spent corpse running, and traveling is incredibly time-consuming. Holding out high hopes for the introduction of battlegrounds though.
---
Vicious on Pagle charged 200g per craft your mats.
---
Not quite true. If the recipient of the buff was a hunter fighting a lvl 60 elite demon by himself with no pet, then the buff will cost said hunter a minimum of 20 minutes waiting for the demon to respawn.
---
There's a slim chance that what happened here, and even then this response is unwarranted, but I did have friendly ignorant people cost me probably 2 to 3 hours while doing that quest because they wanted to help.

I'm doing approx 600 dps on a dad guild on Magmadar and Golemagg with partial raid gear. Already having some threat issues so could pull probably closer to 700, especially with world buffs.

If you are on Blameaux I can hook you up with some engineering supplies
---
Everything
---
I'm sitting at like 25g on a 28 warrior. I skipped some abilities though like extra overpower rank since it's just a 10 damage increase.
---
"half the fun"? really, it sounds like I'm missing 1/5, 1/6 or maybe even Flamelash ratio(1/10) of the fun, but certainly not "half the fun"
---
Yeah I just deleted my lvl 60 Warrior. Gave all my matts and gold to the guild bank and rerolled PvE.
---
There's so many NE Hunters around :P.   
---
Starting areas aren't as packed as launch, but definitely still populated.
---
But I don't regret it now that paid transfers are a thing. I'd rather have a playable game until the paid transfers get implemented than be able to pick up my 60 Warrior again. That's how miserable P2 is to a semi-casual.
---
They gave people plenty of time to transfer and BEGGED people to transfer out of certain servers

In this thread: people reading the title and proclaiming how stupid blizzard is and how the game will end on Tuesday.

I had a horde buddy, her name was crittala or something similar. She was leveling in winterspring while i was skinning all her mobs and mining for epic mount money. I saw her there like 5 days in a row while she was grinding. Have not seen her recently, i imagine she has hit 60.

Server transfers are $25.

Maybe he's in ironforge because there is literally nothing to do? No one to go PVP?

Skeram is just as bad if not way worse. Ally don't even make up IF it's literally dead corpses and horde.

Try again.... And stop being in denial of what is truly happening to this unfinished 15yr project of changes we didn't ask for but got anyways.
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm talking about the total lack of skill required here - brain dead commitment yes, but skill (think modern arena etc) no.
---
Every achievement is a reflection of time in some ways - but this is the basement dweller of basement dwellers achievement
---
That's.. Not how it works.  All melee don't get punted lol.  Just 3 melee get punted based on lowest GUID, meaning everyone else can stay in and do DPS for the entire fight, and your tank never gets punted.  And you know exactly who those 3 will be so you can simply bubble/heal those 3 and they come back to the fight via intercept/slowfall/running back.  Pretty simple, you end up with a ton more DPS, not less.  Even a dad guild can down Rag before submerge doing this.

I play seal fate right now and I would argue it‚Äôs already viable without Felstriker. Just try to have 20%+ crit chance unbuffed and in raid use mongoose, greater agi and leader of the pack. It‚Äôs useless for aoe situations but solid for bosses. I ignore slice and dice in my build though and only use points on eviscerate. Only downside really is not having adrenaline rush. I just find it the most enjoyable spec tbh
---
Oh and not using slice n dice I also ignore the snd talent in assassination. Its actually a PvP based seal fate build.
---
It's not more fun on a balanced server only difference is that both factions can't use the world

lookingforgroup is not a player made channel and is accessible outside of towns I believe. The functionality can pretty easily be ported over to that channel. I'd assume they just used a custom channel because it expands better if they wanna add more features, but you can make the lfg messages pretty easily human parsable.

I see this advice for boardgames: it's much easier to turn gamers into friends than it is to turn friends into gamers.

I have 2 60 Alliance on Herod. I've rerolled. Not allowing me to transfer isn't helping balance, it's just punishing me.

Damn you Blizzard
---
The same reasoning applies to mashing it with .5 seconds left on the stun, or having to re-send pet to attack after they successfully complete a gapless kidney shot. That could be the difference between an extra pet auto or not.
---
&gt; Literally zero reason
---
Give me a break dude, are you telling me that if this functionality existed you wouldn‚Äôt use it?
---
I mean, he has a point.
---
With just a group of 5, solo kills would get you something like 2-3k honor over the course of 7 days that's 20k+ for free. 20k honor in wpvp is around B7-8 on my realm
---
No Arathi Basin?
---
From Camp Mojache to Dire Maul entrance, I can count on getting at least 2 rogues jump on me. Especially at the bridge and the overgrown path near the big tree.

The last [@player] bit is optional.  It'll cast Renew on yourself if you don't have a target or a mouseover.
---
I tried to do the streamer thing. It's bad for the gaming community in general since if you've a good idea everyone's going to follow it and set the meta which means no one will think for themselves which makes games stale. I've great builds for many games that I now refuse to share. My playstyle is help friends and guildies so we are all strong not just have 1 person as a carry
---
You're in a thread where it asks about how to deal with phase 3 dude.
---
You can spout whatever stuff you want, unless you're a guild that mindlessly farm her, your strats aren't useful to OP.
---
yeah the community at large has been pretty shit.
---
still some good out there though.
---
If Blizzard allows premades without ranked BGs, they will ruin BG PVP just like the world PVP clusterfck.  
---
Someone posted something similar the other day.  Equitable competition is what matters.
---
Nope! Mostly he just sounded kind of young, disgruntled, awkward and pissy. I'm too tired these days to "stand up" to that sort of low-key catty shit when I could be sexing my many beautiful sexual partners on top of my Maserati. Have you ever tried to tell some kid in their early 20s to go fuck themselves when they had a righteous point to prove online? That shit would've taken all night, and I'd just be proverbially wrestling the pig.
---
Did you but the cloth or farm it?
---
This announcement is blizzard testing the waters on the pay model. 
---
Will the player pay to fix a problem the developer made? More at 10
---
Nice.
---
How is the faction imbalance on ZT now? Me and my guild left when transfers opened but the new server hasn't worked out for me. ZT had some really friendly people, I kinda miss it.
---
The fact that the game launched in 1.12, had wildly larger populations per server, and layering was in place at the start is reason enough to drop the "#NoChanges" movement entirely (because there already were *massive* changes like those) and make an actually enjoyable Vanilla-like experience with solid QoL improvements reminiscent of a game 15 years in maturity.
---
Bring on the downvotes, but Classic+ including the Scarlet Crusade raid, Karazhan, and Emerald Dream (all as a side-step to AQ/Naxx-tier ilvl) and QoL like Keyring at the start and Dual Spec (maybe throw in a Druid Rez if we're feeling feisty) would have been a much more fulfilling experience to many people I feel like.
---
At least I see that kind of sentiment sprinkled in here and there. Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying myself. But there could've been some lovely additions to keep things feeling fresh.
---
It's easy because the mechanics are a joke, especially compared to retail. Most wow players during vanilla actually sucked and didn't optimise their gear or talents for dps as well as people do nowadays.
---
I mean .... pve servers are pretty damn healthy
---
Can anyone tell me roughly how many AV games for exalted? Need that Lobo
---
I think you could macro using a free action potion to same key as escape artist. Free action prevents new  stuns and movement slowing effects but does not remove any. That is why having them on same key would be a good idea.
---
&gt; I played vanilla, don't play classic 
---
Then you have absolutely no fucking idea of what you are talking about, stop wasting everyone time
---
If they damage you they refresh the  honorless buff. If you damage them you remove the buff. Also enemy players cannot see your buffs. Addons can guess your buffs or mages can detect magic your buffs.
---
They take considerably longer than the other "farming runs" in BRD.  He also has a fucking gigantic loot table, reducing the odds that your item will drop considerably.
---
Sounded like a joke to me why you so serious? Runecloth bags are only 2g so not like you did some massive favor.
---
This is what I don't understand. I often deliberately don't bother attacking Horde I see minding their own business, because I don't want to be part of the griefing problem. When you make it your goal to prevent enemy players from even being able to play at ALL, it's disingenuous to throw your hands in the air and cry about how you "don't get it".
---
You feel like pvp? You enable it and battle others who have it enabled. Can‚Äôt attack those who didn‚Äôt opt in. 
---
Don‚Äôt want to pvp? Unflag and don‚Äôt attack anyone for 5 minutes
---
(In a nutshell)
---
Taurens already feel slow when running because they are so big. I toggled run/walk sometimes to be sure I'm not walking. This challenge is hard
---
You know it's Snapchat, right? How would you have sent this clip to someone on Snapchat? Record it, upload it, send it as a link? C'mon man
---
I was, and I'll tell you this. Not gonna happen again.   
---
As skilled as Karma players are (because lets be fair, they're really good), I think its super scummy to sell items in raid, especially with PUGs.   
---
Same with reserving. But hey, they run their guild like that, I'm not gonna stop them.
---
Mages chaincasting frostbolt rather than waiting for the projectile to fly to the boss before hitting the button again is a change from 15 years ago. My guild was most of the way through BWL before we figured out why some of our mages/warlocks did so much less damage than other ones despite having similar gear.
---
How can you tell if someone rolled a PVE server? Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll tell you.
---
There are no rated battlegrounds in Classic, just random premades,iirc
---
[Blizz support](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/breaking/22835078). 7am‚Äì3pm PST.
---
Each win of AV gives about 1k rep and takes 10 mins with a decent premade and no queues
---
That's 6k rep per hour, or about 7 hours of AV farming to get exalted.
---
So say you have a bad premade or got queues maybe you spend 15 hours to get exalted or something. Basically it can be done in a weekend easily.
---
Wowhead saying it will take 8 hours with nothing to go on doesn't mean it's gonna take 8 hours... Their source is the patch notes listed here that make no mention of it going till 6pm. It probably will be longer then an hour but I'm not gonna take wowheads word that it will take 8 hours when its based on nothing
---
Hey, glad you guys had fun.  I'd probably throw gasoline in my eyes though before spending valuable hours doing this.
---
What an asshole I can‚Äôt believe it and he should burn in hell for not saying thank you for some cheap gear you have to him. I bet he doesn‚Äôt say bless you when someone sneezes either. But really you shouldn‚Äôt do something nice just for self gratitude, get upset he didn‚Äôt acknowledge your kind gesture is a sign of self serving. Not saying it‚Äôs a bad thing but you should be happy nothing you gave them something that made their char better without receiving praise. A lot of people that receive help from their community don‚Äôt appreciate it and think they should be getting more it‚Äôs just shitty humans but you should know that you did help them even if they might not act grateful.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and explain it to you but it‚Äôs really not hard at all. And the quality would be 100x better.
---
I mean the same thing happened on Vanilla... just at a smaller scale. The biggest thing that changed is how we play the game now verses then. Should they reinvent the system all together because we‚Äôre more knowledge and player attitudes are different? This is the game people wanted. I feel with the layering they added it helped ease into what we got now. 
---

Orgrimmar is a shoe?

What's your point? That didn't happen on retail either. Apes are hardcore sweaties.
---
\* in the short run without having the required brain cells to think about the long-term ramifications
---
You said there's no other way to earn honor. You're obviously wrong. Now you're being self righteous. 
---
Better watch out for the psychological whiplash
---
Imagine making a toon on Ironforge, an undercover pve server
---
When do I say it‚Äôs the player‚Äôs fault for being dealt a better hand? That was in response to your ridiculous ‚Äúwhy do you think horde players never complain?‚Äù remark, because of the (well known) fact that horde *does* have it easier, and thus haven‚Äôt got much to complain about. If you can seriously deny that then I suspect there‚Äôs no point to this conversation - I play wow fairly infrequently now, and it seems you have tribe bias.
---
It‚Äôs 2019 and there‚Äôs something called the cloud that makes things like this super simple but y‚Äôall are just too lazy to learn.

Vanilla/TBC had Battlegroups. This is not new.
---
Let me get off Herod!
---
&gt; Ally are mad that Horde are shitting on them in PvP
---
That‚Äôs a weird way of writing ‚Äúally are laughing their asses off while they all abandon servers leaving horde players to play PvE as a result of their decision to camp cities and flightmasters‚Äù. The actual image in question is *mocking* the gormless hordies who are now left on 1:99 servers and get pissy at blizzard for letting ally players ‚Äúescape‚Äù (reference to another thread). This whole situation is just the behaviour of no-lives impacting a whole community, where in this case the ‚Äúno-lives‚Äù are the hordies who camp cities / FMs, causing ally players to switch server and other, innocent, horde players to play in a dead server. The whole excuse of ‚Äúbut blizzard made me do it!‚Äù is so infantile, blizzard didn‚Äôt force anyone to do what they currently are, WPvP was designed to incentivise fighting in contested zones, it‚Äôs not blizzard‚Äôs fault that people have to find ways to ruin that, and it‚Äôs not ally player‚Äôs fault for abandoning entire servers.
---
yes, im scanning and uploading horse side daily
---
I read the warlock in the Pharaoh's voice from Yu-Gi-Oh. Thank you.
---
I remember them changing the mount system at the end of Vanilla, because that was prep for flying mounts if I recall. If private servers were based on that specific world build, I would not know. I just know that I specifically grinded to Rank 11 for the PvP mounts because I was poor.
---
I also vividly remember that I couldn't ride the cat mount and was ecstatic when I could.
---
(Yes, I could have grinded for money instead but my BF wanted me to heal bot him to GM. I had two Guildies follow after him so I heal botted them as well.  At that point just grinding the last bit made sense. )

---
We used to say woot when something epic happened in the olden online days.
---
But they are not missing out on anything. They are getting the overall better experience.
---
I don't disagree that their actions drove them off the server. That's not what we were talking about. I'm really concerned because you seem to understand the logic of the statement and then also refute it in the very next sentence.
---
Just because they are doing A doesn't mean they aren't also doing B. Doing A makes it harder (near impossible) to do B. Both statements can be true at the same time. Like this is middle school logic man.
---
what? they e not even enabled them wtf are you on about commenting 2 weeks later, I suggest you read what it actually says
---
That's the gayest most John wick response I've ever heard.
---
Byebye Skullflame :)
---
All he wants to do is give a laundry list of excuses, looks like they can‚Äôt accept they fucked up bigtime.
---
Because of him me and my friends back in MoP were able to complete Glory of the Icecrown Raider/Glory of the Ulduar Raider achievements, and got those dope proto-drakes. This was wayyyy before he blew up, like he didn't even have a stream at that time.
---
as far as private servers this IS TRUE. If youre away from everyone you get full xp.
---
Can confirm. Am OP do love rarepuppers and aww.
---
Those are high Elves.
---
thats how incentives and gradients work though.
---
you can't look at large groups of people as individual particles, they are more akin to a liquid, ie if its at the top of a hill they will flow down. so when the only place to get honor easily is to gank other people in large groups they will do that.
---
this is a fundamental part of game design, if you let the most efficient way to play be boring people will bore themselves and quit.
---
not true, its accurate, i upload census 2/3 times a day for weeks, i know someone who does the same ally side; it was 60 40 for weeks then dropped to this ratio very recently
---
Exploit??  Damn didn‚Äôt know ele was bannable
---
You must be mistaken.
---
This is not how rare spawns work.
---
"World pvp is dead everyone just sits in BGs"
---
That will be the complaint after everyone complained about world pvp...
---
Fearlina doesn't have a faction balance problem though, it's one of the  most even servers out there.
---
That changes the speed of your MC clear and annoys people but the gear does not change.  Maybe if the buffs were the only thing allowing you to clear certain bosses that would make sense.  And it affects the world bosses, but honestly on most servers only one or two guilds ever got those anyways.
---
+1!!!!!!
---
Oh are we really going to bitch about alliance ganking on Blaumeux? 8 deaths to get from Thorium Point into BRD. **8!** And that wasn't once. That has been a half dozen times.   
---
   
---
Sorry if I don't feel bad for horde on that server.
---
&gt;the current state of PvP servers
---
You mean the current state of a *handful* of PvP servers. Bigglesworth is thriving. Even with our slight Horde majority, our alliance counterparts are extremely good sports and have proven that with coordination they can lock down zones for hours even with the population imbalance.
---
 #nochanges REEEEeEeeEeEeEE
---
It shares data over party, raid, and guild channels, none of which are affected in any way by this change.
---
I don‚Äôt even know the guy in the video or watch streams but proc is in now way a viable spec to use for PvP and he would be lucky to take down lvl59 players.
---
Exactly, you don't play Fury Prot because you want to be the 1%, you play Fury Prot because you already are the 1%.
---
Is this satire? You think people in Vanilla weren't chain casting?
---
Dear God..
---
It‚Äôs literally takes 5 seconds to get a video from your PC to your phone. You can post videos from your camera roll on Snapchat.  It‚Äôs 2019, we need to start shaming these low effort posts when it‚Äôs so easy to produce high quality clips.
---
Thought about that too. The question is, how good can you sell it later on and is it worth waiting another month
---
feralas is the only area they ever control, horde has literally everywhere else, try playing ally side lol
---
and i play horde btw
---
Have you considered (de)porting them to Darnassus for amusement.
---
Westfall ! BEST SERVER NA
---
Are boobs fun to play with on any girl? Idk man you tell me.
---
Alright well let me know when you down Cthun bro
---
Nobody who knew what was good with vanilla raids thought MC would be that hard
---
It's good but a lot of guilds and players were prepared to do that 1 day of battlegrounds because of blizzard crappy communication.
---
For instance my guild did MC today instead of tomorrow because we weren't sure if we wanted to be farming honor at that time tomorrow. This impacted the amount of show ups and honestly this whole situation stinks due to blizzard failure to communicate.
---
Well for Swifty and Preach, there reason they so great is because they are old, the same can be also said MadSeasonShow. What they all have in common is that age has mellowed them, once upon a time Swifty was just like cdew or staysafe are right now as in they are a bit of a cunt. But time mellowed him so and so he‚Äôs fun to watch.
---
I too would be keen on this macro
---
one day the whole server will be final boss. Horde, ally, timbermaw, goblin- wont matter.
---
in your opinion, sure.
---
&gt; anything sharing threat information
---
Most or all of those go over party/raid channels, which are unaffected.
---
Shadow priests complaining about pvp what has this world come to..... You can slam your head into the keyboard repeatedly and still destroy most other classes 1v1.
---
I love good wpvp. But when you out level me by 5+ levels or fight me 3+ vs me, fuck that!
---
High as a kite elf. She can barely keep her eyelids open.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the whole thing. From
---
The people who watch people play video games to the fake drama created by the streamers that are making real money. It‚Äôs not like watch sports on tv seeing some loser sit in his room act tough in a video game isn‚Äôt very..well appealing to me...i think I missed the fad by being a few year too old and a few too many brain cells left to enjoy it.
---
We clear it in 32 minutes, Its not really that we gather world buffs to save raid time, its more of a fun challenge to keep it interesting.
---
Lets face it, MC is quite dull. Most of us have done the raid hundreds of times.
---
Is this the first game you have played with pvp?  Pretty standard stuff imo
---
Our guild had to push our raid times back because it takes people extra time to get in (~10 death runs from TP and ~5-6 from Lakeshire). Some can logout by the entrance the night before, which helps, but not everyone has the time to do that.
---
We've been able to adapt to a shitty situation. It's not much to ask that Horde do the same.
---
Yep you angry. #nochanges for life! Aside from the bullshit realm transfers and stuff this is basically like it was in Vanilla. O and take whatever total server pop is now. Cut in half twice then that the real deal.
---
The funniest part of this is that at launch it could be flipped and been completely valid 
---
Yet that goes completely ignored.

The ranking page only counted the top 1000 and it was at the end of the week. Honorspy is realtime and counts everyone one the server.

Wonder how much equipment has been broken at the hands of this guy since honor dropped LOL..

do BG's give XP?

Let's be real here. There's plenty of people out there that genuinely follow the mentality in favor of the comments by keepitpeace. I don't think it's really that crazy to assume it's not sarcastic, because it certainly doesn't come across as playful or sarcastic to me.
---
I just sold most of mine - spent 50g total on a banks worth of random twink gear (19/29 bracket) and cleared 210g.
---
I could of made more but I got tired of holding onto it - I am saving 1 pair of 'Feet of the Lynx' incase i wanna twink or sell if the price rockets... MAYBE
---
..Who is complaining?..
---
I've never claimed anything you listed there. 
---
My problem is mostly with this post of yours;
---
&gt;No they dont.
---
&gt;Rank 11 is for top 1,4% of your realms pvp players.
---
&gt;The amount of honor or whatever headway you¬¥ve made during the wpvp season is absolutely worthless unless you have a premade ready to go.
---
&gt;Battlegrounds are so much more honor.
---
As an answer to someone who said;
---
&gt;I mean they have to get the honor if they want to rank
---
Why do you keep keys in your inventory if you are doing lasher runs?
---
I also don't remember rated BGs in vanilla.
---
So I believe you are recalling correctly.
---
&gt;  The actual image in question is mocking the gormless hordies
---
Yeah... but I am the one with Tribe bias. LOL. Dude.. reread your comments...
---
&gt; That‚Äôs a weird way of writing ‚Äúally are laughing their asses
---
-
---
&gt;  no-lives impacting a whole community
---
&gt; ‚Äúno-lives‚Äù are the hordies
---
&gt; is so infantile
---
&gt; people have to find ways to ruin that
---
It seems like you are the one with hang ups over the opposing faction my dude.... I haven't ONCE insulted alliance players.
---
I'd be shocked they would be willing to deal with the lag.
---
As a us player I was quite happy with them staying in EU so I wouldn't need to deal with their BS in BG's
---
I‚Äôm not ashamed of it at all lol Your attempted attack was saying people disagree with it as a whole. Normal people are much more likely to agree with my positions as long as they have the thin veneer of political correctness than they will over someone bringing up how problematic decades old Disney movies are lol.
---
The more I read it again the more unsure I am too lol.
---
Please OP tell me you were kidding lol.
---
Lol you are braindead.
---
So Paladins make up for the deficit. Noted.
---
i need ideas for more!
---
Do Pve servers get bgs?
---
Thanks for reaching out! It doesn‚Äôt get me too down, other than the fact that the system itself is flawed and the unfortunate result of that is that people who just want to focus on other content cannot reasonably do so. Luckily Phase 2.0 is shortlived and we‚Äôll have BGs shortly. But, at no point have I ever chosen not to log in to avoid wpvp, or changed my plans at all. Hell, I even reached 60 in the middle of it all. Now that I have survived this, I feel like am ready to survive anything. It can only get better from here, and for those of us who have stayed, every time you kill us we only get stronger :)
---
Btw, still doesn‚Äôt explain why you killed my level 1, but no hard feelings, as you can see you gave me a good laugh!
---
The only limitations were from PvE (rp included) &gt; PvP.
---
PvP could transfer anywhere. There was also a 6 month cool down initially.
---
&gt;have path 1.0 and then eventually get to patch 1.12
---
Classic would be DOA if it launched with patch 1.0. [Racial traits weren't added until patch 1.1.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.1.0) and even 1.1.0 was pre-launch. The very first iteration was a minimum viable product and I doubt most sane people in 2019 would be willing to pay for the "privilege" of playing a barely working game.
---
Yeah i already have the most gear for every possible twink i would make saved.
---
There is a setting in your discord that is messing with it, I‚Äôm not at my pc atm or I would look and tell you exactly what one it was. There were a few people in my guild who had the same issue.  I wanna say it was something image related in the setting though.
---
I did all my starter lvling in durotar then bought the majority of the runecloth at 60, managed to collect quite a bit in the 60 dungeons as a tank
---
Nah theres nothing wrong with your spec. You're short on gear or a determined group of friends/guildies. Like I said it is a shame for those that started late/fell behind the original pack on release because organized wpvp is the coolest thing I've done in wow in a long time. You're gonna get your mads n bads saying people just corpse camped and 15v1'd but those are lfg pugs and bored griefers, or solo min max honor farmers. The real deal was a lot of fun
---
I'm just sharing my experience with it. I'm alliance on an unbalanced server and it's been a blast lol
---
Fair enough what rubs me the wrong way is PVE players acting likte there better than pvp players.
---
Play what you prefer and dont judge others.
---
Look at it this way: would you be motivated to farm the materials and gold required for pots/flask/elixirs every week when you knew other people in the raid didn't give a shit about that but had the same chance at the loot?
---
At the end of the day, you're asking them if you can join the raid in a DD role while having 1/2 the dps of your run-of-the-mill DD warrior/rogue.
---
I'm not shitting on you for wanting to play ret pala. We have a ret pala in our raids every week. The guild even chipped in quite substantially to help him get Hand of Ragnaros. What I'm saying is that I don't think the resentment towards your guild is warranted. In the end, it is their choice if they want to raid with someone who contributes half the dps of the other DDs.
---
Undead mage on Incendius looking for semi-hardcore guild that raids some combination of Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday. 
---
To clarify on semi-hardcore, I‚Äôve full cleared MC / ony every week since late September and I will show up every week on time. With all required consumables. Will bring flasks to progression raids however flasking to clear content on farm faster seems a bit excessive imo.
---
Right ...
---
Spy is pretty nerfed now after the range change.
---
Those don't affect me. Just saying I'd rather have Alliance and wpvp die on the server than to deal with the clowns that is those guilds :3
---
Epic. Grats on 60!
---
I can do North at 58? I heard east is easiest and I am a miner so rich thorium would be useful also
---
Your main focus will be carrying the flag in WSG but don‚Äôt expect to actual get in any kills 1v1. Always stay with the group you have some skills to stun the other players healers or surrender the plate wears so the real heavy hitters can crit them like cloth wearers:
---
So they're gonna play with 100+ ping?  Now they get to feel what us NA pserver players had to deal with for years lol.  Doesnt make sense to go to Faerlina to "assist with faction imbalance" though.  If that were the case they would go to Skeram or stalagg
---
It's not nearly as bad as people are saying, even on Alliance.  As long as the player is good they will do good DPS.
---
IMO it is a good idea to have a balance of 2H &amp; DW for gear spreading.
---
Im a little out of the loop when it comes to WoW terminology, what exactly happened?
---
You done throwing your hissy fit dude? Time to grow up some. Maybe get off Reddit for a few days man, this shit means too much to you.
---
Cool, that's not the point. 
---
The point is that the warrior chose to engage in PvP with that spec, popped consumes, etc. Doesn't matter if he's playing an unviable spec, the warrior chose to fight.
---
Will you be cheering me? Or rooting me??
---
lmfao
---
Think of it like this. 
---
Server A: Alliance: 70% Horde: 30%
---
Server B: Alliance 30% Horde 70%. 
---
Losing out on the 30% on Server A and B isn't likely going to have that much of an impact. At least, not enough of a noticeable impact to deter people from doing just that. 
---
That's what I was getting at.
---
Also, I can imagine that would be a fun thing to do for people that already have their gear.
---
Thanks mate :). I have read somewhere that the spreadsheet overestimate the impact of hit after the yellow cap. Maybe this is the reason why hoj replaced with the rune does not provide a great dps increase. But I don't know if it's true.
---
Nope I think it‚Äôs fun seeing everyone in org.
---
In order to truly "fix" retail and solve peoples' complaints, would involve such a large overhaul of the game that they might as well just make a new game entirely.
---
Battlegroups is not the same as cross-realm though.
---
The current implementation of spell batching and melee leeway is complete BS.
---
Once again the incorrect answer is voted to the top.  This sub is so bad
---
We've gotten 6 mageblades, we've been raiding for 7 weeks.
---
Well they have to get into the raids to be able to run them, and a couple of those are also world bosses, so they have to lock down the area while the raid is happening too. It‚Äôs not as cut and dried as it first looks.
---
&gt;hurr you posted here
---
&gt;I'm not a bigot
---
&gt;You're a white supremecist because I say so
---
&gt;I'm definitely not a bigot or racist
---
&gt;fuck off to where you belong
---
&gt;I'm DEFINITELY not an intollerant racist bigot dudes
---
You admited to both being a bigot and a racist, just accept it, no one cares about your bigotry or racism.
---
It's ok, just open your mind and learn about the real world and not the hug boxes you live in currently, it'll fix your bigotry and racism hopefully.
---
Or you'll double down on bigotry like you're doing here. eitherway you should stop embarressing yourself.
---
also reroll pve, I think that's where all this hatreds coming from, giving your bigotry a platform to stand on.
---
since you clearly suck and pvp, it'd be for the best if you did that (reroll pve) because you won't have all this extra stress of thinking you're top shit but still getting dumpstered on. that'd stress anyone out if they couldn't accept they sucked at the game tbh.
---
You are absolutely going to struggle tanking north, and it will take a lot longer due to threat generation and damage mitigation. That being said with how desperate most groups are for tanks you should still find something. 
---
Personally if I were you id spam east a few times. Like doing ZF in your late 40s, an easier time with greenish enemies &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; struggling with tougher ones.
---
Repost. Also, why don't you stop banging your head on a concrete wall before talking? It Avoids the brain damage you must've had to post this shit.
---
That was the first epic I've seen drop. I'm only 47 tho
---
Am i missing something?
---
With the new tab system its like theres a guy behind you or beside you ? Haha your not tabbing him get fucked mate.
---
The old systen would let me cycle through anyone near me regardless of my camera direction way better.
---
who tf even let the priest roll on that in the first place
---
Can confirm, I play an alliance rogue and a horde rogue on Sulfaras. Love the server and both factions.
---
Did you seriously select yourself to cast a spell on you? You know about alt? lol.
---
These alliance are probably salty af at horde for ruining their wpvp experience on their previous realm or for ruining earthshaker. You get what you deserve, or at least that's what they think.
---
This is always the reddit hot take, but I'd guess 95% of guilds running in their first raid in greens are not going to go 10/10, or at a minimum are going to eat a lot of consumables on wipes.  Pretty much anyone who hasn't run in on p-server in the last few years.  Sure, it's not exactly hard to press your 1 to 3 buttons and occasionally move 5 feet out of an AOE, but I don't think it is nearly as trivial with shit gear as some people like to make it in order to sound impressive on the internet.
---
It's the 10th in Australia, sorry lads no BGs.
---
use a video capture program next time...
---
When I leveling my warlock, I had herb/skinning just to make gold, later picked up tailor @57 for robe of the void (dropped skinning).  
---
I wouldn't be super frugal, just because at 60, with ok gear, you can solo Maraudon and get 5-10g/run or 40-50g/hour if you have a friend/guildie that can help reset instances.  There's also some DM-E routes that require a bit more complex (still not bad) but also farmable.
---
Other than epic mount or dreadsteed, the few things that come to mind that might be useful and can be bought, underworld band, DM trinket (harnessing shadows book/quest), felcloth gear (gloves, shoulders, head if you didn't get better BoP items yet), robe of void if a tailor, or winter night (?) can be bought.
---
As others have said, if you go dreadsteed route shouting for a warlock to help can save you 150-200g easy or more on the last portion.  Otherwise with rank 3 and honored, an epic is 800g + riding skill cost.
---
yeah the "top" raids will have 15-20 warriors aoe cleaving everything. Nightfall would be pointless
---
Actually you can flag on a PVE server and fight other people who are also flagged. The only real difference is that all the pointless ganking is gone.
---
Yes. You are correct. But we are used to seeing people that do not exist on our individual servers. According to the patch notes it is almost as though all of US East will be one big battlegroup.
---
Hey, unfortunately I don't have that information. I leveled most of my characters a while ago and the latest one I did, I had quite a few mages express interest in knowing the runs from my perspective, however my lock was already close to 40 at that time and was the last character I leveled to get it ready for BG's.
---
In the RFC video I did bring an alt(since it was quick to get to 8 before the video) and show the exp from that characters perspective for those runs, however since I recorded them all in 1 day, I didn't have time to show exp from an alts perspective for the other ones. In the RFC runs for the most part you were getting almost a full level every 2-3 at the early levels, peaking when you are equal to the mobs level and then taking more runs/level after that. Only recently I started doing SFK from 19-21, prior to that I did WC 19-21, which I know were \~20 min runs, and I believe it took 4-5 runs to get those 2 levels. When you do SFK and SM at 19 from memory I believe I was getting around 25k-30k/h depending on your level to the mobs. Beyond that to be honest I can't really remember. Someone asked a similar question here and I gave the best response I could from memory.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62kFMDW5t48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62kFMDW5t48)
---
For the early levels, i tried to keep the around 30-45 min, taking a bit over an hour/level in the high 30's-40's.
---
If you personally have a character on horde skeram and want me to run you for 1 hour for that information I don't mind helping you do that, but at the moment because I have basically leveled everything I want to, I don't have a character in range of anything anymore in order to get it myself.
---
Lol seek therapy
---
you can't transfer from an eu to us server
---
Yes there‚Äôs two: all of NA and all of EU
---
So I see that the Character Transfer DLC will be available and that it is $25 in retail. Are people really happy to pay what amounts to half a brand new AAA game to make up for a game breaking issue blizzard caused themselves..?
---
I looked at every tab on the realm list.
---
So if you are never in danger if dying and not losing threat, you should try to not die even more? Just do more damage and move on. Especially since literally every boss in MC is tauntable LOL.
---
My freefolk conditioning makes me want to downvote... yes I see the irony
---
Yeah.. I dont think a majority of people are going to PvE realms. Theyre going to Heartseeker to dogpile the Horde there.
---
Soon as this started I knew you were about to get ganked lmao. Congrats on 60!

Oh I see, you're an enlightened individual who needs to use coded language so people aren't repulsed by The Truth.

What do you plan to do with that extra point if not in Cold Snap?

I was just hoping youd finally take the hint and fuck off lul. But now it seems I have finally won and you can only result to being toxic, which is ironic. So with that final little fit of yours I am happy as a clam to see you go. Toodles buddy.
---
I am betting we see the whole gambit including faction transfers.  Gotta get them microtransactions.
---
Honestly suprised to see so many people lrefer the new system 
---
Im old school so im used to the tab system that most old MMOs use...
---
I would say this new system is that bad its forced me to click my targets instead of using tab ...
---
Then Flamelash actually did and they shut down transfers (too slow Blizzard!)

Imagine thinking AV is gunna take 10 minutes LOL

---
not to be abrasive but even in your context I don't see how you could take that as some sort of negative.
---
The developer‚Äôs job is to think about the long term consequences of their incentive structure. You can‚Äôt blame individuals for the actions of a majority.

You can send it in the snapchat chat, but not as just a video. Sorry no one snapchats you.

classic isn't vanilla
---
He was making fun of you because he's going to have an even easier time farming honor than you once you're stuck in an hour long BG queue and he's not...reading comprehension?
---
Seriously smashing the tab button 5 times is easier than holding it and turning my camera.
---
Sometimes i want to tab someone behind me and the new system cant do that without turnint around.
---
Ok Yang Gang
---
Get over yourself, that joke has been made millions of times before you.
---
Ah intense. I think my first was around then as well. 2nd was 52 in ST and I won the roll 5 way. Then most recent was in burning steppes off one of them orcs that one sold for 250.
---
I doubt that faction transfers will be a thing. Players would have to ditch their paladin and shaman friends since those classes can't be swapped and they don't use the same gear.
---
barman or heartseeker if you wanna drop a shitton of gold
---
Toxic PvP players are going to flood PvE realms, and there's not a damned thing we can do about it. Blizzard consistently underestimates problems, and never prepares, much like the people that rolled PvP realms and forgot they didn't like being camped.
---
i mean you can try, just go kill level 50ish mobs over and over and over and over and over
---
You mean Frost bolts
---
A'int nobody got time for that.
---
Actually people are really good at that. It‚Äôs specifically the thing humans are good at, that no other animal knows how to do. Some are better than others. Some are also better than others at realizing the difference between a group of people and individuals.

If you cant get a couple hours of free time for yourself on days off, then something in your lifes schedule must be really fucked up
---
You are a wise man. I am in a similar position but thought I could get to 60 before the honor system dropped. They dropped it early, and its been a bloodbath for me. BGs are dropping soon which adds salt to my wounds as I could have just leisurely already been 60 on a PvE server, geared up and be ready for BGs. As it stands as a fellow working dad, I'm 54 and will not slog it out until after BGs drop--then I will be behind the BG gear curve as well.
---
TL:DR: I wish I was was smart as this guy.
---
How can you tell if someone rolled a PVE server? Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll comment on your post.
---
&gt;Because it is literally the choice between 15 bucks a month, PLUS 25 bucks...
---
&gt;or no bucks a month and no bucks.
---
False dichotomy.
---
People who can't transfer aren't always going to leave, and dead servers are just as likely to drive players away as restricted transfers.
---
how is it good for a druid tank? It has a chance on hit proc that doesn't work in druid forms and zero stats
---
I mean I completely agree with that part, I thought we were talking about pvp servers in general. I left Whitemane for a smaller pvp server.
---
I'm not sure what this is meant to mean, but didn't BGs get introduced at their instance portal first, then at battlemasters in cities? Doesn't matter what patch we're on, this is out of order. 
---
Saying that though, i do prefer the city battlemaster way. The other way would solve nothing on pvp realms.
---
I got raid locked for Onyxia during her trash some weeks ago.
---
Ain‚Äôt nobody got time to watch these shitty low quality clips
---
eh, there were buffs and nerfs
---
+ weapon skill on rogues was a buff
---
attack speed normalization was a nerf
---
I'd trade 17.6% bonus AP for 5 weapon skill any day
---
I would consider returning if I could tranfer to PvE for free but no way am I paying Blizzard for a transfer.
---
i know that pain way too well
---
Also. That guide is for mitigation gear. Not for threat. Use that guide as a baseline.
---
In raids you want to aim for 9% hit chance.
---
In dungeons mitigation is fine.
---
Oh sorry did I not make it anime enough for you???  OWO SORRY uWU XD XD
---
Are they bad?
---
The point was that your rhetoric is so dismissive of Horde's feelings or thoughts. Saying "is so infantile" shows that you see Horde players as infantile. In itself it means nothing... but adding up all the stuff shows that you have a bias towards horde.
---
&gt;  you don‚Äôt provide any counter-argument
---
To what? Lol. I already admitted that there is a faction imbalance. You want me to counter your argument that "Horde players are literally worse people than alliance"? Really? It's an incredibly stupid position that you can't even prove yourself. Why should the burden be on me?
---
How about you counter my argument that "it's Blizzard's fault" LIterally your only argument is "Don't blame blizzard for your fault" without ANY evidence to suggest that maybe it ISN'T blizzard's fault. Literally nothing. So don't try to pretend that I am the only on in this "debate" not defending my position. You haven't done SHIT for your position. Literally NOTHING.
---
&gt;What I do is just let them die
---
I call this one : "You spank it, you tank it."
---
Pve to pvp wont be a thing. Dont worry about it.
---
Yeah 7min is more realistic tbh
---
Faction transfer are not bad in themselves.  They cld only allow changing to minority faction for example.  Imo anything that helps maintain faction valance is a good thing
---
Free faction transfer. Either complain about queue times or fix the problem yourself.
---
Not like games of AV didnt last days on end in vanilla..
---
..oh wait. Lol
---
Look at the breakdown of where Rogues' damage comes from then get back to me. üôÑ
---
Oh good, you solved racism! No one has biases lol! Yes, everyone uses coded language. The same way my girlfriend was worried about me having to pick something up from the ‚Äúshady‚Äù part of town lol she just won‚Äôt come out and say exactly what that means lol. 
---
Thanks those were pretty funny posts lol.
---
Holy fuck i forgot about those hahahahhahaha yessss
---
Yea faction transfers are a bit far fetched, but I wouldnt put it past them.
---
&gt; monopoles
---
I'd say you must be a physicist, but we all know that's definitely not the case.
---
GAME IS SAVED
---
They can still queue before they die.  Dying doesn't pull you out of queue.
---
LOL like a horror movie when you panned back and there was a alliance waiting for you
---
Sure, but people farm specific items. If it is not pre-bis then they dont give a shit about it being "good".
---
There are like 50% of items we haven't seen even once though, its really odd.
---
Fewer horde*
---
And good luck.  We have a lot of try hards ready for 13+ hours of grinding battlegrounds
---
&gt;hardcore
---
&gt;wow
---
You in for a rude awakening.
---
you have a funny definition of top, since I specifically mentioned speedrunning separately. APES, for example, runs a 11+ casters, and you will not see anyone wasting the raid's time with a nightfall on the vast majority of fights.
---
Because there was no incentive to. Its why people have been asking for faction queues, if people have been moving off realms with queue times, they would go to the opposite faction to escape them as well. At this point 80% of the pvp realms are tilted towards the horde, transfering them around will do nothing to fix the problem.
---
You think making Classic was free? Cheap? Lol.
---
This is missing some context from Vanilla though that makes the meat grinder MUCH worse now than it was then:
---
1) In Vanilla, the honor system took a VERY long time before it dropped. Most of the players were 60 by then.
---
2) Overall number of players per server was much less, so you had less opportunity to be ganked since there were less players on your server.
---
This is a much worse situation in Classic than in Vanilla.
---
that's pretty smart. Expensive, but smart.
---
Because Thrall is bastard man!
---
barman shanker has higher damage for backstab but it also had a bleed proc that will interrupt blinds and gouges.
---
Shazzrah - EU
---
Funny thing was I was going to reply to him originally that, "Well I streamed some raids for about a week, so I guess I can call myself a streamer and claim streamers are angels too." because you know, I didn't do anything shitty for that week. But I figured he wouldn't understand my sarcasm toward his defense of streamers.
---
I‚Äôm a lock on this server wtb heals
---
Even further imbalances created by alliance players when all they inevitably paid transfer to a single server you say?
---
I stay arms pvp spec in my guild. Fortunately they let me, but I do stay competitive with our fury warriors. I'm usually fighting for 2nd or 1st between the 4 other warriors and always stay within the top 10. It's only MC and Ony right now so it's not a big deal, but I'll probably have to respec when BWL comes around in order to maximize dps and free up the debuff slot.
---
I dont who to be mad at please someone tell me how to feel.
---
Idk what server you‚Äôre on but I know on mine which is about 60/40 horde/alliance. We have organized to take over BRM/SG and have done it successfully for a certain amount of time, it‚Äôs only when the horde gather an insane amount of people is when we got steam rolled. 
---
So what ended up happening is for the first few weeks we engage or organize teams which would turn into raids, which turned into multiple raids, until it got to the point where we were completely outnumbered. It would always end up this way and eventually less and less alliance participated since they either they knew what would end up happening or got bored of it. Groups still organize to clean it out but they don‚Äôt stay there for long because the horde will typically come with a bigger group and outnumber them and sometimes camp and are forced to teleport out.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Not sure where you see "proud of that"

Notice I say "people grow up" meaning I see it now as childish. I was a angsty teenager doing angsty teenager things.

From my knowledge they're mainly the ones who camp the IF AH
---
You're still flagged after coming out of a BG in a capital city.  People will be flagged around the BM.  People will be ganked.  Happened all the time in Vanilla.  It will happen again.
---
Indeed
---
How likely are they to report you to police if you kidnap and force them to play?
---
I think It was cheap compared to making a new game
---
What problem? More people rolled horde instead of ally. How is that a dev problem? The playerbase fucked the game not the devs. You just want someone to blame.
---
I got a Shadowfang last night and I don't know if I should sell it for 200g right now or wait til later in the week.
---
This seems to be the only solution to the problem. Literally the only solution.
---
Current spell batching feels fine to me. Most of the complaints about it now I remember hearing 15 years ago too...
---
What?  You have classic because it is profitable to bank off peoples nostalgia.  Respect capitalism if anything for sucking you back in.
---
People in vanilla also hadn't played av for 15 years and didnt understand effective strategies. Players have changed a lot since then and I highly doubt it's going to be long gamea like the old days.
---
You're a credit to your race, son
---
Someone didn't play Vanilla.
---
Right... which was kinda the joke I was making.
---
FREEfolk...group think conditioning...
---
Nvm
---
So dense for one spelling mistake 
---
And yet you couldn't even speak my language lmao
---
After the changes to AV that made it quick. Yes via battlegroups. This was pretty late though.
---
If we're taking about full x realm across regions that had more than like 8 battlegroups then no.
---
 Basically
---
Yes, and people are telling the tanks to put on a shield. This is not good advice.
---
Nethergarde Keep is pretty good
---
congrats on being wrong
---
Not to mention, that was 20 yrs ago...
---
Sounds like you didn't play Vanilla.
---
Can call it Fairlina now? ey?
---
*please laugh*
---
1.st of all its a Mace, so its immediately viable for Human Ret Paladins in PVE content.  
---
2. You might think what about Human Warriors in raids? well since you're alliance and you dont have access to Windfury totem on horde side, 2Handed warrior dps in raid is severely hurt on alliance side.  
---
3. The mace has a big DMG proc on attack about 300dmg or so + dot i believe, it meshes well with the heavy RNG damage a ret paladin has (same as shaman) bigger 1shot potentials.
---
Heal duo as druid just fine anger if the tank is good.
---
What's the "Elemental Invasions" bit all about?
---
I have been uwing my ignore list is thid not the right way ?
---
You cant ignore an entire guild but it works good for single idiots.
---
its t1 lol
---
Whoah...
---
I really enjoyed that. &amp; I did, in fact, laugh out loud irl. Ty.
---
You could be my guild that clears it in 3.5 hours and has strict spec and talent restrictions on who is allowed in.
---
Only way its fun is to be in the top 10% of people that hit 60 and had some decent gear once the honor system dropped. Or at least be horde on a server that tilts in their favor population wise. 
---
Other than this, its just a supreme waste of time. Actually, its worse than that, you are basically paying money every month to be someone else's entertainment. Reverse Prostitution.
---
Queues can't be much worse than death runs to brm, we've had people take over an hour and my server is pretty close to balanced
---
What‚Äôs the add on for the melee enhancements?
---
It took them several years to do. Whether they are creating new content or translating old code, it is still labor hours, resources and time to do so. The cost was not much cheaper. Guaranteed.
---
Yeah that was my other line of thinking, but at least with the ~50% drop rate it seems more achievable than, say, mageblade for a mage or warlock. So I can see how people would be upset if I rolled on staff of dominance or sorcerous dagger
---
They can still queue, you don't get bumped out of queue after dying in the world.
---
For alliance or horde?
---
Not even close to relevant to what they said. Why do you repeat the exact same thing? I know you don't believe it, but some people like the strategy of small scale and large scale PvP, ganking is a small part of it and smart players roll in groups.
---
This is one of the best ones I‚Äôve seen recently
---
I respec shadow for pvp between raids and it‚Äôs been great so far! Only locks and shamans wanna duel me cos the rest says we‚Äôre too op soo maybe you need to play a bit more.
---
Me to! I was definitely on the northern most tip of Azshara killing Crab people and Murlocs. Never got ganked once. Had the highest level mobs in the region as wel which allowed me to stay there until level 56.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/O7vGMBK.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/O7vGMBK.jpg)
---
So many of the problems that have come up in classic seem to stem from the root thought that no one was going to play classic and the fallout from that being a totally bogus premise.
---
I have nothing to do with it. I have no control over what other players do. Blizzard does have control. Human behavior is very predictable at scale. You‚Äôre a dumbass with a 5 year old level of critical thinking if you can‚Äôt grasp this simple concept and instead hurl insults. Pathetic.
---
Why not both?
---
And im still sitting at lvl 42...
---
&gt; How is that a dev problem?
---
The developers provided zero oversight into faction balance. Forced the players to do a manual census to figure out what was going on. LITERALLY broke census addons to prevent the census from being conducted.
---
Now they want to charge for server imbalance?
---
Are you fucking dense kid?
---
If your HS is off cooldown, it will not kill you. It will use your HS.

I used to fury tank dungeons before going DEEP prot (i mean 11/5/34?) and I can tell you all right now, deep prot will keep aggro and save your life in a pug. people want a fury tank for fury threat for faster runs, and that only works if your DPS can kill stuff fast enough to where you dont get beat down. you need incredible gear (BWL+) or everybody to atleast be full epics before fury tanking is ideal.  
---
Since the switch, I have all the negatives outlined above...but that sense of grabbing 8 mobs and being able to keep all of them on me no problem? THAT is good tanking, and a fun time
---
These posts are getting so annoying, PvE players on this sub are like the new vegans
---
Who getting down on the 49 bgs!? Bout to tear it up full destro. Going to keep deathcoil on cooldown all day tomorrow
---
Hyena aren't dogs, they are an offshoot of the cat family. 
---
They basically evolved to be dog like in a region that didn't have a natural dog predator. Much like foxes evolved to fill a role of a cat in regions that didn't have cats.
---
Unfortunately, it's just going to break addons that provide information that should already be available to use.
---
This is 100% more important than the battlegrounds that will save the state of the game.  Now I can fill up 10 more bag slots with shit I don't need to be carrying around, but... "you never know when it might come in handy."
---
I think it's a good idea but you will find nothing but downvotes here
---
Cannot be healthy? Yet classic and pservers have/had healthy player-bases. The entire point of classic was that many players actually wanted that old unrefined gameplay. Many like yourself did not, and that's fine because retail exists.
---
What about pve to pve? I rolled on a stupid low horde pve server. We're like 3:7 horde to alliance.
---
I kinda liked it when they ‚Äúnerfed‚Äù it. It then became so much easier to pin point people‚Äôs locations.
---
Faerlina, most of the alliance here are simp orbiters from twitch who don't actually pvp or even know how to, absolute scum of the earth and their game time revolves around AFKing in Ironforge and honor trading in some remote cave
---
I'm Alliance. I haven't checked in a while but I think there's a lot more Alliance than Horde. Do what you will with that information.
---
Priest was probably thinking "i wont even need to heal the gnome"
---
With what? Im 55 on Warrior atm, not farming Truestrike would be great
---
We came in with 1.12 talents, out of order. Plenty of things which were added late to vanilla have been available since classic released.
---
Going around flagged for PvP on a PvE server = actual hardmode
---
That mechanic used to be in the game. I remember ranking down one time because a raid member made a dishonorable kill. But it was limited to low level players I believe.
---
This is the quality I admire.
---
Yeh I'm playing less and less these days since horde honor farming my server, can see a flow of about 8-12 horde every minute around my body half way to BRM lol, no way I'm going to reroll or PAY !!!  for a character transfer when pretty much every Oceanic realm is Horde Dominated! Will let my sub expire if nothing is done in the next week or two, just aint worth logging on to raid and hope someone can summon to dungeons, don't like 10v1
---
Yep, these people are so fucking dumb. Literally claiming "you think you do" to people enjoying classic.
---
lmao i hope this is a troll
---
No offense to PvE players, but this extreme fright of any sort of conflict or adversity is really strange. Does it suck as an ally getting ganked 6 times on the way to BRD? Yea. But at least you feel something. At least something is happening.
---
I literally cannot imagine entering BRM and just not PvPing. While it does sometimes get super fucking annoying getting ganked, it wouldn't want it any other way. It makes the world and server feel live (insert Flamelash joke). Going from Thorium Point to LBRS SHOULD be dangerous. 
---
"Oh but you can just flag for PvP". Yea. I had a 60 on a private PvE Server. NOBODY flags for PvP. ;aybe like 5% of the people EVER do it.
---
If all you want to do is run the same 15 year old dungeons a couple dozen times each and then raid log, then by all means go PvE. A lot of us enjoy world PvP too much, even if it makes us angry a lot of the time.
---
Timing couldn‚Äôt have been more Perfect
---
I mean Blizzard has already made changes to the game. Adding faction transfer arent much of a change really. Moving around the horde around when most pvp servers are horde majority will never fix the faction imbalance. But convincing horde guilds to swap factions might.
---
I‚Äôm sorry too. Sorry no one liked your pour painting, that is
---
Did you maybe read over the first line?
---
&gt;we‚Äôre making a change to disallow calling C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage **with the CHANNEL ChatType**
---
Bolded emphasis mine.  Why would you assume official channels are safe from the CHANNEL chat type?
---
Just res and fight. Kill one or two before you go down again. Isn‚Äôt that the point of wpvp? If it‚Äôs a whole crew, then call on your friends to assist. This is supposed to be a group game.
---
Me and my guild would do it for free. I know another guild that would also switch. I think it can help
---
/thread
---
I agree with this completely. Rend is shit for tanking. Even for dps, it's only good if the mob is alive for the whole duration assuming you purchased max rank. 
---
I would like to add that after switching to defensive stance, I prefer to switch to 1h+shield. The whirlwind should be done with a 2H for max damage (threat). Once in def stance w/ 1h+shield, revenge is first priority followed by sunder armor while revenge is on CD.
---
&gt; That's what MMOs are about, not grinding dungeons.
---
MMOs are about everything social related. If a group of friends want to grind dungeons, they're doing what an MMO is about, If they wanna play pretend and one is RPing as a bartender at a bar location with active chit chat of 'whats going on in the world' all as if we were NPCs, that's what MMOs are about.
---
..As is cruising around like a warband of orkz lookin for a fite.
---
They are better honor, so it's going to go a long way.
---
Yeah i think plenty of horde wouldn‚Äôt mind changing to Alliance to help solve the issue. I wouldn‚Äôt either but i‚Äôm attached to progression with my current guild.
---
Same. Definitely helps that I‚Äôm on balanced server tho, but I love flying to Tanaris and wondering if I‚Äôll be able to repair before I get nuked by alliance inside the city (I‚Äôm lvl 51 holy priest), love turning fights in our favor even after death with spirit of redemption, love trying to juke alliance omw to instance even if I don‚Äôt succeed. The world actually feels alive and dangerous and it‚Äôs just awesome for me.
---
I will try East, I have to hope it is easier to enter than blackrock mountain. I also could use Satyr's Bow for the 1% hit. They may even offer to let me do the mining
---
Keyring is nice but breaking spy is the real news here
---
I think it affects the honor spy addon.
---
I‚Äôd go alliance if they‚Äôd give us dwarf shaman.
---
The old "I got a suspicion". This change won't do anything to Spy.
---
I guess it just makes pve an objectively easier difficulty level
---
Its 100% Pss lol
---
Helenius you fucking r word xDDDdddDDdddd
---
Yep, I have a job and no time to spend corpse running. Will happily but a transfer for me and my pals when those became available.
---
spy shouldn't be affected much, maybe sharing KOS lists.
---
honorspy should be dead, different addon tracks honor.
---
sounds logical, except that raid leaders might not like you speccing into arms for dps unless they are pretty casual.
---
People will quit or re-roll.  The end result is the same as a paid transfer.
---
Yeah definitely my mistake for not checking. I thought this fell into the whole ‚Äúno changes‚Äù thing. They certainly haven‚Äôt put effort into anything else to support this game.
---
I hear that Flamelash is great (too soon?)
---
as said, Blizzard has control and therefor they need to crack the whip and enforce balance, rather than let players have choice.
---
enforced 50/50 ratio to the point of changing player-character races on the spot and deny access to opposite faction capitals, like an invisible wall or instant-death zone.
---
Its t1 indeed
---
No way... a freakin boomkin?! I'll gladly submit against such a rare beauty
---
You owe everyone in your country money for subsidizing your education with their tax dollars. And if your parents paid for a private education, you might want to get them a fruit basket or something as an apology for the profound waste of resources.
---
Almost every psychologist is on the same page: the evolutionary edge that humans have is our ability to recognize and predict patterns, our ability to cooperate/work as a team, and our ability to hypothesize ‚Äî that is, to imagine scenarios and invent tools to address them. This is not long-term thinking, since most of those skills help you pretty immediately: you imagine building a fire to keep you warm through the freezing night TODAY, because you won't survive tomorrow. You develop a farm because your tribe has run out of berries to gather and has hunted the moose in your area to near extinction, and you don't really consider any of the consequences of your farm because you're getting hungry.
---
 These are not examples of long-term planning, because again, almost every psychologist is unanimous in saying that our ability to plan in a contextually long term (meaning, in context of decisions affecting a certain timeframe, humans will put more emphasis toward solving short-term problems in spite of long-term consequences) is very poor, and what is often held up as an example of " great long-term planning" by anthropologists (not psychologists) is in-fact just an extrapolation of short-term fight or flight thinking.

I took Blackstone off when I got Accuria and run BoA/ETR on my mitigation set
---
Do I look like I know what the hell a snapchat is, im just trying to get a picture of a god dang warrior here.
---
Bug/Lag?
---
I had a clip from me in old vanilla of a bug where I was stuck on my horse and able to enter combat and was fighting from horse back. Movement speed was my normal run speed though. A friend filmed it and we told guildies mounted combat was coming in TBC and here was the proof on me beta testing it.
---
Its not even updated to reflect the transfers yet. Since it takes raidlogs into consideration, its probably best to wait 2 weeks to see the impact. But i do think its not as big as 70/30 but i wouldnt be surprised if it ends up becoming 60/40 or 55/44.
---
but you said Nesingwary in the title?
---
&gt; The point was that your rhetoric is so dismissive of Horde's feelings or thoughts. Saying "is so infantile" shows that you see Horde players as infantile.
---
I don‚Äôt think someone‚Äôs infantile because they chose the red flag instead of the blue flag, I think someone‚Äôs infantile if their main point of justifying their actions is that they, apparently, are entirely incapable of free will. You‚Äôd certainly think this was the case when reading their ‚Äúreasonings‚Äù, as they all seem to have one thing in common, and that is refusing to accept responsibility for their actions. Are *all* Horde players camping Ironforge (and other cities)? No, absolutely not, the vast majority are just playing the game like the rest of us and thus don‚Äôt have to take responsibility for the actions of their faction-mates. Are an oppressive amount of Horde players camping Ironforge (and other cities)? Yes, and it‚Äôs these people who are making the excuses, not your average Horde player. 
---
When I refer to the ‚Äúbut Blizzard made me do it through incentives!‚Äù excuse as ‚Äúinfantile‚Äù, I‚Äôm absolutely *not* calling every Hordie to ever exist infantile. I am simply doing as is clear, criticising the excuse. Yes, the problem *is* partially on Blizzard because of how the system is designed, but it‚Äôs difficult for them to fix it as the ‚Äúno changes‚Äù crowd would go absolutely wild. In this way, it falls down to basic decency, the decency to not farm honour from lvl 40s and camp FMs. The whole ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm just playing the game and getting my rewards‚Äù argument is entirely valid, and entirely pathetic. 
---
Another Horde player in this thread jokingly commented ‚ÄúVictory!.. what now?‚Äù which I find to be very apt. I mean, congratulations on ‚Äòowning the Ally scrubs‚Äô with ~~superior numbers for gank squads and camping~~ objectively better players who are just amazing at PvP, but when they start to leave, you can‚Äôt just point your finger at Blizzard. I‚Äôm not blaming the Horde, I‚Äôm blaming the no-lifers that exist on both sides, but are especially oppressive on the Horde. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdarn Alliance whining‚Äù whenever an Ally meme highlighting in-game problems is posted, to write it off as such is *actual* dismissal.
---
Kidney stones.
---
I'll have you know I speak fluent moron, thank you very much.
---
No, I definitely agree with you on the fact that wpvp right now is a garbage-fire.
---
Human Rogue on Shazzrah here, only hit lvl 40 today and tbh I'm really struggling with the fact I should spend my gold on a mount or just give up on either playing a Rogue or playing the game at all.
---
I'm not in a guild and can barely find a group to do dungeons because they only want Mages for the AoE farming/grinding. If I do find a group, reaching the dungeon is itself is a pain in the ass because of the Horde ganking me (and the others) on sight.
---
Also, I think once the BG's are here later today, Horde will have huge queues in comparison to the Alliance, but I think they will absolutely dominate and be victorious most of the time because not only their better PvP racials, but because they will be having far superior gear.
---
I bet Alliance can forget the AQ openings as well.
---
:(
---
He is talking specifically about  streamers who use their communities to carry them. He didn't said that all streamers use their communities to carry them.
---
This would require faction balance to actually be the problem people have.
---
They claim it's faction balance, but all it is is a flawed honor system for world-pvp.
---
Last night my raid nearly wiped on golemagg, but me and 9 other survivors beat him from 20% by kiting his adds and smart cooldown use. It felt amazing, it was awesome, but it didn't even come close to the feeling of winning an on the spot raid v raid battle. Hell, it wasn't even as fun as the run to MC - us and another ally raid plowing through the brm campers then doubling back as they respawned.
---
If I got ganked every second I wouldn't want to miss those experiences. But I guess you're having more fun logging in once a week to do MC and maybe pick a couple of herbs.
---
His lion just glaring at him
---
I think the boomer role is reversed here, friend. Given Snapchat is the newer technology than screen recording software.
---
But, okay. Gottem I guess?
---
This will probably make People quit the game kn the extremely unbalanced servers, and then you have the same situation as if they were allowed to transfer to wherever they want, but just fewer total players.
---
The 90-10 servers are for me fucked beyond recovery.
---
The 60-40 ish servers can still be fixed by de reading numbers of logged in players or introduce layering again
---
Create a problem and sell the solution
---
Never used snapchat but what is the difference between using snapchat or just any messenger app where you can send videos, gifs, photos etc.
---
cool post subscribed. I also like the color red the most
---
You allies crybabies destroyed Flamelash, once a great balanced server.
---
Have you seen BFA? Or Legion? or Wod? And you still think they aren't total morons?
---
So, blizzard allowed transfers contributing to the problem by emptying the servers for alliance instead of allowing transfers to balance the server more, how is that not blizzards fault?
---
This doesn't break Spy in the slightest.
---
Game would probably turn out better if we're being real here (Obviously not saying they should do it, that'd be dumb). Seems as though the WPVP on PVE servers is where people are having the most fun.
---
Bad idea. Just reroll.
---
We are getting the nerfed version of AV from the end of WoW. Most AV's there lasted under an hour. 
---
With a pre made knowing what they are doing and up against pugs then yeah maybe 10 min is a bit short but 20-30 min for a win isn't unreasonable.
---
‚ÄúThis patch includes client support for paid character transfer which may become active at a later date‚Äù
---
Know what we never hear about? Flamelash.
---
Honestly a mystery what goes down on PVP servers.
---
I‚Äôve got a key for that
---
RP PVP ZT is alliance dominated 55%, not much right? Pretty balanced I'd say. We still get crushed on the horde side. It's completely disorganized and we just get fucked. There's a few times when we can do shit like when we destroyed aliance all night for azuregos but BRM is a shitshow all day tons of horde corpse running. It's even worse when you know we'd probably get in easily if we just ressed all at once and went in. All that to say, balance isn't all the matter :(
---
Evasion mount?
---
They need to do free transfers and faction changes to low pop realms.  And maybe even a double XP bonus to 60.  It's the only way you will get people to move to low pop alliance.
---
Is optimal spec even required for dungeon dps? A bigger concern is that tanking level 60 5-man content would be harder as fury than arms. So with fury, you might be stuck as a pure dps role everywhere and inferior at pvp to arms.
---
Still a huge assumption both factions are making about queues. I will be downvoted for this comment
---
Fainkdeath is a big memer, I doubt that was meant to be legit roll on the crown, he waited so long to roll too no way it was serious. On the off chance it was well he did wait for fucking ever to roll and asmon just gave it to the highest roller, can't really call that a ninja either way. Guy made a meme video about it ffs, I think he was just trying to clown McConnel in the first place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpPFrchLb8s
---
I told ya, the stuff about talking shit then wanting to quit/transfer was true. Those are good reasons to criticize asmon instead of the made up shit and the overblown shit. Like people giving him gold, who gives a fuck? It's not effecting anyone else's gameplay why care? Also the original list said he relies on his viewers giving stuff which ya people give him a lot of stuff but he made it sound like asmon depends on his stream for gold/gear which isn't accurate. They just give him stuff and he says "ok, thank you".
---
Also I wouldn't call his "shameless raids" ninja looting, everyone knows that asmon will take everything he can use in those raids. It's basically just a run where everything he could use is reserved and people join of their own free will.
---
I think its a bug indeed, on my screen i was actually already dismounted. But my partymember Asselity saw me on my mount constantly, even in combat lol! Went all the way up to molten spire and back to south entrance on my mount before taking the screen. 
---
Haha mounted combat in TBC, that wouldve been a blast KEKW
---
It's not that it exists, it's that the batch is just too large. Two mages polymorphing each other is hilarious if it's an occasional rare thing. If it's routine, it's annoying. 
---
Currently, batch sizes are so large that, say, Omen of Clarity procs are getting eaten by the ability that procced them, rather than being used by your next attack. This is definitely weird, and affects how classes play.
---
Humor is even in the description
---
Awesome. Next up Grand marshal/high warlord? :p
---
Freaking Awesome work
---
No, you don't get it! We need updates on flamelash every hour on the hour!
---
You can just use the combat log for the exact same thing....
---
It's defined by the  amount of honor you gain relative to your faction.  Not some predefined number of honor.  Your rank points are defined each week.  Every week counts as incredibly important to your ranked standing.  I don't get where you think skipping a week of pvp ISNT detrimental to your pvp rank.
---
It doesn't seem like you understand that WPvP right now is giving the same rank points as bgs will next week.  It's relative mate it's not some reach X points system.
---
try being alliance priest vs 40%+ Undead enemies
---
Thats because it is an exploit and one should get banned for doing it :-)
---
He was recording it for his friends on Snapchat, not for you current year neckbeard
---
Mate one of his guildies did this so everyone must've done it.
---
&gt; overtuned bosses and 1.2 itemization
---
But not 1.2 talents. It's too big to underestimate.
---
I'm sure at least mid-tier guilds would have troubles in MC with 1.2 everything.
---
pretty much. rolling on a PvE server as alliance was my best decision wrt classic. had no issues leveling up, aside from some crowded zones, but it was nice and enjoyable. and if i ever wanted to wpvp, i can just flag and people will still attack me. there are still frequent raids on capital cities, so lots of potential there. we've even done organized wpvp with the horde on our server. plus, we still have competitive world environments around world bosses and such. i'm leveling my second and third characters now after getting my druid pretty close to bis (missing a few pieces of minor upgrades) and i'm having a great time. can't wait for p3 and BWL :D
---
Lol? You must not play a rogue or look at your screen often when fighting druids/rogues. This item is completely gamechanging and still busted a.f. its my #1 biggest issue with classic
---
It just can't come soon enough.
---
That would be you who is in the for the rude awakening. 1.12 av is super easy and fast
---
So is Battle Chicken bugged or not? Is it supposed to stand still and not follow you like other Battle Pets
---
Is this the "pvp on pvp servers" that I hear everyone talk about?
---
I mean yea it‚Äôs a both sides thing
---
That was also 2 people out trying to get kills. Not a full 40 man raid ganking redridge.
---
Finally some quality classic wow content.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to absolutely decimate the pvp players who have had no competition
---
are you trolling? Or are you just trying to spread the wrong info? Cause that person is right
---
A way your body gets rid of liquid waste
---
I mean... BGs are being added to the game tomorrow.
---
Honestly, raid logging gives me time to play other stuff and even now, BGs, not like i can do much as a resto shaman anyways. And i don't feel like swapping specs every time i want to run something/log in for raid or want to go clap someone's ass cheeks.
---
Had a rogue leave as soon as he got his T1 helm for Garr, like a month after classic release. The only time I've ever seen that happen, so yeah it's rare.
---
oh we didn't just stand still in one place, we controlled a large area and this was our good bye spot :)
---
Warriors compete for the threat best they can. We often got our fury tank recovering her.
---
Nuke in p2. Go crazy.
---
Full T2 bloodfang
---
You do need the faction specific riding for each rank 11 mount right now
---
Classic is a completely different beast than Vanilla. But thanks for admitting you don't play Classic so you don't know what you're talking about.
---
