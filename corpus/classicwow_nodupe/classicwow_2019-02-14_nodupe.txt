All the edgelords roll horde (but not all horde are edgelords).  So this leaves three types of alliance players:

1.  Chad

2.  Chad’s girl

3.  Legolas

We used mixed EPGP + loot council. Simply put, we followed EPGP for the most part and loot council intervened when something like tier set bonus could be gained by giving it to someone else. Common sense things that some raiders fail to have common sense for when greed takes over. 
---
&gt; I know this gets parroted a lot, but if you spend ~30 minutes on the AH on a weekly basis you can turn a profit. 
---
This works when a few people do it. Unforunately, trading is a zero-sum game, and this solution doesn't scale.
---
Interesting, this wasn't my conclusion at the time, but if you've been active in theorycrafting for years and claim otherwise I will look more into it.

ay, that's a good point about tremor

I hope this doesn't effect classics current release date.

The taunt wasn’t what made paladin all of a sudden good, nor why it was poor in raids.

It can be said that the company views the current share price as really low and they buy back shares because the market is pricing it wrong according to them. It did drop from high 80s to 40$ under a year.
---
Admittedly I didn't do any in-depth analysis of the meters/logs to figure out who was getting ahead, but overall I saw that locks/mages were pretty equal, with mages slightly ahead on some fights.
---
Bullshit, no competitive guild will ever be using dkp, while dkp might end up with more "fair" (using that term very lightly) distribution, it will never beat a council in effectiveness of gearing a raid as a whole, especially when there's as little loot to go around as there is in classic.
---
Blizzard will 100% follow classic wow with TBC. That is if Activision doesn’t fire everyone and give their CEO’s all the money
---
You always give loot to the person for whom it will be most beneficial to the guild as a whole.
---
Sometimes this means giving an upgrade to the person who has been in the guild for a long time despite other people having other people getting a bigger upgrade and sometimes it means doing it the other way around.
---
It really is a case by case basis.
---
They can follow but the classic level 60 servers should remain.  I don't want them to disappear.
---
I would expect them to keep the old characters and continue playing at 60, with the option to transfer your 60 to a TBC server and continue your journey. 
---
I could see them allowing you to stay at 60 though.

Two mana burns would turn a ret pally into a slower, dumber, hunter pet.

&gt; it is not a good indicator for skill. 
---
I agree. It's not a *good* indicator for skill. But it is better than having nothing, which you disputed before.  
---
&gt;In modern WoW that's not a problem because you can cross-realm and get as many players as you want, but good luck doing that in Classic.
---
Yeah, people just don't pug much in classic, that's basically all that happens. They don't suddenly start accepting people without any sort of proof of experience. It might be asking about random tactics, or inspecting their gear. No matter what you do there's no guarantee of skill. Achievements just has the advantage of being a big convenience for raid leaders, without actually affecting gameplay, it's just an administrative question. 
---
&gt;Yes it does because then you, as a raid leader, actually have to use your skills to try and determine who can do what based on what that person has equipped, how he's answering questions, what consumables he's bringing etc.
---
Which you need to do anyway, even with achievements. Achievements just skips the first obvious step of getting rid of people who has never done the content before. 
---
&gt;Just like how in an interview (at least in tech, or in jobs worth a fuck in general) they give less of a shit about your credentials and more of a fuck about what you actually know how to do. While having credentials is alright, no one is going to "invite" you in any company without an interview, an exam and an evaluation.
---
And just like real life companies if you have a lot of people applying to  a position they might throw out under-qualified applicants based on very basic criteria, like having previous experience in the field. That's the same as checking achievements in WoW. 
---
&gt;No it doesn't, it deceives naive people such as yourself that they reflect experience. If it can be bought at a reasonable price, if you can get carried to get it, then it's not an indicator of experience, skill or anything else. If it can be abused it will be abused.
---
You think about this the wrong way. It's not that having an achievement is a guarantee of experience. It's that *not* having an achievement is a guarantee of *not* having experience. Like if you don't have the achievements for the later bosses in heroic BoD, you absolutely do not have experience on heroic Jaina. 
---
And are you really denying that if you pick random people with an achievement, and another group of people without an achievement, that the group without will have just as much average experience on the fight as the group with the achieve?
---

I play warrior too, and the reason I stuck to it in the early game was that I had a strong feeling my hard work would be rewarded down the road. I was correct, therefore I believe it was intentional.

OK... so what I am saying is... just because YOU think they are flaws does not mean I think they are flaws. A flaw to you is not a flaw to me. One mans trash is another mans treasure.

I understand that... but if the community as a whole came together and said we want this guy back.. please give him his job back... they kind of have to at least acknowledge it. Or they can really prove they don't listen to us and lose a ton of customers in the process.

For me they should have either improved the old world or at least made the new content more connected to the old. Outland had only a single connection point to the Eastern Kingdoms and you rarely had reason to travel between the two. Kalimdor had five and gave plenty of reasons, so even though it was a completely separate continent it felt more connected.

I know I repeat myself in every post about this, but people seem to forget. So.. I will keep posting it.
---
Blizzard said that they view classic WoW as a museum piece, which basically means that they want to ALWAYS have classic WoW on the side that people can return to just to have fun or for new players wanting to see how it was back then.
---
So if classic TBC ever comes out, it will guranteed be separate from classic WoW.
---
While i agree, this is irrelevant to what I was trying to say.
---
I'm just separating facts from misleading clickbait.
---
These helped but were not the biggest things I think. Mana regen was hugely increased in TBC. Mana when healed for both prot and ret was incredible and Mana regen when ret judges were the biggest reasons they improved
---
You are completely misinterpreting what these people are saying.
---
From what I've seen, every Classic streamer/youtuber I watch wants Classic and TBC/Wrath servers to exist independently and not erase one another. They want character transfer/copy not progressive servers.
---
If you like working 80 hours a week, sure.
---
Prot got good from better itemization, base improvements from talents (which were buffed later in TBC) and mana regen capabilities.
---
I would say Avengers Shield was waaay more useful than taunt.
---
Definitely. Giving prot a hard Taunt turned them into really good tanks.

Not at all.  Software engineers at Google have a good wlb

We were never arguing about followings though, and I can argue that those followings were based off IP created pre Activision merge
---
In TBC 25 man raids as of patch 2.4.3, most hybrid class specs were not just viable, but optimal to bring at least 1 of to the raid. Sure there were classes that just did straight up amazing DPS that raids stacked (destruction warlock, BM hunter). But raids wanted to prioritize getting all the hybrid class buffs first before stacking on top of that solid foundation. Blizzard did a very good job of balancing things so that the unique buffs/debuffs brought by hybrids were enough to equal or outweigh their lack of raw DPS. 
---
You want enhancement shaman for your melee groups, elemental shaman for your caster dps groups. Shaman in general were very good in TBC and raids always wanted 5 of them minimum for totem utility.
---
1 balance druid for improved faerie fire (+3% melee/ranged hit debuff) and insect swarm (-2% hit debuff), and the 5% crit boomkin party aura is pretty good too. 1 feral druid because they are by far the best off tank in the game due to being able to flexibly go cat form whenever they don't need to tank, even mid-fight often.
---
1 shadow priest was invaluable for the immense utility they brought (+10% shadow damage and +5% all spell damage debuffs, as well as 5% of damage done returned as mana to their group which is a huge deal for healer groups.) 
---
You really want 1 prot paladin for certain AoE fights, especially in hyjal, and they can do a decent job healing when not needed for tanking. 1 ret paladin for an additional judgement/blessing, and crusader strike to keep all paladin judgements up on the target without the holy paladins needing to stay in melee and whack the boss once every 20 seconds.
---
Funnily enough rogues and mages who were top tier in Vanilla were actually relatively marginalized in TBC. Sure you definitely wanted 1 of each, but after that optimally you'd stack hybrids and the higher performing hunters and warlocks. Similarly holy paladins were poor performers in 25 man raids, mainly being brought for extra blessings and judgements.

Yeah. Who does that? The goal in life is to improve over time. Not stay stagnant or go backwards.
---
What makes you think any of these people had better options? I knew a guy that had to take care of his mom and his best bet was switch to a part time low paying job. He went from a lead sales guy to a material handler.

Maybe on Gothik.

Also a lot of 'basically', and 'honestly' - you can write a sentence just fine without either.

On Horde you get the first taste of this when collecting Zevra Hoofs. It's not a terrible grind by any means but at least the first time you do it something dawns on you. You realize that there is something darker at work here that you have no control of.

Blizzard doesn't owe him anything. He got paid for a service and that service is no longer needed so they are getting rid of him. He also complains about receiving a low wage for 10 years but nobody forced him to do it, so that's on him. Talk about a lack of ambition. Yikes. 
---
Mage has a lot more impact in BGs. They are extremely important in BGs by having the best AoE in the game, a nearly 90% AoE slow and the most reliable CC, Polymorph. They are the second best FCs and can FC without any issue if the druid is unable for any reason. They can shut down key chokes and overall have a lot more impact in fights in AB as well.
---
Meanwhile warlocks are mostly supporting with curses/ST damage and will frequently be base sitters in AB.

---
The problem is that as soon as guides and wowhead and meters and youtube videos start coming out with perfect information (or just rehashing the past fifteen years of pserver optimization) you’ll find yourself in a very unVanilla-like world where Hunters are no longer a DPS class in PvE—merely a weird utility role of tranqing and kiting. 
---
what do you mean bad?
---
nope
---
What a pussy.  An $11/hr an hour GM had the gall to claim he’s one of the people who created the success at Blizzard.  Completely expendable.  Good riddance.
---
When people say they fall off in very late game, they usually mean their sustained dps is lower than others.
---
Their burst potential and CC are excellent and the pet, while it doesn't scale with gear, offers a lot of annoyance and spell pushback.
---
And on top of that, healing = mana made them threat champions. I remember tanking loot reaver as my first tanking experience. His knock-back reduced threat by 25% (?) so you needed 2-3 tanks. I remember being top the entire time.
---
Raided with a ret paladin in classic who was one of our best DPS, so I'm not sure that "viable spec" argument works regarding paladins.
---
The only way certain specs didn't work was for something like being a fire mage or destruction warlock in MC due to fire resist. But otherwise, I don't agree that there were non-viable spec choices within a class to a huge extent.
---
&gt; The issue with hunters is that half your power comes from your pet.
---
Only true while you're leveling and your pet hurts as hard as you. If this stayed true through endgame, hunters would be completely broken.
---
This.
---
Oh yea this has to be one of my all time TOP 3 things i hated in WOW. When they bought in achievements i hated it. I actually loved wow playing it they way i wanted it. With achievements i felt pressured into doing them. I can remember waiting for hours sometimes for rare mobs to spawn so i could kill them for an achievement. 
---
I just wanted to play the game without having OCD.

Yeah making continents more connected would have been awesome.

Alliance is safer and has a bit of a lower entry barrier, but Horde has higher highs IMO. A very well executed Horde Raid is more efficient in the long run.
---
I'am 100% certain that quite alot of hardcore/top guilds will start on Horde side because of this.

They won't be cleared by most because of the raw time investment required, most don't have that free time. They aren't difficult.

---
Hunters aren't underpowered in lategame PVP, they just aren't as OP as they are while leveling. Hunters are completely broken in the early levels but it gets toned down at 60.
---
Hunters definitely have it harder as content progresses past their power spike (T2+Ashjre'Thul). They gain barely anything from AQ while casters become much stronger, and it stays somewhat true for Naxx as everyone else that shares the hunter token will get prio over them for tier gear.
---
Hunters are still decent with Naxx gear but their issues
---
As for the scaling, a part of it is the pet, which does the exact same damage for a fresh 60 as it would for a hunter in full T3 (minus the 50 AP the pet gets from T3 set bonus). The other issue is that hunters just don't scale from gear as well as other classes. Casters have spammable spells they can constantly throw while melees have dynamic rotations/ways to boost their autoattacks. Hunters are stuck autoshooting and waiting for Aimed/Multi shot cooldowns and that's it. There's only so much scaling you can get when you're spending 60% of the fight autoshooting stuff because your two damaging abilities are on CD.
---
My fav part is how they're all afk.

EPGP sounds like it's similar to the zero-sum system in that it's trying to avoid "inflation" of EP by making sure that GP matches EP.  
---
I feel like these days mixed loot councils are probably best, but it seems like every person says that loot councils become corrupt eventually.  A situation of "you either die a hero or see yourself become a villain" And the simple reasoning behind that is "unintentional nepotism".  
---
That person you've been in the guild with since it was founded, is someone you'll always have a comradery with. But then they leave, and are replaced with Billy Bob-Orc the newbie guild member.  You won't feel any comradery with the newbie, and thus you'll have an inherit ...ambivalence towards them.  Something you probably didn't have with your previous friend.  
---
I don't think there's any one great system to rule them all...they all have flaws.
---
Hunters do not use Larvae of the Great Worm and do not upgrade from Ashjre'thul until the Nerubian Slavemaker off of Kel'Thuzad.
---
This is why Hunter damage falls off greatly after BWL.
---
And the pic about unionising. Even in left leaning countries like Australia, only 17% of people are unionised, because very often unions charge exorbitant fees, to simply line their own politically motivated pockets, whilst barely offering a simple service like representation and they often work in cohorts with the employers to screw the employee - for you guessed it, more money to fund their politics. 
---
Yeah I think my guild was just bad, or at least the dpsers were. It was very normal for me to be #1 on the dps meters all the way from MC, to BWL, to ZG to AQ. Unless the fight was blatantly anti-hunter 
---
&gt; viable implies optimal
---
No it doesn't. Viable means just that - good enough to play casually, but not good enough to be compete.
---
This is nothing but bad for the players. I sympathise for the people losing their jobs but no one is talking about the fact that this is basically blizzard saying it no longer cares to communicate with its players. 
---
I was already worried that the changes to classic like loot trading and such were moves reduce gm assistance but this clearly shows they want money but have no intention of offering any of the services one usually expects when you pay subs.  I think it’s short sighted. RIP blizzard. 
---
Both of those are wasted on a Druid.
---
Definitely check it out! It's super cool to play with. Honestly since I'm older with a job and kids and all that I have more time at work to play with the numbers and talk about it than I do to even play anymore haha. If you love numbers it's super interesting to watch them change when you shift things around. The worst part not being human is you're looking at your sheet, changing your gear around looking at total dps like.. hmm 820... change wrists... 823.... change hands 822..... change legs 826... check the tick box for "human" 857. God damn it. You can get more from that one tick box than 1-2 other upgrades sometimes Lol

On live way back in the day I played a gnome rogue just for RP reasons and then with pservers i wanted to come back and "do it right". Its definitely a super small change and something you wont notice without being obsessed in a bad way haha

&gt; From my point of view, making hybrid classes being able to do dps like pure dps is a flaw in an RPG.
---
Just chiming in to agree with this. A Ret Paladin or Boomkin should rarely be doing the same or more damage than traditional DPS classes.
---
That said, there is a line that should be drawn so they're not so weak as to be useless. What good is being a hybrid if only 1 spec is great and the other two are garbage? 
---
Yup true. Druids and mages can remove curses and priests are the only alliance race with an offensive dispel. I said cleanse specifically bc that is the in game term for magic+poison+disease. 'Remove' is what happens to curses. Dispel is hybrid offense/defense magic dispel and Purge is shaman taking 2 offensive magic huffs off at once
---
Thank you lord.
---
Good question I dont recall exactly since I've only played warrior and mage alliance side and wars just have the 1 single interface shout fear. There might be  a small immunity window but I know it does fear and charm as well, like the succubus seduce
---
Great post w really good info!
---
Wow, that stinks :(
---
Loot council is also hard to view subjectively from the bottom. Maintaining a 40 man raiding guild would generally involve 50-60 people at the very least, assuming nearly everyone comes on for every raid which just doesn't always happen. So perhaps 80 people in your guild of a raider tier or substitute raider tier. Even if you weigh each piece of loot as perfectly to who needs it most its unlikely that everyone will see it as fair. Perhaps you gave a +stamina gun to a warrior even though it was better than what a hunter had and they will resent it without understanding. Etc etc. Loot council can be corrupt and still viewed as such.  Generally a loot council for certain items that are pre-declared(say tanking armor, thunderfury, or other rare/useful objects) combined with a general points system is the best combo to avoid this sort of sentiment. 
---
[removed]
---
No problem. If you're curious, [this](https://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/?c=u5epnrrb4mihhoo776do7ktfn000000000000000) is roughly what a good TBC raid composition looks like. On serious progression fights most of the time the prot paladin will be respecced to holy. How the classes are arranged in the raid groups will change depending on how many tanks the fight needs and what buffs the tank(s) need most.
---
I too was watching ClassiCast and recoiled when they said that.
---
As a separate server option, fine. But they should never force it on Classic Vanilla players.
---
I had a couple of amazing wow bffs in wotlk. A crazy fuck from norway and an absolute lad from uk. It was amazing how well we hit it off. A little sad i’ve never met them offline, but I still see their posts on Facebook and I wish em nothing but the best
---
That's pretty neat, had no idea the game had two moons.
---
What about human vs gnome? Will I lose out a lot for not playing Gnome as a caster?
---
That’s the idea.
---
Number of pieces gained per hour would be a good measure? Someone that has logged 100 hours of raiding should have twice the amount of loot than somoeone that attended 50 hours. Otherwise something is wrong.
---
TL;DR hunters are actually pretty good. Play one
---
Hey... fuck you.
---
Which companies would those be?  Blizzard, certainly, but in fact most of the products we buy are better and cheaper than they've ever been.  Would you prefer a cell phone from 10 years ago, or one from today?  How about a TV?  A car?  A computer?
---
Almost everything we buy today, compared to 10 years ago, is significantly better, or significantly cheaper, or both.  Even something as purposely low quality as fast food is better.  When I was a kid Jack In The Box was total shit, the beef they use in their burgers is 20x better now than it was back then.
---
Is this an ideal you support? If so, why?
---
Ehh, I understand wanting to push all of the staying power onto a love of the Blizzard. However I'd say, fondness or not, a lot of people are willing to work for the lower wage to get the Blizzard name on a resume.  
---
I'm not discounting the people who love the games, I did too. But even I would stay despite the working conditions, just to keep it on my resume.

Why this is downvoted is hilarious. Yes parts of are system are the evil SoCIAliZM 111!!

Not necessarily.  A lot of people stay at their current job even if it's not as good as what they could get.  They're lazy, or they're unmotivated, or they just prefer to stick with what they already know, or hell, maybe they actually like their job (it could happen!).  Happens all the time.
---
Completely agree - what I meant by "vanilla option" is the ez mode of just letting the loot system work without GM intervention.  The reality is the world is different 15 years later, and these things may just have to give unfortunately.  
---
That's how most good engineers work anyway.  Check with any engineer in Silicon Valley and you'll get the same.  Long hours in hopes of a good payoff.  For those who want to work a regular 9-5 job, there's plenty of jobs maintaining legacy code at small to medium sized companies.

Some tier tokens are stacked on classes that are more populous. For example Warriors, Rogues, Shaman, Paladin and Hunters share the same tier token. So what happens when Naxxramas comes out. Every class except for Warriors get screwed on T3 tokens because all of the Warriors need T3 4-set bonus ASAP.
---
During AQ guilds are basically forced to stack T2.5 tokens on Rogues. Why? T2 is a PvP set and next to worthless in PvE. So Rogues effectively receive no major tier upgrades between ZG and AQ40. So you can't have Rogues wearing T1 equivalent when you're about to enter Naxxramas.

You'd have a hard time arguing that one considering both games I thought were good came out after the merge (2008). Listen, I'm not saying the merge was a good thing, I hate Activision as much as the next guy. All I'm saying is that Blizzard makes some dank ass games
---
I'm not pro-layoffs obviously, they're just reality so you should never get complacent at your job, and always have a plan. Your employer isn't daycare, they owe you a paycheck and whatever benefits they decide to give you and that's it. You're not entitled to your job, just the severance package when they take it away.
---
I'm pretty cynical. I see he posted like 7 times on the classic forums the last few hours. Makes me think the bosses snapped the whip today and told them to get out there and "reassure" us.... 
---
All of a sudden after people are fired and there's less CM's we get more posts than ever before? ... I dunno...
---
Hi my name is Alex and I've been an addict since age 12 
---
&gt; Generally a loot council for certain items that are pre-declared(say tanking armor, thunderfury, or other rare/useful objects) combined with a general points system is the best combo to avoid this sort of sentiment.
---
This is roughly what I'm planning to do with my guild. I don't want to deal with the drama that seeds from having a loot council preside over the loot for 40 people, nor do I want to deal with the headache of evaluating every single piece of gear that drops.
---
Instead, I'm probably going to go with DSK since it's the most "fair" system, with loot council to supplement it for important drops. That way people won't feel punished by giving up their reel spot for a minor upgrade and giving up their shot at Perd Blade or whatever.
---
At this point I’m definitely waiting to build a PC and buy the game until it’s out for a couple of months. If they add in sharding or some other bullshit, I’m not buying it. No need to stress over it for however long the wait is for the game to launch. 
---
Since I’ll be playing casually, I’m in no rush to level. It’ll be nice to have servers stabilize and a community to form on whatever server I pick. Hopefully there will also be significantly less competition while questing.
---
I’m still optimistic but I’m also going to go through the coming months with the idea that they will fuck this game up in the back of my head. 
---
You think you want to continue but you don't.
---
No honestly, some people act like they want a progressed vanilla server to last forever ( or several years after naxx comes out). Reality is that you really don't. The game is not very fun to play after naxx is on farm, the population will die out meaning you guild will split up unable to recruit back players as there's hardly anyone new coming to the server. You will end up needing giant merges of vanilla servers and start the community fresh after naxx if you want a server with above 100pop, and honestly there's no point playing the game with no new upcoming stuff, the game becomes a consumable farm for naxx raiding(which is a LOT of consumes), and PVP with full naxx gear is retarded not to mention anyone without naxx gear will basically feel like fresh 60's. 
---
God people are so dumb to think that Classic was cancelled.
---
They obviously don't do any research or listen to the content actually being covered.
---
Oooo 16:9 monitor
---
This is pretty basic business. You don't just keep paying people that you don't need for the fun of it. With at least two if their franchises is n maintenance mode and killing off esports for a game they consider a failure that's a lot of people that they're paying that aren't really doing anything. 
---
Blizzard having a good year and laying off employees are two unrelated things. You don't keep having fantastic years if you keep paying hundreds of extra people that aren't doing anything. 
---
If you had a business and you realized you had 800 more employees than you need, would you not do the same thing regardless of how your business was doing? 
---
They refer to it as a "classic server option", which is even more low profile.
---
Solo'ing lower level dungeons as a prot paladin, using a combination of Retribution Aura, Holy Shield + Consecrate so mobs can beat themselves to death.
---
Ah, the memories.
---
The support and love from this community has been an amazing inspiration and motivation for me to keep pushing forward. Thank you all for being here and scrolling through these paintings! :)  
---
(I plan to explore the Western Plaguelands next in the future, will post them here too if ppl will be interested)
---
Plenty of people spend years or the majority of their working lives in low paying jobs (e.g. retail). Whilst I agree that it should be everyone’s goal to improve themselves on a daily basis it doesn’t mean it actually IS their goal. Some people don’t realise that. 
---
Asking “who does that?” as if you’re better than them or that they’re all stupid people is pretty disgusting. 
---
I cant wait to farm in the off hours of EST NA. Farming on a global server is impossible due to 24/7 activity. Praying they keep blizzlike population caps as well. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **3rd Cakeday** _ItsImportant_! ^(hug)
---
I don't see why is that a problem.
---
I think they just tend to get comfortable most of the time. They resign themselves to that kind of lifestyle and get stuck in (what others would see as) a rut.
---
Honestly thought he knew of a server list for when classic launches by the way he worded this. 
---
I guess, I just don't expect the attention we are getting today to last.
---
So good! I especially like the one of Brill. 
---
No actual conversation but you do seem to still have “contact” in the form of a letter, in regards to your original comment. 
---
it honestly comes down to greedy capitalist baby boomers. They're breaking the social contract we have. Spitting in the face of the very people who have helped make their company great. They should have their pay cut to under 500,000 dollars. They aren't worth a penny more. Their intelligence irreplaceable. The baby boomer generation has been screwing over America for decades and we need to put our foot down and stop it. This is unacceptable, we won't take it anymore.
---
I find it hard to imagine anyone would honestly think it was cancelled. Just a bit of good old fashioned outrage manufacturing and baiting blues into post.
---
one word...Unionize
---
These are just superb. 
---
if diablo immortal wasn't set to come out this year, why even announce it so far out. It's a fucking mobile game, they are faster to make, etc. They shouldn't be announced as early as their normal games because they don't take as long to make. 
---
Same boat. SK is great for letting your geared players sit at the top waiting for one drop and your under geared players can sit at the bottom and gobble up upgrades with no repercussion. The only problem I ever had with SK was my OT was determined to get the wrath pants and we just didn't have them drop, but other upgrades kept dropping for him and he kept passing. I ended up replacing him at primary OT with one of the other OTs who ended up better geared than him and was producing more threat. He took it really poorly and it caused drama but it was his choice to sit there half geared with his heart set on one object to the determent of the raid. He ended up leaving the guild over it, and it caused some shit but I would have done it all over again exactly the same. 
---
Plus the sporeggar shield. sploosh.
---
Yup great post. "Corruption" is subjective and  most people I've personally had complain about that were immature younger players on their first or 2nd mmo who join an established guild expecting loot within a few weeks. They dont see the literal months of working and wiping over and over to get your runs worked out really smooth, they join once it's already smooth and complain that they're not getting loot over someone who has been there countless times more than they have, even when it was hard shitty nights with no progress. These same people usually leave the guild eventually once they do get a piece or two and dont see how absurd of a self fulfilling prophecy that was and the loot council was right to question their loyalty since they were so new. Lose lose situation and it sucks to make those decisions lol
---
The employee has the chance to negotiate another wage or sell their labor to someone who will pay them more for it. If no one will their labor is not worth more and should stay with the best deal they can get. 
---
Wow, this is fucking beautiful.
---
Pretty sure the original WC3 EULA was "fucked" too, if you're implying that they claim ownership of any mods created. Whether or not such a clause will hold up in court is an entirely different matter. Evidently it hasn't, or rather wouldn't since Dota 2 never went to court and Valve did not pay royalties to Blizzard over it — that said, they did modify some characters that were similar to WC3/Diablo characters such as Windrunner and Skeleton King.
---
Is this what they're teaching kids in school now?  
---
Great, a whole new generation of psychopaths set to destroy the economy again.
---
would be stupid from blizzard to not use seperate realms for it because the circle of wanting classic would come again
---
I don’t think Blizzard executives are gonna read this.  But then again maybe they will. For all you know I am one... hmm
---
Yes, please feel free to give Acti-Blizz money when Classic releases, who knows, maybe because of Classic they will post a record earning year in 2019, and to celebrate they will ~~Fire~~ Lay off 900 employees this time! Yay!
---
Now I want TBC instead of vanilla.  I miss my protadin :(
---
Also I miss the SunEater sword from the 5 man dungeons outside Tempest Keep...I known it wasn't BiS for protadins but damnit it didnt look badass as hell...
---
i dont wanna play with russians sry
---
It wont be like that when classic is re-released. Just look at 2007 runescape. The game is certainly a lot more successful than runescape 3 and this is inpart because Jagex made a lot of changes to 2007scape to help facilitate player growth and add end game content, but no one plays it socially any more, they all play to be as efficient as possible.
---
And also spent 20 minutes grave running from the 60’s that gank there
---
So... summer?
---
imagine thinking it was ever canceled - wtf?
---
the anti-blizz virtue signaling has reached an all-time high
---
My experience was mostly PvP but arcane mage became super fun and viable. They had some new spells like Arcane Blast, Slow etc. They also got bonuses to Crit and some other interesting talents. Sorry, super lazy response but check out the BC talent calculator and their spells on classic wow head and you’ll get an idea of what I’m talking about. 
---
Shadowpriest?
---
How big are they and are they up for sale?
---
They said they are beefing up development teams - so it may be a bit faster. 
---
I found that super exciting personally. I'll never forget questing in Ashenvale and walking past the entrance to Felwood and thinking "Hmm, I wonder what's up here...?", next minute a ??? bear runs me down and mauls me to death. 
---
Mulgore. That’s all. I just want to be there again. 
---
Wasn't really exciting when I went to Thousand Needles out if excitement and the few quests there were finished. Then I did some ashenvake and figured out I was supposed to be found Hills Brad :(
---
They fired mostly community and e-sport based personnel but it seems they are hiring more programmers. From what I have heard, the firing was pretty sudden but they got good severance and Blizzard is actively helping them find employment. Overall I think it was a negative for Classic (potentially hitting GMs, and hitting people that actually communicated with the community) but we will see.
---
I have no idea who you are, or why I should care enough to bother watching a youtube video for something that can be clearly explained via text.
---
The wiki says that what you actually want to use with MD/ruin spec is succubus, not imp. It gives 10% bonus to all damage. And when succubus is sacrificed, you get 15% to shadow damage, which is even more than SM.
---
Mazen's Behest
---
I dislike where some of the money went - however, I do understand why they did it.
---
It is a horrible thing - but maybe they did some internal Audits and found some reason to make cuts. 
---
We know for certain that they'll have larger development teams to work with for every franchise.
---
I'm not saying this to be an arsehole - but blizzard needs to cut back on taking feedback - and just work on their games for a bit.
---
Like seriously work on the games - Take all the current feedback and use it.
---
The upside is that acti-blizzard is giving all the employees a pretty damn good severance package - so they do care at least a bit.
---
Overwatch and WoW have every reason to be much better than they are - you don't need CMs to tell you that that is what the player base is thinking.
---
Pog Clap
---
Unless they’re dwarves 
---
Well this is just effing fantastic! Now I have to go make another undead priest. I hope you're happy! &gt;\_&lt;
---
The numbers do shed light, but the point is that they’re laying off, while still giving themselves fat bonuses.  
---
I loved WoW.  Retail is shit.  I’m looking forward to an official Vanilla SUPPORTED by Blizzard, and this doesn’t inspire confidence.  
---
Two is a bit of a stretch, but your point is valid. Mana burn rendered them completely worthless.
---
Honestly the only thing Dwarf Priest brings is fear ward, which is a great spell, sure, but only finds major use in pvp and a few raid bosses with an aoe fear. The aoe fear was easily handled by tanks stance swapping properly, healers and ranged dps staying out of range of it (they were all 30 yard aoes, and ranged DPS had ranged up to 36-40 yards), sure the melee dps would run around for like the 8 seconds, but thats all it was. 
---
Give CDPR a couple more years. :)
---
haHAA all alliance are bad horde are the true faction for good players haHAA
---
That's exactly what my question was about in the first place. You can get distance just as well with nature's grasp talent. It does exactly the same, but doesn't even have casting time. As long as you have nature's grasp, no pushback while casting roots is a pointless talent. Unless you need to get distance more than once per 45 seconds, that is.
---
Ret Pally/Cat Druid received god tier quality of life and buffs in WotLK. Prot Pally/Bear Druid had the time of it in TBC onwards.
---
hey! :) they are digital paintings, but I've put up some of them on my Inprnt store, you can grab a print over here in any size you like: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/)
---
Man it must be nice for Blizzard to have a convenient Activision scapegoat to blame for doing all the things Blizzard has been doing since the 90s. 
---
As for the layoffs, it's a business, you can't keep paying non-essential personnel forever. When you realize that you've got 800 employees that are redundant you have to trim that fat. 
---
that makes me feel proud in a very strange way, yes! :D
---
Holy fuck dude/dudette this is amazing! Like seriously.... wow
---
That's interesting. As far as I know, balance was an extremely unpopular spec back in vanilla, both in PvE and PvP. Being viable in it took a lot of skill. Did you play balance in vanilla?
---
They don't say summer. 
---
That would be wise.
---
Tbh the hot-takes and crying on this sub recently has gotten out of control. No shit its not cancelled.
---
I didn't ask if you supported layoffs.  I asked if you supported corporate culture.  And if so why.  The status quo is not static.
---
At the launch of TBC Mages were horrendous. It basically took Blizzard most of TBC to buff them back up but by the end of TBC they climbed up to a solid top 5 finisher again.
---
This just comes off as salty and unproductive. Guy wasn’t even laid off in this recent wave he was let go a while ago
---
Ok, so, not starting from the VERY start, but:  
---
Patch 1.2: Will of the Forsaken now displays as usable while feared.  
---
Patch 1.5:  Duration reduced to 5 seconds. (this patch also nerfed "I'm sitting" -&gt; "I'm shitting" when drunk)  
---
Patch 1.12: Will of the Forsaken now displays as usable while charmed (LOL, it took them this long to fix the other half of the bug!)  
---
So while it was 20 seconds at launch, it is 5 seconds as of patch 1.6.  It looks like the duration stays at 5 seconds throughout all of burning crusade, only become instantaneous in 3.0.2 (though I can't find that explicitly stated in a patch note).  
---
What I can't find is when it stopped *making you undead* and started simply *providing sleep, charm, and fear immunity*.  I think this may have also been 1.6.  
---
Also at some point in BC, you stopped being able to use it while disoriented- it never cleared disorient that I know of.  
---
Anyway, in 1.12, I don't think it gives you any vulnerabilities, just a 5 second immunity on a two minute cooldown.  
---
oh no, a business making money! someone stop them!
---
Well that explains your bad luck, you were supposed to be killing Zhevras!
---
Does the +5 gun make that big a difference?
---
I'm going to say arcane mage. Arcane went from a set of talents that were there only to buff fire and frost spells to a standalone spec that didn't need other trees.
---
I'd say I am better than someone without any gumption in life.
---
Blizzard laid off 600 people in 2012, as well. They're now hiring over 100 people for Developer jobs. 
---
If you want to boycott every single product you buy from companies that lay people off, you're going to have a hard life.
---
Tax payer bailouts and subsidies shouldn't be in a capitalist economy yet they exist for the rich. Its the poor who get stuck with brutal capitalism. 
---
Share this article with everyone. Let Karma's wrath reign down upon Bobby.
---
Paint me one of some mushrooms with a burning zig and I'll buy it
---
They pick up a bit in naxx. But there’s a long stretch from BWL - AQ where they fall off relative to the other classes 
---
&gt; I said cleanse specifically bc that is the in game term for magic+poison+disease  
---
I don't think that's exactly a game term for it.  Druids "cure" and "abolish" poison, they don't cleanse it.  Priests "cure" and "abolish" disease, they don't cleanse it.  The text on the spell all refer to the "removing" of poisons, and the "removing" of diseases.    Meanwhile, "Remove Curse" is a druid spell that "dispels" a curse, and "Remove Lesser Curse" is a mage spell that "removes" a curse.  
---
No, of course not. But wealth disparity know this *planet* is completely out of control. 
---
That includes the rolling ignite. Warlocks had higher individual dps.
---
There are many things that makes a person good and having more gumption in life is simply one slither of an entire spectrum of what makes up a person. 
---
Continue to look down your nose at others though. 
---
And somehow you suddenly know that I've never tried. Jesus Christ you're pretentious as fuck 
---
Absolutely beautiful.  It brings back memories of my time in the army when we'd be walking through the woods with our night vision goggles on.  Wonderful work.
---
Okay, here is your chance, what's your idea that would improve the wealth gap other than whining that other people get paid more than you?
---
Or just "ah shit, guess my job that involves me making the occasional forum post actually *isn't* safe. Guess I should actually start doing it."
---
Nothing wrong with a fire under the ass to get productivity up. 
---
Why does wealth disparity matter?
---
Rogues just being rogues
---
Unions are great when they do that, yes, but, in my experience (I don't live in the US), those aren't the majority.
---
Just today, in front of the building I work in, I was handed a pamphlet containing propaganda about one of the candidates for running the Union for the next few years. The pamphlet literally stated that the main goal was protesting against the new president - the COUNTRY'S president.  His main criticism of other candidates is that they refuse to involve with politics.
---
The worst part about it is all of these YouTube, (low-quality) content creators suddenly became equity research analysts overnight. It's bizarre.
---
November 23rd, 2019.  
---
15th anniversary release date. 
---
&gt;but maybe they did some internal Audits and found some reason to make cuts.
---
Multi-billion dollar company *might* have done some audits, and *might* have come to a logical conclusion that's fiscally beneficial? Hot take.
---
Doesn't mean it's still summer :P.
---
In that case I would have fired the inactive employee instead of the most active, but I don’t know the whole story.
---
Moonkin went from a useless spec to having an active role in raids. Shorter more burst reliant fights fit its damage style well, and the smaller raid size makes the 5% crit matter more and being able to dedicate a debuff slot to Insect Swarm for the reduced hit reliable.
---
guess classic isnt a 'major' release according to Activision lol 
---
Not really, I cant remember exactly but our raid leader had a long rant which the shamans joined in on on how bad tremor totem was, since it did not pop immedietely but removes fears in pulses with if i remember correctly 5 seconds intervals, meaning if you are lucky you could make that fear perhaps as short as 1 second, but if you where unlucky you had 0 help from the tremor totem since most fears where like 3-5 seconds themselves. 
---
Since mana &gt; dps on many fights during progression in vanilla we had shamans in healing groups with mana tide instead of spreading them out all over the raid, making it another reason for never being used.
---
Also will of the forsaken has at its worst a 5seconds duration of immunity and 2 minutes cooldown at its worst, before 1.6 it had 30sec immunity, so how it it stronger then a fear ward i'm not really sure.
---
Incredible work! Can’t wait to see your work in the plaguelands! 
---
Chill dawg. People putting out content about Classic / Blizz is kinda the point of this sub 
---
Are these oil on canvas? Love it! Do you take commissions? 
---
I'm almost at a point where I think Classic isn't going to happen now.
---
I was torn on what race to play for a while but I think you just sold me on the forsaken. Really great work, I’ll probably end up buying a print as well. 
---
If you escalate past the first level of support you'd be shocked at how easy it is to get a real GM response. I had an issue with a transmog item and I had a GM log into my toon to try and solve the issue for me ~6 months ago. They use tier 1 support to filter out the basic/bullshit tickets, all major companies do this now.
---
It's pretty damning that he didn't say "It's still coming out summer 2019"   
---
&gt;The announced year for releasing WoW Classic, 2019, has not changed.  
---
I guess they are giving themselves the option to release after the summer, in case they need to delay it. Then they will still release it in 2019.
---
Elemental Precision &amp; Wand Spec are really really potent. I'd try to get those into your build. (Wands are key rotation for a lot of the levels below 40).
---
Since he said this:   
---
&gt;The announced year for releasing WoW Classic, 2019, has not changed.   
---
It's super clear it might be after the summer but in 2019.  Probably they have a planned date but wanted to give themselves the option to release it after summer (but still in 2019).  
---
We will just have to see.  
---
I am willing to bet it will come in August or Sept. as a worst case, if there are delays.  
---
It's very unlikely they meant they are adding staff to the Classic project.  The new developers will go to Diablo 4, Overwatch and other games.
---
Capitalism is just a coward's way of saying Jewish Supremacism.
---
Leaving aside the moral argument, it's simply bad economically to have this much wealth concentration.
---
 Economic activity is important for the health of an economy, and one thing that is the hallmark of poor people is that they spend their money. If you give a poor person a million dollars, he will buy things, he will spend that money, and he will stimulate the economy around him (Then put whatever's left into savings). However if you give that money to an already wealthy person it will go into his portfolio and do basically nothing. The basic idea of capitalism is that the money will function as a reward for doing well and as incentive to engage in the economy more, however the 1% cannot ever spend their money and so they are functionally worthless, they are an inadequate incentive for them to do anything because they doesn't need and they are far less rewarded by it than anyone else. Plus as they are merely adding zeroes in portfolios they don't actually do anything economically except exist.
---
Letting "the elite" be this wealthy is objectively a bad idea.
---
Then there's the fact that, no, the hyper wealthy are not worth the same as the entire economic output of half a continent. The stock market creates price, and money, out of nothing, and isn't reliant on any real world mechanisms except that people want to buy the stocks. They have not actually created the same economic worth in this world as half the continent of Africa or something, and if we shot someone like Bezos tomorrow then the world wouldn't actually notice and he'd get swiftly replaced by another CEO who'd continue the operations of Amazon just fine, while if we shot Botswana into space you'd have no more smart phones and computers.
---
And again, that's not even getting into the moral argument, that in order to create this massive wealth, we have to endure people starving. People literally cannot buy food or medical care, while he is literally incapable of spending all his money in a human lifetime.
---
They still have Blizzcon 2019 guys, I wouldn't doubt them releasing the release date then.
---
they are digital, but I try to achieve a more 'oil on canvas' look as much as I can (it just looks so cool :D) - commissions: yes ofc, pm me if you have something in mind!
---
Most nostalgic thing in gaming history is making an undead character for the first time in classic. And you did it justice. Well done 
---
Also, Healadin tanking in dungeons with a 4 dps chomp squad made for some fun gameplay. I fondly remember getting the shattered halls heroic timer quest this way on my lock, and it was glorious. The pally was named kazhadum or something close to that
---
Druid saw the most improvement, going from 1 viable spec all the way to 4. 
---
That one was the worst. I got a full level killing the mobs for that. 
---
Lol literally the kind of unfounded rumor op was talking about.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer, I'll check these out!
---
If there's one redeeming quality about Bobby Kotick, it's that he's honest about his priorities. He doesn't even pretend like he's not fucking people over and ruining video games. 
---
That being said, fuck Bobby Kotick.
---
Maybe not the most improved, but Feral became 10x better.
---
SL is probably the strongest 1v1/world PvP spec in the game once you have gear.
---
We don't know for sure what itemization Blizzard will use for early content. If I were a betting man I'd wager Blizzard will use the most up to date version of item stats. Why? Long story short, caster DPS mechanics were completely reworked early in vanilla and it wouldn't make sense to revert to itemization which was meant for a completely separate set of mechanics. Casters would underperform even compared to their original version, pre mechanic rework.
---
So how do Warlocks fare?
---
MC era: Relative to other classes your burst output is lower. Warriors, Rogues, Mages and Shaman all crank out bigger numbers than you, but none of them are anywhere near as tanky as an SL Warlock.
---
BWL: Things start to pick up. Your damage output is a little higher, but you have tons more stamina and HP. You're tankier than you were back in MC, but melee are more lethal now that they're running around with awesome items like Ashkandi and Chromatically Tempered Sword.
---
AQ: This era is when vanilla WoW's damage output goes from just melee having high damage, to everybody having high damage. You're just as tanky as you ever were, but your damage output as an SL Warlock shoots up a lot. Conflagrate and Nightfall/Conflagrate specs become way more popular since they are ridiculously powerful.
---
Naxxramas: Everything goes pants on head retarded post Naxx. Except for Shadow Priests/Ret Paladins, everybody's damage output is just way crazy. By now it doesn't really matter what spec you play because everybody just destroys.
---
Sorry, but random people who I've never seen partake in discussion here posting nothing but a youtube link to their opinion, (which could be clearly explained via text to not waste time) without giving any context as to why their opinion deserves it's own topic rather than simply adding to any one of the plethora of other threads discussing this topic isn't exactly what I feel the point of this sub is.
---
Which is smart, because things always end up taking longer...especially with Blizzard.
---
When you let finance guys run a company - you skew the goals and metrics towards finance.
---
That's a word I haven't heard in a long time
---
Ah, the oddspec times were great. I remember other ZA bear runs where the norm was 2 tanks, 2 healers, and we did 1 tank, 1 healer, and 1 healtank (me)
---
self-healed and pulled aggro on all the bird adds on the gauntlet on the 1st boss, all the adds on the 3rd boss, and healed the rest. Was glorious.
---
It’s funny because people say they tend to trust what’s on Reddit until Redditors try to opine on the topic that they study professionally and realize they have no idea what they’re talking about. I work in finance, and have seen some *horrible* misrepresentations of reality; mostly to fit political views, so I usually just ignore it and move on.
---
Funnily enough, it gets to me a lot more when it comes from subreddits completely unrelated to finance. So when I saw this whole “the rich don’t pay taxes” thing in my Classic WoW subreddit I felt compelled to respond.
---
FUCK OFF THEY "NEED TO DELAY IT" the fuckin game worked fine 10 years ago what do they possibly need to delay it for holy fuck im tilted
---
I am not buying Anthem, not buying The Division 2. I am investing my team in other things like revamping my portfolio so I can play as an Orc warrior and get my full set of Champions warrior gear set.
---
I don't mind the delay, more money for me, less distractions and addiction.
---
Looks so amazing! I wish vanilla wow was as dark as these paintings.
---
Spec is pretty bad tbh.
---
3/3 Elemental precision is mandatory if you plan on doing any PvE. I suggest doingg a search and watching YouTube videos as this has been asked 1000 times already
---
How did Bornaaakkkkkk survive the culling?
---
Yea but now you can only play it on your phone.
---
Wand spec is not worth the extra 7 levels you would have to wait until getting Shatter or Ice Barrier. You shouldnt be facetanking mobs as a Mage and Wands are pretty much only important for Warlocks and Priests as one has a personal tank and one can heal
---
Cool,
---
You have no understanding of how an economy works to the point of embarrassing yourself. 
---
&gt; I already put 5 points into Magic Absorption. It's not entirely useless in pvp either, I'd just like to add.
---
I mean, it basically is, 3% damage reduction and 0.25% of your mana regened when some one casts a spell on you.
---
??????
---
Individual mage parses are higher than lock too. But whatever, I'm 100% for misinformation. Everyone is competition afterall.
---
I really notice that in this sub noob friendly or noob behavior promoting things get far more upvoted and real information or more in depth less widely known information is downvoted.
---
But that's a good thing. Every time I break from that mold I regret it.
---
We need the shoulders of noobs to stand on, after all. 
---
The key distinction is that it was a record *revenue* year, not a record *profit* year. If their costs are growing faster than their best income year yet with no major games planned this year, they have a BIG problem. 
---
It's amazing how many people don't understand tax rates. 
---
Nice! :D
---
And to keep people from winning the roll on Lucifron and taking their T1 boots and leaving the PuG
---
Winter 2017 2.0
---
&gt; Economic activity is important for the health of an economy, and one thing that is the hallmark of poor people is that they spend their money.
---
Do you speak for all poor people? You are just making up sterotypes, this isn't factual information.
---
&gt; However if you give that money to an already wealthy person it will go into his portfolio and do basically nothing.
---
You do know what a portfolio is? Most rich people have most of their portfolio in stocks which is investing in business mainly in the US. Also, anyone making 1million+ might have a large percentage of savings but most people in that demographic also have a higher standard of living and do spend way more than poor people even make.
---
I was born poor but I was taught the importance of savings and going to school. Both my parents worked. My mom worked 2 jobs and my dad worked 7 days a week with the occasional Sunday off. They never wasted any of their money. It was important to make sure my brother and I were taken care of and had the ability to focus on school. It's very offensive to just assume all poor people just waste money.
---
1) You are making up facts. 
---
2) These 'facts' don't actually prove that it's harmful the economy. Show me some proof. Because there are a lot of papers I can link about Communism(splitting up wealth more evenly) not being good for the economy. Would you like me to dig them up?
---
&gt; Letting "the elite" be this wealthy is objectively a bad idea.
---
Who are the elite? I was born poor, I'm in my late 29 and make top 1% of income earners in the US. I'm not an elite. Why is it objectively bad to have people make more money if they earn it? If I event the cure to cancer, should I make only $50k/yr? What's my motivation to invent stuff if I can't profit off of it? It makes no sense..
---
&gt; The stock market creates price, and money, out of nothing, and isn't reliant on any real world mechanisms except that people want to buy the stocks.
---
You have no understanding of the stock market or what it is. It's apparent you are just very ignorant. You don't understand basic fundamentals of how the real world works, of course you are just going to see rich people as bad people because they have more money than you.
---
&gt; and if we shot someone like Bezos tomorrow then the world wouldn't actually notice and he'd get swiftly replaced by another CEO who'd continue the operations of Amazon just fine
---
Bezos is rich because of what he accomplished. If you shot him before he made Amazon, the world be very different. Amazon revolutionized online purchasing. Amazon is also the leader in cloud computing. 80% of the cloud computing markets is through AWS. 
---
&gt; if we shot Botswana into space you'd have no more smart phones and computers.
---
What? You do realize any country can make smart phone parts. Other countries have cheaper labor but if they didn't exist, smart phones would just cost more. So, if you get rid of wealth inequality, you can't afford luxury items and no one will make them. You also fuck with inflation super hard. 
---
These are incredible, really captures the essence of the Undead. Great work!
---
If I were to play TBC today, I'd roll warlock. They did crazy damage in raids and in pvp they could spec SL/SL and dominate.
---
Reeee is barrens chat will be wonderful. 
---
Beautiful work!
---
If you read the op comment that started that thread, he said this: "Until the company says its actually coming in 2019, dont hold your breath."
---
Blues response was directly addressing that, in a subtle fuck-you sort of way. 
---
It's literally the name of the spell haha you can look it up on classicbd. There is a weaker version at earlier levels too. Abolish is a specific mechanic where you get a buff that removes it every X seconds as opposed to the instant removal single cast
---
I wouldn't mind respeccing costing _some_ gold, but a cap of 50 is way too much.
---
Although there might be a lot of inflation in Classic given people actually knowing what they're doing and gold farmers being more sophisticated operations, so maybe 50g won't be too much?
---
Saying "inb4 X" doesn't make X an invalid comment.
---
The brill and deathknell paintings are sick af. 
---
Maybe they didn't like the way the most active employee was being active.
---
"Cannot emotionally identify with the characters" Please... I fucking cried like a when I had to kill Gray Fox in Metal Gear
---
no I can't do it. And those dudes don't even have faces ffs
---
Yeah, "in case they need to delay it" is a huge rumor.
---
Cashiers at Walmart get paid 11....... ouch 
---
Amazing 
---
What this shows me is how the desire to work for a gaming company can blind you to how bad your job is.
---
Least these guys ate out now.
---
I was 16 when I started using in 2010. It was after I lost all my friends and started hanging with a new scene. No regrets. Loved wotlk
---
Hes got a fantastic shit eating grin and a great hairline
---
lets crush the classic numbers so we can get burning crusade as well bro &lt;3
---
You can do this in Classic too. The gamechanger was the addition of appropriately itemized tanking gear and a taunt, not their ability to thorns tank, that's been there since classic. Paladins can still offtank in classic using the same setup on hectic add fights. 
---
I've said this a few times here before I think summer is still going to be a stretch, based on everything they still had to do as of Blizzcon, if I had to bet, I'd bet this ends up closer to winter 2019, than summer 2019.
---
But they always come out polished af tho
---
I realize now I fed the troll. Good luck out there, champ. 
---
I agree
---
Here is what it says on youtube
---
&gt;I sat in on the phone call earlier today and here is a basic summary of what happened and how it will effect Blizzard Games in the future.  I will also discuss the layoffs that Blizzard announced today where roughly 800 people lost their dream jobs.
---
On the matter of [who he is,](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYWjKpoShEI53icE2rQpJA/videos) he seems to be a content creator for first retail and then a lot of private servers.
---
good points - I'd reckon it depends on playstyle.
---
Wandspec not needed for an AoE grind spec (which OP may be doing if they're not planning on running dungeons).
---
And rip warlocks, no wand spec ;_;
---
Your options in life are a direct result of the choices you make. In 10 years, this guy had *more* than enough time to improve his lot in life. Blizzard really did do this guy a favor by giving him a kick in the ass. Doesn't sound like he took the hint though.
---
I don't know if they're doing that for Classic, but thats not really true for game development. Because you have to slog down development to train people to use the tools, and the growing pains along the way.
---
Thats kinda one of the reasons why WoD shipped in such a state, they had a bunch of people joining Team 2 when Titan went through a reboot in 2013. 
---
Soooo how can I make this my desktop backround?
---
Oh yeah. They may even mail out checks to every subscriber and let them fuck their wives.
---
Actiblizzard bad
---
I think it was BiS when threat wasn't an issue, and threat wasn't an issue all that often. But most of us used a +spellpower weapon instead because we all love big numbers, and the defensive stats weren't all that much better.
---
Those soulless little black eyes.
---
thats not damning. I'd rather they push it a month or two rather than rush it and put out a broken product.
---
Or maybe your reading to much into it? Blizzard is a professional company, they might have shitty business practices but you can still expect to release games in a timely manner and in a polished manner. I'm pretty sure they confirmed multiple times, i think not even a month ago, that they are still on track for summer.
---
Hey it is ssethtzeentach.
---
&gt; prot's still "rough" compared to wotlk onward and you'd never choose one over a warrior for main tanking bosses (there are exceptions)
---
I'd choose a prot pally over a warrior for main tanking everything in T4 except Gruul.
---
Wow these are great! You really captured the essence of the Forsaken lands with these!
---
Ok. I'll continue to make fun of anyone that thinks working a 8 dollar an hour in for their entire life. 
---
&gt; Helcular's Rod
---
On top of killing a million Yetis, you also have to kill a million Alliance since they also frequent that cave in numbers.
---
So much fun.
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure they confirmed multiple times, i think not even a month ago, that they are still on track for summer.
---
Show that please. Because they were unwilling to state today that it would come out in the summer.
---
I agree with you.  It just means it might not be summer.  
---
Here's your [Crusader Strike.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTf8gQhejfE) Oddly enough, it's in the Protection tree.
---
&gt;  They feel creating classic wow is akin to agreeing to host a second full scale MMORPG.
---
What they actually said was that running Classic on the old 1.12-era client and server would be running a second MMORPG, and they didn't want to do that, so the solution was to run Classic on a modified modern client and server. So they are only running one MMORPG.
---
If they did Classic TBC, I imagine that would run on a modified version of the current client too.
---
You're a survivor too?
---
/s
---
According to J. Allen Brack, that is what they are doing.
---
Hiring new people and training them for games like WoW and Overwatch.
---
I believe the plan is to release content in 2020 and 2021.
---
So 2019 will be a slog - Only Warcraft 3 Reforged, Diablo Mobile - and Classic WoW.
---
Which all aren't very big projects.
---
Classic WoW is big in-terms of how many people will buy into it - but the project itself is, like, 1/10th the size of Retail.
---
That's why it has been referred to as a passion project.
---
“cOnTeNt CrEaToRs”, 5% do something good while the rest just try to milk views from this sub with an endless amount of “someone sneezed at blizzard, here’s a 10 min video on how it affects classic”
---
“oh btw LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE”
---
“oh btw I’m gonna title my video ‘CLASSIC DYING??? HUGE NEWS’ “
---
just fyi m8, they are not the point of this sub. 
---
They may add new staff to Classic WoW to help train them.
---
They'd get to work hand-in-hand with the development team there - which is very experienced no-doubt. 
---
I'd imagine, as you said, Overwatch, Hearthstone, Diablo 4 - and other projects they are planning.
---
We most likely won't see anything until 2020 - or 2021.
---
Lol classic.
---
No way it'll hit before summer... 
---
Who's fucking who's wife?
---
I was so excited to post exactly this as I scrolled further and further down thinking noone had said it yet....
---
And you broke my heart and excited me all at once haha!
---
My very first character. You've gone and got me all nostalgic now.
---
So it's a PUG system, not a guild system.
---
Blessed, I am bringing my partner and we tried out private servers and we could not be more hyped. Hopefully there is a lot of more casuals then the effective powergrind private servers.
---
We are hoping our characters will still be there for us to show our kids and grandkids, "well son I'll show you what we used to play in the old days".
---
Generally, yes. I guess a guild could use it, but I don't think it provides any particular advantage over loot council or DKP, provided those are done competently. 
---
They weren't completely broken in TBC when the pets did scale.
---
I’m ready to get back to the old days of making friends and making memories. 
---
It’s been a loot game for too long. 
---
Let’s get back to when having a Thunderfury showed you were a dedicated part of your guild. Worthy of being invested in. 
---
No, we have decades of data showing how trickle down “works”. It’s not a matter of opinion
---
You have to wonder if some investors actually want games to be art and not just cancerous money printers. 
---
We're fucking Activision Blizzard employee's wives. They're just that nice!
---
Blessed it was a truly wonderful time of my life. Made alot of good friends I still talk to.
---
I want BC more than anything too. If Blizz is willing to do Classic WoW I don’t see why they wouldn’t be willing to do progression servers too. They’re super popular with Everquest and other MMOs that do it
---
Do you have a website or shop?
---
A massive canvas of The haunted Mills on the wall would be insanely cool.
---
Gets me excited for The Barrens chat
---
He's a business-man. Like most big businesses he is focusing purely on shareholder value and nothing else.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Crh82rYweIk
---
Oh man that reminds be of bubblehearthing. So many damn things to do again!! 
---
Why did they believe that btw ?
---
Once mages got two piece t5 they were supposed to go Arcane chug mana pots and do stupid heavy dps. That's how it works on private servers and it's always mages and locks top DPS.

---
More devs for their new mobile games. You are so clueless.
---
Feral (cat) druid in the TBC beta. Still pretty nice after launch (yeah, not quite as bit a change as paladins got)
---
This guy gets it
---
Well, they used to. BfA's launch was a nightmare.
---
I always assumed they were going to try and release around the same time as FFXIV Expansion in order to pull the people back from that game.
---
Then again i also believed in a longer Beta that would begin in Feb if the game was indeed coming in summer.
---
2018 had no major releases for Blizzard, and 2019 will have WoW:The good one™ and a Warcraft 3 Remake and that's it.
---
Yet it'll be Blizz' best year in a long while game-wise for me. WC3 was my childhood so that's a big factor, add Classic WoW and you got a deal. 
---
...As long as they don't fuck them up. *Please* don't fuck them up.
---
They said at blizzcon SUMMER 2019.
---
Yea, I know the paladin version is cleanse.  You said this:  
---
"with the ability to cleanse everything (rare in vanilla to do all 3 poison, magic, and disease)"  
---
You are using "cleanse" in the generic sense- where it also applies to curse.  Paladins cleanse, and it removes the listed there things.  Without the generic use of the word "cleanse" the rest of your line makes no sense- it's exactly as rare to have access to the spell "cleanse" as it is to the ability "sinister strike", because both are spells on exactly one class.
---
maybe all those years when we wondered why they never posted it was because they weren't doing their jobs...
---
Asking for expansions past vanilla is a slippery slope I don't think they'll slide for.
---
not everything is virtue signaling.
---
full balance is bad, that's why u take a little of each, for pvp. I didnt play but just from watching videos over the past year 29/11/11 looks better than chasing someone in cat form. watch stormx videos
---
You can’t level without elemental precision. As a pve’r surely you understand the important of hit rating by now? 
---
srsly. they write that instead of "we wont release it in summer but in autumn/december". this wording is bullshit
---
Brill is my favourite inn place
---
Prot/Ret Pally comes to mind, but also any DoT-based class and those with mana issues being fixed!
---
Vanilla WoW's limited debuffs were a big "fuck you" to every class that owned a DoT and wanted to actually hit a boss with them. TBC removing them opened the door for many specs to shine.
---
Shadow Priest and Warlock are pretty fun (except Sacrificing succ for big SB damage) if you actually use more of your toolkit. Balance Druid has different rotations based on different amounts of Manaregeneration you have, and the debuffs you maintain help both the party's hitchance and your tanks' dodge as well.
---
Fixing those mana issues of burning through your entire pool by looking at your big cast in a weird way also helps a lot. 
---
While some specs like Enhancement became even better in Wotlk and Cata IMO, almost all specs in TBC had something fun to do.
---
When it comes to viability: ALL specs were viable in most of TBC. Sure, your Warlocks were dealing stupid amounts of damage together with Warriors and Rogues with the Glaives near the end of the expansion in Sunwell, but you could still play almost every DPS, Healing or Tank spec and expect to bring *something* useful to the table.
---
Shamans would still provide craptons of support, with Windfury totem still being amazing in TBC and providing the actual 1 more hit buff, Shadowpriests got you a lot of manaregen and a bit of healing, Retpallies provides some nice buffs like a unique 2% damage buff to the party they were in, the list goes on.
---
TL;DR: All specs became viable in TBC, and while gameplay wasn't free from spam-1-button Vanilla style, it did become better for many specs.
---
This is purely my pov, but  
---
Spriest: You have to think about mobility, because you have none without engineering. Sure your mind flay slows and you get 1 fear, but, one a melee is latched on to you you're probably never gonna get away from them. And melees hurt clothies. Otherwise, you have pretty much everything you'd ever need and then some. Fun-wise, you have mind control, and this alone is honestly making me consider rolling a spriest myself.  
---
Warlock : Same as priest, no mobility. I personally prefer to stay away from any pet classes because of bad pet AI and having to deal with it every single day. But if you can get over that, warlock has probably some of the most fun out-of-meta stuff you can do. Bored? Release an infernal over goldshire/razor hill. You can self-heal and that's pretty valuable in classic, where self-heals as dps are pretty rare. You also get a spammable fear, and a choice of gameplay style, dots and direct damage as destro (succubus seduce and soul fire is up there with PoM Pyro for me)  
---
mage: the bane of melees. Basically roll mage if you hate everyone who swings a sword or mace. The leveling experience is easy, but far from great. Out of the 3 the mage is probably the most boring to level and raid with. It's a blast in pvp because of all the tools you have, but in pve, you'll be spamming frostbolt and frostbolt with a side of frostbolt and filling with frostbolt until AQ. Mages have probably the most CC available to them, tools to escape and chase, pretty much instant slow with r1 frostbolt, roots, sheep, blink, ice block, can take a beating stacking stamina and using ice barrier. I don't think anyone except rogues have are as efficient in pvp. You'll never lose because of your class, but because of gear or skill, and that's a good selling point for mages. Bonus side you have slow fall, and most importantly, portals and food/water. You can make gold as a mage by simply being a mage.
---
Blessed.  I will tel you this right now, Nothing will ever be as good as it was the first time you experienced it.  As for you enjoying something again?  That is entirely on your own shoulders if you will allow yourself to instead of sabotage it.
---
I accept that Classic wow will not be exactly what vanilla was.  I also accept that Classic wow is the closest i'll ever get to vanilla and will make do with that.
---
From what I heard they fired some low level positions,  as a lot of the work had been automated... that's something I can actually understand from a tech company. Just hope.ghe increasing Activision influence doesn't spill into classic.
---
Panic at the subreddid adjourned!
---
&gt;The executive said game makers just haven't reached a point yet where the mouth movement and facial animation of game characters is good enough to establish a compelling emotional attachment from the player.
---
Uh no, Valve had it figured out 6 years earlier and it just took the rest of the industry that long to even come *close* to catching up.
---
Done and done
---
Do you take suggestions on what to paint in the future?
---
No. Ranged attacks cannot result in a glancing blow thus the main purpose behind weapon skills is not utilized. This is why Edgemaster's is so good for Melee.
---
Subbed in December of 04, don't really feel blessed or cursed. In the moment it was just a fun game to play with other people. That kinda stopped after wrath though.
---
I’d say Warriors needs it way more. 
---
For a Rogue, Satyr’s Bow is just as good and he should aim for Striker’s Mark. 
---
Am I the only one here who thinks that the lack of specifying summer may mean a late spring surprise release? I mean it could go either way right?
---
I would go with aesthetics.  
---
If you like orcs, go orc. They have the better PvP racial for rogues and the better PvE racial. Also, armor looks amazing on female orcs since they are the closest to a human male, the model they used to design the gear.  
---
If you like undead, go undead. The racial is still good in PvP, just not as good as the orc racial. There's no benefit to PvE in being undead.
---
Resto, just for the Tree
---
Blessed, without wow I don’t know where I would have been. I had ptsd after shattering my femur at 16 years old. The only time I wasn’t reliving the experience was when I was playing wow. 
---
I have PTSD when I think about this MFing sinew...
---
Heads up: I'd rather have TBC remade than Vanilla, the below's kinda why. 
---
- Easy Raid encounters coupled with class and debuff design make for monotonous combat. Most classes only spam 1-2 abilities, and a lot of Bosses in dungeons and Raids are too simple, thus resulting in boring combat. As u/Nickras said, large toolkit, small rotation doesn't work in Raids.
---
- Specs not being viable and not feeling finished. Itemization doesn't help them, either.
---
These are my biggest gripes. As long as I have a satisfying gameplay loop and bosses challenge me, I'm most certainly gonna have fun with an MMORPG and Classic sadly has...Neither in its premier content. I'll probably dabble in Classic and play it every now and then, as I truly think the focus on the journey and adventure is great, but it does have its low points. *in my opinion*
---
Yes that was before we started getting granular and arguing over nothing lol - your statement about abolish is "wrong" too if you want to be pedantic about everything, remove specifically is a 1 time action and abolish is the continuous magic buff that removes several times over X seconds so there is no confusion like you claim there is in the naming of remove curse. If I had said "removes" for the paladin I feel like that would have been confusing to someone who has limited experience with all of these terms but maybe thats my own bias in being familiar with the differences
---
I wish I had friends to go into Classic with.  
---
I don't know anyone from the old day who wants to play, the ones I still know aren't into WoW anymore or they're so deep into retail they wont quit.  
---
Hyrbrid dps became viable. Mages/Rogues/Druids/Warlocks became ridiculous. This is from a PvP perspective.
---
Blessed. This game was hugely impactful for someone like myself. I was raised by a city woman in a tiny town (800 people) out in the middle of nowhere. The culture of my city was cowboy/cowgirl. I was the odd man out because I liked playing video games. I had no interest in most of my peers and they didn't have any interest in me. I grew socially via WoW because everyone was so similar to me there. Came out of my shell as well.  
---
When we revisit the game this summer, sure it won't feel the same and we'll remember so much about the game. However, I think the truly special thing about vanilla will be recaptured in it's same glory: The friends you make. I fully expect to make new friendships in Classic just as I did in vanilla, and I look forward to that moment even if I already know every corner and quest of the old game.  
---
Additionally, I'm excited for the prospect of helping people who aren't as well versed in the game. I will be playing a warrior in vanilla, and I look forward to tanking for people who just need a little more assistance than others.  
---
Level alts, level professions, do roleplaying scenarios, do owPvP raids, protect your leveling guildmates, farm consumables, do battlegrounds, the list goes on.
---
Plus you are locked out of raids most of the time, so you won't do raids every time you log in, even as a serious raider.
---
&gt;Can you specify what is "telling" about someone enjoying a more polished, comprehensive experience?
---
Because polish doesn't matter if the writing is just random shit happening with little rhyme or reason. There is little consistency in anything, characters just appear and disappear randomly, switch their personalities, entire cultures change to accomodate some story point that gets forgotten anyway, and retcons out of the fucking wazoo. What's the point sticking with a world when everything you know is going to get retconned in 2 expansions max? All-encompassing plots like the Burning Legion get resolved in something like 1 patch, after being completely forgotten for the past 4 expansions. Then there's total clusterfucks like WoD's time travel/alternative dimension shit that breaks any semblance of a coherent world.
---
Every time I go to the Wiki to look something up, I discover another piece of awfulness from the writing of post-2010 WoW. Like this one [about Jaina's brother Derek](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Derek_Proudmoore):
---
&gt;The novel Tides of Darkness described Derek's death as him having been consumed by dragon flames, with his body crumbling as it fell, burned to mere ash. In Battle for Azeroth however, his corpse is quite intact, and this despite having spent nearly thirty years underwater. The rest of the sailors are all skeletons, except for Valentine who is also intact. After being revived Derek still remembers dying from dragon's fire.
---
You can't make this shit up. Saying these writers don't care is giving them the benefit of the doubt, because the alternative is that they're mentally handicapped.
---
mortal strike 
---
I was giving you the benefit of the doubt, perhaps you were just okay with the story being random stupid shit happening, but thinking the writers of this illogical clusterfuck actually have any passion for it clearly tells me that you don't even see the lack of coherence.
---
Hate using cliche'd phrases, but: Go read a book. Or 2. Or 20. You clearly have never seen good writing in your life.
---
Not having some certainty around the release date really sucks. I was booking some training at work today around July, and I had to stop and check the dates against summer 2019 to make sure I would be able to attend.
---
Edit above: I am planning on going engie. 
---
mind control is v tempting. But I'm leaning towards lock now.
---
Thanks for the thorough reply! Which class can beat mages and warlocks?
---
Hey, thanks! I really liked the look of this build and if you don't mind I'd like to ask you 2 questions about it.  
---
Why Imp. Arcane Explosion? I'm just curious why I'd be using Arcane Explosion when I have already upgraded Blizzard and Cone. Is it the instant, low-cd damage? I'm just curious in case I'm playing wrong.
---
Also would 2 points in Arctic Reach + an Extra in Piercing Ice be a good way to end this build?   
---
Due to the fact I like high population pvp servers and lots of pvp, I will sadly be avoiding aoe grinding. However Wands don't have as much of a place in PvP, and I don't mind the extra downtime if it means I'm stronger in pvp.
---
Along with becoming a PVP god.  
---
Wait... you’re insane?!
---
I played Warlock in the last half of TBC and if they made TBC classic I'd play it again. It was just that fun.  
---
Not to mention T5 warlock set is the greatest looking tier set of all time.

Mages: Warlocks maybe, a good hunter/priest. Opportunistic Rogues/Ferals that will one-shot you if they catch you unprepared. Shamans are a tough match for mages but since you're horde there's no worry about that  
---
Warlock: Rogues and geared 60 warriors, a good shadow priest maybe. I feel like warlocks have less counters due to having a pet and dots to apply constant pressure that no class can deal with in vanilla. They are also plenty sturdy and can take a beating before going down. Again, my only gripe with warlocks is relying on a pet to cc for you. If you're ok with pets and farming soulshards, then warlock is a great class and a blast to level/play as.
---
Ah yes, also known as the sunken cost fallacy.  The more time you put into something, the more stubborn and invested you become because you don't want to feel like you wasted the time already spent.
---
Blessed, it's not going to be the same but this time I will be able to finish Naxx.
---
&gt;Strikers mark doesnt allow a hunter to pull off his raid rotation properly. 
---
And on top of that you have 50% chance of mc quest bow chain drop EVERY FUCKING WEEK. Everyone, everyones alts and friends will get that shit.
---
I feel this way as well.  
---
I just wasn't that good in vanilla, but I also wasn't super focused on being good. I loved exploring back then. Primarily because my PC was really bad and I could only do ZG and Molten Core.  
---
I look at this as my second chance but this time I have the resources to make sure my PC and internet are top of the line.  
---
I also have more free time than ever now so I plan on going hard on this game and experiencing the things I didn't experience before.  
---
Why would you need it to feel exactly the same ? You already got to experience the "real deal" in all of its glory. Now it will be slightly altered version of it.
---
And tbh, nothing will ever feel like wow vanilla at start. And thats fine, i was there, i remember it.
---
This conversation has nothing to do with trickle down economics. 
---
Both of which would still classify as summer, at least through Sept. 21.
---
Europe.
---
I wonder how do you have breakfast in the morning, knowing someone somewhere starves to death.
---
This is something I've wondered about too. It was wonderful being there with all of the excited folks as we shared the experience in an interesting virtual world for the first time and developed a culture. 
---
The downside is that peaking is a dangerous thing: were we blessed to have had our penultimate gaming experience in our teens or 20s? Were we cursed that nothing might ever match it? With the way the world and corporate norms have shifted for the worse, can we expect anything else that draws mostly enthusiastic and happy people together into one place like that and encourages them to form groups and achieve difficult goals? 
---
I personally think it was a blessing and a curse. 
---
Jesus fuck of cause it hasn't changed. This community...
---
The biggest flaw is itemization. In raids all the hybrid spec tier gear, except 2.5, is for healing. Warrior itemization is all tanking. PvP itemization was pretty much the opposite: it was designed for hybrids to go dps. And Druid PvP gear? Most confused set ever...it packs agi, int, and spell damage into the same set.
---
At least if you raided you would gear up, in PvP you were pretty much consigned to T1-ish level gear unless you sold your soul to the PvP devil, and then you got T2-ish level gear.
---
And that's just end game gear. In lower levels there is a lot of gear that is literally useless. I carry around a shield with +shadow damage on it as a joke.
---
Many of the other things you mentioned are also flaws too though. I mostly PvP so most of my concerns are there. Itemization is #1, class balance is another.
---
It bears mentioning "summer" goes all the way to Sept. 21.
---
&gt;Activision Blizzard posted record revenue across the board, boasting the company made 7.5 billion dollars this year alone
---
It didnt MAKE 7.5 billion, it was bit under $2B. Blizzard has been like this for a long time, ppl just didnt want to hear about it. THAT guy had that job for xx years. Nothing has changed in that 10 year period. And NOW ppl are upset.
---
Because they werent exploited with low pay, but kicked out. That was that bad thing.
---
absolutely. Some of my best friends were made like that. Meet them at 19 in deadlines. See them in passing in stv. See them again with their mount on the pirate beach in tanaris.. hey man maybe the old gods are telling us something lol wanna join a guild together?
---
The only thing I'm concerned about is the lack of a beta or anything so far. Summer is just a few months away. There is no way they will be releasing (re-releasing) a game this size without extensive player testing
---
I agree in part, I said that "existing companies to be able to focus on making new and exciting games will be limited", I absolute think the focus is currently on cash grab games, large companies will follow industry trends. When Wow was developed for 5 years starting in 1999, there was only a handful of MMO's and Blizzard took a large gamble to make it happen. Modern Blizzard is not going to make a large gamble. Therefore the new and innovative games are less likely to come from them. However they may look at taking an existing format of game, doing their own spin and applying the polish to it to make it look great. However without Metzen and the other original creatives I can't see them making new and engaging IP's any time soon ever since the failure of project Titan.
---
Hey hey people, it’s me, Sseth here.
---
Hi ! I'm willing to learn tanking with Classic. The build you're talking about, does it go all the way into Fury or is it kinda balanced between the 3 specs with a bit more points into fury ? Any relevant ressource you can share, I'd be happy to get ! Thanks
---
Sorry but that is just not correct from my experience.
---
You are so clueless that you are moving the goalposts when you get called out? 
---
Unless they’re replacing Rhok’Delar*
---
How about one that continously makes decisions based solely on short-term financial factors. Blizz is taking a lot of flack about not listening to players and they in turn fired CMs while the new CEO raked in bonuses. Blizz is going downhill and more people are starting to realize this.
---
And then you see 1-2 sinews drop in 2 months from Ony because RNG is RNG. 
---
?  They have a taunt and they can use the same trinket than warrior. The only thing they don't have is the taunt set bonus but no warrior will have it on the firsts try anyway.
---
Prot pally is clearly superior on Moroes because of Blessing of Sacrifice negates the gouge, BoP partially negates the garrote and they can easily tank multiple adds if needed.
---
Prot pally is clearly superior on Nightbane because they trivialise the air phase and that's the only hard bit once you are geared enough to go the distance.
---
Prot pally trivialises Illhoof and solo tanks the whole thing without needing a warlock tank.
---
Prot pally is clearly superior on Magtheridon because they can tank two channelers, freeing up space for an extra DPS, and bubble through the roof collapse.
---
Just about everything else in Kara there's no mechanical reason to prefer a warrior tank and exorcism does great damage and threat because everything is a demon or undead.
---
Plus they can AoE tank almost all the trash making the whole run smoother and faster.
---
Gruul is the one exception because he can silence you when you need to put up Holy Shield and open you up for a crushing blow. That's it. That's the only reason to even have a warrior tank in Tier 4.
---
And looking upon that random guildless Thunderfury warrior made you ponder what his history is.
---
No matter how good a job bliz does recreating the experience, it's not going to match what you had back then. It can't. You're not the same person, and you're not a WOW virgin. 
---
You've got to take the present for what it is, and find the good in it. Which hopefully will be a good Classic experience
---
The typical hyper toxic executive
---
Sep 23rd this year. But yeah. I posted a few weeks ago saying summer can last until late September 
---
Hunters are great in PvP end game. I played a hunter when vanilla was live and had great fun with it. There's a lot of cool tricks you can pull off, and hunter really gets to utilize most of their kit in PvP. 
---
One time in warsong, I was in the enemy tunnel and had a lot on me. Right before they killed me, i feigned death. They all ran off except a single rogue. I trapped and bandaged. Managed to get an aimed shot off and kite him to death. Stuff like that was among the greatest PvP memories I have in wow. I would recommend it.
---
Check out this guy rifluvr on youtube for vanilla PvP. In this vid, he 4v1's 4 rogues.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPtSiKS5lJw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPtSiKS5lJw)
---
Yea that's the problem with private servers. Usually they aren't populsted for too long because of new and "better" servers. That my experience with them anyway. 
---
&gt; I wasn’t sure if you had actually played retail in a long time. 
---
I even gave BfA a chance. What killed it for me was that on the one hand, thy've turned the world into a lobby for what feels (for me as a tank) like a singleplayer with 4 bots and me giving these mobile turrets something to do, enabeling them to output DPS and keeping them alive. That would all be fine if my tank-game hadn't been dumbed down so much. Azerite clothing only gives passives, my reactive abilities were heavily pruned and my active abilities (aka "rota") could quite effectively be handled by a priority-list-macro.
---
*So,* the multiplayer-aspect had more or less disappeared as other players would not interact with me (not that there was a need to) while the single-player-ish part, the handling of my char, lost its appeal due to oversimplification.
---
In the vanilla versions available today, both these issues are not present. Interaction is necessary, omnipresent and encouraged. When was the last time you passed someone in the open world on retail and casually threw a buff their way? I'm currently doing that all the time, as well as being on the receiving end. I constantly talk to strangers in the world to coordinate questing. The world is much more alive that way. And at ~lvl 20, you start having a bigger toolbox than on retail at 120.
---
Well that's your opinion. Why not both?
---
Had a 40+ vid of myself ganking as a Rogue as well. It is lost forever tho.
---
But this includes everything from the music to the walking scene.
---
"Fools of Stranglethorn" is an awesome name.
---
The thing is, you can't have the 15% from sacrificing at the same time as the 10% from having it up, and 15% &gt; 10%, so you're wasting 9 points for a talent that gives you less damage, and those 9 points could go to improved life tap instead of being wasted.
---
So frustrating that the debate is reduced to these two choices.
---
Best server ;)

---
Basically, you can world pvp naked and still win with some skill.
---
Now I miss the addon AtlasLoot. I guess it would come back.
---
Whilst I met my best friend in ‘real life’, our friendship was solidified by playing Classic together. We made so many memories that we still often reminisce about them more than a decade later. 
---
We’re both very excited to revisit those memories with Classic.
---
Neither really. I started in August 2005 and uninstalled the game about 2 weeks later. I just hated the leveling part of MMOs and there were a wealth of games that were more interesting. I went for A rank on ICCUP during the Broodwar days and I thought that was much more fun than killing X amount of boars and collecting Y amount of murloc eyes that never drop.    
---
Funnily enough it wasn't until Cataclysm that I really fell in love with WoW. That's still my favourite expansion because of how awesome it was during the first few months. 
---
I didn't care for MoP, WoD heroics were fun at first and the raids were pretty good. It wasn't until Nost that I fell back into WoW again. I started playing there to shut up a mate of mine who went on about how great vanilla was. I still remembered the horrors of eye-less murlocs but I gave it a try and instantly fell in love with it. Now I've jumped around private servers ever since and am looking forward to Classic.
---
I mean, the term "sunwelled", meaning to be removed from competitive raid line ups capable of beating the dungeon, came from mages being so outshone by warlocks that there was no reason for them to be brought to Sunwell.  I doubt it's stilled used in common parlance, but it was all over the forums for a couple years after.
---
A classic pro is a wizzard knowing everything about the game. Spending time wizely for optimal progression. Knowlage is power.
---
A retail pro had good mussle memorie for a hard rotation + reflexes for boss mechanic. No need for knowlage. 
---
I'm a cutting edge raider but I've done almost no m+ dungeons, I know nothing about other classes, others specs, other aspects of the game besides the current raid. But I can dream these mechanics.
---
Vanilla = Knowlage &gt; Reflexes
---
Retail = Reflexes &gt; Knowlage
---
Thats my oppinion
---
We use it as a part or our LC decision making. Mostly just to make sure that we don't stack gear on one person or class. Currently it's a mess because we have like 30 mages and warlocks and keeping track of them is a pain. 
---
That’s correct.
---
Has been obtainable since MoP from BMAH. 
---
$11 btw
---
You can abuse alot of things. Its a choice. 
---
Absolutely stunning! 
---
"My spec's itemization is fucked."
---
"Go level an alt."
---
Okay, then...
---
Can it be a mix a both?  Bless for many reasons like everyone else.  Was a haven, and a place were I made plenty of friends.  Enjoy many aspects.  Over time that dwindled directly after WOTLK.   This game has killed gaming in general for me.    I miss that I could log in any time  benefit myself and a friends. Hate having to wait for everyone to group up to play a match.  Now on Retail and other games it feels worthless to advance.  
---
I skip it by now, because its the only quest in shimmering flats that does not have a followup like killing vultures or turtles, so it's just one deadend quest with no incentive doing it except mediocre XP, because you arent even chainkilling them due to competition. 
---
But I've done it once too.
---
cool ganking video, dude. Obviously a top 10 rogue
---
How about mutherfokkin Burning Blade Insignia outside Orgrimmar? You are already in the group for RFC, you just want to snatch the questitem real quick to get the main dungeon quest and for another 15mins it does not drop with an ever increasing impatient group breathing down your neck. 
---
I never accept group invites anymore before having all dungeon quests.
---
Valve time?
---
is this it https://youtu.be/abmbObP02IE
---
You misunderstand my point.
---
The story is certainly flawed - and often times falls back on Blizzards ability to recreate a character to fit a plot.
---
My point is that the story is translated very well in-game.
---
This extends from the cinematics (Saurfang + Zappyboi, Jaina Warbringer, and all the in-game cines).
---
Not the actual writing, itself, as of Battle for Azeroth.
---
It is, after all, possible to enjoy a lore event even when it seems like a stretch in the story.
---
However, the two points where I personally believe that WoWs writing was at its best Was MoP and Legion (Prior to argus) with WotLK trailing closely behind.
---
I do personally believe they have passion for it - but a story can't stay consistently amazing forever - it is hard to keep selling WoWs story arch every expansion without changing an important lore characters alignment - WoD sold because it brought back the old - and then offered a chance to kill the old. 
---
This was cheap writing - clearly designed by the executives to sell the game.
---
Which it did - Reaching 10 million subscribers. 
---
Battle for Azeroth has done similarly as successful in terms of Release sales. 
---
It is easy to attempt to make ad hominem remarks as a way of avoiding any real substance within your argument. 
---
You've failed to support your own point - There is plenty of examples you could use to support it - but you can't.
---
Because you don't know anything. Simple. 
---
First Law Series - Joe Abercrombie.

Grats for the most retarded comment in the thread
---
EPICLY owned me with that one, autistic bootlicker
---
Hope he doesn’t get fired for saying that...
---
Affirmative.
---
Hunter. If he was 1st in line to get AshJre'thul I would give it to the Warrior though.
---
Blessed because it was wonderful.
---
Cursed because it ruined all over games.
---
It’s crazy to me. I’m getting old I guess! :D
---
Absolutely stunning!  "Return to the Magistrate"  is my favorite by far :D 
---
Can you please make more?

November 23rd 2019, 15 years after initial release
---
&gt; P.S. You can also post links or explain yourself why they don't scale so well, because everyone just keeps on echoing that statement but no one provides examples or mechanics behind it. It's not neccesary but would be appreciated.
---
they scale rather great considering that they get 2 AP from 1 agi.  
---
in PvP you are a monster starting from T1 and this never changes throughout the game.  
---
you have great long range burst with very minimal need to stand still.  
---
compared that to casters who have to stand still for at least 2.5s to cast powerful spells.
---
at end game you are basically a 46y range MS warrior without the healing debuff. from a pure damage perspective.
---
Pheew I felt this was closer.. god thanks! 
---
Please tell me you are about to make a Ironforge or Thunderbluff Painting. This is next level art, thanks for sharing
---
Saved the best for last 😍
---
They'll inevitably fuck it up somehow like they do everything they've touched for years now, but I'd like to be pleasantly surprised for once 
---
It's definitely not going to feel the same. Even if there were #nochanges, the biggest difference is that nowadays, information about the game is everywhere. Theorycrafting is a lot more accurate and open to the public, guides to beating bosses are much more accessible, datamining sites are more popular and accessible than they were during vanilla, and addons, though they probably won't be available *immediately* at launch, will be used much more widely. Even if you decide to deprive yourself of all these modern amenities, other people won't. If you raid or do dungeons, someone in the group will tell you the optimal strategy for every boss. Even if you just group up to do quests while leveling, it's pretty likely whoever you group up with will know exactly where to go and what to do for every quest. So unless you decide to play 100% solo, you're going to have a pretty significantly different experience from the old days.
---
Agreed 100%
---
Been available since MoP, from the black market auction house.
---
If anything this makes me happy. Sure I’d love the game ASAP but this reminds me of old Blizzard who would just delay until they get it right. I don’t want half baked game that doesn’t live up to expectations.
---
These are fantastic, I can't wait to see some WPL. A contrasting piece with some Scarlet Crusade thrown in would be glorious! 
---
I miss it, I really miss it 
---
The lack of wording *Summer* 2019 worries me though. Could still mean its been pushed back from its summer release.
---
&gt; And are you really denying that if you pick random people with an achievement, and another group of people without an achievement, that the group without will have just as much average experience on the fight as the group with the achieve?
---
The **TL;DR** is that:
---
I am saying that if you gave me and a random raid leading monkey the job of recruiting a PUG raid, I could do a better job than him without requiring the achievement in the same amount of time. 
---
I am saying that 95% of the reason why current PUGs work isn't the achievement (aka *experience*), it's the brute force of the ilvl overpowering mechanics and, occasionally, the skill of the players involved (with or without experience killing the boss). I am confident I could get on my main and rock the 80 percentile at least on my first try on any boss right now with no experience, if the "link achievement" system would prefer the 80% under me then it's a bad system and you should do away with it. 
---
I am saying that the people who have the "experience" of 1 or more kills are not necessarily better or preferable than those who don't have that. If it's not a discriminating factor then it shouldn't be a factor at all because it makes you biased, it will give you false flags, bold confidence in it and etc. from a meta perspective. 
---
As in, if you keep doing this for a while and you see that it works, you tend to acknowledge that it works because of the achievement requirement even though, as I've argued, it has almost nothing to do with it as much as the insane ilvl required for most PUGs. Then other people start doing it and the echo chamber of ball scratching is formed. That's pretty much what's happened with the "link achiev for inv". They kinda forgot about the fact that the mechanics are not as punishing once you Titanforge the fuck out dungeon gear and you're 10-15 ilvls over the raid's level instead of 10-15 ilvls under it. 
---
It's like scratching your balls before every raid and then saying "well, everytime I did it I managed to kill bosses, it must be doing something" and then you tell everyone that scratching balls is effective at killing bosses. 
---
It's not any indicator for skill as much as gear/talents/meters/mechanics is and figuring out who is good at what based on a quick 1 minute evaluation in Warcraft is definitely what makes a good raid leader 
---
Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft would like a word.
---
These are insane, so so good!
---
Rank A ICCUP? Now that is something I have not heard in a loooong time.
---
Boxer, Jaedong, Flash :) I was a fanatic myself. Good times.
---
Welcome to the real World.
---
You've piqued my interest! Awesome work pal 
---
In unlimited rage situation you gain almost 100 more tps from the dagger, it's certainly better for threat.
---
Lol this will be fun 
---
Amazing art! Well done !
---
This, I honestly don't care if it splits up the community. Let me decide which one I want to play.
---
millions of flies are attracted to shit, that don't make it appealing.... 
---
Here. This is base of any mage build.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZZVVG000x
---
Idea is to freeze mobs and tear them with increased crit chance and power.
---
After that you can take any talents in any order. Increased hit chance? Good. Increased damage? Good. Increased slow effect? Still good. Decreased mana cost? Take it, if you need. 
---
Blizzard *did* address the issue. In Burning Crusade. They gave the Horde a "pretty" race and the Alliance a "monstrous" one. They gave both factions access to both Paladins and Shamans, and they did a better job of balancing out all the class/specs.
---
I spent countless hours on the Booty Bay boat mind controlling people off it. Sorry to those I hurt. 
---
Anyone supporting this company can go fuck himself as well.   
---
I won't play Classic, fuck this pathetic cash grab that plays on people nostalgia... and it still wont deliver, they will fuck it up and people here will still be going back to it just like the dude who got his heart broken by his first love but he cannot forget about it... ya'll are pathetic.   
---
This whole company can go fuck themselves.   
---
I have original D1/D2/D2:LOD/Wc2/Wc3:battlechest/WoW/TBC/WoTLK cd's from the days they were released basically (Except wc2) and no I ain't coming back. Yes these were good games but that is no reason to blindly follow this shitstorm just because I can't find nothing better to do with my time except romanticize their bullshit products that were developed over 15 years ago because they weren't able to create anything of quality ever since.   
---
Fuck Activision Fuck Blizzard. Fuck the CEO's and fuck all this shit. I ain't supporting this piece of shit company for 10 years almost,almost had me due to my nostalgia there Blizz but as same as with all of my ex'es, go fuck yourself bitch and find someone else to make their lives miserable with your bullshit (policies).   
---
That quest can be an evening in itself. I think it once took me like 3 hours. Just torture.
---
I imagine a world where what initiates the transfer to a BC server is stepping through the dark portal on your vanilla realm.
---
Okay? And I can continue to not play live wow. I'll support GGG whose poured tons of work into their game and their image. Tencent bought them last year and so far they've only fucked with the Chinese client.
---
I would loot chests and leave 1 gray item in it for the next person.
---
Nothing, I refuse to be a dick to people.
---
and it
---
Fantastic! You've captured the tone perfectly :) 
---
I'm russian and I don't want to play with russians either.
---
wow, diablo, hots and overwatch would like a word...
---
What defines summer?
---
Where I come from it has always been the months of June, July and August.
---
I'd take it just to sell xd. In Classic every possible money source will be useful anyway.
---
Classic wow is like heroin in a sense. It is THE BEST THING YOU EVER DID when you did it, but it leaves an empty void after that can never be filled again except with even more classic.
---
Well it also really helped that their 60% block from talents didn't rely on being critable any more.
---
Blessed.  If I hadn’t started playing when i did, I may not have met many of the people I call friends now, all these years later.   There are experiences I would have missed out on. 
---
I realize modern classic will not be the same.  That’s simply not possible.  I’ve changed, my friends have changed, the world has changed.  What happened in 2004 can’t happen again.
---
But this will be as close as we’ll get and the most I can hope for.
---
That being said, Prot only became truly awesome a couple of patches down the line. I recall that our server was literally crying out to get some Prot Paladins recruited by the time Sunwell came along (oh we prot pallies were godlike in that raid). For The Eye and SSC prots weren't that great yet.
---
Warlocks saw a lot of love. They were competitive with mages right off the bat with way more utility. They were invaluable in raids and some fights even greatly benefited from stacking warlocks, like pre-nerf Magtheridon which almost required three or more warlocks to be doable.
---
As the expansion progressed their damage scaled way higher than mages and other pure DPS classes. As a mage I felt a lot of resentment to the balance issues. I still am ticked that I got rejected by a higher tier guild, the spot got filled by a Lock with less gear and experience. 
---
Vanilla was more opposite. Why bring a Lock when you can have a mage?
---
Thanks mr.jobs
---
Thats because it's few and far among them! Also the two most populated servers out there are still at AQ, and there are ferals raiding AQ on those servers.
---
in many years of wow i did one thing, that i am really not proud of. my 3s team in arena was doing very well, but the one thing to push us even higher was a caster trinket of icc for my affliction wl. i always had bad luck and didnt get it. so we 3 started a random raid with one of my mates as lootmaster. when the trinket droped i lost the roll for it. my mate just gave it to me and said "sorry missclick, pls give it to person who won". i logged out and kept the trinket.
---
in hindsight we should just have declared that item as "locked". i have to admit i feel very bad about it now.
---
pls no downvote :(
---
Blessed. No question. My first line when he started talking about ice cream was "I can go back" 
---
Seeing as this isn't limited to hybrids, BM Hunter! Went from "don't even think about it" to best hunter spec.
---
When the group sucks dix ya aggro half the room run back to them and bubble hearth.. /s ciao
---
I hate epgp! It incentivises people to only ever go for absolute bis gear. The one guild I was in that used it constantly had to force people to take items they didn't want. Otherwise your GP gets too high and you get lower prio than newbies who show up for a raid or two.
---

Dwarf Hunter every time. The others have far better options, and a Dwarf Hunter likely rolled dwarf purely to use that damn gun.
---
Whichever one you like the most
---
This is amazing, congrats! More like that is comming?
---
I remember hitting level 24 on my dwarf rogue then spending like 2 weeks in stone talon mountains ganking lobbies entering their first contested zone.
---
Also had a priest friend who would Mindcontrol enemy players in Stv then we could inspect them to see if they had good gear. I remember Mcing a warrior with whirlwind axe and seeing it for the first time panicking and running away 
---
Depends on the class. For hunters it's actually better to get the ones who don't have 8/8 T2 geared up with T2.5 first. 
---
Did people genuinely think it wouldn’t be 2019 lol?
---
&gt;Your options in life are a direct result of the choices you make.
---
Lmao, I'll just be over here having the same options as someone who inherited millions of dollars. Tons of people are born into way better circumstances, giving them.... *better options*. Are you seriously saying that everyone is totally equal from the start? Think about this for like five seconds dude literally
---
This
---
Wow that’s really cool! Good job OP!
---
In AQ40 specifically, the bis gear for hunters gets a total stat upgrade of +2ap (from silithid claw). That's it.
---
Naxx is better at least.
---
2000 seems pretty high before Sunwell for a 20 man
---
Definitely blessed. It was one of the best times of my life and the best game ever made. I made so much memories, so much experiences, so many friends. It was awesome. And everything awesome has to come to an end, but I still have the memories.
---
No illusions that Classic WoW will be different, but it doesn't bother me that much.
---
These are great, love the haunted Mills one especially! Really captures that creepy feel
---
It'll be the same game for sure...  
---
But everybody who plays it will know it... they've seen it all before now.  
---
There'll be no 'wonder', I won't accidentally take the boat to Booty Bay from Ratchet at lvl 15 and explore STV by dying over and over with a few friends.  
---
Won't randomly try to find legendary/epic items from fishing .... or killing random elites.  
---
Surely won't take 5 months levelling at my own pace because I'd stop and explore each new map.  
---
Blessed to have played it, cursed because I know whatever we get won't be what we want.
---
I wasn't aware of this phasing thing. Why would anybody think it's a good thing?
---
At MoP launch I got to level 90 quite early and got myself some Honor PvP gear. At one evening me and 2 or 3 guildmates killed 100+ of leveling Alliance players at a quest hub. We had flying mounts, they didn’t. It was so much fun that I switched guilds and joined a WPvP guild so we did the same thing with higher numbers at every evening for months.
---
Definitely blessed. It's like the gaming equivalent of growing up with the Beatles or Rolling Stones
---
Dual wielding yes, along with every single post-34 talent being god-tier.
---
They got: 
---
+10% weapon damage 5/5
---
30% of AP as bonus SP 3/3
---
Dual-wielding 1/1
---
Stormstrike 1/1
---
+6% hit 3/3
---
On crit gives party-wide +10% AP buff 5/5
---
And finally, they got rage 1/1, reducing damage by 30% and giving your attacks a proc that restores 30% of your AP as mana, 15 seconds on a 2 min cd.
---
But one of the coolest things was the change to spirit weapons: they got a 30% built in threat reduction on weapon damage.
---
This. I've had quite a few moments of temptation but I've always said no and moved on.
---
The inspiration for Jastor Gallywix, I bet.
---
Mixed.  I loved vanilla.  It was the first MMO I ever played and it consumed my life.  I played over 60 hours a week for several years.  Nothing I've ever done in gaming compares to my guild's first Ragnaros kill, but WoW destroyed my first marriage.  I want to go back and I never want to go back.  I have a spreadsheet for everything about warriors so I can no life it when Classic releases and I am simultaneously afraid of where that will lead.  One thing's for sure though, I will not play Ret Paladin this time around.  Lok'tar Ogar.
---
looool
---
Pretty sure it had like 400+ armour back in the day too, which was significant for clothies

I was the douche hiding across the way from MC window and mind controlling people into the lava.. :]
---
Another thing I used to do was take my hunter to noob zones, tame a level 1-2 critter, name it the same as the zone's critter, then mind control it in walk mode to a newb who was leveling just to get them to flag themselves on it... at which point i would... well...  I wasn't a nice person.
---
They’re frequently mentioned in WoW literature! I hope to see them. 
---
Well, just do 5 onyxias per reset. np.
---
Thank you for posting them! They all look amazing and I'm definitely interested in more paintings. I sent this post to a couple of friends and we're actually going to plan an afternoon to paint our favorite WoW areas. 
---
Well done. Keep up the good work.
---
The developers and other workers should have control of the company, by all rights, since they're the ones who made the games and marketed the games in the first place. The company would run much better and produce a better product, but instead capitalists have to be allowed to fuck up everyone and everything around them so a few workers in the company (and shareholders) can squeeze out a few more drops of wealth, wealth for only them.

Spent hours as a rogue ganking low-level alliance in ~that lake town with a lake~ Lakeshire.

Imagine a group of children who are enjoying to draw something. They are drawing every day getting better, getting validation from friends and parents, putting all the drawings on the wall to enjoy even more. Now imagine the teacher suddenly comes in and tells the children if you draw me this and that, you get candy. If you draw more and faster, you can get more candy.   So suddenly the whole story of the children changes – Now they are drawing for the candy reward, they are no longer doing it because they liked drawing in the first place. What happens?  They no longer enjoy drawing altogether, the wall isn’t filled with different creative drawings. Everybody compares how much candy they have. 
---
The whole story changed from  we like drawing together, growing our ability, creating this versatile wall of paintings   to: -  well, we are drawing because we need to get the candy achievement, drawing things I don't really like anymore. 
---
I hated when they implemented Achievements – go away, I don’t need your stupid incentives, let us create our own.  But now you can’t even take them out, imagine how mad all the stupid kids would get if you took away all they candy they played so long for.  You can’t just smash a certain gamification mechanic in without knowing human psychology. 
---
But retail isn’t even like creative drawing anymore – it is more like colouring-in a given mandala with certain given colored pencils.
---
Billion dollar corporation good
---
I wasn't convinced of the whole "rip blizzard" thing until now but this makes it crystal clear, the blizzard we knew is dead
---
&gt;  a Dwarf Hunter likely rolled dwarf purely to use that damn gun
---
Why's that?
---
(just curious - never played a hunter)
---
I can only comment on my experience with loot council, loot would go to players based on a few different factors. Maximum priority to classes for whom it would be BIS (i.e irreplacable until new content releases which may contain better gear), if it's BIS for nobody or you've selected your BIS people you would then make the next call as a combination of who is the best performing/loyal/dedicated player, but also taking in to consideration how much of an upgrade it is. Ideally everyone would be giving 100%, so you'd only need to consider how much of an upgrade it is, but that's rarely if ever the case.
---
Incredible!!!!
---
It looks like this sub found it’s new ion 
---
Well that’s his job, it’s literally what he was employed to do.
---
I played hunter so I once tamed a low level tiger in Echo Isles, used Eyes of the Beast, and pathed in around using just like a normal Durotar Tiger mob. Even named it "Durotar Tiger" so when the hordies attempted to get the furs for their quest, they'd be put in PvP combat and I'd 1 shot them from underwater with my Hydrocane and Dwarven Hand Cannon.
---
When is anything on the internet not an exaggeration 
---
Also orc warriors 
---
really great. do you also have other wow themed paintings?
---
/u/spearmints /u/IAMAPandaBearAMA or any other mod please ban ty
---
Tbh, I just decided it..I wont be coming back for classic.
---
Blessed, undoubtedly. I was in my early 30's when it came out. My wife and several of my friends all got into it, and we had incredible times for the first couple of years. Only I remain from that group as a continuing player, but to this day WoW rates as the most significant gaming experience of my life. :) (And that includes the day I first saw X-Wing on my brother's PC!)
---
Honestly I have no desire to switch to Classic. Only speaking for myself, it wouldn't be the same without the friends I used to hang with. I'll no doubt revisit it every now and then, but the majority of my game time will be with retail.
---
You should do a westfall version. The difference between light and dark of westfall and tirisfal would be a really cool thing to compare
---
They've already stated they are doing progressive patches (Gates, etc). If they go through the trouble of retrofitting the modern engine for the old assets I see no reason why they wouldn't keep porting the old stuff over. How to manage and not split the community on this would be the biggest hurdle.
---
The walk from Deathknell makes me want to roll Undead again. I was thinking about an Orc or Troll this time around, but I dono know
---
Classic wasn't included in the "future" part of the yearly earnings call. Probably just getting lumped with retail.
---
these are absolutely gorgeous. i love the colour of the sky.
---
i was kinda set when it comes to classes/races, but this really makes me want to play an undead aswell.
---
L O L
---
Why 2 pts into imp blizzard? Since the spec has frostbite it won't be used for aoe grinding, for pvp itself 1 pt is enough. Better to put that point and the remaining into permafrost.
---
I guess you could, in a mostly stationary fight with a group with casters/ranged, drop tranquil air in a distance from the tank that he wont get the effect of it. It has obviously minimal use in a five man dungeon most of the time though,
---
&gt; From my point of view, making hybrid classes being able to do dps like pure dps is a flaw in an RPG. 
---
While this is true IMO, most of hybrids asked for just be *competitive* as in *being an option* rather than do the the same damage/being as tanky. There is alternatives to it, such as stronger buffs or other utility making them more valuable with certain comps due to them, kinda the way TBC took. 
---
The issue in vanilla is most of these utilities are baseline so healer specs have pretty much the same buffing as the other specs even some have more (manatide being unique for Rshams). At best these specs bring a unique weak buff that is not worthwhile enough (LotP, moonkin aura, additional aura+blessing for ret/prot pally, VE for spriests, enhanced WF totem for enhas). 
---
This lack of unique worthwhile utility, the fact of being the only classes capable of healing, itemization being focused in this aspect as well (and scarce and wonky for any of the others, needing a balance of too much stats) and poor individual performance seal the deal. 
---
he was only referring the year, so we are still safe maybe.
---
You really need elemental precision as early as possible. It's way more important than frostbite and ice shards, even imp frostbolt as you don't get the max cast-time on frostbolt until like 20 or something anyway.
---
One resisted frostnova or frostbolt screws you over so badly while leveling.
---
prot pala, from joke 5man spec to progress main tank even. (hyjal anyone?)
---
then the hibrid dps specs (enha retri boomkin elem spriest)
---
Cool, sounds like a good idea. Hope it pans out well.
---
Don't know why you got down voted, it's quite spot on. Hordes try hard way more from my experience, especially pvp wise. 
---
Blizzard didn't buff the damage as they do nowadays. What they did in the pass they gave Hybrid-Classes a reason WHY they should be in a Raid and thats why they had Utilities.  
---
Sp-Priest: ManaReg  
---
Enhancer: TotemTwisting(effected Groups only) + Ap-Bonus on Crit for the Group + BloodThirster (effected Groups only) + ShamaRage for more Totemwisting  
---
Ele: Totem with Hit and Crit (effected Groups only) + BloodThrister (effected Groups only).  
---
Boomkin: 5% Crit and 3% Hit  
---
Feral: 5% Crit  
---
Slam-Warrior: 4% Melee-Damage increase  
---
Thats the reason why TBC is the BEST expansion. Because you had so many utilities and they were unique that you had to get specific Classes to a raid and make also a prob. Raid-Setup today its jsut all about the DPS and which class can soak/ignore most mechanics
---
Bfa was a good launch. Try WoD lol...
---
Dude people in this community are so fucking dumb that they honestly considered that a game from 2004 would take 5 years to re-release.
---
To those who ever though that was even possible (plus the autistic shitting on everyone who pointed out that it was the dumbest shit ever) are the maximum retards of the community. Same dumb shits who are saying it gets canceled if they don't get weekly updates from blizz
---
It was not about the Shocks and Dps they did... It was about the Utilities they had compared to Vanilla. You were the totemtwisting machine and didn't use shocks at early tiers because of Mana-issues. So you jsut twisted those totems all raid long. Warrior, Rogue DPS &gt; Enhancer DPS
---
Blessed to have been there but largely feeling cursed because WoW Classic is only faux vanilla instead of just bringing back the old software.
---
I'd honestly rather have a proper tested december release than a hastily tested summer release
---
Also makes it extra nice to buff a stranger you walk past if that stranger knows you gave them something other than just mana. Builds good community feels.
---
I had a rogue alt on a PvP server. Once I got to a higher level, I had countless hours of fun messing with lowbies. Outright ganking lost it's appeal pretty quick, I liked finding an exposed healer class and slapping them with garrote when they're fighting a mob. Just stand back and watch them struggle. Things like that.
---
Blessed for sure.
---
I managed to hit 60 in vanilla and did few of the end game stuff, but I was busy in school and I wanted to do more in vanilla.
---
Going to PvP a lot and do raids up until AQ40 I think, not sure if I have the time for Naxxramas but will see.
---
A lot of my friends from my teenage days are going to play as well, many people who gave up gaming years ago. They are all returning just to play WoW Classic once again and it's kinda cool.
---
Obviously don't expect anyone to put in nearly the same amount of time as before, but you can have a lot of fun in Vanilla even on limited time.
---
The basic rule is that blizzard is safer, but AE is better DPS and also instant, but costs more mana. It will have its uses.
---
It's the best gun for hunters in the game. There's a better naxx bow and a couple better xbows, but if you're determined on using guns then that's the one.
---
AQ40 loot is only poor for hunters since the set's a very minimal upgrade (mostly some +spell and minimal agility, but way poorer set bonuses) and for drops there's quite few nice ones. No ranged weapons (considering u got Ashjre'thul, else there's Larvae, still inferior, tho), armor drops being not that great...
---
Other classes do get quite a bit. Especially offspecs. 
---
Whenever I transmuted \[primal might\] for randoms, I wouldn't accept their party invite so they wouldn't know if duplicates were created or not. Then I'd keep them all for myself. I had absolutely no use for them either. I'd just hoard them. 
---
Amazing work! They speak to anyone who's a fan of WoW!
---
&gt; our generation was the first generation to adopt the pc gaming culture.
---
What is that even supposed to mean.
---
&gt; WoW was the first of its kind
---
Not by a long shot.
---
&gt; do owPvP raids, protect your leveling guildmates, \[...\], do battlegrounds,\[...\] 
---
All of this gets better if ur gear is top-notch, and that requires raiding. Consumable farming is enhanced as well depending on your method (gold grinding gets better). 
---
This is the issue, and it permeates to offspecs which will struggle gearing making it worse. 
---
Holy cow these are awesome. I can hear the soundtrack in my head for the zone right now.
---
I think it was wotlk when you were able to mind Control Ganon and he had this ability where you were able to kick people around. It stopped all casting so naturally I kicked the people crafting stuff. They all got pretty mad and instantly killed him when the MC got off. 
---
Of course I did what everyone in my position would do and MC him after he respawned only to kick them again. 
---
Loatheb between your heals due to the boss mechanics.
---
If we are playing the "what they didn't say" game... They also didn't say it wouldn't be out before summer. April release confirmed! /s
---
Seriously. I would like separate servers for the expansions as well. I'd play different toons on each and enjoy the different experiences.
---
Whow, this is so beautiful!
---
Just branch off into a new wow. New expac in the vein of classic. New, gigantic landmass with no flying mounts, and Vanilla style leveling and dungeons. 
---
Trying to make people really paranoid about getting ganked was great fun.
---
Someone didn't try to level with warmode on.
---
wow, you dont have a sense of humor... you know druids cant use swords right?
---
They were blessed, on private servers it just sux. For example on a new TBC private server there were guilds with all the content cleared in less then 2 weeks. The game is too much old and you will never feel the beauty of being a noob with others again. Also Activision/Blizzard is not going to take that back again in future expansions. So you can play only old content with experienced players, which is far away from the original experience.
---
Boy, you used to be one hell of a top-notch rogue!
---
I mean, two of you versus one AFK'er. The balls to even try that! Good thing you chose to be a rogue; who knows what those AFKers might otherwise have done to you.
---
Thanks for reminding me of the type of players that drove me to playing on PvE servers only.
---
Do you have Etsy?
---
If I could get to their first level support, at least. Most of the time the ticket submission system wouldn't even boot up properly.
---
ahahaha :D
---
it's called r/wowservers
---
I never thought about how much I loved showtooltip until now. I never thought I wouldn't have it again either. :(
---
I'd  sap people on their way to a boat that was about to leave. 
---
You say no, but then basically agree with my definition?
---
yes i want
---
Wouldn't mind that, tbh. Summer's not the ideal time to spend 12 hours behind mouse &amp; keyboard, when it's 30 degrees (c)
---
In vanilla i played a mage and whenever i ran scholo i would stand on the little bridge just inside the instance, peer down below and wand one of the mobs.  
---
Most of the time the group wouldn't even notice anything out of the ordinary until 200 skeletons, ghouls and zombies came and annihilated us.  
---
It got mad lulz from the group every time.
---
True, but even then, imagine working your ass of to get Sharpened Silithid Femur only to replace it with MSA almost immediately, that kinda thing. I feel like the gear progression could have been smoother for a lot of classes. 
---
From what I've experienced on private servers, guilds tend to burn out horribly in AQ40 if they aren't clearing it within a month or two.
---
y u mad tho
---
Maybe think about your professions then. Herbalism could be good. Priests aren't all that bad soloers really tho. I can remember a priest on my server would have 2k smite crits. This could of been near the end of vanilla and i'm not sure if that was with power infusion but either way it was still nuts
---
that sounds pretty awesome
---
That's the perfect time to be indoors.

A true legend among 3 minute mages.
---
Go under stormwind to the edge of the platform. Falling mean falling till you die of fatique. Aim to EPL for a 3 hour fall.
---
/who 25, invite for free stockade boost. Summon him and let him fall. Waste his entire day.
---
Using typhoon to knock AFK people off their flying mounts was endless fun.
---
Was Wotlk, the daze would demount people and you could drop combat and go back into flight form before you hit the ground.
---
While FOL spam is most of your raid, its not the only thing you do. We do have example in AQ stun rotations on palas and you should hover your finger on that BoP button pretty much on each pull. Your own bubble actually gives you permission to sometimes completely ignore boss mechanics. 
---
And that can result in funny deaths... sitting in some sit, thinking np ill just bubble and keep on healing. To notice you had 15 seconds on bubble cd.
---
A lot of classes dont bother with T2.5 at all. As a healer priest, pally... T2.5 isnt worth taking. On a pally... you dont use T1 or T2 either so...
---
I've had my ego reduced so much as when I first played against Boxer. I literally thought I was one of the best SC players in the world. I got so raped by Boxer my ass bled for a week. It's truly staggering to watch someone play like that. One of my most valued moments in my life.
---
I enjoyed it but it didn't fuck my life up like a lot of people. I'm not trying to relive some nostalgic content. It's a good game thatl be fun to replay.
---
So, blessed.
---
Never used it, but from the description it sounds terrible.
---
What we did as paladins in most naxx fights was:
---
1) Each pally select a number from 1 to 5. 
---
2) Set (CT-raid?) emergency monitor to display 5 players with least hps in group or raid
---
3) Set a macro to cast FoL on the assigned number and spam it via keyboard auto
---
Blessed, best time of my life!
---
Best content I've seen on reddit ever. Great job. 
---
It's Brill-iant.
---
^(Sorry, I know where the door is.)
---
But aint this exactly a corrupted system, you have DKP but when something big drops you dont use DKP but instead give it to your friend. 
---
Im a fond advocate for loot-council. It is the most efficient way of distributing loot. If your LC is corrupt, and you only give drops to the loot-council members and few of their friends, you will be without raiders in no time. Vanilla is pretty good at self governing itself.
---
In my pserv guild, we have class officers who pretty much worry about the loot, they should know their class members and their gear. On top of that, healer classes chat with each other about the items, and decide on what classes get first dibs on what, same with caster dd's and melee dd's and so on.
---
Bad loot-council will fail fast. Still, usually it is the officers/LC members that are the eldest and most likely people to stay in the guild through hard times, that is why they are usually pretty high in the list for big and rare items.
---
Well, I thought the stability and quality of the launch was being discussed. I don't think any other expansion experienced the utter chaos WoD brought.
---
I spent the entirety of my highschool years camping in hellfire peninsula between BG queues and rep grinding breaks on Magtheridon.  Lots of forum posts complaining but it was, for me, just something to do.
---
It varies. When I was younger WoW consumed my life in many aspects. I got worse grades and did less for school, logged on straight after school and chatted with friends while grinding xp well into the night. My relationship suffered at the time and I made some bad choices. But hey! I learned SO much from these choices, my relationship at the time was bad and would not have worked in the long run anyway, I still meet my friends and we are closer than any group of adult friends I have heard of, and my lower grades in HS and lower Uni don't matter vs. communication skills, english, typing speed, team spirit and the will to put in effort in what you're passionate about ( all skills practiced via gaming )  Sure my parents were mad as hell, who wouldn't be. But I have come so far and learned so much about video game addiction and time management from my past. Do I feel like playing classic is a bad idea, yes. Do I feel like some of my relatives will disapprove and nag me about it, yes.
---
But I feel (and hope) I will be able to play classic like a responsible adult and enjoy it immensely at my own speed. And that is the only thing that matters.
---
That site gave me cancer.
---
Perfectly captured the haunted spooky vibes of the zone. Masterful work
---
those are pretty cool!
---
what pollin said. sc2 not dead in anyway. it actually is on the upswing. there is content pretty much every day. (i watch it on twitch daily) there are still enough tournaments. and it get very good viewer numbers.
---
Excited, I was 16-17 around the launch of WoW and I was a keyboard turning scrub who was terrible at the game. Now I'm 30, know what I'm doing and am looking forward to properly experiencing the content and pvp with friends and my brother. Can't wait.

Priest t2 is good, 3/3 is op, 8/8 is good, even wanted for a few priests per raid.
---
Amazing work. I think Brill and Magistrate are my favorites!
---
I would say druid - all specs.
---
Restodruids were terribad in vanilla. Yes they could heal but they were the worst of the healers. Yet only brought 1-2 druids and only to not waste the gear.
---
Feral and balance was not viable for anything really. Not raiding, not pvp.
---
You could tank dungeons but since your gear was worse than a raidinggeared tank, it was still not great.
---
In TBC all of that changed. Resto was suddenly an amazing healing spec both in pvp and pve. You didn't always top the meters but it was a close call. And fights like Muru you destroyed everyone else. In pvp you were a god.
---
I raided big parts of sunwell as balance. We were not at top spec but we were viable. Same with feral.
---
Vanilla and TBC is like light and day for druids.
---
These paintings are beyond awesome holy shite. Great work!!
---
Resto druids were not that viable in vanilla either. The worst of the healers and only 2-3 were allowed in most raids.
---
So I agree! Druids changed the most
---
Interesting. Ty
---
Looks like they laid off one CM from each game, and while I can't know for sure what their exact criteria was, Bornakk has worked for Blizzard since 2006 (at least), giving him some level of seniority on the WoW CM team. I'm guessing.
---
Also whispering your class officer after every item that drops will net you a lot less..
---
yup. if they cant get it right (which is not that hard objectively) i will look for a long living private server and never look back.
---
Yeah. That's why I love ZG a lot. 20 is a good raid size even for vanilla.
---
These are amazing dude. You captured the spirit of the area perfectly. Fucking well done!
---
Im really excited, i even went so far as to try out a private server to see if its how i remembered.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Im only 8 hours played and ive grouped more times for quests and had more human interaction than the entirety of BFA.  In stormwind i see dungeon LFM spams for all level ranges.  I am literally dying waiting for classic, i really hope they dont fuck it up.
---
They weren't fired, they were laid off. 
---
In the US, if you rehire for a position someone was laid off from, you must either wait a minimum of 6 months; or you must offer the position to the former employee at the same rate or better than before. If not, you get a giant fine.
---
I mean, you dont make 25m a year being a nice person. 
---
Planning to run a Mage to 60 with Enchanting/Tailoring at first. I plan to have tailoring for a while, get my BoP robe and level enchanting with it, then have been thinking about a swap to Alchemy to make consumables for raiding. Is this reasonable? Should I get Herb/Alch if I'm going to go that route? Should I just stick with tailoring?
---
Amazing!  I'm saving this post for possible future commission inquiries when I build out my office in a couple of months.
---
Grrrr, capitalism is bad!
---
Your right tho. 
---
Are they even doing a blizzcon this year? I know it’s the norm now to have one annually even when there is little to announce but I feel like after last year they would consider going back to the old schedule.
---
As a diehard undead fan, I absolutely love this. Keep it up!
---
People are so stupid it's almost annoying now. Can people being this nervous about classic WoW just remove yourself until the next announcement?
---
Classic WoW is not a major title, it was never portrayed as a major title. Inside Activision Blizzard it's portrayed almost like an DLC to retail, hence the reason your retail sub transfer directly over to classic WoW. When they speak of "frontline releases" they are talking about new games that are meant to be the poster childs of Blizzard, like Overwatch.
---
It's funny to see a part of the WoW community complain about Blizzard not communicating with its audience, but you can't even take the time to read posts from your own equals that explains why "frontline releases" is not even related to classic WoW. **Classic WoW is an EXTENSION of retail WoW**, okay? Good
---
Running into someone you recognize is the best feeling. That's what makes this the world of warcraft and not the 1 day pass Disney world warcraft , with thousands of people you somt know phasing in and out every day.
---
A similar feeling of recognizing a friend can ever go for enemy faction too.. when you see that horde player grinding kind of near you in stv but you're both minding each others business and low health and /not at each other. Then you run into each other again later on and you remember something specific about them, their name, their funny hair color whatever. Make yourself a little horde buddy. You can even find an alliance same faction player steal your quest mobs and you can sic your new horde friend on him with a well placed /point/nod lmao
---
Man... screw sharding. Screw the barbershop, even Lol. Screw transmogging. 
---
What makes the axe hit any less hard? 
---
Mission accomplished, Bob.
---
Typically..."twink" toons will aim for X9 and then enter that bracket of battlegrounds. It's not really something you do in the open world.
---
Since BGs won't be available for a few months after launch, your PvP will be limited to world sure, but BGs may be out by the time you get your alt twinks to your desired level.
---
And by THAT time, your server will have alot of 60s, which will just be called in for help if you're spotted in the open world trying to snipe some HKs with your twink alts. Like...if you're thinking about just camping Nessingwarys in STV (just as an example), be prepared for resistance fairly quickly from higher levels.
---
Yeah but the chest won't respawn if he does that, that's the main harm done. The respawn timer starts whenever someone loots it empty.
---
If you intend to raid casually you should consider a class that has a chance to be picked for a pug no? I'd rule out feral and prot warrior at least cause this seems like the kind of spot you'll secure only with 100% attendance. Mage are boring, one button spamming 90% of the time, same for warlock except you may need to just stop and do nothing cause of threat, depending on your faction and tank. Dps warriors and rogues are more engaging in raids, but they are very popular so raiding and gearing up may be difficult. If you're gonna play alone and have inconsistent attendance, a healer would be a good choice. I think shamans are engaging in raid, and so are priests. And they both have a PvP spec that can destroy people without being very good. 
---
when it comes to priests, while *rogues* do hurt, warriors just get rage starved when they try knocking on your bubble, then slowly die.
---
Once I took pity on Gamon and ~~kite~~took him on a ballad through the wild. I couldn't reach Desolace, but it was all about the journey. He was still part of a  class quest at the time.
---
Grey items could still be valuable. I always left the 1s herb
---
No joke, fuck Tim Cook. Genius at logistics, shit CEO.
---
Are Blizzard fans not the public, and is that not who we are talking about being put off?
---
I know but it wouldn't piss me off much personally. I'd be like "what an ass" then go my way lol.
---
I in my youth I would somtimes kite the exploding voidwalkers in the void ridge of hellfire peninsula in large groups to horde trying to quest after just getting through the dark portal there and blow them up. It was a pve server so they couldn't retaliate.
---
They make really accessible, casual, polished games that get boring after a week.
---
I inflated the cost of cloth by buying everything and reselling at a higher price.
---
My windows installation mysteriously vanished 2 days into it.

Use my rogue, follow a low level alliance in westfall on the Deadmines quest, right as the long walk almost ends, shoot the NPC with a bow.  /smile and vanish.  Repeat
---
Poor itemisation of some endgame tier sets
---
Major unfinished questlines - eg. Missing diplomat
---
Major unfinished zones - eg. Azshara

Teased content that wasn't added - Hyjal, CoT, Furlbog stronghold in Azshara, Grim Batol
---
Maybe I wasn't clear enough but let's say the hunter has no chance of getting Ashjre'thul because he's 3rd+ in line and it hasn't dropped yet.
---
You have played against a god sir, should be proud.
---
Before Iccup there was a server called gamei in korea and after that wgtour. Sometimes you could encounter pros and semi-pros there. It was a good way to get back to reality for sure :) 
---
You might have misunderstood me, but that was kind of what i'm saying. In the guidance they might mention IP's but they generally won't go into details. 
---
Why mention being a mage? 
---
Well both of it but for other reasons. Ofc it was and still is the best ive ever played.. but also i was so addicted to it that it basicly changed the way my career (and my life in general) went. I didnt care for anything else really and droped some very nice job and qualification opertunities back in 2005 when i was 19 years old and instead picked something that was close to my home so i could be back playing asap even if payment and career chances were pretty bad. But i made some very good friends trough wow and we started to visit each other a couple of times a year to hang out and party . We still do so today sometimes.. but the way is much shorter now as i moved there found myself a better job and also the most important, married the girl i met here first in 2012 on one of my visits... So i guess it was worth it all in the end.. but i still sometimes think about how something like a game totaly took control over my decision making for years.. gladly wow went to Shit after cataclysm and i stoped playing and could fix some stuff IRL especially work wise . That said i feel pretty settled now and cant wait to relive the classic experience from back in the day with a more mature mindset and clear goals..... And less time... Alot of less time .. 
---
He's a regular on a blizzard podcast called the instance.
---
Itemization =/= engame gearing. You can also get gear while leveling.
---
Mmmmm Abrahamm Lincoln..
---
Yes, gearing up makes those easier, which is so many people raid, even if they dont enjoy it. But you don't have to raid with the same spec and role you do pvp with. 
---
its a 15 year old game, nothing new or major about it
---
You do need peel and dispels from your team. Against poly you can use a Skull, or a potion of fervor I guess. Against fear, you could use reflector or mithril insigna. 
---
&gt; Just branch off into a new wow. New expac in the vein of classic. New, gigantic landmass with no flying mounts, and Vanilla style leveling and dungeons. 
---
I would love this to death. But can you imagine how it would make the retail developers feel to see millions migrating to the alternate timeline version of WoW because of how badly your team screwed up the game? Wooooow.... that would be... crushingly demoralizing.
---
And not give your main tank or potential other melee windfury?
---
That's a hard pass.
---
Very nice my friend! As someone who is making an undead rogue and warlock. This made me very happy.
---
I've spent hours looking for one of this round face guy with a side part doing a apple add parody maybe.. its this guy talking about his warlock.
---
Few key quotes from the video..
---
He begins with: "I.. i dont get out much"
---
"Off with your robes elvish girl" 
---
*rl orc warlock costume holding a shoulder mount camcorder.*
---
"Im paying 2g an hour.. to talk with this girl whos probably a guy.. and i dont care.. cause its turning me on"
---
"I chop you in half with spell dmg mother.. fk..er"
---
I swear to God if anyone can find this video i will be forever in your  debt!!
---
Worst part of it is in 2005 I had no clue how good we had it. I was picky because I was convinced WoW vanilla would merely be the first step towards better, more open, RPG-y and interactive MMORPGs.
---
I shot for the sky and ended up about as low as the parking lot.
---
Im glad you guys are twinking for world pvp. So that i can chew your asses with my lvl60 main
---
I'm actually in support of this, but this sub isnt the place for this. Rule 1, had to relate to classic 
---
Wow bruh, calm yo teets.
---
This article basically nails everything on the head perfectly.
---
Except on PvP templating (sort of). It makes things more skill than gear based, which is good. Not that destroying noobs isn't fun or anything
---
OOh, so much for you to even understand...
---
These are all fucking amazing my dude.
---
They haven't been able to deliver a polished timely release in years, what are you smoking?
---
Yes and no, I suppose that you could say a tiny slice of the public cares. But for the general public this will not be even a blip, if they even hear about it.
---
in 3v3, there were a lot of RMP tears back then when faced with hunter - warlock - priest.
---
"oh, you almost managed to kill one of use while throwing CCs around? that's nice. by the way, two of you are out of mana and have pets following you, just to ensure you won't do anything as foolish as drink or evocate."
---
holy paladin + arms warrior was a nice combo in 2v2 and could go to high ratings easily... until it met something like UA lock + spriest. played it from both sides (BE holy pally alt, troll spriest main), and holy shit, that *thing* was like anti-attrition personified, it cut through most warrior + healer combos like no tomorrow.
---
fun times.
---
That's absolutely cool
---
I played classic back then, but I also played vanilla private servers in 2008 and 2013-2016 and I'm very much looking forward to play classic again.
---
It wont be exactly the same feeling as it was back then, but it will be a different feeling and it will be good. 
---
There's a reason we have been playing on private servers for years. It's not just nostalgia. It's a far more superior game than retail has been for years.
---
in wotlk when dungeon finder first came out, people who joined a group in progress would spawn in on top of the party leader. so, while i was leveling a rogue and my friend a druid, i specifically remember in ST stealthing into bosses and letting new people aggro them and just say shit like ‘wtf why pull we arent rdy?’
---
similarly in ST, we’d hang out next to the giant hole that led to the big troll boss area, spawn people in, tell them to ‘hurry and jump down’ and watch as like 90% of the people would do it without hesitation. good times.
---
Yeah let's throw money at a guy that had a 6 dollar figure salary and was laid off with a year's worth of severance.
---
Oh my gosh it looks like they had some really cool people on. I'm going to be doing some deep searches trying to find episodes of these.
---
Excsquisite content.
---
Blessed. The whole industry is moving in the direction of casual cash shop games, real hardcore games are rare. The only other game from back in the day that I wish would relaunch is Planetside. Knowing I will never be able to play it again fucking hurts dude. :(
---
When you replay a game you once loved, you will be much more aware of its flaws. But you will also discover that older games did many things better than most modern games.
---
Playing WC3 before WoW released was far more important. People here don't understand the impact of the story of WC3 on why we were so eager to play WoW.
---
I first got into MMO's after playing Old School Runescape back in like 2007 or so. Played that for a year, then one day I was walking around the store with my mom and I saw a huge like "World of Warcraft Battle Chest" and I was like whoa, that is awesome, but I wasn't sure about what that game was. So I did some research, saved up my allowance for a few months and then I eventually bought the WoW base game. I got into WoW towards the end of Vanilla and I specifically remember telling myself, I will just stop at level 60 and play something else. 10 + years later, I am still playing the game. :D
---
I was playing Warcraft 3 back then. My friends told me about World of Warcraft and I thought it would be boring. I was thinking how boring it was to just control one character. Anyway I came home one day and my mom had bought WoW for me. I installed the game and the rest is history. This was in February 2005. 
---
In comparrison to lvl 30, mobs and players have more health at 36 and the axe still has the same stats 
---
Blizzard CM's make 6 figures? For posting on forums and interacting with a community? And playing videos games?  That can't be right...  But I agree with you on your point.
---
Did they take you to Abercrombie's F shack for a good time?
---
And Karazhan! :)
---
Blessed. Playing classic with about a group of 5-6 high school friends was the absolute best times of my life. We would all LAN almost every single weekend. Sneak in a couple beers or steal our parents liquor, smoke a little weed, and run a some dungeons. If I could go back to any point in my life and relive it, it would be the height of my Classic WOW experience.
---
Yeah I'm in the same case. As a shaman you can heal raid with 30/0/21 build which is also probably their best build in PvP. Hunters are good in PvP even with a PvE spec but if you're serious about PvP you'll want to respec often, and healers usually need less consumables in raid (although hunters don't need as much as other dps) so I could see shamans spending less gold overall. As a shaman you'll always be wanted by raids, however as a hunter if you get a spot you can probably gear a bit faster. 
---
I got burnt leveling a pala and a druid.
---
Although both were molto bene in tbc.
---
No hybrids for classic this time, no sir!
---
dude wheres my mount/

---
Here is a nearly everything and unfortunately the only WoW Radio episode I could find was the last one. It's mostly the works of TB but well TIL TB was on WoW radio alot!
---
You filthy animal!
---
And a happy new year too.
---
I mean that’s a good point but still.  The nature of classic wow talents was very customizable so I just don’t think it should be so much 
---
I asked this question in other threads, but haven't received an answer. Is it possible to do raid progression with the 30/0/21 build as a healer? Or you need to commit more to restoration? I want to PvP at the same time and the respec costs concern me.
---
oh yeah? what are you going with this time?
---
Perhaps you’re right but it’s only going to matter if Classic really is Classic and not some patched version of it. Still Activision is a tumor that needs to be cut off from the body. It’s already messing with the main game and even if Classic becomes a success it won’t be enough to keep WoW alive. Not if new players have to chose between an ancient game and a shitty new version of it. I hope it all works out.
---
paladin if you want to quint, easy to use, durable healer and priest if you want a wrecking ball who can fuck even the best laid plans up with two clicks.
---
[I've written a few posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aiy1dl/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_january_23_2019/eesigic/?context=3) on what mindfuckery [priest can get up to](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ao7ylz/how_to_use_each_class_to_troll_your_own_faction/efzecf7/?context=3), and it's still just the tip of the iceberg. if you want a varied playstyle and raging enemy players, go with priest. note, however: they are made out of wet paper and are generally primarily targets for anyone worth their salt.
---
you are talking about one fight in the game.  you dont get unlimited rage on other bosses
---
whats more important? making new games or having someone write you messages?
---
Ok, since I will probably play a hunter to 60 and raid a bit in MC and BWL and then probably get bored with the game again, I will be fine... I will stop just before the scaling really starts becoming noticable :D
---
I read somewhere that CM’s after the ActivisionBlizzard merger start off at $11/hr. Unless he made nearly $50/hr or salary equivalent to that there’s no way he was making 6 figures! If anything the man deserves a little help after putting his heart into a company and community for years and barely scratching by on his minimum income.
---
WoW also set me on a destructive path because it was so addicting. Looking back I can’t believe I was like that.
---
If anything I’d say both but more cursed than blessed to be honest.
---
Just these little bookends called the summer solstice and autumnal equinox.

Here's a few more pieces of the WoW radio puzzle.
---
I got my friend exited to play classic and he plans to play both so there is at least that
---
That's probably true, but my understanding is that we're discussing the Blizzard community and their reactions to what is going on. The general public probably doesn't know or care about what's happening, but the general public also probably didn't have the relationship that Blizzard fans had with the company in the past.
---
Rogue! :D
---
I've heard about Gamei from Day9 but I've never actually played on it. Clan X17 as well, but that's before my time :)
---
As far as I know he was the most active CM in the wow classic forum? 
---
Keep doing your part, I’ll do mine too and maybe after plenty of sweat, blood and tears we can keep the game alive for many years to come.
---
#teamactivision

Listen in on a fun group chat all about one of the more beloved instances in vanilla WoW – Scarlet Monastery.
---
Join Josh, Defcamp, Melderon and Orcbit as they reunite and talk all about why High Inquisitor Sally Whitemane and her loveable band of religious zealots are so much fun to go and visit time after time.
---
The episode also touches on Enhancement Shaman and The Four Horsemen, before finishing up with fan favourite segments Anger Management and Memory Lane.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Scarlet Monastery With Defcamp, Melderon &amp; Orcbit – 2:10
---
* Calling Countdown #2 – Enhancement Shaman With Sakuraba – 1:26:10
---
* Forum &amp; Fauna – The Four Horsemen – 1:41:35
---
* Anger Management – 2:10:35
---
* Memory Lane – 2:16:50
---
These are gorgeous. 
---
&gt; i think ironically its because Activision we get to play Classic
---
We may say that when it releases. For now, we are not sure if we will play Classic or "something that looks like Classic but in fact is not".
---
For example, there has still been no confirmation that we won't have wow tokens in classic, which is the most worrying aspect to me right now.
---
Amen
---
Ah I think I did find the highschool student. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
---
&gt; all of the content was designed to do with other players
---
The only content where you need other players are quests marked "GROUP" and 5-mans. Did you ever think about that? Why would the devs *specifically mark quests you need to group up for?* Use your head dog. It's because the entire rest of the 1-60 levelling experience can be done solo and is enjoyable. 
---
Westfall is so solo friendly its funny you chose that as an example. Boars, harvest watchers, gnolls, animals everywhere. And in your previous post you mention Elwyn Forest, also super solo friendly. 
---
The fact that you died a lot in those areas tells me you are a below average player. You're getting your ass whooped in beginner zones mate.
---
Also it shows me you are used to other MMOs where you can run freely and tank as many mobs at a time in your zone. 
---
Then you get to Classic and you say "woah this is so hard, I keep dying, surely it was meant for a group!"
---
So you die a lot and don't know how to solo quest, therefore you convince yourself game must be meant for groups so you don't have hurt feelings. Lol cmon mate. Surely you see the hilariousness of this.
---
By the way, is this your brothers or someone else's opinion? You have this so poorly thought out it feels like you are parroting someone else's opinion rather than thinking for yourself. 
---
This is exactly what I was looking for.  I do hate how priests can just be so easily tunneled, and vipersting gives me nightmares, but there’s so many fun things to do besides spamming freedom and heals.  
---
That’s fucking dope
---
Duuuuuuuuude...these are my favorite areas and you  captured everything about them! You're very talented! Also, if you did prints of the mill, I would totally buy it!
---
That would be ideal. But I’d expect plenty of people would want a full journey from vanilla-wotlk. 
---
So I could totally see blizzard releasing each xpac in order with the option to transfer and continue your journey or stick around at 60/70/80
---
How does it not relate to classic? Moron
---
First saw the game on the screen of the big brother of a friend of mine. This must have been like december 2006. He was dwarf hunter lvl 46 on his mount in booty bay. I saw it an fell instantly in love, i asked if we could watch him play and we did, later on my friend and i were able to play ourself, since his brother had to leave for sports or something. BOYwas it fun just to do thing ourself with none elling us wehre to go, so i got home aked my mom if i could buy it, she asked me how i would pay the subscription and my dad told me our internet speed wasnt enough to let him work and me play. So after a year of begging behaving like the best child ever und all those things, i finally got it to christmas 2007. The battlechest with TBC in it. My first toon was a NE rouge, which i played with a warrior i met in darkshore, till 30ish, the swapped to a huntard which was my main till bfa.   
---
Im so damn excited for classic, playing the game in the original stat will be great, i was always jealous that i coudlnt really expierience it all. Classic content is "less" than modern wow but since u "only" have raids an pvp u can really focus on those. You dont have 354651646 Factions to get exalted, dont have 5654668 mounts to get, not 545654 titles to get.
---
Im german so apoligies for the grammar and spelling.
---
Don't forget a lot of consumers are actually investors, most of them not directly, but for example through retirement funds and / or other financial products. And they will complain if their retirement fund is growing fast enough for example. 
---
Yeah I remeber a similar mistake I did. I had played Vanilla pretty intensely since the beta started, and about 6 months after release I said to a friend: "I'm so tired of WoW, it feels pretty undeveloped. I'm leaving for a game that has been out a while", and left for Lineage II. Needless to say, I was back to WoW within 2 months.
---
Delays are a thing
---
As hyped as I am for Classic, I will take a break when Cyberpunk hits. I mean it's a CD Project Red game. It's like a Blizzard game from the past: You buy it without questions.
---
Yeah lets do it
---
He didn't make 6 figures as a CM, I dunno where you're getting that. I also haven't seen any numbers on how big their severance package was, and considering you pulled 6 figures out of your ass I'll assume you pulled "a year's worth" out of there too.
---
Welcome to the part of capitalism where we, the lower class people volunteer our hard-earned money to help someone who was screwed over by wealthy executives who wouldn't even notice that person's salary as a rounding error.
---
&gt;from being basically the only game I played for almost half a decade
---
I feel you brother. I started playing when I was 8 years old, prior to that I only had experience playing PS1 and PS2 games. 
---
Vanilla WoW and Dragon Age Origins were such huge step ups in the quality of game I had come to expect.
---
Y'know something we gotta remember Halo 3 too, because this is around when the internet started to go through that awesome moment in it's history, in my opinion. What with all the halo and wow machinima at the time.
---
Man those were some darn good times.
---
I'm guessing you're going alliance... if you pick dwarf, even viper sting won't be such a problem, stoneform can easily take care of that.
---
no spaces in hunter pet names ?
---
It's Paladins, probably Prot then Ret. Druids became PvP gods as well in TBC
---
Can't remember, might have just named it Tiger
---
omg thank you for that.  it was PVP but auto correct changed it it
---
And a microtransaction of $15.
---
I'm from Argentina, in retail i have 200ms in pservers from here I have 15ms. I wish blizz put servers on LA :c
---
My favorite moments are a mixture of both TBC and Wrath. I absolutely loved the raids design of this era (except for ToC obviously), spending a whole night immersed in the cold walls of Black Temple or ICC was thrilling and I'll never forget my first KT, Archimonde, Illidan, Sartharion and Lich King HM kills that were just epic, I can still visualize everything that happened that night when I close my eyes like a movie engraved in my brain. I don't have this kind of fond memories for vanilla, I was younger but most importantly I did not feel as involved in raiding because I was forced to play a build I didn't enjoy and overall didn't have the best time, most memories are related to open world and pvp.
---
I really miss Wrath's class balance in both vanilla and TBC. I think late Wrath was the absolute best state of WoW regarding class design, especially for hybrid classes that were all viable, and the best skill ceiling regarding PvE rotations and PvP as well (for the classes I played, can't speak for all).
---
Now obviously not everything was perfect and Wrath introduced a lot of bad changes, especially I don't miss the dumb dungeons that started the whole "pack and AoE" LFG mentality compared to TBC heroics that were a piece of art and the best 5-man content to ever exist to this day. Wrath also had a ton of catch-up dungeons and the infamous ToC... All these little experiments of easier dungeons with catch-up gear, easier, PUG friendly, raids with different difficulties, led to the WoW we know now with LFG/LFR being so problematic.
---
Overall, if I could pick and craft my own, perfect, WoW xpac, I would definitely take TBC 5-man content, TBC-LK raids design, LK balance, throw as much gear personnalisation as possible with enchants, gems, reforges, vanilla PvP premades and gear (fuck arenas), no stacking 30 stupid consumables and world buffs to prepare before a raid. That would be my dream game. Obviously never gonna happen.
---
More of a blessing than curse.
---
However it'll have more curse to the mix if stuff like loot trading, sharding, progressive itemization, aren't addressed.
---
Please don't f*** it up Activision and Activision Blizzard.
---
hey, I've uploaded some of them (Mills too) over here: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/)
---
Wow you had to wait a whole year to play after seeing it!  Did you ever go back to your friends that year to watch him play more (or play when he wasn't there?)
---
Great  so... how does this post about supporting a guy who now streams who knows what relate to classic?? 
---
ooh that sounds very cool! :) I always do a couple of studies from screenshots before I start on a wow zone, helps a lot with getting used to the vivid-warcraft look. good luck!
---
Did you remember to make a rambling “I quit!” post on the official WoW forums?

thank you! :) as for the prints: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/the-haunted-mills/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/the-haunted-mills/)

Mind controlled people off of the bridge in Winterspring.
---
Mind Control emote chatting alliance lowbies, forcing them by threat to duel each other.  Killing the loser.  Watching them panic knowing they couldn't obey us except to log out.
---
Using mark of shame to create pandemonium in the barrens or other low zones.
---
"LFM &lt;instance&gt; summon available" and summon the people who joined into the bottom of the deepest well of water in Hyjal (having set this up by wall walking there with 3 members, a fourth in city chat to spam lfm.
---
Oh I played on a pvp server and had to learn how to look for pvp.
---
I used mind control cap on duels near the gurubashi arena to get people inside and killed them.
---
I "teached" guys from my own faction an "awesome jump" near the gurubashi arena that would put them in a spot that would tag them (bug) so I could kill them.
---
I used /concede when dueling people of the opposite faction in Tanaris so they would usually attack me by accident and get killed by guards.
---
Shadowmeld on my hunter so horde would attack the pet, thinking it was a mob.
---
Sneak into orgrimmar on my rogue to kill random tagged people near the bg area.
---
Played a gnome.
---
Killed orgrimmar auctioners just to piss people off (this was in TBC, with shadowstep). Then I would log into my horde char just to see them cry on trade chat.
---
Killed low hp dudes dueling outside orgrimmar between bg queues.
---
I would usually spend all day attacking xroads while waiting for gurubashi arena, killing all quest givers I could. Did this from level 40 or so.
---
I just realized I was a true dick lol.
---
Well it’s summer here now and it’ll be summer again around November so...

Kids who start off heirs to millionaires in no way impact the choices you make. Things like whether you chose to do well in high school or chose to slack off and get poor grades. Whether you went to college and studied a well paying major or chose to go into something that sounded easy. Did you get married right away (or worse, have kids out of wedlock), or wait until you were on solid footing to start a family? Did you move to a very expensive part of the country, or choose somewhere that was more affordable? 
---
All of those types of choices can determine whether you have a successful life or a struggle for survival, and no kid with a silver spoon in their mouth has any impact on how you choose to live your life. They just had the easier path.
---
How do you think content creators get started? By making videos. He’s trying to expand his brand. How is that a bad thing?

hey :) you can dl them in their original resolution on my AS portfolio: [https://www.artstation.com/dlikt](https://www.artstation.com/dlikt)
---
Haha nope. I always found those kind of posts pretty entertaining, but I've never been one for them myself. I've quit WoW numerous times since then, for various reasons. If I was to make a post every time I'd have little time over for anything else! 
---
I agree 100%. Having any political viewpoint besides "We don't hate people." linked to our community is a really bad decision. I think maybe a hat with a unique vanilla feature would be better. Or maybe even a wristband. Now what that would be is still a mystery to me.
---
I sure do and I plan to do all the zones over time. I'd love if ppl shared their ideas for specific moments in specific zones that'd they'd like to see painted: these were only my 'moments' that I felt strong about, but I'm sure others have a lot of ideas as well!

And by "We don't hate people." I mean we don't discriminate based on religion/sex/gender or anything. Because if you do you won't be playing the game very long!
---
Doesnt make it good in any way, just shows the system is broken.
---
will do, thank you! :)
---
If you really think activision was the reason classic is happening you are wrong. Classic isnt even worth mentioning to them in a earningscall, even when the subject was releases in 2019. Classic is only happening ptobably because we have been yelling at blizzard for over a decade now that there is serious demabd for it and blizzard probably begged activision to pour at least a little resources in to the project, even if its only 2.5 programmers. There is only COD and mobile on AVs mind and thats it!
---
Sorry to disappoint you but I think at this stage this tumor is unoperable
---
For a lot of the fear mechanics in raids you could pretty much predict them or see them being cast off. A good warrior tank would stance-dance for fear immunity and carry on regardless of faction, just from my point of view anyways we never really had too much issue but it's been a long time so I might have blocked the bad memories out XD
---
Oh my god, I never realized I wanted a print of the cauldron fields s bad before. WPL is beautiful!
---
Enhancement Shaman!!!!! Hell yeah!@!@!@!@!@! lets goooo! pummped to listen to this one.
---
Keep up the good work Josh, love when you get Melderon and bro onboard
---
It's more that people are acting as if this will damage blizzard in a real way, and it won't. If anything it is strengthening them by driving their stock price and company valuation higher. People may be angry at this moment, but in the end we will all be paying a sub for classic. 
---
They laid off some low level employees, apparently they are being quite good to them with severances and help finding other jobs too. Overall it sucks for those people, but business has to take care of the company first.
---
I'm about to make a Ironforge or Thunderbluff Painting - hopefully in a couple of weeks :) thank you for the kind words man!
---
Can't wait for STVietnam to become realised once again.
---
I'm actually so happy I didn't play Private Server Vanilla - It will make the return to classic all the more sweeter. 
---
I never was on the bad receiving end - since I was a druid - So i just stealth through every choke point - but i still remember that fear of "Someone could be watching me" - even in the most hidden corners of STV.
---
And Chat would never shut up about the ganking - constant complaining and begging for someone to help them.
---
thank you! in the works, yes! :)
---
I'm sorry you feel the need to call me a moron. Does this guy streaming and asking the classic community relate to classic?? Does he add anything more than being a former CM for blizz?
---
Thanks, they’re great guys and always great fun to have on the show! :)
---
I had one of the unarmored ivory raptor mounts on my mage, whenever someone would ask me how I got it I would tell them they had to have a bunch of random reputations to exalted and it would open up at the dark moon faire. 
---
We use "soft reserve" system for guild 20 mans and I've used it in pug MC's before.
---
Basically you make an excel spreadsheet and everyone writes down the one item they want to reserve next to their name
---
If an item drops then whoever reserved it gets that item. If multiple people reserved the item then they all roll for it. If no one reserved the item then it gets main spec rolled 
---
I'd think that content creators would get started by actively participating in discussion within the community they're looking to create content for.
---
I'd think that they'd like to produce something of quality, in a format that makes sense for what they're trying to convey.
---
What he did is the same as if I just posted a youtube link for a response rather than typing something out. It would just be low effort trash that the overwhelming majority have no interest in engaging with.
---
Whilst TBC &amp; WotLK were both awesome expansions and as much as I'd love to play them again, it'll be splitting the playerbase even further. What happens after WotLK? "Classic" Cataclysm servers &amp; onwards? No thanks.
---
With Classic, Blizzard has an oppurtunity to start fresh. Some time after Naxxramas, they should open a new "Classic" server, which builds upon the core that is Classic. No increased level caps, no flying, no LFG, minimal changes to talents &amp; spells. There's so much un-touched potential content. With Classic we're basically time-travelling anyway, so why not have an alternate time-line.
---
However the new server should not force people to transfer their characters off the Classic servers. Meaning, people would have the option to **copy** their Classic character to the new Classic "evolved" server. Whilst also keeping their original Classic characters on the "time-locked" Classic servers.
---
This way, there would be a maximum of 3 playerbases. Retail, Classic &amp; Classic evolved, which in my opinion is the best course of action. If we would follow the same path of Retail again, we'll come full circle &amp; all of the problems &amp; issues that are plaguing Retail would just be reiterated.
---
We will fight to the bitter end even if we have to search for alternative medicine. We won’t let Blizz die without a fight. Not like that.
---
&gt; Hopefully there is a lot of more casuals then the effective powergrind private servers.
---
I really hope so too, but I kinda doubt it. Casuals are a lot less likely to pay 15$ a month for a game that is supposed to attract old veterans.
---
did a few already yes, you can scroll tru my gallery here: [https://www.artstation.com/dlikt](https://www.artstation.com/dlikt)
---
(but I've only recently 'stepped up' my wow themed work a bit)
---
nope, but I have an inprnt store over here: [https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/](https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/)
---
I thought the worries that it was cancelled were dumb as shit. But there’s still a very ominous writing on the wall for Classic. We knew they were going for a less GM-support centric route, but with the number of layoffs, it means that right click report and loot trading will make it into the game, two systems that will be abused and turn the community into a cesspool rather than an ecosystem.
---
PERFECT! This has always been our battle cry!
---
We did not have much issues with it either, it happened once or twice as far as i can remember that someone fucked up while stance dancing. But on private servers as alliance I never once heard of stance dancing and heard often enough about fearward which was missed once on nefarian with not much trouble, we did not take a breath so it was not a big deal.
---
If you were fortunate enough to experience Vanilla then you are one of the lucky few.  Classic will not be Vanilla, because MMOs are less of a reflection on the gameplay and more an encapsulation of the culture at a given point and time.  
---
Classic will have streaming nonsense, instant report garbage, limited sharding, skewed graphic overhaul, and loot trading.  It will most importantly be a game played with hindsight, which destroys the very essence of "What's this?!".  YouTube guides galore, most poor.  
---
Classic may very well be a good game in its own right, but Vanilla was better, and anyone who never experienced it I am sorry you missed out, but Classic will not be what Vanilla was.
---
Pretty well. I was 10 years old and used to go to this gaming café next to the place my mom worked at during the summer. Was cheaper than a baby sitter and I spent all day there. I hit level 40 but didn’t have enough gold, so a lady that worked there traded me some and I bought a kodo for my Tauren. 
---
Good times.
---
For the record I started in TBC, but like around the start of its release. 
---
I was playing RPGs and RTS games basically constantly. Dabbled in Age of Empires, Age of  Mythology, and then a friend showed me WCIII. I was amazed by how that story and gameplay was. Got a bit bored of playing that and Halo over and over so I jumped into many free RPG games to switch the theme up.
---
Runescape, Fable, flash game RPGs, and many others were there to play but they didn't have a driving force to keep me playing, with Runescape being the most active of them all. However one day, a friend of my brother came over and showed us his WoW account and I was blown away by how cool it looked and sounded. He had some dungeon tier sets and things and I gave it a go. I wanted more, I needed more.
---
So being that kid who wanted it badly, I got a 10 day trial and since we had the recently new broadband service in Australia, it took six days to download. Four days of pure bliss, and I never regret any of my time playing.
---
I believe you are thinking of GMs at $11/hr, but I don't imagine CMs making that much either. I would imagine it's a 40-60k salary job. At least that seems to be the average salary of CMs across industries. 
---
Live WoW makes less money from subscription fees than ever before, and it makes more money from transactions than ever before. It makes sense that they’re shrinking that department when their sub numbers are so low.
---
I’m not naive enough to think they would rehire more GMs and community managers if the community grew past 3 million again, but who knows, if the game grows in playerbase, it could happen.
---
You would be really bad at playing The Price Is Right. 
---
Do you know what turned druids into pvp gods?
---
classic will be a hit or miss for me. when i think about my greatest wow memories, it was because i was exploring this vast new world for the first time ever. i didn't know the abilities of every class and I didn't know much about the game in general. now after playing wow for over 10 years I know everything like the back of my hand.  i didn't play much in vanilla, but i'm worried that even tho vanilla was a much more enjoyable wow, some of the QoL we have now with the current wow may spoil the fun of classic. also not being a young teenager with no responsibilities is going to be huge. having to find time in between working, wife, newborn baby, it's going to be hard. none the less i'm excited for the chance to experience it all again. 
---
I think the answer here is to make some merch you like.
---
That was my EXACT thought when I first saw his picture, before I even knew who he was.
---
He looks like a sociopath who practised emotions in the mirror as a child to blend in. I would actually bet money he is one, because few people who rise that high in business are capable of genuine sympathy, empathy, etc.
---
**Sound interesting. But if it would be no Act-Blizzard, maybe we would still playing the best RPG ever...**
---
HL2 really was incredible in that department when it first released.
---
PvE realms give you serious blue balls.
---
The hat is fine already. It fits MAGA perfectly and the only people who get offended by them are NPCs, brainwashed by fake news who I wouldn’t want in my game anyway. Therefore no new branding is necessary, it’s going to attract the right type of person I want playing classic. 
---
Twinking for world PvP sounds fun, but unless you’re a stealth class you’ll just get stomped by 60’s.
---
If you’re set on it, I’d twink at level 39 for the BG experience.
---
Me, big bro, and cuz were blizz bois from a very young age. D1,D2, wc2, wc3, SC1, all amazing and the pinnacle of gaming.
---
Cuz got wow for Christmas the year it came out thinking it was wc4. Was at his house the day he installed, the long, arduous process. 
---
Made an orc shaman, proceeded to have mind blown. 
---
Me and bro got the game but didnt have internet on our computer until we begged dad for like 4 months. 
---
Bro made human pally, and I made Tauren Shaman on a shared account. Bro made it to mid 40s and quit because everyone told him ret sucked. 
---
Cuz played orc lock, me and him hit 60 on SenJin server and had some of the most incredible memories of my life. We cemented our bond as best buds.
---
He was a hustler and got into all the good guilds, and I rode his coat tails as a baddy. Will never forget him buying me my tier 1 bracers from the AH. RiP cuz much love.
---
TBC was incredible but I tarnished it for myself by account trading. Played every class at 70, but was committed to none.
---
We quit at wrath cuz game sucked and went back to playing wc3, becoming very good at 1v1s. Around MoP came back,  but always joining and quitting again cuz it sucked.
---
We always wanted vanilla back. Ty God for making this happen.
---
Go 39 and get pendulum of doom.  (Would also recommend you do enh shaman as opposed to warrior)
---
Well. Plus the free mana from heals thing. That was likely a bigger factor than itemization. 
---
It's Activision who are forcing shit like Loot Trading and Auto Muting/Kicking/Banning because they refuse to pay any support staff.
---
I can't see how Classic will be anything other than a hollow shell with such horribly detrimental systems. The saddest part is that they don't even need either of them.
---
Misclicked need? Next time don't be a moron.
---
Someone ninjad your drop? Tell the community and ignore them.
---
Someone is spamming? Ignore them.
---
GMs only need to be available for essential things like serious bugs, exploits, hacking, etc. They're not there because some dumbarse rolled on your loot, or because the nasty man said a mean word to you.
---
I had a buddy who worked for Blizzard (just a network dude), who knew I liked Warcraft 3. Gave me a friends and family beta code. I had never played an mmo before, lol, and was hooked. Played a paladin (shout out to those who remember holy strike from beta, or being able to cast turn undead on forsaken PC's). Joined a leveling guild (Ancoran Guard). Still remember how, met the guildmaster in redridge doing the elite quests.
---
Had a tight beta group (Ulrik druid, Yummi warrior, Alarr warrior, me (Erdrick) paladin, Shadylady (thief) and sometimes a guy named Consecrated (priest)). We played on Sargeras in retail (a server that used to have horde slightly outnumbering alliance). Outgrew our leveling guild, joined a guild named Tyr Invictus. We were semi progression, mc and bwl on farm, aq40 except got cthun, first few Naxx bosses.
---
Guild fell apart with BC though, like a lot of vanilla guilds did. I played horde pvp for a bit, then quit. Looking forward to coming back, seeing if any peeps from the old days are around.
---
The longer this sub exists, the more it starts to look like a cult.
---
I’m sorry to inform you.
---
It’s already dead.
---
I’m sorry for your loss.
---
Oh so many years ago my boyfriend (now husband) asked me to try Everquest. We both liked video games and Magic the Gathering and other nerdy stuff, but I had never heard of EQ before.  He described the game to me like this: "You run around and kill things and loot their corpses and gain experience points, so that you can run around and kill harder things and get better loot and more experience points". My first reaction was "that sounds really dumb . . ." But, within 1 play session I was hooked.   
---
I remember this ephinany moment we had together, grinding up characters in the City of Mist. They weren't our first characters and they weren't our last, but we had been playing the game for several months as kind of tourists. We were half way through the leveling process, the highest level we had ever been, and we were chatting about the game and we kinda had this aha! moment. I know it sounds weird, but it was like we suddenly really understood the game. How stats and gear mattered, that we should be min/maxing - we crossed that line from the casual player to the hardcore player.  
---
When we first heard about WoW, we were fairly content playing EQ, but my hubby loved WC3 and there were quality of life improvements said to be in WoW that were quite appealing such as actual quests and story line and no death penalty. There was something really appealing about starting a game right when it launched. We did the open beta to check it out and we instantly loved it, despite lots of server crashing and getting stuck crouching from looting. 
---
We spent the first few months trying out different classes, leveling to 20 or 30 each time and then trying something else. I was playing a paladin and my husband a mage and we were in Wetlands killing gators when we had a very similar discussion and cross-over from casual to hardcore. Blizzard was releasing fresh servers in a couple of weeks (from that moment), and so we rolled on Shadow Council, him a warrior, me a priest and with a couple of friends we built our first guild and raided MC, BWL and opened the AQ gates. It was a great time for gaming for us, but WoW really was like a second job. Work for 40 hours a week at a real job, then put in 60+ hours a week into WoW (not just raiding, but running/managing the guild).
---
I can’t ever reexperience a game for the first time. That’s just life. I can’t see it in a bad light at all, I enjoyed my time spent from Vanilla to Wrath and I hope to enjoy my time again.
---
My GF said she’d try it, so if she does, I can reexperience the game vicariously through her eyes :P
---
Not while the current people are still in charge.
---
They created CDPR as a passion project. They're not remotely comparable to publishers like current Activision and EA who blatantly have zero respect for their customers and will try and scam them of as much money as possible.
---
I think the threat of violence to take money or property is theft.
---
Southern hemisphere finally getting their dues
---
Gonna give it a listen
---
Yup.
---
There was a way to compensate by using 2 piece T5 (for the 20% arcane blast damage bonus) plus 4 piece T6 (via the new Sunwell T6.) That brought Mages back into the “competitive” range, but wasn’t easy to gear for, and required you to have a slot already to acquire said gear.
---
Those of us who quit during the BT lull, then tried to find a new guild for Sunwell had an uphill battle. 
---
2/3 is all you need unless you're raiding.
---
Yea I think this is more based on the system then specifically on Kotick himself
---
I heard about WoW before it came out because my best friend was always looking for the next great video game back then (he still is) and was a WCIII fan. I liked things to be realistic when I was a kid so I was more of am AOEIII fan. However WoW seemed pretty cool even to me, I especially remember seeing a preview of what Stormwind would look like on the Blizzard website before launch and I got pretty excited. 
---
I didn't start playing immediately at release though (I forget the reason, I think it had to do with the subscription), while several of my friends did. I would go to their houses and watch them play until one of them let me create a character on their account. I got it to level 10 or so, and then went immediately home and created my own account. Being more inclined towards realism, I of course created a human warrior (I even basically copied the name of one of my friend's characters but always denied it lol). This was all 2004 and early 2005. I joined a couple months after release in 2005.
---
I eventually got that character to 60, eventually made it Naxx, rank 10 and had a bunch of unique trinkets and other items. I quit right before BC because I was very upset that all my hard earned gear would become useless overnight. That character still exists as a level 64 (I played a little TBC much later) with all the original gear and stuff.
---
I was not aware that Blizzard stole from Sweden’s government.
---
In Wrath, a horde stole a mining node from a guildmate in Sholazar Basin.  I, on my priest, along with many others in the guild, flew out to address the situation.  We proceeded to Mind Control/CC this guy for like 40 minutes. 
---
Still surprised we never got banned/warned for griefing.
---
Absolutely excited about this! Of course I loved it from day 1, but I don't think I realized until many years later how good of a gaming experience it was. I love difficult games and I'm ready once again to play. 
---
That said...I think I'll be a lot better about time management this time around. 
---
That's the unfortunate trade-off of private company v public company. If Blizzard were independent and privately owned, game design philosophy might be stronger and more consistently applied. Yet they'd also lack the funding to make games on the scale they currently do, and could potentially not have afforded to take so long making certain games we love now. Can you imagine a smaller studio taking 10+ years to make Starcraft 2, Diablo 3?
---
Hunters are fine in PvP. It's PvE raid DPS where they fall off a cliff.
---
We'd need to know what classes you were playing to be able to give any accurate info.
---
Sigh... I own a little ATVI but I think gone are the days of D2, Classic WoW, all the great devs they had in the past. Just money grubbing AAA crap creators now. :/
---
This is pure evil genius, I love it
---
It was fun, fast and easy. 
---
I levelled with 2 friends from 26-60 back then and we’d be running into murloc and ogre camps just storming everything. 
---
XP was split on mobs but you would be getting it faster, and also completing quests really fast, you never had to wait too long to get into dungeons/elite quest. 
---
Its overall just the “right” way to level imo. 
---
It definitely felt like a more fast paced game. 
---
Works way more than it should, just use the walk command. Most people dont even think twice reading the mobs name.
---
Sorry I updated the original post, we're rolling Alliance and I was thinking of playing a warrior or rogue with him playing a priest or paladin. 
---
I love these!!! If you ever do any Tauren related ones, I might be overspending lol. The Mills one is just breathtaking
---
Go to the classic forums.  There are some real tinfoil hatters in there
---
I am going to put my vote for BM hunter(at least raid-wise) as that was what I played(in TBC).  In vanilla marks/survival was pretty much the only real spec because your pet was basically guaranteed to die in the first minute of any fight.  BM while great for leveling was a non-factor past that except maybe in PvP.
---
I believe at some point very early in TBC there was a patch that dramatically changed pet survival and BM became the premiere hunter spec outside 1 for survival talent proc.  Went from basically dumpster for all of vanilla raiding to being able to easily stay top 5(if not #1) in BT/Hyjal(boss only not aoe)/Sunwell fights. 
---
&gt; It's Activision who are forcing shit like Loot Trading and Auto Muting/Kicking/Banning because they refuse to pay any support staff.
---
Really overstating control here. Activision Blizzard is a holding company. It doesn't have an operations staff, and it doesn't make decisions like how many GMs to pay. It may tell Blizzard to cut costs, or order lay-offs. Where those things happen or how is typically going to be decided by Blizzard themselves. We maybe have to accept that Blizzard has changed, and it's not just being controlled directly by Activision. 
---
It is easy and fast if you stay focused. Because of the xp hit, use your group advantage to kill every mob you see on your way to and from quests. 
---
That sounds like  operator error 
---
At what point did blizzard ever mention making record profits? All you guys do is read a headline and start bitching and moaning. 
---
REVENUE IS NOT PROFIT
---
Honestly I don’t understand the fun with twinking.  It feels similar to just attacking lowbies.  
---
It’s fun and easy but it’s not always fast because of the xp penalty. Do all the group and elite quests. Grind on mobs everywhere you go. 
---
I first came in contact with wow reading about the beta in a video game magazine while in my early to mid teens. I was absolutly blown away by the epicness described in the article. I can still remember telling my parents about it and asking for permission to play it. The subscribtion model of course seemed strange to them, so i bought it in secret. 
---
I think it was the first monday after EU release when i started my first character: an Orc hunter. Not knowing what i was doing i spammed that autoshot hotkey. He made to to lvl ... four :D, before starting several new characters.
---
After many new starts my first more serious character was a nightelf rogue on EU-Nathrezim where I found a nice community. I think this was around the time the honor system was released and i was in my lvl 40s and fighting in tm-ss brawls with the big boys. Such epic moments :). I quit that character at lvl 48 after burning out. Understandable since i read in some forums that grinding was somewhat the best way to level. Not even buying food and just grinding away, regging life with /sit.
---
Then I took a longer break, returning when blizzard announced RP-PvP servers and i wanted to try that. I found a guild forming after the announcement of the servers and before their release. There(EU-Das Syndikat) i started a troll priest and made some friend there and had a great time, yet burning out again after grinding too much at lvl 48 again. After some time I continued that character to lvl 60 (grinding again :D). Then I joined a progress guild even though i was a bad noob and was too afraid to join dungeon groups. Of course that didnt work out and i stayed offline with that character until they kicked me.
---
Then i found a semi-RP more casual guild/raid coalition where i stayed for the rest of vanilla, rocking raids up to aq40 and bgs with them. Some of my best gaming experiences ever.
---
I also followed a friend to another server, leveling an human rogue to lvl 60 and farming AV to exalted, yet doing nothing more with that character.
---
I the recent past i played with my gf on the german classic privat server and now we're both looking forward to the offical classic release :)
---
Engineering guns are not important, but as with any class engineering is by far the best profession if you plan on doing any sort of PVP (and still the best if you want competitive PVE as well)
---
Hunters it helps out a little more even, because you can make ammo for yourself. Grenades and everything else just gives you a little more ability to protect yourself and create space compared to other classes as well.
---
If you want to use bows don't worry about it. Engineering won't really effect that.
---
&gt; Please tell me you are about to make a Ironforge or Thunderbluff Painting.
---
OP delivers
---
&gt; hopefully in a couple of weeks :)
---
Soon^TM
---
Blessed.  There has never been any kind of gaming experience I’ve had that comes close to original Vanilla WoW.  
---
I know it won’t be exactly the same, we obviously have been there, but I’m looking forward to new fun.   
---
This is exactly it.  Back when I played WoW, I had a vision of what the "next big thing" could be like, building off of what WoW had done.  It's never come though.
---
Whenever I find myself sorting through Steam, Google, etc., to try to find that next great addiction, I get a mild anxiety as I realize the best appears to already be behind me in terms of gaming.
---
It's absolutely maddening to me that we still don't have a modern day flagship game that was able to realize all the dreams we had back in 2004 when we first started to experience WoW.  Various games have touched on the concepts, but none have done it.
---
Keep in mind there were many patches in vanilla.  Classic and private servers are only showing the 1.12 snapshot.  Also even on private servers hunters are pretty strong in MC and okay-ish in BWL.  Add in people being bad and you were probably correct in your judgement.
---
&gt; Clan X17  was actually a channel on US east. Can't remember much, lol it was waaay too long ago hehe

Gonna be so much fun right click reporting you MAGA retards

&gt; Worst part of it is in 2005 I had no clue how good we had it. I was picky because I was convinced WoW vanilla would merely be the first step towards better, more open, RPG-y and interactive MMORPGs.
---
YES!  I still can't believe we're sitting here 15 years later and *no one* has been able to capitalize on the dreams that WoW gave us.  For all intents and purposes, the MMORPG genre is effectively dead.
---
Yeah it definitely helps in that regard.  If I went horde with my buddy, who’s most likely playing warrior, I’d def play priest, but we’re leaning alliance.  
---
We got ourselves an NPC here boys. I’ll cast a polymorph, should hold him for a while 
---
Group leveling is slightly slower than leveling solo, but much more engaging and fun. Basically the increased kill speed from any class synergy is outweighed by needing to travel twice the distance to obtain a given amount of xp since mobs are spread out. Doing kill quests faster is balanced out by doing collection quests with limited spawns slower, etc. Warrior/rogue + priest/paladin, regardless of which are chosen, is a great combo with a lot of synergy since warriors and rogues have limited self healing options and priest/paladin have relatively slow (but steady) kill speed that is boosted by the higher DPS warrior/rogue.
---
At this point the body is the tumor.
---
Retail players and Classic players are two entirely different players and Blizzard knows this. This makes 0 sense
---
Blessed. I’ve been playing north of dale the last few months and it’s been amazing.
---
I’m 31 now with a wife and intense full time job, living overseas and having experienced a lot since I quit WoW in ~2008. Those WoW years from 2005-2008 were great, but man was it ever an all-consuming game.
---
Now, I only play about five hours a week and don’t feel the urge to play more. Partly, I’m too busy. I have a 60 priest and the group I play with is really skilled, plus the game is so old now it’s just really well known how to beat it.
---
So the five hours I play per week are really fun, we get to accomplish a lot, and it doesn’t own my life. We killed C’Thun on the second week of AQ40. MC takes half an hour, BWL takes an hour.
---
In some ways I feel like an old guy with a stamp collecting hobby or something. It’s a nice feeling, and a nice game. I like it even better now than I did back in 2006, because now it’s part of a balanced life rather than a future prospects-killing obsession.
---
Now if I could figure out a way to get my wife to play...

&gt;The letter also promised “a comprehensive severance package,” continued health benefits, career coaching, and job placement assistance as well as profit-sharing bonuses for the previous year to those who are being laid off at Blizzard.
---
And as for his salary, it's the US we're talking about, the Golden State even. If you think he was making anywhere under 100k a year then you're a fool. But alas, I'll leave you to your naiveté.

If this man died today, I would literally burst out laughing. People like Bobby who only suck the life out of everyone, do not deserve life.

I just want that UI NOW! To look at while I’m workin

Amazing paintings my dude. Saved all of them. May I ask what brushes or brush pack you are using?
---
Baby steps can be taken that don't reduce identity or dramatically affect pvp (which would be the other main argument-- ret paladins doing 30% more damage would suddenly be a huge problem in BGs). 
---
As a random example I like to give out, Bdruids are pretty capped on what gear they're able to take. They really need hit, and are restricted.
---
If the 2nd last Bdruid talent, the 5pt talent that increases damage by 3% per point up to 15%, was 3% damage and 1% hit, granting a total of 15% damage and 5% hit, they'd be much freer to pick up more crit gear and finally shed the burden of being eternally restricted to Bloodvine.
---
You could even make their group buff 5% crit like in TBC. That wouldn't negatively impact their class identity, and it wouldn't dramatically increase their PVP strength.
---
It's not this "all or nothing" thing where any minor adjustments brings about a post-WOLK calamatous homogenization.
---
You don’t know how right you are.
---
I absolutely agree with everything u said.
---
I do beileve classic will be the same, because they simply..want to make money.Now i personally hate the current direction the company is going, that doesnt mean i wont play classic
---
Tremor totem? 'lmao'

Nowhere in that quote does it say a year's worth of severance. And the guy was a customer support employee. On what planet does a customer support employee make over 100k? Even in Cali? You have a seriously out of touch view of what these people are making.
---
A game is not capable of destroying a marriage. Individuals in the marriage destroy it by placing more importance on something else, be it a video game or some other hobby / passtime / distraction. Take some responsibility for your actions.

they laying off CM's and other administrative employees for more devs so they can make more games... This is fine. Companies are allowed to fire people.

I think having good times in the past is always a blessing, never a curse. It can hurt to lose something good, but you can still look back on it and relive it as many times as you want. Life has its ups and downs and you can't control that, but you can go anywhere in your own mind.
---
Amazing story. Thanks for taking the time to write. And I /bow to you, Scarab Lord!
---
Some of the worst implementations were done competently.  The GM knows what they're doing.
---
I'd buy that in a heartbeat
---
\&gt;  Activision saw the immeasurable lust for  classic content and wanted to capitilize on that.
---
I'm sure they'll just  leave it as that. 
---
I'm sure they think 'This game is making us enough money as is, we don't need any more'. 
---
I'm sure they won't decide three months in that a level boost is huge lucrative in a game where the journey to max level takes ages and has a high difficulty / inconvenience factor. 
---
My friend was convinced Classic would not be coming after the lay offs and the quote saying Blizzard would be focusing on new games.. I told him it is a major cash grab no matter which way you look at it and Blizzard will be able to use it as a way of showing that their subs for all of WoW increased exponentially. At this point Blizzard truly needs Classic's release more than we need it. 
---
The dead horse is so dead that even necromancy can't bring it back.
---
You listen to whatever you're told and don't even realize it. Poor bastard.
---
Because I don’t get offended at a hat? Riiight. Nice name calling by the way, goes well with your stellar argument. 
---
There are some great videos by Kargoz on YouTube that break down group leveling comps if you want to get granular with it. Overall it’s perfectly fine. 
---
If you can roll Warrior/Priest you are in an amazing spot. You always have your tank/healer for all dungeons and can make groups incredibly fast. On top of that you won’t compete at all for gear. 
---
Honestly though, just play whatever you want. 
---
They already said Summer. Just be patient for them to announce a specific date.
---
this game was made with "bring your friends" in mind. everything is better with a group
---
Oh god fuck off. It's been posted 7 times today already.
---
If it happens it will be separate, not a progression. They/we here have said this so. many. times.
---
This.  I did this all the time.  Missing the boat was a time drain and people would lose it 
---
Can we travel to that parallel/alternate universe where Blizzard never merged with Activision, and WoW evolved in a completely different way? I want to check that out.
---
Depends how you set it up. I had it set so it decayed a lot (something like 20%? It ended up being like 2 weeks worth of ep would be the cap, was a while back) every reset so the more you saved the more you lost. It made people roll for gear and not save up and allowed new or returning players to catch up on gear quicker without ruining their chances at good gear on later progression bosses.
---
GP also decayed so you wouldn't always lose to new players. 
---
By the same logic blizzard would stagger content patches in classic between content patches on retail which would be ridiculous. 
---
Certain servers are doing this already. 
---
That instance was hell to get to as alliance. 
---
That would be incredible. Great post, thank you for sharing about WOTLK. I have similar memories of TBC but I unfortunately didnt play wrath very much other than arenas-only actually haha. You are right about thats when the bad changes began creeping in.. I remember hearing about rogues having a self heal combo point finisher and that was the first time I was truly taken aback by a change and felt like Switch in the matrix.. "Not like this.. not like this..."
---
Lol you are so correct about the TBC 5-mans, those were incredible and I loved how they were all split across the world and made for good world pvp areas too around the dungeon entrances. Shame that flying mounts came in and sort of killed the feeling of the world and realistic long/dangerous travel through zones and all that.
---
Something I hope they do, if classic is a hit, is to keep some servers in vanilla forever (until the company shuts down), but also allow you to make a copy of your character and progress it up to a new classic TBC server. And then the same for WOTLK. And so on.
---
I think that would be amazing to be able to at any time go hop back on your old characters in a time capsule and play with other people who might be experiencing the expansion for the first time many years later. For instance since I never played Wrath, I could use my TBC character copy to start anew on a wrath server, and play with other people who are huge fans of wrath and want to relive the experience with some new folks too. They could eventually merge servers as the population dwindles, but always leave at least 1 server for each expansion open so you can go through them at your own pace, or go back to them at your own pace too. Truly "Timewalking" with what I feel is way less effort than what they did in retail with the whole re-working and re-tuning all dungeons stuff, cant imagine how hard that was versus just leaving a copy of existing content that has already been patched and perfected running. If it were a small server with only a few hundred on it and no GM intervention for loot, the costs would be minimal compared to developing new content and hosting servers with 10s of thousands and admins to help with the load balancing in the data centers and all that fun stuff. I bet there are a lot of different people across the wow player base that love different expansions bc they hold a special place in their heart. I feel like that alone would get them enough monthly subs to make this pay for itself easily.
---
I think it's possible but definitely not really appreciated. The enhancement talents are more welcomed for melee groups 
---
On the other hand, if it was old blizz, maybe they wouldn't need classic to boost sub numbers to begin with...
---
I didn't know that, I'm sorry.
---
oh shit sorry I didn't mean that literally. I just like the ring of it - no judgement towards your mother. I get rubbed the wrong way by people denying personhood/value to other people. Hence "NPC" bugs me and I had to be a prick to you for fun. Also cause I didn't sleep well last night. Nothing personal
---
Rogue is the obvious choice
---
I agree personally that both games are TOO different. I play Retail and private servers and will play Classic. I will continue to play and enjoy Retail aswell. This xpac isn't great in my opinion but the current raid is one of the best they've ever made, so I'm staying for now. Of course everyone enjoys different things in different ways.
---
The downvotes are expected but not warranted, in my opinion.
---
Blessed to have enjoyed one of the most wonderfully built games ever. I was a huge Diablo 2 and WC3 fan and WoW just built upon that with its huge immersize world.
---
It had negative consequences for college and socializing in general, but I don't regret those moments playing. I matured past WoW, but it will forever have a place in my heart.
---
It killed almost every future game for me. Just couldn't get into any of them.
---
Looking forward to playing Vanilla in a casual manner.
---
I dont think they will, because the retail players wont put up with that shit
---
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
---
If you lose half your player base but the other half spends enough money on micro-transactions, that's a great result for your first earnings call. That's what investors want to see, longevity be damned. 
---
Affirmative. Seems pretty badass.
---
Unless your hunters using a 45 green, its not an upgrade
---
#HAS THERE BEEN ANY RELEVANT NEWS LATELY?
---
"Still confirmed" Like... that's the least of what I'd hope for..?
---
1. Mage  
---
2. Hunter  
---
3. Rogue  
---
4. Druid  
---
These 4 classes are the best imo for solo pvp, good while lvling and at 60, perhaps druid a bit less so though at 60.
---
https://youtu.be/axUuI9p54hk
---
That's a huge benefit people don't realize when comparing private servers and Classic. Because Classic will be regional, there WILL be off-hours when you're more free to farm and resource collect.  Private mega servers with 5-10K players logged on at the same time, there is no off-hours. Its crowded 24/7
---
But it all depends on the playstyle. Do you prefer melee or ranged? If ranged then do you want to shoot with guns/bows or use spells? Do you like pets? Do you like mana or some other form of source? I think every class is good at killing people, some just require more investment and sense than others.
---
he said for world pvp
---
Holy mother of crap my guy, these are extremely well done. I can't help but remember a time when I was a teenager rolling as an undead warrior parading about the Glades. Thanks for the trip down memory lane!
---
Good to see that the same old classic wow attitude will be present. 
---
My statement was meant to convey the message that the need of the whole outweighs the need of the one. As a Rogue main I would give up Strikers to a hunter that needed the upgrade. 
---
Don't worry, it will hit the spot.  
---
Windows open, breeze blowing, Classic playing
---
30 definitely, ww rly stronk at that lvl  
---
and at 36 maybe u'll face 40's with mounts and final talent so fuck that imo, illu rod not a big deal
---
Back in the day. i was on my rogue, and i ( i took it from someone els ) made a macro that would " /emote Has just pickpocketed 20 silver of you ", or something like that. Players who believed it would totaly flipp, demanding i give them back the money i stole from players my own faction :P
---
Somewhat long. But I posted this yesterday. God I'm hyped. Especially after seeing the panel at blizzcon.

Lmaooooooooooooooooo I was the victim of this. When my guild had the first half of Uld on farm we would run Naxx pugs for our alts and someone pulled this and wiped a third of the raid, but we were cracking up in vent
---
Josh have you done an episode on priests yet? Been checking out your backlog and loving it!
---
Me too for my exasperation
---
The community and the economy are what bring me back to Classic time and time again.
---
I've been eyeing CB2077 since the initial release trailers and for a while was the only game i was looking forward to. But when I look at my game history I've put more hours into my character on a pserver than I have playing most open world RPGs. I put 40 hours into Witcher 3, similar with BoTW, and it seems to me that I like open world games but I really need that passive competitiveness of others in the world who are striving to get better and competing for items to retain my interest in a game. 
---
I think SM was the first "raid" environment you get to experience. Its almost like a mini Naxx, 4 wings.  
---
Its when a lot of classes move up in armor type also, leather &gt; Mail, Mail &gt; Plate. But I mean you can get an axe that makes you spin.....its amazing.
---
But Blizzard's people have been replaced with Activision's, from what I've seen.
---
Blizzard is dead.
---
That's only 30g/hour if they can do it as fast as hunters, which they can't. They'd also kill the bosses much slower. Their already low DPS is made even lower by having to face the boss to do damage and needing to conserve mana for self-heals.
---
hey, thanks a lot! :) I like to use some rough oil and charcoal textured brushes from Deharme's free brush set (I'm sure it's still up on deviantart)
---
He has a ton of insider info that he may be able to leak, either intentionally or inadvertently, especially if he gets drunk and livestreams it only to delete it later haha. In that way it seems relevant to me.
---
Even more so for BE Ret pallies. Alliance Ret kinda got the but end of the stick.
---
I watched Moneyball yesterday and the Athletics owner who accepts the trade of their best players for money really reminded me of this guy... 😂😂😂
---
I don't understand the context of the question &amp; answer there. Is he being sarcastic? This is a couple years after that great recession, so idk. The article feels all over the place without any context.
---
I love guitar hero though.
---
These look amazing! Great job!!! I’m not an artists but my wife is, so I can see the work really put into these! 
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again; there will be a huge number of people playing classic for a long time to come, undoubtedly more numbers than any pserver has ever pulled. All the nay-sayers with thier negative and toxic outburts can go back and stay playing thier pservers. Good riddance. 
---
Mouse over and add-ons were absolutely a thing in vanilla but we don't know what support they'll have as it's vanilla in new game engine, not the real vanilla engine. 
---
I'd assume there's support or healing 40 man's will be a nightmare.
---
Ban emily
---
They took away half of hunters ap (agi only gives 1 ap in TBC) as well
---
Next level immersion. 
---
To my knowledge, one finance person from Activision joined Blizzard's leadership. I don't know of any other people who "replaced" Blizzard's people. 
---
Just play the MASSIVE amount of new indie games out there. There is a lot of stuff to explore. Also, if you don't want to support blizz just play a private server.
---
Great story!  Yeah running a guild in vanilla was like a 2nd job.  With 40 man raids, you needed such a large guild to progress.  Fond memories though?  Mixed?
---
On the plus side for me, my deployment ends sometime in July, so if it gets delayed a tiny bit, I won't have to miss any of it!
---
I'm beating a dead horse, but focus on a good product or service &amp; the money will come. You may not have a biggest profit margin, but you'll have respect &amp; dignity to go with it. 
---
This sounds amazing! Im a Orc players since release so something that is related to that (Durotar, Ogrimmar, Barrens etc) is something I will be looking forward to.
---
Blessed: I have wanted classic servers since TBC came out. 
---
Cursed: Because i'm almost 29 now and if I don't get married soon I'll be bald then its dating on hard mode. 
---
Doing frost mage warrior now on pserver and it's really good.
---
You've taken some general assumptions about cost of living and California, and decided that means everyone in an office makes six figures. Here's some actual data on Community Manager pay in L.A.:
---
https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/los-angeles-community-manager-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IM508_KO12,29.htm
---
Median is 58k, and it peaks at 79k. 
---
I live where it gets over 50c. My ass stays indoors.
---
It 100% was intended, it says it right in the manual you got when you bought the game, the most gear dependent class. Pallys were meant to be the easiest, and they are. 
---
Priest - mind control them and make them kill themselves.  Far more sadistic and enjoyable.  
---
The overall quality of goods has deteriorated. Technology has progressed, sure, but a lot of the manufactured goods are of inferior quality. I worked at one of the biggest manufacturing companies in the states and I saw first hand how quality became less and less important over time. It’s like that everywhere.
---
It's fun, but the reality is that one person inevitably levels faster unless you have the same schedule, which is rare.
---
But they put AP on Agi gear, so they got it right back.
---
There were a ton of improvements to hunters in TBC that made them far superior to their Vanilla versions:
---
* Pets scaling (mentioned)
---
* Aspect of the Viper for longevity
---
* Steady Shot to have an actual spammable shot (this also helps offset the AP loss)
---
* Traps could be used in combat (meaning hunters quickly became viable CC)
---
* Tracking was changed so that neutral and friendly units show as yellow and green instead of red
---
* The 51-point talents were all amazing
---
It's running on the current engine, so almost assuredly very popular addons like grid and healbot will be transferred over, along with auctioneer, quest helper, threat meters, dps meters, atlasloot, etc.
---
Whether these will be available on release will depend on if they have a beta that the addon devs can get into. If they do, the bigger ones will likely be available; but if not you'll only have to wait a few weeks before they get ported over.
---
I had a good friend quit for that same reason.  Except it was the release of BWL.  All the time he spent in MC for gear that would get replaced - he never really got back into MMOs after that.
---
Extreemly viable. But imo a bad choice.
---
Leveling in classic is a huge part of the game and grouping not only trivialises it but also speeds it up, and I feel rushing the leveling is a mistake.
---
My biggest argument against leveling as a group is that one of the best things in Vanilla is community. By leveling as a group you shut yourself off from a big section of that, if not completely.
---
Don't get me wrong, everyone can level as they like ofc, thats one of the strengths of classic, and if you want to do it, then go for it.
---
Classic is forked from the Legion client, meaning you'll get add-ons with similar functionality to ones available in retail. Not every feature of course; add-ons that interact with achievements for example won't exist as achievements weren't in Vanilla. I'm pretty sure mouseover was a thing in Vanilla. Even though Clique wasn't made back then, the functionality to make it work already existed as there's a 1.12 version people use on pservers right now.
---
Honor system was fair but brutal. TBC arena was.. you either pick the correct class or you lose. Maybe you had an IRL friend who was a druid who would carry you but otherwise why would a druid play with an enhance instead of a warrior and get free 2k?
---
And you don't think that's indicative of Activision's influence of Blizzard policy?
---
Lots of people will say its not as fast as solo leveling. This isn't exactly true. You do get less exp per kill. However, you also eat/drink significantly less, kill faster, never struggle to kill groups of npc's, don't fear ganks as much, and time passes quicker when you're having fun with friends.
---
Here are my thoughts on solo PvP characters:
---
Warriors (arms spec) are king in groups but harder to pull off in solo content. For skilled players who are willing to put effort into mechanics (kiting, managing rage, stances) and aggressively take engagements.
---
Rogues can obviously jump on people easily and have decent burst damage. Great for beginners and advanced players alike.
---
Hunters can win any fight when they initiate, its harder if you get initiated on, but you have tools to avoid that. Also Hunters can get lazy because solo PvE is so easy with them. For skilled players who know how to kite, switch between melee/ranged and aspects etc.
---
Mages are as always just good as in any situation. They have very well-rounded abilities especially when tapping into the frost tree. Great for all kinds of players.
---
Priests (shadow) are absolute monsters in PvP. Their only weaknesses are counterspells/silences and the fact that they don't really have good tools to engage on someone. But their ability kit is brutal for PvP. For all kinds of players.
---
Paladins I have never really played and from my experience they seem weak in solo PvP except for the fact that they can survive long. For defensive players.
---
Shamans are a weird one. The two non-healer pvp specs you'll find are enh hoping for WF proccs and ele. Ele shamans are really strong after lvl 40 or so because they combine ranged burst with soft-cc and a wide variety of utility. Enh shamans always feel gimmicky to me. But shamans are more group oriented than solo oriented.
---
Warlocks are brutal in PvP in the right hands with one of their PvP pets out (Succubus/Felhunter). Actually going deep into demo with succubus should be a pretty versataile build for leveling and solo pvp.
---
Druids can win any fight vs. anyone, especially if they use the intricancies of the different stances to their advantage. They are pretty much the kings of solo leveling, even moreso than hunters, because they also find groups (for dungeons) super easily when they want to, since they can fill all 3 roles.
---
Get out of here you filthy casual
---
This chain of comments was removed because y'all can't keep it in your pants and have to rub your needle-dicks against one another as you fall all over yourselves to splooge politics in this post aka, Rule #5.
---
Yes, I recognize why this post can bring politics into it, but it's quite easy to see how ideas for new slogans or whatever could come around without going off the political deep-end/fighting.
---
Blizzard said at Blizzcon last year that the plan was to allow addons.
---
However they specified they wouldn't be using the old architecture and as such old addons wouldn't work.
---
They also said New addons would ALSO have to be limited in some way due to how advanced they are nowadays and how it could break the game.
---
The reality is we just don't know right now. That said I'd be very suprised if a raidframes addon of some sort wasn't available.
---
Very nice.  I remember the grind after 48 all to well.
---
Your entire idea is horrible, IMO. That Chris Metzen guy? Nope, can't post here. Other founders of WoW talking about how they did stuff when the game released? nope. John Staats and others talking about how and why they designed MC the way the did? only ex-employees. 
---
And those guys left decades ago, this guy was working with WoW YESTERDAY. 
---
Was overwatch not polished?  I played that near launch and the only issues I had were my shitty PC taking forever to load objects.
---
wow, I'll buy a canvas. seriously
---
If I had never played Classic, and I play it in Summer of 2019, I wouldn't feel the same magic I had when I was 12 and played Vanilla.
---
It would be an interesting and different experience if Classic was new for me, but it would be a *different* type of joy.
---
I prefer having the nostalgia rush and playing a WoW I actually like again.
---
They deserve it.
---
I already touched on Activision's influence on Blizzard. A single person filling a finance role doesn't really concern me overall. 
---
Fly to SS run north through on the left side of alterac and you’re basically there.  
---
I re-read your comment and have to apologize for misunderstanding what you said. I was pretty tired yesterday.
---
You should consider going horde if you want to focus on PvP and ganking.
---
Back in MoP, my rogue friend take the form of mobs in starting horde zones and then walk around like an NPC so low level players on autopilot would hit him without thinking while I flew above. 
---
Took around an hour for some max levels to come find us. That was when the real fun started usually and we could hold out for like 30 minutes to maybe an hour before enough people showed up to push us away.
---
if you want to kill people then warlock is always a great choice
---
if you are more focused on WPVP then maybe you should go rogue
---
you gotta swim through that lake right
---
It can be like that, but those guilds never last long, for obvious reasons.
---
Warrior shaman is actually slightly faster than solo grinding. Just focus on getting a high density area and you can kill mobs faster than an aoe mage (no downtime).
---
Paladin warrior, doesn't really increase kill speed, just survivability which isn't much of a concern at all when grinding in pairs.
---
Maybe I'm an optimist, but it **could** mean we get it **earlier** than summer, especially if they're adding more dev positions!  
---
^^blizz ^^pls ^^i ^^need ^^classic ^^now
---
A warrior with a pocket healer is a killing machine once you get whirlwind. Can easily pull 3 to 4 mobs and kill them faster than killing just 1 mob due to the increased rage generation.
---
The obvious focus of playing with 2-3 people is to kill that many more mobs.
---
The reduced downtime by not needing to rest makes up the difference under the assumption you can keep up the killing pace.
---
For me it would depend on how big of an upgrade it would be for the Warrior (if fury) or Rogue.  If it is a massive upgrade, give it to one of the OP dps classes over the Hunter (I would say this even if I was the hunter and the gun was going to me).
---
Aw c'mon that was helping me procrastinate! Fair enough though. God speed good sir SoupaSoka
---
"Comprehensive severance package" doesn't not equal a years salary.  And there's no way a CM makes 100k/year.  Game Devs don't pay out that much.
---
Once you get your Southshore FP, take a jog up the river to Chillwind Point. Closest FP to the monastery, and its easy enough to avoid most WPL mobs by hugging the hills.
---
The reply from Melekith135 very clearly responds to that. 
---
*Mind controls people into said portal
---
I legit would have loved to jump in too to be honest, as I've got somethings I'm pushing off at work as well... buuuut as you know Blizzard pays us the big bucks and I've gotta keep things a-political if I want to keep seeing my $5,000/hr paycheck.
---
But upper case within the word, so probably DurotarTiger. 
---
Yeah and avoid the murloc island at all cost
---
Nothing beats a geared Spriest. 
---
I disagree with this mentality entirely. I am playing for years to earn gear that I want to spend time enjoying. Sure the journey is nice but so is the destination.
---
Gear isn’t the only motivator for playing, and one class isn’t the only one I want to gear.
---
Deal With It.
---
Until you find out Activision is selling level 60 boosts and wow tokens in classic and you finally realize Blizzard's dead
---
I was a little surprised they weren’t doing a Nov 23rd release, as an anniversary thing. 
---
But now they might make me wait longer than “Summer 2019.”
---
Also...may have missed it, but did the Classic team lose anyone during the layoffs?
---
Cyclone and Lifebloom. Direct form to form shapeshifting.
---
Probably the mana cost of shifting was less too. Not 100% on that.
---
Sounds like my cup of tea
---
I wouldn't be so sure.
---
While we can probably expect the protection and event systems to be the same, I would expect that the frames and data of the default UI will be completely altered.
---
As such, a UI addon that reads the data from the raid frames might run into trouble.
---
Because of the updates to the events and protections, vanilla addons will have their own set of issues as well.
---
I think addons for Classic will have to be written specifically for Classic. Addons for the live game as well as addons for 1.12 will not work.
---
That depends on its success.
---
For world PVP, it doesn't make sense.
---
For battlegrounds, I love it. It basically sets your "end-game" PVP goals to a more easily obtainable level. BIS gear is set in stone, and nothing "new" will ever be needed. So basically it has the exact same appeal as Classic in general.
---
It's fun to go into a battleground and be able to carry the team on your back. All-twink BGs are also enjoyable since it's then all about teamwork and skill at that level (albeit at a lower skill cap than 60). Everyone will have the best gear possible, so it's more "equal" than PVP at 60 (but maybe not as fun for some). Getting your BIS gear feels really rewarding and it's much less of a time investment than raiding. Overall it's a different way to play, and a "casual" PVPer's dream. 
---
Oh wow, I should consider selling my own soul and integrity after seeing those numbers.
---
damning? seriously?
---
Yes, one of the best things about pservers was the ability to game with people from across the world. Somehow, we all find a way to communicate and share common enjoyment of WoW.
---
Right, you won't be able to just load current addons in classic; but if they have a beta that will give addon devs plenty of time to make the appropriate changes; which is what I said. It's on the same client though, it's not like they're going to need to re-write them all from scratch.
---
So no retail players will play classic?
---
A huge problem right now is that the game isn't even out, so the only way to stream it is through means that's against the rules of blizzard. Streamers are probably holding off on streaming it untill it's out. If things are problematic when it's actually  out, I think that's a different scenario.

I’m talking about making Azeroth great again. Who cares about politics 
---
They didn't specify they were using the Gregorian Calendar either.
---
I would have to say that it is mixed, bittersweet.  The main tank (who was not an officer, btw) used to repeat this one meme over and over again on ventrillo when we raided. I still hear it in his voice when I repeat it in my head. And, I am still friends with some one I never met with a Mage that we had in the guild. 
---
When I think back, I feel the first cracks in the downfall of the guild, and why we fell apart when we did, was the introduction of ZG. It was really hard for the guild, built on friendship,fun, and fairness (the 3 Fs!), to split our 40 man raid group into 2 twenty man raids. Even tho we deemed it "optional" raids, everyone wanted a piece of it, and no matter how hard we tried one group always cleared it better than the other and it would create hard feelings, a sort of A group and B group mentality. 
---
We were a united and happy guild, until some started to feel like they weren't "good enough" to get into the A team, or that we even intentionally seperated the two raids into "good players" and "not so good players".  The truth was that we had one super amazing raid leader (my husband) and two not so super amazing raid leaders (the guild leader and me who was the loot officer) and no matter if we had the best of the best in our group, whichever raid had my husband leading it, did better that week. 
---
Maybe we should have just never done ZG as a guild activity at all, and just said it was below us and people should PuG, but there were cool side grades . . . . . 
---
I min/max on pservers.. I really feel like we will be in the minority. I’m not one of those crazy people who yell at those who don’t min/max. My last guild had people mostly new to wow at all and I kept my mouth shut on how things should be done to not ruin their experience. Unless they asked of course.
---
My story is a pretty funny one in my opinion. 
---
I moved near chicago to go to college in '06, i was majoring in video game programming and design. The school put us in housing with 3 random people. At the time i really enjoyed RPGs and shooters. So i was playing FFVII and Oblivion, along with random Shooters and RTS games. While we were driving up (im from MO) i told my mom.
---
"I bet my roommates will be fucking WoW nerds, I don't want to get into that game because i'll probably get addicted."
---
When we arrived only 1 other roommate had showed up and he wasn't into many games at all besides digital poker and a few Action/Fighting games. He was also a DJ (I fucking hate techno music im a metal head, he fucking hated metal). Somehow we clicked right away and became buddies. Then a few hours later my other to roomies arrived with there Gaming rigs in tow, both wearing world of warcraft clothing of some sort. We all ended up getting a long i just told them how i was hoping my roommates wouldn't play wow lol. 
---
Fast forward a few weeks and everyone was going to go back home for a visit (they all lived like 2 hours away from home versus my 6 or 7.) One of them said, "Hey you can try world of warcraft while im gone." Knowing that i would probably laugh at him and say no but for some reason i said yeah show me the basics ill mess around on it while you are gone. 
---
From the time he walked out the door I played for 18 hours! I am not sure i even ate or drank anything. Then i logged out and went to bed...I just laid awake thinking about it until i fell asleep for about 4 hours. When i woke up i immediately logged in and played for another 13 hours. 
---
The world just felt so huge and dangerous. It was so thrilling. When my roomie came back i told him about it and he said. "alrighty we are buying you an account. He asked his mother to buy me a pc and pay for my account. I started my account right after TBC came out and played until near the middle of wrath and stopped.
---
For years after that i would see the new expansions coming out and really miss the game but I was a terrible drug addict and couldn't afford to play the game and buy drugs. 
---
Once i got clean I updated my computer, then i started looking at private servers. Now i play retail and can't wait for Classic to release. 
---
Sorry this was a little all over the place it has been a rough morning. I hope you enjoyed this stupid little story. 
---
Husband got out of the USMC. I convinced him to do unemployment while transitioning into school. He would play WoW all day...I'd leave for work and get home and he hadn't moved. I'd have to remind him to do schoolwork and help out with chores. Him not doing chores really didnt bother me as much as I let on...he had just gotten out and felt he deserved a break but I didnt want him taking full advantage and thinking this would be the norm. I got tired of nagging him so one day I told him I'm done fighting it and I wanted him to teach me how to play. I loved bonding with him and he loved teaching me stuff and running around. It brought us closer together. We went hard for 2 years before work took over our lives. He never finished school but now works on base as a helicopter mechanic. We are also much better at communicating. 
---
I don't get it either, but it's true.
---
Releasing enslaved infernals in the Auction House or Bank.   
---
Enslaving demons people were trying to kill, then releasing them once they pulled another mob.
---
Dotting lowbies and following them around as they panicked, then cannibalizing them when they died.  
---
I was an obnoxious little cuss in 2005.
---
Roots, bear form, travel form, stealth form, HOTs. They were close to unkillable, very frustrating to fight against. Especially when they started getting high resilience and they could just soak up damage. Their HOTs could easily keep up with the damage.
---
I might have, but I guess I recently developed an interest in the RP fantasy of Human Mages in the WoW lore, and my friends are gonna go Alliance.
---
I've been waiting for that next Classic Hit! time to get my fix. 
---
You do have a point!
---
The worry people have is that they'll try to include ways to make money beyond the subscription. Hopefully they learn/understand that this isn't what Classic players want. Subscriptions work! Think Netflix! They aren't trying to find ways to add micro-transactions there, because the subs actually are profitable! Imagine that!
---
We'll see once you have actually killed kt ok?
---
Have you killed KT?

---
A lot of things beat a geared Spriest.
---
You may be right in that ATVI might have pulled the trigger for Classic while Blizzard was too pridefull to accept making legacy servers, but on the other hand retail WoW would probably not be such a shit show if they didn't interfere and we would still play modern WoW instead of begging to go back when it was still good.
---
Druid is probably the most fun world PVP class.  Stealth makes you just as capable as a rogue of disengaging (or ganking) and the druid toolkit is very diverse and can really help you turn the tide in any fight. 
---
Wow, there are still Blizzard employees working there?!
---
Hey guys, I thought I should share an idea I had regarding the latest news from Activision Blizzard. They clearly aren't in a mood to be spending much money on non-development staff, as we see in the recent lay offs, so they should just leave us to take care of the community side of things without the right click report/loot trading functions. Keep Warcraft, Purecraft.

My best friend throughout my life was always more into computers and computer gaming than I was at the time WoW came out. I was more of a console player, and had only ever briefly dabbled in basic computer games, but I was able to create a couple characters on different MMO games that he was playing (City of Heroes, Everquest, etc.) when I would be over at his house. They were cool, but I didn't have a computer good enough for that stuff anyways.
---
We were 17 when WoW first launched, and both turned 18 a month later; he started playing it almost immediately at launch, but I never really thought about getting it for various reasons. February 5th, 2005, J bought me a copy as a late birthday gift. I was living with my dad at the time, so I waited until he was done with the computer for the night, installed it, and launched WoW for the first time ever. My "gaming career" was never the same after that point. I made a Night Elf Rogue on Elune as J and our mutual friend S were both playing Paladins on that server already and were half way through the leveling process. They gave me little hints on ways to get through the grinds, but left me to my own devices so that I could really immerse myself into Azeroth. 
---
J gave me 5 gold after I made it to Auberdine, Darkshore, and told me, "Don't take too many flight points as they cost a lot, and don't go to the Auction Houses unless I really, really, really need it." The former was easy to do as I loved exploring, but the latter was tough as I loved buying new shiny items!  I spent hours upon hours exploring the world, skinning beasts, and just falling in love with my character as I had never had a gaming experience this in depth before. Class fantasy was the coolest thing to me; the poison quest chain, finding lock boxes to pick, crafting my tools of the trade (poisons, thistle tea, blind and vanish powders).... I was just over the damn moon.
---
I had never played a game before where I was THIS invested in what I was doing. J and S eventually gave up on the game to do real life decisions. J went into the Navy, and S and his wife had a kid, but as I had no desire to start a family, or join the military, I was able to keep playing.
---
I never got passed BWL as I was working full time delivering pizza on the closing shift and it was hard to find raid groups in the early morning hours, or 3rd shift hours, but I did have a solid casual guild that would run a couple UBRS groups, ZG, and on occasion, would team up with our "sister guild" to do MC and BWL.
---
Since vanilla, I have played most of every expansion for WoW (I'd say around 75-80% of the length of time each expansion was current) but took breaks periodically. Nothing ever really compared to how I felt about vanilla wow. The combination of my age and relative free time, being an MMO virgin, having RL friends play, and finding a group of people/guild that really felt like a 2nd home, made that time one of the most amazing for me.
---
I understand that WoW Classic will not be the same, even with NO CHANGES, because I am not the same as I was back then. There won't be some Tuesday patch days that take almost the entire 24 hours to get going again AND Blizz credits a day or two on our accounts. There won't be the same imperfections being ironed out with each patch. There won't be the same people playing the same way; even if I got in touch with all the surviving members of my old guild to play Classic again, we all won't be experiencing the game fir the first time together. 
---
It will NEVER be exactly as it once was, and while that is sad and true for everything in life, I'm glad that it won't be the exact same. I want a new, fresh look at a game I tout as being one of my favorites in my life. I won't be playing the game the same as I did, but I won't ever forget to take my time and explore the world again. Unlike current iterations of WoW where the grind is a small chore to complete before getting to End Game (current "meat" of the game), I look forward to having the grind be the game. I look forward to buffing random strangers in quest zones as we run by each other, because we all need all the help we can get. I look forward to hopefully having a server community once again where what you do affects your reputation (I.E. Ninja looters, poor sports, dickfors, etc. get remembered and black listed so to speak).
---
Subbed on Youtube - looking forward to seeing this episode uploaded so I can listen at work..
---
I got into it after moving countries! I was living in Spain for a long time and remember seeing WoW at a friends house. Specifically he was an undead rogue and was killing ppl in STV as there were not even BGs at that moment!! It looked so cool but I didn’t even have a good pc to run it.
---
Then I moved to USA and didn’t really know anyone and luckily my dad gave me a brand new pc. So I walked 1.5 hrs to my local target (no car) bought the game and have been playing since. Haha! That was summer 2005.  What a glorious time, except for the hurricanes... fuck hurricanes.
---
Yeah it even appears "yellow" since it is a neutral mob to begin with right?
---
In many spots, it is a dead giveaway because most mobs are red (automatically aggressive) and you see the neutral hunter pet wandering around. 
---
Yeah or the dwarven mild
---
Good story!  Glad you got clean.  It is pretty funny you avoided WoW at first cause you knew it would suck you in lol.  Shows you know yourself pretty well.
---
From what I understand, the API will be somewhat a mix of live and Classic.  Classic addons simply wouldn't work on this API, but I'm worried that Live addons will require a lot of customization from the user unless they are re-branded for Classic.  Things like:
---
* Specific spells that were removed or changed
---
* Spell ranks
---
* Which dispels are available
---
WoW Classic actually had broken OP healing addons that would basically heal for you and all you had to do was click a single button.  Those probably won't work.  Clique works fine on the private server I'm on.
---
Downvoted, but you at least answered the question honestly.  May your shame never ebb into the mists of time!
---
hey thanks! 16 years of addiction. WoW is one of the things that keep me clean actually and my wife is the greatest and let's me play wow all of the time. :)
---
Right? I heard not even 1 person yell at Hazzikostas. Even Ythisen is thanking him for all the great time
---
Yeha I guess that makes sense. I guess the best druid farm would be to dou DM N? 
---
Glad you went to WoW and bonded over it.  I have heard too many stories that opposite.
---
I love this podcast.   Makes my driving around so much better with my home health job.  I may have to call in one day and contribute my 2 cents 
---
They fired the one and only good community manager this game has had in years. They may consider it low level, but it was one of the ONLY publicly known employees they should’ve kept. Pathetic.
---
It’s not hard to imagine. People are fucking dumb.
---
Wow that is dedication!  Was that 1.5 hours total? or one way?
---
If you are going for endgame pvp, a caster, why? Huge armor is real in vanilla. Holy paladins and shamans are really hard to kill with a melee class in endgame. While rogues are killing machines at low level and vs undergeared people, they sux a lot vs heavy armor in endgame gear. So which is the best pvp caster class? Warlock simple. PS: You will be very weak in pvp at low level but everything is different later.
---
This is the build for "Off Tanks"

The end goal of the prot tree is to get last stand, and 1 point in improved shield block. You need 1 point (and mostly only 1 point) because that first point increases the amount of blocks from 1 to 2. But subsequent points don't increase the number of blocks just the duration.
---
With the remaining points you would get either Mortal Strike or Blood Thirst by going into arms and fury respectively. BT would likely be better for tanking, and way better for PvE DPS. But its not unheard of for people to go MS if they were PvP mains who just helped out as OT.
---
Your end specs would be something like these...
---
Fury: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVZqVzhbxRVoEbzo
---
Arms: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LVhxdhio0uVZEbzo
---
Yeah I'm doing some of that as well with a friend, and we can effectively AOE grind or single target great.  Warrior can hold threat enough to let the mage spam mana-efficient spells, and for AOE the warrior and mage can both gather some, come together and frost nova, and then the mage has a much larger than usual group that they can AOE.  Warrior can help with piercing howl, thunderclap, demo shout or warstomp
---
Mage.
---
High CC, high burst, decent to high survivability, scales well with gear, easy to farm with and probably the most effective farmer in the game, is a staple party member in all raids and dungeons and is a staple of all PvP encounters. Raid vs. raid, premade BGs, solo BGs, and world PvP.
---
If you prefer Human for the look then you should pick Human. I'll just mention for your consideration that Escape Artist is amazing.
---
I believe you need to turn it on through the SCT addon
---
But he wasn't screwed over in the sense that he was treated unfairly. He was laid off in a normal way, which is what we should presume, unless you know something I don't?
---
I feel this is why most raiding guilds didn't survive TBC with the loss of 40 man.  I didn't even think how guilds were affected by ZG or AQ20 since mine thrived with them.  Can i ask the meme the tank repeated?
---
The system of consensual transactions between two different people or corporations? Lol okay.
---
God dang these are flippin' awesome! Great work!!
---
Would love to see a painting of EPL with the Naxx pyramid menacingly in the background. THat'd be pretty neat
---
appreciate it, as long as there's a way I can see it. Thanks!
---
Definitely, something to do with the human/undead struggle would be cool, like the Plaguelands, Scarlet Crusade, maybe Stratholme or even Duskwood (maybe with a torch in the dark theme). Maybe a Blackrock Spire/Dark Iron etc theme would be cool too (fire+darkness). Just my thoughts, I'm sure anything you put out would be sweet!
---
Yea! I didnt wanna be one of those lol!!
---
I normally get tired of fan art but you are just extremely talented. Amazing
---
Note: through SCT, it won't float over there person you heal. It will scroll over a selected area and in the options you can have it say who is being healed. 
---
Ah, yeah if your group is all RP'ing and rolling alliance not much of a choice then.
---
Thats a dead meme and that woman doesnt need attention
---
I ended up thinking about this more than I expected.  In part, I agree with you, but the way you replied was pretty dickish.  I'm still not sure if I think you're right or an asshole, but it sure did prompt some introspection.
---
There is some truth to what you say.  I wanted to play WoW and she wanted to smoke weed and have children.  We weren't really interested in what the other was.  
---
That being said, WoW was a monster in that it was unlike any other game as commitment level goes.  Nothing else I've played required me to schedule around it so much.  It's true that I could have chosen not to, and that's what eventually happened when I took another job and wanted to progress porfessionally.
---
This time I'm going to have to do things more rationally because life is different now.  I'll take a week off to hit it pretty hard, but then raiding won't be a full time job.  If it takes seven hours to get through MC or BWL this time, we'll be doing something wrong.  A few hours a week is a lot easier to balance with work and life.
---
These are *incredible*.  Any plans of more?  
---
Set in Westfall, maybe?
---
I agree with most of what you said here. 
---
&gt;I am saying that if you gave me and a random raid leading monkey the job of recruiting a PUG raid, I could do a better job than him without requiring the achievement in the same amount of time.
---
But that's completely irrelevant. That just means you are a better raid leader than most. Just because you don't need achievements doesn't mean it's not useful for anyone else. 
---
&gt;I am confident I could get on my main and rock the 80 percentile at least on my first try on any boss right now with no experience, if the "link achievement" system would prefer the 80% under me then it's a bad system and you should do away with it.
---
You are one of the very few then. Most people has to die at least a couple of times to a mechanic before they really understand it. Unless they have religiously been studying a guide beforehand, which is sort of silly imo. 
---
Yeah, creating any addons will be childsplay for addon makers. HOWEVER, Blizzard did say that they will limit some addons that they won't deem fit for classic.
---
So.. we will have to wait and see.
---
The thing is, modern WoW isn't necessarily a bad game. It's just deviated from the original concept so much that it's no longer the same game. Due to the abandonment of RPG elements and difficulty, many of the player base have been dis-included. Separating the two types of players into their appropriate play styles might actually work out.
---
For speed-leveling, probably not.  For normal leveling, it's amazing.  My friend and I level duos all the time:
---
* Warrior and Priest - easy dungeon groups
---
* Paladin and Paladin - blessing stacking, the person who's not getting hit can heal
---
* Rogue and Druid - rogue can backstab, druid can go bear form without loss of DPS
---
* Shaman and Shaman - similar to Paladin and Paladin
---
We also ended up leveling our mains together, Mage and Hunter, because we have similar work schedules and met up a lot.  As long as you're within a few levels of each other, it's usually fine.  We would typically say "hey, let's do ZF next" and spend the next few days gathering quests and leveling on our own, and then we would run ZF when we could both be on.
---
Now, the Mage/Hunter combo wasn't really a duo, we just happened to group up a lot.  The others are all duos, and they're alts, but we mostly play those now.  
---
Pros:
---
* Much better survivability.  Where a group of 3 mobs might be really difficult with 1 player, it can be trivial for 2.  Where a group of 5 mobs might be skipped, it might be doable now.  Less corpse runs is good, being able to get that last Redridge Mongrel instead of waiting for respawns is also good.
---
* Utility.  A warrior now gets Power Word: Shield.  A caster now gets Arcane Intellect.  Paladins get both BoM and BoW.  More stuns and CC are available.
---
* You can tag more enemies.  You can have one person tag and another kill, which is useful in highly contested areas.
---
* Easier group finding.  You've already got a group started, and a lot of duos have a tank and/or a healer.
---
* Some classes just suck solo (and which ones is somewhat subjective).  I hate soloing on Rogues, Shamans, and Warriors, and I find Paladins and Druids slow.  All of these are helped by doubling up on people.
---
* Vendor trash is split between the two of you, which saves on bag space
---
Cons:
---
* Must be on at the same time
---
* Have to agree on where to go
---
* "Loot X items" quests start to get annoying, especially if there's a low drop rate
---
* Class quests
---
* Less XP and gold per kill
---
One way around issues where players aren't on is to handle "chores" while the other person is offline.  Class quests, leveling professions, farming ore, fishing, training pet abilities, spamming Barrens chat, leveling an alt are all viable.  You could also do things IRL and plan to play around your friends' schedule.
---
Do you plan to play again?  If so, how will you approach it differently?
---
Hmm I didn't know that. I wonder what the restrictions will be? Possibly buff/dot timers and enemy spell cast displays? Hopefully not things like swing/autoshot timers or druid bars
---
Now this is fear mongering! Love the rhetoric my guy. 
---
Great way to go out! Thanks for the read Moonranne :)
---
For anyone thinking of rolling a 19 twink in Classic I wrote up a guide on how to get all the BiS gear etc. over here: https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=873
---
The classic dev team was aware there would next to zero GM support for the game, hence why the loot trade system and auto reporting were integrated into classic despite their adamant effort to make the game as authentic as possible.
---
its not exactly a mystery. 
---
Such a nice made up story! Love it!
---
Question is, if we want classic, do we also want it to have as much players as possible? Do we trust blizzard and current generation of players? How long will this classic actually stay classic?
---
I really want it to be considered success, but sometimes i wonder for what reasons...
---
In other news:  The year has 12 months,  cows moo, bears shit in the woods, and people post obvious, short, pointless reddit posts to farm karma.  
---
yup, that was my assumption for making the video. There was no mention of that being a mystery!
---
I would say the difficulty stems from it being obvious when a tank screws up and not so much when others screw up.... In the end just blame the dps for not managing threat.
---
I'd hate to wait longer too, but I'd also rather them get it right. If that means a month or two more of development time; so be it 
---
Why is it made up? This is exactly how it happened from memory. My memory isn't the greatest these days (got a traumatic brain injury in iraq, but it did happen. 
---
So you're wrong. I never said what you're suggesting. I said THIS POST was not the right place. THIS POST is saying we need to give money to a former Blizz CM. It doesn't relate to classic. If Metzin started streaming and someone made a post saying look Metzin is streaming and that was all the post is, Unless Metzin is streaming classic or videos of classic etc then Again who cares if he's playing Roblox it's not classic and doesn't apply to this forum.
---
1.5 hours each way. In south Florida summer heat. Probably dropped like 5 lbs from the walk alone, haha
---
The classic client is very similar to the current expansion client and uses the same addon and macro API.
---
You'll most likely get to play with all of your favorite addons from the current expansion.
---
(This was back in early BC for me)
---
I remember dinging level 40 in SM on my Blood Elf Mage. I was so giddy with excitement because MOUNT! I asked the group if I could leave mid run to get my mount but they said no, lmao.
---
Thanks! Yeah that would've been helpful back then. Like an idiot I didnt roll engineer because I didnt know it was viable in pvp. 
---
You’ll get plenty of practice through dungeons while leveling up. Without a queuing system, people will take any tank/healer they can find.
---
Can someone walk me through the Enh spec that Sakuraba mentioned?  He was saying 21/30/0 and it involved spell power and high crit chance for shocks and melee with Flame Tongue or Frostbrand weapon.  Sounded super interesting especially if you have a Hand of Edward the Odd.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Its not difficult, its just a slightly different skillset.
---
If you tank high M+ keys in Retail WoW, your main skillset is your use of your mitigation abilities, ie: if you play a Blood DK, you have to keep mitigation up and use Death Strike (heal) at opportune moments.
---
That is not the same skillset you need in Vanilla. Your "skill" in dungeons, is patience. Pulling well so you dont pull more than 1 pack, LoS pulling to get casters/ranged to follow you, keeping always on eye on your healers mana and lastly the patience to mark the sheep or sap or banish or whatever.
---
The rotation itself is not all that hard, you typically use Thunder Clap, Demo Shout and tab around and Sunder. Revenge when its up. While you do have mitigating CDs in Classic, they are typically on much larger timers than in Retail.
---
The "googogogo pull!!!" crowd will fail miserably in Classic. Because healer mana is scarce even when played well, fights are longer and AoE is minimal. Things are generally more methodical. So you taking a few seconds to mark a target, to do a good LoS pull, all that stuff is expected and very rewarded.
---
The people get what they want who cares about what happens to everyone else!
---
Just had a look at the guide. I was actually pretty close to having everything you listed. I didnt have the arena trinket or the fishing hat, but most of these other items I did have. Brings back even more memories. Thanks friend. 
---
Gotta start somewhere. Learn what you can and move on.
---
Excellent summary 👍
---
Are you a mod of this sub? If so, by all means keep complaining about us supporting the best Blizzard CM in history. If not, then you’ve gotten your point across but clearly we feel differently. So please stop being a dick.
---
If by a lot you mean nothing then you are correct. 
---
Mages would lose to the rogues.
---
Master of the obvious
---
What happened in iraq?
---
Blessed
---
I am a little afraid that there will be a large chasm between hardcore players and casual.  In vanilla it was only a small percentage of the playerbase with aq and naxx gear.  When 15 or 20 percent of players are in end game gear it will massively change the feel compared to vanilla.  I say this as someone who had naxx gear in vanilla, but wont be able to raid much (if at all) in classic.
---
So kinda like the HIMYM slap-to-come?  Never actually kill them but just freak them out so they are constantly bubbling, being ineffecient at killing the quest mobs because of paranoia....etc?
---
Can hardly do something wrong with pressing the button and having the page load blank

Hots don’t stack, not enough CC.

Quick question, I was thinking of doing a priest wand twink @ 19 &amp; 29. What are the rep values from each flag capture/win, just wondering. Also the "for great honor" quest for turning in badges if you happen to know how much repeatable rep that gives
---
I was actually reminiscing on my time in FF11 way back when, stumbled across a folder on my hard drive that had hundreds of random screen shots I had taken from the game.  Getting a beastmaster to level 71 before ultimately calling it quits to jump into the WoW open beta and vailla release.  Got two characters to level 60 in vanilla WoW quite easily.  Got really bored and then went back to FF11 for a while longer but instead getting a black mage from 1 to 75.  Getting a single job in FF11 to max level was incredibly rewarding, and I had a good group of in game friends.  Since it was required to party for pretty much anything, it did you well to enjoy some casual conversation while partying.  Often times on the weekend you could enjoy the company of the same group all day long.  It was great.  
---
WoW I got into mostly because I had more real life friends playing that, however that didn't prevent the appeal from wearing off on me.  Still felt mostly solo, and when you did party with a random group for a dungeon it was for a very small amount of time.  No real time for quality chit chat.  Ended up making no in game friends in my time there, just had my real friends.  
---
Between both vanilla WoW, and technically near vanilla but I believe the one main expansion pack 'Rise of the Zilart', I felt I had a more satisfying and possibly emotional time in FF11 overall.  I actually miss it.  Doesn't sound like it's the same now though, seems it was dumbed down to cater to modern day MMO players.  FF14 became too 'WoW'-fied for my tastes also, I feel like every MMO now is about 'mindless questing' and that is terribly boring.  In a way it's good though, means no MMO really grabs my attention long enough to get me addicted anymore.  I don't personally have any interest in playing anymore MMOs that are based on the WoW aesthetic.  
---
You did an amazing job depicting the gloomy landscape of the Tirisfal Glades - it's one of my favorite lore places in the game and the art really puts a heavy emphasis on this dead, decaying land and its inhabitants that used to be normal and peaceful - once.  
---
Excellent work!
---
Thank you a lot !!
---
I actually kinda hate SM for creating a standarized model for all future dungeons. Short, linear and thematically identical. This was especially painful in TBC and Wrath which basically had 4 dungeons each, split into 4 wings (one of which was usually a raid).
---
Imagine how much cooler SM and expansion dungeons would be if they were done the same style as BRD, or any other high level vanilla dungeon. Even freaking Deadmines felt more epic, since at least getting to the entrance was a challenge in itself. Here you just stroll carefree to a safespace lobby with easily accessible entrances to each wing, placed one next to another. That was the first step in making dungeons feel like theme parks, rather than epic adventures into hostile and mysterious environments. Which later they applied to the outdoor world as well.
---
&gt;for more devs so they can make more games.
---
lol they are not.
---
Blessed. Classic wow will pale in comparison to the original vanilla retail experience but should still be great.
---
No way.  The longer a fight can go on, the more a mage can put up temporary hit point barriers.  It seems unlikely to impossible that the rogues would get a solid opener, with multiple rank 1 spams at arbitrary locations.  Mages can also become invincible, forcing a target swap or multiple vanishes.  The mages have multiple peel options, and an aoe root that can grab multiple lesser CC breaks at once.  
---
Really, I think the ability to spam 3-4 low rank aoes at all time will be enough though, as you wouldn't need to catch more than a couple rogues out to have a huge advantage.
---
I feel like the void won’t be filled by more classic. I see it as a curse of raising a bar/standard of what I think is enough from a new game. I went to other mmo’s and the simple fact that there were loading screens between what I consider a small zone messed with my immersion. 
---
I feel like if you look at how much and how new of an experience WoW classic gave us, very few, if any games, are delivering on an experience that would be equal to that in modern times. (Red Dead 2 gave me some feelings close to this)
---
IEDs and EFPs. Loads of them.

&gt; Summer's not the ideal time to spend 12 hours behind mouse &amp; keyboard
---
It is if you're in Phoenix
---
This is the mentality that leads to 30% war mode buff
---
Where do all the people come from who say it will still take some time? They very clearly said it's coming out this summer. Depending on how summer is defined this ranges from early june to late september.
---
If they delay the game there is a lot of shit coming their way and they know this. I don't think they would have announced summer as their release window if they weren't certain the game would be ready by then.
---
Username checks out
---
&gt;But he wasn't screwed over in the sense that he was treated unfairly.
---
I mean, he was laid off after the company made literally billions of dollars and the ceo got a big pay boost (if I'm not mistaken). I wouldn't exactly call that "fair" if I'm being honest. 
---
Sometimes they polish the shine off of their games though.  Diablo 3 Classic, for example.  I remember reading about all of the cool mechanics they were experimenting with (the way runes worked back in 2008-2010, for example, was _completely_ different), and I remember each one slowly and methodically removed from the game in lieu of something more "streamlined" and, in my opinion, watered down.
---
Whatre healers for?
---
These are fantastic, love the art style too
---
Yes they will, but it's not like Classic will take away from the main game. There is not much to lose their at this point anyway. Classic mainly focuses on the hardcore playerbase who want a more slow paced and grindy game. Retail does the opposite.
---
Both.
---
Blessed, I got to experience WoW in its exceedingly better state.
---
Cursed, All other MMO's since the end of BC have been utter gutter trash comparatively and this includes retail WoW.

I'm not saying its a good or bad thing. I'm just saying.

---
no worries :)
---
Not sure how SM was the model given that later level dungeons made further into the development cycle were often non-linear and massive like BRD. I don't think SM was super linear, each wing indeed was linear but if you look at it as a single dungeon with multiple wings the choice is given back to you. Only thing I would change is to connect the wings from within the dungeon itself, so you have a branching choice.
---
I can't wait to see "gogogogo pull!!!" crowd fall on their face. 
---
So, there was BfA in 2018 aka WoW 8.0, a major release by definition, objectively spoken.
---
edgy brah
---
vanilla is a very easy game mechanically don't worry about it. if you not sure what do do, where to go, how to pull, etc. just don't be shy, or afraid to seem noos and straight up ask in a party chat. ppl will tell you what to do. and you pick up fast. also there will be plenty of noobs apart from you learning the game its normal.
---
ppl don't like tanks that actually quite noob but act like the "know everything" and cocky and egomaniacs. if you won't act like that and actually straight up ask how to do  i do some thing better. or straight up "i 'don't know how to tank or pull it, tell me". Ppl will really rather like you, if anything.
---
That was the best!! Ele sham was my main and I totally did that too. Did you ever watch the Thunderfuck videos? That dude got really inventive.
---
[Reminds me of](https://pics.me.me/people-are-tooselfish-forsocialism-to-work-so-lets-solve-poverty-35073304.png)
---
On a more serious note this is something that's bothered me for a long time. A relative of mine tried to guilt trip me once on these grounds. I'm rather political on my FB, so they said, "well maybe instead of going to your music festivals you should give your money to the homeless" as if the $500 I spend on music festivals would be enough to solve anyone's homeless situation. 
---
I like the idea of the OP though, I'm just not sure how realistic it is for a long term solution to Ythisens problem though. 
---
Yeah but it's way more fun to put words in your mouth and show the world how pro-#nochanges we are.
---
I mean, that sounds exactly like Activision making the call on where to cut those cost, doesn't it? 
---
Activision's CFO joins Blizzard as CFO.
---
Blizzard is told to cut costs.
---
Blizzard CFO decides where to cut cost.
---
Sure, the other C level executives have a say, but they would be remiss to not listen to the CFO's advice/decision.
---
The difference between good tanks and just tanks is an ability to adjust to each specific fight, namely find the balance to put out max threat while also keeping reasonable survivability and it's mostly a matter of experience. 
---
In context within Vanilla, Tanking for Alliance may be easier than Tanking for Horde.
---
Alliance, you have the benefit of all your dps having Blessing of Salvation, 30% less threat generated giving you much more leeway to hold aggro with.
---
Horde, although you have windfury to generate a LOT more threat with, so does your melee dps.  Your ranged dps also do not have blessing of salvation, at best they might have tranquil air which is only 20% less threat generated. 
---
This comes at the cost of 1) you need to be on your A-Game to keep your melee dps not threat capped, 2) need to find ways to really maximize your threat generation.
---
So as a result of 2) you will often find many horde tanks not in full defensive gear, looking to get more damage output with windfury / rage to generate a lot more threat with.  This comes with the obvious cost of being harder to heal since you traded some defense for offense... which also is a huge tax on your healers.
---
If you don't feel confident with your tanking abilities, try Alliance.  If you want a challenge and strive to be the best damn tank in the game, go Horde.
---
I mean, i love teldrasil but the faster you can get to westfall the better. There is a way to get to if without doing the wetlands run. I’m not sure if it’s just a pserver thing... the way you do it leads me to believe it was in vanilla we just didn’t know about it.
---
&gt; That instance was hell to get to as alliance.
---
I can only imagine the additional frustration of being on a PvP server. If they Horde aren't flagged they can always get the jump which typically puts you at a disadvantage right at the beginning of the fight, and if they start losing, just zone in, do the instance and come out unflagged. Wash, rinse, repeat. 
---
You'll be fine. It's not THAT hard, and you already have some tanking experience from other MMOs.
---
Even 10+ years after release, you're likely to run into people who just don't get how the game works. Your lack of knowledge wont seem like an issue next to that Warlock who spams life tap until he's one hit away from death, then complains that he dies instantly when he pulls aggro.
---
Actually, like that Warlock example above shows, just make sure you always leave some wiggle room for things to not go exactly as planned. If you do that, most people will consider you a good tank. Vanilla is definitely a "slow is smooth, smooth is fast" kind of game. 
---
People said the same thing about pretty much every single game dev that they've come to disagree with. CDPR will be no different. You forget that a lot of game companies start as passion projects. So lets see. =] Didn't Witcher 3 have a season pass?

Underappreciated comment ^
---
Here; choke on my uppvote
---
My hope is classic becomes vastly more popular than retail. No one knows yet though. Saying one way or the other is pure speculation.
---
First thing I think of when you use the word “blessed” is 15-minute Blessing of Wisdom. What a great buff that is.
---
Does that answer your question?
---
&gt; I mean, he was laid off after the company made literally billions of  dollars and the ceo got a big pay boost (if I'm not mistaken). 
---
Just because a company have a record year in revenue, it doesn't mean that you can't make strategic changes, which is what we should assume, unless anybody else have some dirt on Blizzard. They have clearly stated they want to increase devs on all of their projects, so cutting down on other departments makes sense. That screams of a strategic move.
---
Also, it was the CFO, and he was basically taking a demotion to be the CFO. He had once been it at Blizzard, but had changed to Chief Corporate Officer, and since the old CFO recently got fired, he took his old spot back. Which is most likely why he took a bonus. On top of that, working as a CFO, or any of the other corporate titles at a Fortune 100 company does usually come with a bonus. 
---
You seem to be of the impression, as long as the company is making money you can't make changes or fire people.
---
Right. I wouldn't be surprised if Classic becomes more popular and I'm hoping for it too. Runescape showed that it can happen.
---
But delaying Classic because of some retail patch is just stupid from a economic standpoint. It's basically not taking the money of people for a few months. Classic is gonna get released when it's ready.
---
Then why care if someone WAS posting for Karma anyways?
---
Don't post this stuff here.
---
Lol what? Its objectively easier for horde. Theres no hidden agenda here they just stated a fact.
---
Going to advise you delete this post before you waste a mods time for the second time today.
---
Kranos
---
No names. Just trying to find my mates
---
that's not it chief
---
My advice: Take it slow. If you're uncomfortable tanking just go mob by mob/pull by pull. If people get upset in your party (for going too slow), it is your job as tank to totally ignore them and continue keeping the party alive. Wiping is not fun, and it happens because people freak out, aren't paying attention, or bite off more than they can chew. Ready checks for dayyyyyyz. 
---
Druid.

Mangle was OP as fuck for the first few months.

That is a good perspective and something I havent considered even though I have played through vanilla a few times now. Looking back, that is indeed around the time when guild drama starts to brew, also the time where there is a bit of a content drought as you wait for AQ to open. Thanks for posting, love the stories!
---
Uh, blessed for being able to play the best game of all time?
---
When I started, I think I was right between middle school and high school, which is an important time to figure out who you are.
---
WoW is what made me interested in computers, and coding, and helped me socialize, and helped me learn how to plan things, and taught me how to type fast. Before WoW I was pretty much living my life on auto-pilot and couldn't actually focus on things or learn things, unless they were intuitive and took no effort.
---
Seriously, reading quest text to find out where to go, asking people for help, defragging my hard drive every 10 minutes, learning how my computer works so I could get over 15 fps... it was such an exploratory experience, inside and outside the game.
---
It's retarded to be afraid of right-click-report. But I will agree that loot reading would be bad. Thankfully it's not going to come to classic.
---
And for clothies, the magnificent Whitemane's Chapeau!
---
&gt; high M+ keys in Retail 
---
What does that even mean? What the hell happened to retail?
---
Just tired of seeing the same post over and over. 
---
I think it's less about skill and more about commitment, reliability, and dedication to be there when needed. 
---
Also, if you play warrior - your shouts are muy importante in classic (I would argue more important than in expansions). I know Demo Shout produces threat, and I think I read somewhere that Battle Shout produces threat as well. In my experience, aoe threat production is harder in classic than the other expansions for warrior (thunder clap only in arms, for example). Just keep that in mind, and build a rhythm for when to use abilities. I would love input on this subject, and please if I am mistaken - call me out and publicly shame me. I shalln't be afraid!
---
you obviously haven't listened to Tips out discussed the Pros/Cons. I'd suggest you do that
---
Why do you care..?
---
They'll fail on the second pull. First pull if they're dps.
---
If he didn't say they laid people off to make room for hiring on more developers then he's wrong.  Not sure who would watch this.
---
Toss out blinds, stunlock one down, continue through the loop.
---
It was--Blizzard has said dungeon design from TBC onward was heavily influenced by player feedback, and Scarlet Monastery's segmented and linear design was very well-received.  I couldn't find a working link to the original blue post, but you can read a little about it [here](https://www.engadget.com/2008/04/19/dungeon-depth-in-the-past-present-and-future/).
---
These are amazing!
---
That is very true.
---
Difficulty scales when multi tanking +3 mobs at the same time and trying to keep aggro.
---
Pulls in lower-end dungeons have rare pulls where there is +4-5 elites.
---
Tanks are always in demand, more than you'd think.
---
Like what, specifically?
---
Sure, I mean, living in the nation with the #1 global economy is pretty cool, I guess. It means I get to participate in it and build a life for myself, start a family, live life on my own terms, have the things I want, etc. You gotta play the game and not the victim tho.
---
Or you can just keep complaining and be poor and miserable I guess. Keep on fighting the good fight... or something.
---
If all you want to do is world PVP. Rogue is the obvious choice. If you wanna do BG's though. Do mage instead.
---
Good stuff! I love the mood in each.
---
It’s good advice. This shouldn’t be downvoted.
---
While you might be right, but without Activision Blizzard Retail wouldn't have been the idiotic mess it is today.
---
Rogue by far is the least friendly to level, but only do to what it is compared to in that list (the top leveling classes ... excluding warlock).
---
But ya, more than makes up for it as being an amazing ganker.
---
Deadmines is going to be absolute carnage
---
In TBC mu husband and I started over. I took a chance at guild leading. The hardest thing was getting the guild from the leveling phase to the 25 man raid, given that Karazhan loot was a must. It was easy to start the first 10 man raid, but we had to build 2 10 man raids and then we had to merge them into a viable 25 man raid force (also 10 +10 does not equal 25). I did not see many guilds able to do that in a timely manner. The server we were on (it was a server launched the day  TBC went live, Shandris), we were the only 25 man raid guild for quite awhile because there were no vanilla guilds that were already established that could handle doing that. Guilds struggled to make that leap from 10 man Kara to 25 man Serpent Shrine Cavern. I had to step away from that guild when my son was born in 2009. I left it in capable hands and I am pretty sure it stayed functional and relevant through several expansions before it fell apart.
---
As for the meme, I do not even remember what video this is from, but he would randomly break out on vent "This is the earth. That is a sweet earth you might say. Round."  I also vaguely recall a short video that involved a stick figure and the figure would say "My spoon is to big. My spoon is TOO big"  obviously there was also a spoon . . .
---
Youll be fine, ill be there healing. If you die its my fault.
---
The default xp loss is significant when grouped. 
---
This has to be countered by grouping with very high dps and/or aoe farming classes. 
---
There is a reason why those rushing to 60 typically are 100% solo and use very specific classes.
---
For the first few patches they abolutely blow up any class of the same skill/gear.
---
..just need a tank into my group!
---
It’s been 12 years since I raided, you’re laughing cuz it sucks right?
---
Explaining the nuances of running a business to someone who uses  "wealthy executives" as the foundation of their injustice is pointless.
---
Guy worked for a decade for the same amount of money a hs kid can make at a pizza place. Its not Blizzards responsibility to protect anyone from an absurd level of complacency, and clearly they didnt even value his work to begin with since they laid off swathes of people in that sector.
---
Like where did all these loser commies come from recently.
---
Not a dick move. Straight up villiany. 
---
If you care at all about money, herring is essential to maximize Mage gold making potential (assuming Diremaul East farm isn’t nerfed)
---
I really wanna see someone Thunder Clap in Vanilla just to then notice that they have to switch back to Def stance and lose all their rage.
---
I loved playing classic, I didn't play much of the expansions. I'll love it again I'm sure.
---
Soul Link Warlock stacking PvP stam gear is extremely hard to kill in all patches. Alliance might make warlock an issue due to WotF tho, not sure.
---
I think you have that the other way around, there's xp BONUS for grouping (granted it's small), not a penalty.
---
On PvP servers, it's soooo much better to level in a group.
---
Why tho, just BC, it was really good expac. Even just a few servers
---
I wasn't worried at all. This is because of the power of the written word.
---
Blizzard said they have no Frontline release in 2019.
---
Classic is NOT a Frontline game ... I never included in the statement for even a second.
---
You don't need alchemy on your main. Put it on your level 35 alt and have herbalism on your main. You can send herbs to your alt to make potions. You can farm herbs in AV where Mage is the fastest at getting to black lotus spawns due to blink (before mounting)
---
Hunter hands down. Burst em down from afar. So quick to
---
pros of leveling alone:
---
-significantly faster
---
-you don't have to worry about schedules or outleveling the other person you're playing with
---
benefits of leveling with a friend:
---
-less deaths
---
-easier to deal with elite mobs
---
-way less likely that players of the opposing faction will start fights with you
---
-generally more fun
---
So basically if you're not rushing to 60 and you're not worried about schedules clashing, duo leveling is better imo.
---
Deadmines. 
---
What a masterpiece. 
---
I will NEVER forget the feeling after I finally found a group and made it through. Got the Emberstone staff too. Masterpiece and the perfect conclusion to the defiss story line. 
---
Enhancement shamans in classic, everyone thinks they will be a two handed boi....but then you realize one handed weapon and shield is far better until end game with flametongue and a fast weapon. 
---
priest is basically the class for omnicidal maniacs and it's absolutely wonderful. when I wasn't playing one, I made sure to stay the fuck away from enemy priests, because they're like Liam Neeson - they will look for you, they will find you and they will kill you... then they will corpsecamp you to hell and back.
---
No doubt it's because they can make money out of it but I don't agree it's because of Activision.
---
What I believe happened: for some time devs internally wanted to go back to their roots but they had no numbers whatsoever to back it up so they weren't allowed to do it.
---
When Nostalrius received C&amp;D and decided to shutdown there has been such an outcry and such passion and support shown from every corner of the world that devs had the push they needed to find a way to show higher-ups Classic could be financially profitable, also helping retail (still their flagship) with the shared-sub "trick" (smart from a business point of view btw), so now we have it.
---
Thanks to Nost.
---
Activision I believe doesn't care because Classic doesn't take much resources, like a recent article states they don't even consider it a "real" project, that's nice for us so we can still have it regardless of budget's cuts.
---
damn man sounds like awesome times. I was a few years younger, didn't have quite the same experience
---
Awesome I remember those lol.  Thank you for this!
---
For those curious [https://youtu.be/nZMwKPmsbWE](https://youtu.be/nZMwKPmsbWE) is the first reverence.
---
And the 2nd one [https://youtu.be/WbcFrEp07Yc](https://youtu.be/WbcFrEp07Yc) my spoon is to big
---
It was, I remember reading interviews about TBC before it released and they specifically named Scarlet Monastery as the direct inspiration for the new dungeons design. They said they did it because people liked that, but in reality this was probably just the easiest and fastest way for them to make dungeons. I'm glad they moved away from the "4-wings" thing eventually and introduced more variety, at least in visuals.
---
That's my point, it should have been a single large dungeons, with branchings into each wing within the actual dungeon. The "entrance room" thing completely kills the idea that its a real place that exists in this world, instead it makes it feel like an overworld in a video game with doors to different levels. Kinda like the castle in mario 64.
---
If more people than in the past work hard to get the gear, why would it be a problem? The way I see it, they worked hard to gain the knowledge and skill to reach that level of play. More power to them. 
---
like a rogue backstabbing the living shit out of you. trolls have a bit of resistance against it with their racial spells, but even then, you're essentially made out of wet paper.
---
hunters can also *sting* a lot (har har har), though most hunters are no danger on account of all the major mental disabilities.
---
I don't like SM either, but that's because I have to run it so goddamn often. Chasing old men in red robes around gets old after the 431st run...
---
Why do you think private realms are overtuned?
---
&gt;You seem to be of the impression, as long as the company is making money you can't make changes or fire people.
---
Not sure why you're getting that impression, I never alluded to it, or didn't mean to at least. What I was alluding to was the morality of the situation. Is it moral to lay off 800 people (let alone anyone) when you just had a record breaking year? Is it moral to lay off anyone when you yourself are taking a bonus of any kind? Legal, sure, moral, I'd debate no.
---
I am interested in how Blizzard markets Classic when nearing release too. As proven in their statement, Classic is not a Frontline game. This means several things including:
---
- It isn't part of their meta-marketing strategy because it doesn't fit their primary payment model (subscription is to appease the audience it is made for and does not align with average $ per person expected from RMT/F2P models).
---
- It is a side project largely driven by consumer appeasement and risk if IP control loss and likely doesn't fit nearly any prediction models of investor return or percentage of existing meta-audience participation. 
---
I feel we await a project even Blizzard is handling as a "wait and see what happens" ... because even they are rather clueless about it other than it's more wise to complete than the EXTREME negative reaction of it being canceled ... and the boost private servers would get from it. Definitely a unique situation within this business at this level of Developer status.
---
I enjoy SM and I appreciate its linear design, but I think that design is most enjoyable when it's employed in moderation.  My favorite dungeon in Vanilla is BRD, but if every dungeon was a three-hour quagmire it would lose a lot of what makes it special and unique.  You mention you dislike how SM's wings were thematically identical, and I don't disagree; I'm just suggesting experiential/functional identity, while it may be less visibly apparent than thematic identity, is no less important.

I'd also point out that the two don't necessarily need to be separate--a monastery is *supposed* to feel quiet, orderly, and simple.  A pirate hideout is *supposed* to be difficult to find and enter.  Putting a chapel on a hill and cloistering the baddies inside enhances its identity.  A monastery shouldn't feel like a pirate hideout.
---
Each of these three dungeons we've touched on were done very well, in my opinion.  Blizzard just took the wrong lesson from SM's popularity.  As you point out, designing every TBC dungeon as a copy of SM with different textures made them feel samey and superficial, but that doesn't mean the original is to blame.
---
The issue I have with the CM’s being laid off is they (Blizzard) keep telling people they want to be more vocal, talk to us more, have conversations with us so that they can make better games... but then they got rid of their eyes, ears, and voices.
---
Meanwhile, a CM who survived is making jokes about his fat cat on twitter and advertising his twitch stream. Since the layoffs, he also hasn’t said anything towards the CM’s let go - not a damn thing. It’s almost like he’s unaware it happened or just doesn’t care.
---
I’m of the opinion that there is no job in the world where you should be making multi-millions of dollars per year. 
---
Fine, lay off some office staff, lay off a group of mobile devs who were running a game that you don’t want to support anymore, but laying off active, well liked community managers in the name of “cutting costs” and “saving money” is bullshit.
---
I was an undead rogue on a PvE server in vanilla. I used to go to Westfall and camo the defias traitor until someone activated the escort quest. I'm sick and twisted so I'd let them escort the mob all the way to moonbrook and just kill him right before the end line. Yeah I was a wanted man
---
&gt; My point is that all the people who never played WoW Classic will never have that feeling because they’re oblivious to the greener grass, so maybe they’re the lucky ones?
---
It's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all
---
I loved every minute of it. Some of the most fun times i can remember were those runs from IF to there. All the pvp and fun along the way. 
---
I think you need to do more research on Vanilla wow. 
---
no bonus on two people, +10% bonus with three. however, you're still getting 50% xp/person with two people and ~37% xp/person with three.
---
You receive a small xp bonus + a division by the amount of people in the group.  
---
100 xp per mob in a group of 2 will be 100/2 = 50 + group bonus (of maybe 5-10 xp). So killing two mobs will yield about 120 xp, instead of 100xp of a single mob for a single person.  
---
&gt; you're still getting 50% xp/person with two people and ~37% xp/person with three.
---
Yea, because the XP is shared, not because of a penalty of any kind.
---
Haha, this isn't a serious comment right? 
---
Top-tier. 
---
You submit tickets in the game client so sounds like you're full of shit. 
---
The other half of the story was going from being "As successful raid guild" on a server to being "the best raid guild" on a server. It changes peoples mindset, and not in a good way.
---
We were not the first to kill Ragnaros. We were not the first to kill Razorgore. But we were first to kill Vael and everything after that just seemed so easy for our raid force. When we opened the AQ gates, we were still the only guild on the server that had killed Nef. It seem to all happen so very fast.
---
Suddenly those faithful (attending ever raid, etc) raid members who score low on those damage/healing meters are holding the guild back. They were good enough when you were just any old raid guild, but if you want to stay the best, you need to be the best, and those at the bottom of those meters are not the best. And it consumes you as leadership, beacause it is not just the leadership talking this way. You have raiders whisper you to discuss "those" people. the ones suddenly not good enough. Suddenly you feel, as part of the leadership, that you really can't please everyone. SOme people want pruning, but deep in your heart you know the value of some of those people and you start to walk a line of "sitting" some of those people on key occasions to appease some, and then trying to soothe those that sat and make excuses as to why it was not a big deal and they are fine. 
---
And you mix all of that together, that it really just takes the nudging of a few people who think they can do it better, to make the whole guild crumble to the floor.
---
The ride was thrilling and exhausting at the same time.
---
Exactly, a bonus, but no penalty.
---
You are correct, Bshout actually generates more threat than demo shout since bshout is, I believe, 55 threat per party member affected. 
---
Shield block and revenge every time it's up. Keep sunders up. It seems like a lot at first but it's not as difficult as you might think.
---
This, raid nights on my old server use to be, “okay all 40 here, let’s mount and go!” That pass was always littered with skeletons. AC knew most of the guilds raid times and I want to say we were outnumbered 3-1 on that server. It was crazy!
---
The word "fair" doesn't even make any sense in this context. It's neither "fair" nor "unfair" and looking at it through such a lens is, to be frank, just not accurate or valuable. 
---
&gt; The rotation itself is not all that hard, you typically use Thunder Clap, Demo Shout and tab around and Sunder. Revenge when its up. While you do have mitigating CDs in Classic, they are typically on much larger timers than in Retail.
---
That is quite misleading for OP.
---
Thunderclap does not belong anywhere in Vanilla warrior tanking, except if you are an off-tank. It does absolutely no threat. For the sake of comparing, casting Battle Shout gives you more threat than Thunderclap.
---
Vanilla Warrior Tanking doesn't have a "cookie-cutter" rotation like you would have in Retail, except if you are Main Tanking bosses: Sunder Armor to 5 and keep it at 5 &gt;Shield Slam&gt;Demo Shout&gt;Revenge&gt;Shield Block/Heroic Strike when rage capped/when pull is established and stabilized.
---
On the other hand, dungeon tanking, or multi-mob tanking, is where skilled tanks really shine. In fact, dungeon tanking is all about situation vs. the amount of rage you currently have. Because in the end, your worst enemy as a warrior tank is being rage starved. There is no such thing in Vanilla as AOE warrior tanking, compared to warrior tanking in WotLK. Multi-target tanking requires a lot of technique and knowledge, stuff you can acquire right now. And to answer OP's question, it requires less time investment that you would think.
---
To describe it like the previous MT Boss rotation, multi-mob tanking goes a little like this: Ranged-pull or charge&gt;CC's are applied&gt;apply threat ability, usually Sunder Armor, on each mob that you are tanking but also taking in account the kill order. Depending on the DPS and the amount/type of CC that you are packing in the group, you will need to adapt your strategy as a tank, since every group will be different. Your spec/gear might also change the way you approach pulls.
---
There will be groups that have so much DPS that only taunt will be needed to kill the first mob, freeing that initial rage to spend it on the next mobs, therefore having a better threat "grip" on them.
---
Yeah, I remember reading about it, i think before TBC was released. They said they did it because people liked that, but in reality this was probably just the easiest and fastest way for them to make dungeons without having to create too many unique assets. I'm glad they eventually moved away from the "4-wings" thing and introduced more variety, at least in visuals.
---
Wait, how is you getting pwnd in a warsong gulch causing mischief to other people? Unless you mean that your team members were annoyed by it? Because I can guarantee you that they couldn’t care less about you dying over and over. 
---
They said they wanted to get rid of some during blizzcon. Im guessing the ones like the group finder addons and such will be squashed. 
---
And it loads a webbased app inside the game.
---
On an individual level of course.  We will just have to see how it plays out.  I may just be paranoid about nothing.
---
I remember on a certain private server there was a lvl 34 dwarf priest and 36 dwarf warrior that used to kill everyone in STV, they were twinked and sometimes even came with flasks (lol) they would easily kill lvl ?? that were just passing by. I once joined them on my lvl 37 druid and we killed a 60 warrior 
---
Hence the quotations, I think "moral" would've been a moral would've been a more appropriate word but that's not the word they used in the comment I was replying to. 
---
**Level 1: Threat**
---
The biggest difficulty is to keep everything on you.  Threat is a mechanic that is very important in WoW.  I'm not sure how it works in live, except that basically as long as you have defensive stance and touch something, it's locked onto you.  
---
In Vanilla, a warrior (and 90% of your tanks are warriors) will only generate something like 30% more threat in defensive stance.  Which means if you hit for 100, another DPS hits for 130, and a healer heals for 260, then you all have the same threat level on the mob.
---
This is where abilities that generate extra threat (Sunder Armor, Demoralizing Shout) come into play, as does the Taunt ability.  Another good way to keep threat is to mark targets (and you need to be group leader for this).  Put a Skull on what you want to die first, and generate more threat on that target.  Put an X on the next target, and then start generating threat on X when skull is almost dead, so the DPS can immediately switch.  You can either do a kill order (i.e. Skull-X-Triangle-Square-Circle), or what I would do is "Focus skull, then X, then skull again" and I'd simply swap which one was primary based on what we were already on.
---
It's also a good idea to give the DPS a standard delay before attacking (i.e. "don't hit skull until I have 2 sunders on).  Or just taunt skull so it will stick on you while it's burned down and start building threat on X.
---
If you can keep everything on you (which means generating more threat than the DPS on the primary target and out-threating the healer on everything else) then you'll do fine, and that will be enough for most groups and most dungeons.
---
**Level 2: Mitigation**
---
Your next priority is to mitigate the damage you take.  This keeps you alive better, but also helps with the healer's mana pool.  This can come from several sources:
---
1. Gear, enchants, and consumables. 
---
2. Talent specialization.
---
3. Your knowledge of when to use your defensive abilities.
---
4. Your knowledge of the fights and clever use of gameplay mechanics
---
5. Coordination with marks
---
6. Teamwork
---
First, the more stats you have, the better.  I'm not going to get into which stats you need right now.
---
Second, talents add more stats, but also make some abilities work better.
---
Third and fourth, know the fights and what you need to do.  Is there an ability that should be interrupted?  A time you should pop your Shield Block?  Do adds come out?  Are there times you just need to get out and wait for an explosion to finish?  Should you save your CDs for when the healer is feared or slept?  What abilities can you use to avoid the same?
---
Fifth, I mentioned marks above, but this is a different one.  Typically, Skull and X are focus targets, and the others are CC.  It will vary based on server, and I might be using a lot of TBC standardized marks, but Moon = Sheep, Square = Trap, Triangle = Hibernate, Diamond = Warlock, and Circle = Mind Control.  Or if you have three mages it might be "Arcanelol, you're moon; Fireclass, you're circle; and Frostysnwmn, you're Square".  Use CC to thin the amount of attackers, keep casters locked down so you don't have to keep them off the healer, or to stop their healers from being a problem.
---
Sixth, teamwork.  I mentioned CC, but maybe have the mage frost nova stuff near you.  Have the Voidwalker or Hunter pet pick up a problematic add.  Have the ranged DPS handle a caster enemy on their own if need be.  Communicate and work together.
---
**Level 3: Above and Beyond**
---
If you can master levels 1 and 2, you'll be a B-level tank and most groups will be thrilled to have you.  And it doesn't take much practice to get there.  If you want to get even better, here are some other things you can do:
---
* Run the dungeons over and over until you learn exactly which groups patrol where, when to time your pulls, and what mobs are linked together
---
* Get good at pulling in several ways (body pull, ranged pull, LOS pull)
---
* Get used to positioning yourself so the group can attack from the mob's rear
---
* Pull enemies far enough back they don't run away and bring back adds (or advocate use of snares, stuns, and "can't run away" abilities like Judgment of Justice or Curse of Recklessness)
---
* Learn how to stance dance for when other abilities are needed
---
Vanilla addons won't work in Classic.  We'll need new addons.
---
A lot of other casters wanted that fashionable hat but I think just about everyone rolled on the necklace she dropped. It had 7 int, spirit and stamina which was a lot at those levels where amulets were still kind of hard to find. I think I was still using it at 60..
---
Nope. It's just a text window dude. Sorry you're bad at computers. 
---
A) GM's did assist with misloot issues in vanilla
---
B) If they are cutting support staff even more that's all the more reason we need right click reporting or chat will be even worse than it was in vanilla
---
my "gogogogo pull! ! !"s are usually reserved for when im with a preset group who have gone gone gone gone many times before.  In a pug?  Never.
---
I have genuine concerns that their concerted efforts to reduce customer service staff will lead to RCR being a thing in Classic, which will essentially destroy the community like nothing else.
---
Cash shop will likely be present, and if it is anything beyond vanity items I will be disappointed...however, if there is ANY p2w aspect then I won't be participating.
---
I hope that when classic comes they take a very hands off approach to griefing punishment like they did on live servers. The whole point and danger of the world is the enemy faction, that's what makes emergent gameplay and makes things fun IMO. Even against your own faction competing for mobs etc shouldnt be punishable. I think the only thing worth punishing is actual glitch abuse like using tricks to jump through geometry and hide in walls and stuff like that. (But even then I feel like they should patch it to stop that rather than ban ppl)
---
&gt; I never alluded to it 
---
I would say you did, otherwise I wouldn't have made that exact line.
---
&gt; Is it moral to lay off 800 people (let alone anyone) when you just had a record breaking year? 
---
I'd say yes. Those 800 people are not tied to the record breaking year at all, in the sense that you suddenly morally owe them more, because you just had a record year. If it was a strategic move, it's solely the fact that they're not needed anymore. No serious company will keep 800 employed, if the plan is to not use them, nor do they owe them a plan where they're included, just because they were part of the record year.
---
&gt; Is it moral to lay off anyone when you yourself are taking a bonus of any kind? Legal, sure, moral, I'd debate no. 
---
I'd say yes.
---
He was taking a bonus for taking a demotion in a shitty time where a CFO was needed and he had been it for 5 years at Blizzard before, so if they liked those 5 years with him, he was clearly a candidate, given that he already worked in a higher position at Blizzard already. 
---
Next impression I get from you here, is that you think Blizzard suddenly need money or something, since they fire 800 people and therefore you can't justify using a bonus on a new CFO. My point is exactly, that this is not about Blizzard not having the money to pay 800 people. It's the fact that they don't want to pay 800 people for doing a job which isn't needed anymore.
---
A) I know they did
---
B) I honestly don't think it would be so bad - p servers are civil enough and they don't have much policing! 
---
One thing to add to this, pop Bloodrage as soon as you enter combat. You gain 5 threat on each target (I think) for each point of rage you receive.
---
My story actually began with a game called Impossible Creatures. I loved that game and played the heck out of it. Well when I finally beat it I wanted another game very similar to it, so off to EB Games I went. When I couldn't find what I was looking for I asked the guy working if he knew of a similar game. He came from behind the desk and picked up a copy of Warcraft III. I still remember him handing it to me and saying, "You should try this. It's super popular and it's the same kind of gameplay." I was about 13 at the time and was like yeah looks cool.
---
Warcraft III instantly became my favorite game. I played it over and over again and loved the story so much. I was stoked when the frozen throne came out and bought it immediately, playing it just as much. Once WoW was announced my excitement grew even further. I looked forward to the day that I would be able to play it and, after a lot of begging, eventually convinced my parents to buy it for me. Since we had a crappy computer it took FOREVER for it to download, but once it did I was hooked. My allowance money pretty much went to the monthly subscriptions but I didn't care. It was worth it. I started my very first character, a dwarf warrior and played every opportunity I could. 
---
I played from about March of 2005 all the way through Cata and then dropped off. I played with some of my best RL friends and made wonderful guild friends. I only got to do about a third of MC in vanilla before TBC was released but I was able to conquer most raids up through Cata.  It was some of the funnest times that I can remember. I tried to get back in with BFA, but the game was just so different I was only subbed for a month. Once I heard about classic my nostalgic heart went crazy and I cant wait to start again.
---
So EB games guy, wherever you are, thank you! If it wasn't for your suggestion I may have never had the opportunity to experience such a wonderful game!
---
Is that why they're called "Internet-Ticket" and are interconnected to the webservice under [this link?](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/wow/166/167/channels)
---
My guy, come on.  There's no way that just inflating the retail sub numbers will be enough for the execs/shareholders.  Activision is entirely bottom line focused, there's no way they don't try and milk as much cash out of this as possible and entirely kill what made it a good game in the first place.
---
This. Classic will be so much help for the pserver community.
---
Lol this is what wow is all about! No 2 days going out to quest are the same, and you're never safe. You can even make a name for yourself and become famous in the server for being the raven hill camper hah.
---
Man. I really hope we dont get sharding....
---
&gt;I would say you did, otherwise I wouldn't have made that exact line.
---
You could've inferred it wrong, though....
---
&gt;Those 800 people are not tied to the record breaking year at all
---
How? Did they not work at the company when this happened? Did they not contribute to the profits in some way by being employed there, by engaging with the community (in this specific scenario with Ythisens) among other things? What's your definition of contribute? How do you know that these people did nothing to be part of the record breaking year? Do you work for bliz and know each one of these people and the work they did/didn't do?
---
&gt;I'd say yes.
---
Then you, my friend, have a messed up moral compass and may need to do some self reflecting. I don't think I could take a bonus if it meant I myself had to let people go because the profits that we projected to make were not met. If anything, I'd probably fire the analysts that came up with the expected profit because they were the ones that created this situation in the first place. 
---
&gt;The issue I have with the CM’s being laid off is they (Blizzard) keep telling people they want to be more vocal, talk to us more, have conversations with us so that they can make better games... but then they got rid of their eyes, ears, and voices.
---
I agree on that. 
---
&gt; I’m of the opinion that there is no job in the world where you should be  making multi-millions of dollars per year. Fine, lay off some office  staff, lay off a group of mobile devs who were running a game that you  don’t want to support anymore, but laying off active, well liked  community managers in the name of “cutting costs” and “saving money” is  bullshit. 
---
That is a general problem you have with capitalism and not with Blizzard. 
---
Also, I never said anything about cutting costs or saving money. Blizzard have given hints that they're changing things around, so obviously, if changing things around and/or making a new strategic plan doesn't involve the 800 people's positions, then they're fired. Why would they keep them if they're shifting focus to other departments/positions and those 800 positions are not needed anymore? They literally haven't used cuttings costs or saving money as some form of excuse for doing this?
---
Yes lmao I love it.
---
The goal isn't to kill them. The goal is to break their spirit. You win when they log off. Sorry enemy faction guy.. I know you had a nice night of grinding planned.. but this is our land. You're not allowed to play tonight. Better go play an alt lol
---
Truly brings meaning to the term 'contested territory'
---
I just re-watched those for the first time in like forever. That really does bring me back. Thanks!
---
Outrage culture is the new black. You have to remember too that most people on reddit are pleebs so they will complain about everything because their peers are. Then throw in this a wow subreddit and top it off being a classicwow sub. I’m not really surprised at this point!
---
My first toon was a pally.  I remember trying to solo SFK for the pally quest and eventually getting to it.  Was a noob back then didn’t know about grouping up for these things.
---
Because private servers don’t have the exact values so they like to play it safe by overtuning the bosses and disabling all world buffs inside raids. 
---
You can group up with me and my buddy when it launches. I have some tanking experience and could try to help you. I'll be rolling priest most likely so we would be able to find groups. We are super chill and patient just looking to have fun. Probably gonna go on pvp server NA.
---
Most people roll a new character after a while, anyway. And Blizzard comes out with a new expansion every couple years which is like a whole new game in most respects.
---
Pservers are more about the community and the people who somehow still like playing this game after 10 or 15 years.
---
If you think that most pservers are only developed up to BWL, then you probably haven't tried then in the last couple years.
---
The problem with (b) is what constitutes as "worse"? I think people fail to realize that auto reporting can become far worse than any rude person, as what is offensive differs from person to person and it almost impossible to not be offensive, we are after all human. So reporting each other for offensive language can ultimately result in us merely taking turns in muting each other
---
It is also curious to me that people are so vocal with #nochanges on almost every other front, yet when it comes to this issue, which could effect the game dramatically, people are so easily willing to just accept it
---
Especially on a pvp server....we’d get camped for hours. Fucking sucked 
---
Hunters are great in pvp and pve. ignore other flamer and noobs.
---
Damage is ok, kiting you the only class.
---
roll a hunter and have fun. Hunter is one of funniest and best class.
---
Yea sure it was only because of activision we get this game. Not because of ex blizzard devs , openly speaking about the topic for years, the community (actual payers) and private server community exploding in popularity.
---
Seems interesting.. You'd need at least hybrid gear (not strictly str/stam) and a lot of int.  
---
Rotation would probably be downranked shocks on cooldown.  not minimum rank, but a mana-efficient rank.  Plus you don't want to use earth shock max rank all the time in case you somehow pull threat.  Then once you get clearcast you pop off a chain lightning or max rank shock.  All the spell crits will also proc the extra chance to get melee crit talent.  I'm not sure if you can, but flame tongue can crit and if that procs the "extra melee crit chance" talent than that is a nice boost as well.  Flame tongue is also respectable DPS as it bypasses armor and instead deals with the mobs fire resist.  Same with frostbrand if you're fighting fire monsters. 
---
The spec itself is probably something like this.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zq0hoZxi0dVRkx
---
Bear in mind I haven't played this spec at all before but I have done a lot of shaman in general at level 60.  I envision using a relatively fast 2h weap (usually in lower demand because of the lower burst damage!) but if you have it Hand of Edward the Odd would be a great weapon for this spec.  The procs synergize very well with the hybrid caster nature, and since you're autoattacking a lot that'll hopefully be a decent amount of procs.  If you do use a 1h, you could probably ignore the 2h weapon talent point and put it elsewhere but IMO you want to keep 2h weapons if only for PVP so you can put windfury on there and be a much bigger threat burst-damage wise.  
---
This is really a PVE spec though, seems geared towards fishing for spell crits and getting the bonus melee crit + flurry uptime with it.  Interesting idea, seems like it needs a very unique gear set to get viable. 
---
I hope someone else responds as well and helps further what I tried to cobble together here =)
---
Fair, that would be a better idea.
---
My first experience of wow was at a friends house watching them play vanilla wow at a family party. They were playing in west fall and also had an undead character, none of their characters were above level 35 and they shared the account as siblings.
---
My neighbour got wow in BC and I would go round quite often, I got to make my own character and got a couple up to level 20 or so. Then finally i got wow myself in June 2008. The escapism it provided for me given how ill my mum was was unbelievable. It gave me a safe separated place that I could retreat to and enter a different world.
---
I created a Tauren Druid and played to level 15, then a Belf mage which I got to level 70 the week of wotlk release. However, I decided to restart and create a new Tauren Druid again - called Foxybull. I mained them through wotlk and reached 80 for the argent tournament. I was never much into raiding but did do icc when it was relevant (I mean we had it for 12 months there wasn’t much else to do). 
---
I mainly liked alts and levelling so that kept me happy. I then decided I didn’t want to think about wow too much and decided I would only play during the summer (I was still at school until late cata) so I would play for about 3 months of the year max and that was it. I did that for all of cata-Legion when I finally decided to just play casually. I am now in a guild I love and have been for a while, I am well known for achievements (nearly at 20k) but I mainly just play for fun - I mean what is the point otherwise?
---
I would camo myself on the chains leading to MC, and Mind Control people into the lava to slow their MC raid down a little.  I loved swimming them to the bottom of the lava and releasing Mind Control once they didn't have a chance to swim back up
---
Well the reality is that vanilla chat was filled with gold sellers, people spamming junk, straight up cursing etc... in chat chat.  Some people would rather have that than right click report some people prefer right click report.
---
So it's kind of a pick your poison kind of thing.
---
&gt; How? Did they not work at the company when this happened? Did they not  contribute to the profits in some way by being employed there, by  engaging with the community (in this specific scenario with Ythisens)  among other things?  
---
I knew you would quote me out of context. This is actually hilarious. Read the entire comment on this, instead of cherry picking. I literally said; Just because they were there during the record year, it doesn't mean Blizzard suddenly owe them jobs which isn't needed anymore, after revising strategic plans.
---
&gt; I don't think I could take a bonus if it meant I myself had to let  people go because the profits that we projected to make were not met. 
---
My entire point is that they're not doing this, because profits weren't met, and I never alluded that. I literally said it was due to strategic changes, which doesn't mean it's because they're fucked and not making the board happy, based on whatever projections of revenue they were hoping for. Not sure where you're getting this from.
---
No really, people think its a backhanded comment (well it is) but no -- if you are in a small group you're extremely unlikely to ever get ganked by the solo rogue, hunter or druid.  They will seek out an easier target.
---
Even if you are in STV, having at least 1 buddy with you dramatically cuts down your likelyhood to be attacked by the other faction.
---
Yeah you don’t have to swim long if you hug the right side of it 
---
What does melting faces mean? I thought this was a meme but people are serious?
---
More in development can mean anything, could be OWL. They are stripping costs in game dev, we know this from leaks about CFO
---
The gloomy, creepy atmosphere in these is great! I love the painting style as well.
---
Keep it up!
---
My first dungeon ever run in Vanilla on my druid back in early 2005 was Wailing Caverns.  Totally skipped over RFC.
---
I don't get this logic. Let's say there's a quest to kill 10 wolves. If you solo and kill 10 wolves, you get 100% exp. 
---
But if you invite everyone around you to a 5-man party and EACH kill 10 wolves = 50 wolves total. Do you get less than 100% exp per person?
---
It was RFC. I saw a group looking for a tank, and not knowing what that was at the time, I asked the leader, and got the simple answer that was "a Warrior", and hey, guess what I was. The problem was that nobody explained my actual role to me though, so I just went in and played like the colossal noob that I was. I can't recall how, but somehow we beat it, even though I'm pretty sure I wasn't even the one who was pulling.

The lack of explanation for my role would haunt many of my future groups, and believe me, I ran *many* dungeons while levelling. It took all the way until RFK (must have been ~lvl 30) until someone actually told me I had an ability called Taunt that I was supposed to use, that mobs were actually supposed to be hitting me, and that I should probably get a shield (was using white vendor 2-handers).
---
Rage potions exist
---
Rip but as long as i get no changes classic wow and they keep doing diablo 2 ladders im happy. 
---
I don't understand why the original 3 or so posts from months ago weren't stickied, but a while back people posted a link to [warcraftrealms.com](https://warcraftrealms.com)
---
If you remember your first character's name, or your main characters name, you may find them on here, and it will tell you dates of certain milestones (hit level 10/15/20) and which guild you rolled with at that time.
---
I was under the impression that I started around patch 1.9 or so, but I hit level 10 (which can be done in one sitting, but likely 2 for me) on October 21st, 2006, which was 1.12.2, last patch before pre-TBC patch hit. It was a human rogue, and it was my main. There was only 3 months between me starting to play WoW and TBC realease, but it feels SO much longer.
---
Now, I KNOW for sure that I missed out on a lot of Vanilla, and I am even MORE excited about the release of Classic.
---
Blessed. As stupid as it may sound, WoW in those days, when I was transitioning from a stupid little shit into a stupid teenage little shit, was literally the best thing in my life. Those moments when my brother would leave home (queue Chemical Bros!) and I'd jump on the PC to get a few more levels down. We only had 1 PC and 1 account, so every hour played was super valuable.
---
Getting back from school, I was always looking forward to that moment. Naturally I wasn't in a position to greatly excel in the game since I couldn't put as much time in.
---
But now, boi, I'm planning 12-14 hour DAILY sessions as soon as it launches. Summer 2019 is gonna be epic as fuck. The magic wont be the same as  the first time playing it, but I think we'll get a very unique "new" take on it. Especially if you go in knowing all that you know, and having some friends along for the ride.
---
I can just feel all the future memes from this. IT WILL BE GLORIOUS!
---
Shield block should also be used on cooldown on single-target threat fights as long as you aren't losing aggro.  But you summed it up nicely!
---
Love this story!  Thanks for sharing!
---
I get your point, but I'm just blown away people enjoy the questing more in retail. I couldn't even finish leveling to 120, I got 90% through 119 and decided I couldn't take the quests anymore lol.
---
I've felt the questing stopped being enjoyable in wotlk and I got very into the mood of "lets get this leveling shit over with" just to get to cap and be over that hump. Before I took my time and thoroughly enjoyed it so much.
---
Not sure what changed exactly, but that's how I feel about it D:
---
&gt; The "googogogo pull!!!" crowd will fail miserably in Classic. 
---
Oh boy, i cant wait to play classic again.
---
Probably less than 5% of the overall playerbase for it tbh.
---
Gogogo was already a thing in Vanilla so i reckon it will be a thing in Classic also, though probably only in (semi) organised groups. But we did make it a thing to run dungeons quite fast in groups made up of members of the realms best guilds back then.  
---
Cant really find anything supporting what you are saying. Can you link me.
---
Makes me proud to play for the Horde :')
---
Hey aklbos,
---
Thanks so much for listening, the show tackled Holy Priests in episode #55, healers on the whole in episode #51, and shadow priests in episode #22. However, we haven’t had a general priests call yet, something I should get around to soon considering it’s the class I’m leaning towards playing in Classic! Shall try to put something together soon :)
---
Thanks for giving it a try! :)
---
Glad to help out, thanks for listening!
---
It depends a lot on how respawns/quest items work. If they're strictly like they were in vanilla, grouping is terrible for over 50% of quests, it will dramatically slow you down. Quests like 60 centaur ears/thistleshrub glands/sidas bag are completely impossible with no shared quest items, they would literally take you 2-3 hours to complete a single quest in a group of 4 or 5.  
---
It seems likely that regardless of how much people demand no changes, every reasonable person that plays in alpha/beta will argue for shared quest items and increased respawn rate (like has been implemented on all popular private servers) and in that case group your heart out! It will still be slightly slower overall than a well played solo class, but much faster for classes like warrior/rogue/pally and way more fun.
---
I was just going to say this.  The dungeons are a perfect place to teach you your role.  They start off fairly simple with the exceptions of some (for noobies keep in mind).  They then get progressively harder with harder and harder pulls and bosses as you level. 
---
Should be up there in the next few days, until then you can also listen along at iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher etc etc so the show is definitely available on mobile and ready to go for you at work if you listen along to your phone somehow! :)
---
In what world does a twinked priest one-shot people in a 10-19 BG?
---
Glad it helps with the drive and would love to have you one day.  Just let me know the topic that you can chime in on and we’ll tee it up!
---
I can't believe people have FOND memories of Thottbot. What a useless piece of crap! (sorry if this offends anyone). 
---
Thanks to [warcraftrealms](https://warcraftrealms.com), I recently found out that I started playing during the LAST vanilla patch (drums of war) even though it seems like I played for almost a year before TBC released, it was actually just 3 months.
---
WITH THAT SAID, even during THAT time, Thottbot was not just user-unfriendly, it was not useful. The thing that people claim to have used it for (finding items or quests) seemed to be the very things missing from it. It was almost like an item database, it could tell you stats, but often times did not tell you where to find it. Don't even get me started on quests. I distinctly remember asking in general chat about the start of a particular quest and whether anyone knew where it was and getting responses like "Thottbot is your friend" and being so infuriated by that response, because it most certainly wasn't my friend - Google gave me better results than Thottbot did, and I think I was using Yahoo for a search engine then ("Google it" was a relatively new term then).
---
I can't be the only one who felt that way - does anyone else NOT have fond memories of Thottbot? To me personally, WoWhead was a god sent when I discovered it.
---
If you're interested in the Defias story, I'd recommend listening to Countdown to Classic's episode about the Deadmines (#4 I think?). The episode touches on a ton of lore and history I never knew or read into. It helped round out my knowledge and opinion of the instance. Really cool stuff!
---
Firstly, do we have any indication that it won’t come to Classic? I’d love to think wishfully but they mentioned it themselves and haven’t refuted it yet, have they?
---
Secondly, Right click report in its current state *is* a problem. It only takes a small handful of people to ban somebody for no real reason. It gets abused in the live game, and Classic has so many more reasons for people to abuse it. Plus, we’re all on the same realm, instead of being passerby’s for life. Not to mention, the silence feature the ban gives you is much more detrimental in Classic than live.
---
&gt; Just because they were there during the record year, it doesn't mean Blizzard suddenly owe them jobs which isn't needed anymore, after revising strategic plans.
---
Talk about cherry picking, you literally said
---
&gt;Those 800 people are not tied to the record breaking year at all 
---
But anyway, 
---
&gt;My entire point is that they're not doing this, because profits weren't met, and I never alluded that
---
That's fair, you did not. But....
---
&gt;On the earnings call, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick told investors that the company had “once again achieved record results in 2018" but that the company would be consolidating and restructuring because of missed expectations for 2018 and lowered expectations for 2019. 
---
[Source](https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-begins-massive-layoffs-1832571288)
---
So, that's the reason that was given, they didn't meet expectations (financial) for 2018, they're lowering them for 2019, which is good that they're hopefully being more realistic, but sucks for the 800 that now have a questionable future. 
---
Thunder Clap is battle stance in vanilla. FYI
---
It's a blessing as much as it is a curse. The game was such an amazing experience growing up as a kid and at the same time it takes away so much of your life to play it.
---
Because imagine you have a group of five people, two pugs, and two of your friends. Your two friends are a warrior, and a shaman, you are a warrior and really want Kresh's back to create a BADASS RP set, while someone in the group actually needs it. 
---
Instead of rolling against one person, he is now against three people, who will all roll and just end up trading the item to their friend.
---
Similarly, if someone really needs an item, everyone in the party can need it, and then tell the person "Give me x amount of money and I'll give you this" 
---
It's super exploitable and there's no legitimate reason to add tradeable loot for dungeon loot. 
---
Yeah, this post does a decent job but it looks like it’s from someone who played Wrath, not Vanilla. 
---
Thunder Clap is battle stance and there is no mention of stance dancing in any capacity.
---
Revenge and cleave are far more important than thunder clap — but nothing beats the king, Tab-Sunder.
---
Without a doubt rogue. 
---
Are you implying that an option to report toxic edgelords spewing out racial slurs, players scams and other bs is bad and should not be in game? 
---
lol
---
Hey SarcasticNinjuh,
---
I’ve tried and wish I could, but for some strange reason Google Play Music Australia doesn’t have podcasts yet, so I can’t upload to it, it should be coming soon though hopefully (as they’ve been saying for a year.....) so will keep checking!
---
As much as we want to apply logic to this, the fact is nobody really knows when it is coming out.
---
As far as I know, that was then and this is now?
---
I'll definitely try Stitcher - everything else is filtered out by the evil internet overlords down in IT. 
---
Thanks!
---
As a player is attacking a mob, take their health down just enough for the mob to kill them.
---
Awesome! Just recently got back into your podcast and it’s as good as I remember. Super excited you have Defcamp and Melderon on this one as well, those guys are great. Keep it up Josh!
---
That's why i love vanilla dungeons, there was variety, not two of them felt the same. Though i would honestly not mind at all if more dungeons were large and epic like BRD.
---
But I gotta disagree about the monastery. It was a stronghold of a militant sect, where they trained combat and tortured people. It didn't make sense how they kept the main hallway nearly unprotected and each room isolated from the rest, as if each wing was a completely separate, independent location, and not a part of a one large complex. They actually adressed that issue somewhat in the cata revamp, by merging some of the instances together.
---
If anything, i think this kind of design would fit more a prison location like Stockades. With the guards controlled middle room, and 4 closed doors leading into different parts of the prison.
---
Enh Shaman are hilarious in groups. Typically goes like this:
---
- They use Windfury ... it procs, they gain aggro on every single fight and the tank loses their f'ing mind.
---
- They then use Rockbiter ... it pulls aggro on every fight and the tank loses their f'ing mind.
---
- The group shits on the shaman to use another weapon buff. The Shaman cries that they won't want to use fire or frost because of dps loss.
---
- The group asks the shaman to heal a certain boss because pulling aggro would mean a wipe. The shaman casts 2 GHWs and goes OOM.
---
Respect and dignity don't make the stock price go up.
---
Blizzard gave away the rights to this kind of shit when they took the 2008 Activision buyout instead of saying go fuck yourself. 
---
Amazon is doing it to Twitch. Activision is doing it to Blizzard. Bank of America did it to Merrill Lynch and the list goes fucking on.
---
Corporate overlords care about the board and the stock price .. full stop.
---
I'm just gonna get my friends to need on everything and trade it to me because I'm going to abuse their shitty system so they change it.

Great to have you back! If you’ve been away for a while then I highly recommend the last 10 eps, the show has evolved a fair bit the last couple of months, and there’s some fun stuff there! Always happy to have the guys on, they’re great fun, we have a great time with Orcbit too.
---
I dropped out of life for a long time with WoW. Only started rejoining in my mid twenties.
---
No school, no job, WoW from wake up to sleep. I'm sure there's a few more. While it took a lot from me I wouldn't have changed it. It was an escape. Real life was too scary and painful for me to navigate.
---
Oh, so nice. As forsaken player, I like it more!
---
That's not in game is it? Submit your ticket in game.
---
&gt; But anyway, 
---
I'm not sure if you're actually retarded or just got a case of very selective reading. I literally wrote
---
&gt; Those 800 people are not tied to the record breaking year at all 
---
Together with,
---
&gt; in the sense that you suddenly morally owe them more, because you just had a record year 
---
If you take the first part of the comment out of context, like you did, you make it look like I say they're not the reason for the record year. By adding the last line to it, I state they're not entitled to stay employed, just because they had a record year.
---
&gt; That's fair, you did not. But.... 
---
But what? 800 people laid off can still be a case of consolidating and restructuring, without trying to cut costs, especially paired with them talking about increasing dev time.
---
As much as I hate the idea of loot trading they’ve already cut so many jobs at this point more automated services are all but guaranteed.
---
It really was lol. From my 16-23 I was a full on WoW junkie. Dropped out of school, played it nonstop, never kept a job. I'm only recently piecing my life back together from it. Thankfully I've got a better grasp of my addictive personality now.
---
I feel like there's room for nuance than just yes or no.
---
When people think of right-click reporting they think of the flawed and easily-abused system we have from retail. No one wants that. For starters, no conspiracy of other players should ever be able to deny me what I paid a subscription fee to enjoy with no Blizzard employee in the loop to approve that.
---
On the other hand I can envision a right-click reporting system that I *would* want to have. I would like a system where people who get a sudden flurry of reports find themselves muted in chat. Trolling can't be solved via the ignore list, because a troll generates reactions from other people. For example, suppose there's a player-made global LFG channel and someone joins it to stir shit with some political trolling. I can ignore him, but I can't reasonably also ignore the 30 other people who get trolled into arguing politics in the LFG channel for the next ten minutes. I think it's more effective if the people who want that LFG channel to be clear for chat related to finding groups can right-click report that troll and mute him for ten minutes. That is actually very similar to the community-powered moderation we have on this forum via downvotes, which I'm sure I'll be experiencing here shortly.
---
But that's their own fault.  One should never afk in STV.
---
I get chills just thinking about the sound of some rogue coming out of stealth behind me.
---
Yup, I'd just rather they leave us to it! 
---
I want a system where right-click reports, even on mass get reviewed by a person, not just automatically disconnect/mute the person being reported.
---
Yeah multiple trinkets. It didn't last very long because the community was in an uproar.  
---
I rem getting hit for 6.5k crit damage by a double trinket shaman CL. 
---
I agree that 39 is likely the most fun Twink tier. I 
---
Orc because you need to be on horde for Windfury for max DPS.
---
There is no need. Let the special snowflakes get offended. If you could hit report you can hit ignore too. If the guy ends up being ignored by almost everyone on the server then that's on him lol.
---
Lots of people get salty about stuff they think is unfair such as twinking or multiboxing.
---
I love stories like this. Thanks for sharing! Some of my fondest memories of WoW are from twinking, and that's what I plan on doing in Classic. I'm going to have a main to farm gold and most, if not all, my alts will be twinks. So much fun!
---
&gt;Those 800 people are not tied to the record breaking year at all in the sense that you suddenly morally owe them more, because you just had a record year
---
Again, if those people contributed to the company in a record breaking year, which they did (unless you know what jobs they did, or rather, didn't do) then as far as I'm concerned yes, they are morally owed to retain their job (or at least a job within the company) because they were part of the overall team that made it happen. Again, unless you know what jobs these people were/weren't doing then I'm not exactly sure how them being part of the company at the time of a record breaking year wasn't in part because they, even 1 of them, was there&gt; 
---
&gt;If you take the first part of the comment out of context, like you did, you make it look like I say they're not the reason for the record year. By adding the last line to it, I state they're not entitled to stay employed, just because they had a record year.
---
Ok, let's break this down. You're not necessarily saying that they didn't contribute to the record breaking year, you're just saying that even if they did they're not entitled to still be employed, right? 
---
Looks like we'll have to agree to disagree on the definition of morality, because I couldn't go to bed with a clean conscience if I laid people off after a record breaking year on top of taking a bonus (and we only know of one person's bonus, I'm sure some of the other execs got one too but could be wrong). 
---
&gt;But what? 
---
Did you not read the quote? Did you not see the source. They were laid off because "of missed expectations for 2018". Sure, reconstructing and things of that nature are going to be part of that, you're not wrong, but why they're doing it, you're wrong about that, it's because despite a record breaking year, they didn't meet financial expectations. 
---
Scamming should absolutely be reportable.  People saying bad words?  Eh.  Just put them on ignore and move on.
---
Don’t use addons to heal. Use your skill.
---
Let me give my answer to you in a creative way... Your answer to my question will provide you with my answer to yours... Ready?
---
Did a reporting system exist in 2004-2006 World of Warcraft? 
---
No Changes...
---
As long as classic becomes that much of a success then it's for the best; as another commenter said, in the case that that happens, they deserve it.
---
Alliance for salv. Because ya know threat + death is a dps loss
---
Yes. Yes it is. That's my whole point.
---
As much as I don't want to come off as sympathetic towards Blizzard's actions, it's not as big of a deal as people are making.
---
Outrage culture is ridiculous, and you have no idea how beneficial the CM actually was. I never heard of the guy before yesterday and I have paid attention to announcements and community interactions through WoWHead/MMO-Champ since I started playing.
---
The only public figures I'd be able to actually identify are Ghostcrawler (rip), Ion, and Lore. 
---
That's a url link you sent me. I clicked it in my browser. Open up your WoW client, hit escape, go to help, then submit ticket. 
---
Man. Reading this brings back so many memories. I know exactly how you feel. I have not been a guild leader but I have gotten sucked into being an officer and Loot Council member twice now, against my better judgement because I have seen these same things play out multiple times before, almost identically to how you describe. The mid-raid whispers are maddening. Trying to keep track of what you have told who and whose confidence you must keep when they are whispering you negative things about people and then being nice to their face or on vent. I see both sides too because I am a meter-whore tryhard myself and the fun in the game for me is pushing the limits. I honestly find PvE boring since the encounters are scripted and its hard for me to understand why people cant/dont want to excel since always strive for number 1. I'm the warrior bringing engineering devices and taunting whelps to macro /sit for enrage procs and beating the mages in damage on suppression room. 
---
It's exactly like you describe where you realize who is holding you back, you can see it in plain numbers and its hard to ignore. Here we all are, wasting hours and hours getting frustrated, wiping on a boss several times over because its simply not dying that last 10%. Then you look at the footage pre-wipes or at the damage logs per encounter and you realize you are doing literally double the damage of some people once you truly look down into the 20th-25th place on the meters you usually cant see while playing live. You think to yourself, wow.. if we literally just replaced 1 or 2 of those 25th place people with someone who could actually compete with me on the meters we would have this whole instance cleared in 30 minutes. And that is exactly what happens in most hardcore guilds where you have ten different rank14 fury warriors in there together basically "speed-running" everything.
---
You want the efficiency, you want the pain of wiping to go away and people to stop getting frustrated, to feel that joy again.. but at what cost?
---
These are the people you've built relationships with for months, talked all about raiding together with while you were leveling up, your plans for the future... then you get there and the divide is holding you back. So lets say you replace them with someone else who is smashing meters.. in my experience the kind of people who compete for the top spot like that are often lacking in the social skills that makes interaction enjoyable.
---
So cool, now youve got a raid full of badasses clearing content in 30 minutes, but are you even happy? Youre running efficiently now... just like you wanted.. but then you realize who wins each night is just up to RNG since youre all carbon copies of each other and everyone sort of grows cold with each other because theyre transient mercenaries for hire rather than friends that you grew with.
---
One really good example of this was whatever that mini-boss was in the beginning of Gruul's lair, where you had to have a mage kite him with spellsteal. We had a long-time Mage "class leader" in our guild on live vanilla, who had been with us through a guild split in, raiding into BWL and AQ, and then when TBC came out continuing the same guild with everyone excited for a fresh start. We must have tried for 2-3 weeks to kill this boss and we kept wiping to the mage dying. Everyone loved him, so we all would make excuses for him. We wanted to be a friendly loving guild, not a cold tryhards only kind of environment.
---
Well one night, for whatever IRL reason, that mage class leader couldnt show up. We had one of my PvP arena buddies replace him (someone who barely ever raided at all and wasnt even familiar with the encounter)...
---
He knocked it out of the park and we 1 shot the boss in 5 minutes, like you are supposed to do, since that boss is literally just the entrance-blocker for Gruul's lair and not even Gruul himself...
---
This opened everyones eyes and gave everyone a taste that sometimes the people you love and respect really are "holding you back" and causing endless amounts of frustration.
---
So like you said.. thrilling and frustrating at the same time. So hard to balance. And even now as I type this I'm not sure which environment I prefer.
---
It happens to me in other games even too. I usually have my friendly and fun guild, because I love the social aspect... but then the tryhard in me is screaming to please be efficient and ruthless to get this content down. Specifically in FF14 if you ever played that, the final boss Twintania in Turn 5 of the binding coil was the end boss of the current content patch, and the way it worked was much like wow with a weekly reset... well I would do the first parts 1-4 with my friendly guild, and so would others in different guilds... but somehow we ended up getting together a band of tryhards who wanted to stay up late the night before the reset and grind out the last boss together before they nerfed it (since it was so hard very few guilds actually killed it at all, and the fight was 20 minutes with numerous phases). We ended up killing Twintania right before the patch that made her 50% easier with damage dampening and all sorts of forgiving stuff, and it was an incredible experience, people were literally crying in the voice chat when we finally killed her lol. But.. I couldnt help but feel like I betrayed my friends, you know? I had to go back to them and tell them basically, yes, I killed it -- but I could only do it by leaving you guys behind. Of course I didnt tell them that specifically, but everyone knew it. Strange feelings.
---
Yep. No point in having higher theoretical DPS from WF because you’ll take over the tank in threat and die. 
---
Blizzard is scared of the Disney cops
---
Too bad that there isn't a writeup for paladin or druid tanks. 
---
I don't have any druid tank experience but they are perfectly capable for doing 5 mans while leveling and the end-game dungeons like UBRS, DM, Strat/scholo. 
---
Paladins are tougher but can also effectively tank, but it is rarer to see a successful paladin tank because it is tougher to play and the rest of the group needs to pay attention a bit more than with a warrior or druid tank.  But paladin tanking can be very fun. 
---
Paladins tank dungeons by making sure they are continually getting hit.  Paladins generate a lot of threat based on reflective damage - retribution aura being chief among these- and AOE spells such as consecrate.  There are also certain abilities that generate threat on each mob such as seal of light- each time you heal yourself with seal of light that small bit of threat is spread amongst all mobs that are in combat with you.  None of these things are huge individually, but by keeping them all rolling and building your own threat you can easily keep threat on multiple mobs at once despite DPS focusing one target. 
---
If your group is into it, you can also do AOE pulls- though this gets very tricky if you have certain mobs that cast heal or other tricky mechanics.  It's probably better to just focus those down.  But these are the abilities you use. 
---
Consecration- Use at beginning of pull to ensure initial aggro from the healer doesn't take the mob off you.  Since you are in melee range, consecration should be enough to ensure this happens.  Don't cast it until all mobs are within range (about 6-8 yards).  Also don't recast it immediately once it comes off cooldown as you will probably miss the last tick of the first spell.  It is a huge mana hog, so generally I only cast it twice as most pulls are safely in hand by then. 
---
Ret aura should be up constantly especially at the beginning of the pull.  This is a lot of AOE threat as ideally each mob whacks you in melee every 1-2 seconds.  
---
Seal of light is a big one but you don't get it until early level 30s.  This seal procs pretty often (at least every 2 or 3 hits) and heals you for a modest amount.  This heal aggro is spread throughout all mobs for a small amount.  It is a balancing act between using seal of light for AOE threat or using seal of righteousness / judgment of righteousness for superior single-target threat. 
---
Judgment is also a big one.  The simplest way is to have seal of righteousness and judge it- righteous fury boosts holy damage threat and the judgment of SOR isn't too bad, so that is a big single-target threat boost.  However, judgment of LIGHT provides you threat every time it heals wounded party members (overheal doesn't count) so this can be very helpful on trash packs when AOE threat is a bit more important.  Boss fights it wouldn't make sense- you're better off maximizing threat via seal of righteousness as the judgment of light heal isn't too much and probably won't be super relevant. 
---
Once you get to around level 40-50, you gain access to both consecrate and blessing of sanctuary, so your blocks start to be a big part of your threat.  Every block will deal holy damage as well which is modified and boosted by righteous fury.  Once you get holy shield, that damage itself does extra threat AND is boosted by righteous fury so on smallish pulls (3-5 mobs) holy shield can reliably do great threat to any mobs attacking you in melee range, with consecration around to pick up the remainder. 
---
The HUGE weakness of paladin tanks is lack of a taunt and mana issues.  There are wonky ways to solve either problem but they remain blatant weaknesses when contrasted to the strengths listed above.  
---
1.  Taunt.  You don't have it.  The only way for you to effectively drop aggro on an ally is to cast BoP on them, 3 minute cooldown and it lasts for 8 seconds.  Of course, the player themselves likely has an aggro-reducing tool so the hope is that within these 8 seconds they drop aggro somehow, and you do whatever you can to boost your own threat to try and get it back.  In the meantime, if DPS keep going full speed they will likely pull aggro from you so in order to be effective you have to have everyone stop DPS if you lose aggro on a single-target fight.  Big no-no.  Then again, you could just let that overeager DPS die and save your BOP if the fight is 'well in hand' and you can afford to lose the DPS.  As long as you do as much threat as you can, you will likely win the focus back once the current target is eliminated!
---
Lack of mana is a big issue as well.  Consecration itself drains a huge chunk of your mana, and other abilities all cost mana as well.  You have no way to gain mana back other than pots or demonic runs.  Spirit ticks are basically nonexistent- if you aren't casting spells you are generating a pathetic amount of threat and will lose aggro.  
---
This is best solved by only using consecration when you have to, and saving mana for more of the 'bread and butter' skills- your seals, judgment, holy shield, and exorcism/holy wrath if fighting undead.

The final weakness of paladin tanking is itemization.  You want to get a hold of strength, shield block, defense, stamina, intellect, and spell power which is a strange mix of stats to find.  You have to mix and match gear a lot, and the tier sets for paladin do not lend themselves great for tanks.  They are nice DPS pieces though, as most have str/stam/int and some spell power as well.  It is also possible to vary up your type of gear, for example you could be more spell-power and int oriented but without enough stam and defense you will get WRECKED in the final 5-mans / UBRS and be a bigger drain on healer mana, at the cost of doing more damage and grabbing more AOE threat. 
---
EXCELLENT write up for paladin tanking:

So worth it though; I know the layouts are pretty boring and linear by today's standards, but I just loved that place for some reason. I spent so much time in SM from like 32-40 on my NE hunter doing armory/cath runs to get a full set of scarlet mail for when I could upgrade. I remember when I finally dinged 40 I just spent a good while just riding around in stormwind on my shiny new mount with my sweet full set of mail gear.
---
To be fair, Clap is amazing at reducing damage taken on big/aoe pulls. It shouldn’t be used for threat though. 
---
I played femorc Warlock on retail from 2005 to 2011. Guess my opinion :P
---
I think the ClassicCast crew are a bit delusional in their hopes for vanilla. From my recent experience with Classic-esque servers, there's not much a hope for a major return of a community. I don't think gamers are the same quality that they once were. 
---
Dotting and draining, ie spriest or affliction lock playstyle. Contrast to turret dps, ie destro or mage gameplay
---
Always nice to have confirmation (even though it was forced from the rumors).
---
But I don't expect them to change the release from Summer 2019. I'm certain that they did very thorough estimates and had a prognosis on how long it would take them to put it all back together, and considering they said Summer 2019 back in Blizzcon, that would imply they are fairly certain about that timeframe.
---
Even though Summer 2019 can mean anywhere from June to September, but I'm an optimist and believe June 16th will be the day.
---
So...a GM ticket...
---
Must’ve been a really poorly scripted server if flasks could be used by level 30s. 
---
why not just take that monitor and tower outside. just run the extension cord and find a nice spot to set up the desk  maybe throw on some swimming trunks and get that nice tan goin while you run some Brd. 
---
the mills are a masterpiece
---
if you ever make it into a displate you have a customer
---
cmon bruh. it is clear that the "penalty" is the division of the xp between each player. it's all in relation to playing solo.
---
Yes. That is what they're implying. Some people on this sub are *really* that delusional and self-entitled.
---
&gt; Looks like we'll have to agree to disagree on the definition of  morality, because I couldn't go to bed with a clean conscience if I laid  people off after a record breaking year on top of taking a bonus (and  we only know of one person's bonus, I'm sure some of the other execs got  one too but could be wrong). 
---
Looks like we'll have to agree to disagree, for sure. If their job isn't needed anymore, I don't see any reason to keep them for 'vanity's' sake. Blizzard, like any other company, is there to make profits. It's not a charity. Your position is not sacred, because you were part of a record team. About any serious company out there wouldn't keep 800 people in their positions, if they weren't needed, just because they felt like they owe them that. I'd agree with trying to find new positions for them. But lets be honest, if Blizzard are structuring around more devs, then 800 CMs probably won't be able to take up any of those positions.
---
&gt; Did you not read the quote? Did you not see the source. They were laid  off because "of missed expectations for 2018". Sure, reconstructing and  things of that nature are going to be part of that, you're not wrong,  but why they're doing it, you're wrong about that, it's because despite a  record breaking year, they didn't meet financial expectations. 
---
Missed expectations doesn't mean that you automatically have to try and find the money by firing 800 people. You could probably find the money by firing people. But you can absolutely miss the expectations, and restructure and consolidate the 800 positions into other departments to try and hit the expectations for the next year. In this case, the expectations are even lowered.
---
I gave you the benefit of the doubt but now you blew yourself. Well played.
---
Each wolf gives you about 30% the XP it would have given you had you killed it solo.
---
But you're also not taking into account that there's never going to be 50 wolves at once in an area, so your group is going to be waiting for the five minute respawns on what are probably 5-10 wolves.
---
Main things would be horde get windfury (chance for extra melee swings) and strength of earth totem (more str)
---
Alliance get blessing of salvation (lower threat generation), kings (10% flat str boost) and might (flat AP buff).
---
Also you say swords are undoubtedly top but in all honesty axes aren't massively behind and can be in some cases on par or possibly better, sure they aren't going to be better than KT swords but can you guarantee you will have both? Doubtful.
---
On a PvP server having someone with you can be huge. Rogues are fine because they can hide and even get a lot of 1v1 wins, but warriors have it rough.
---
maybe but there can only be so many mobs around... and you have to kill way more for quest item drop quests. If there is a camp filled with mobs, and you can kill them solo at the speed where you kill the last one as the first one you killed spawns... wouldn't it be better just to do it solo and get all the xp for yourself? Rather than doing it with a group, getting less xp for the same amount of time? All you are gaining here is less effort on your part... and socializing. But you can socialize for instances/pvp/elite quests rather than normal questing.
---
Who's most self-entitled, the guy who just wants to be left alone or the guy who wants to control what other people do and say?
---
I loved to stealth (night elf race spell) and surprise attack people with my hunter. Stealth breaks only at the end of casttime in vanilla so you could basically aim shot multi and serpent sting get on them before they even knew they were attacked.
---
Every game should allow scamming but provide players with the tools necessary to avoid it.
---
Lol, are you willfully ignorant of how a business operates or just a moron?
---
Ahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Nope. The devs dropped the ball in many parts of Vanilla where bringing your friends is actually a detriment.
---
Lack of dynamic spawns, high spawn rates, XP nerfs in group, non-shared quest items and mobs, not to mention fishing being impossible in a group.
---
There's lots of little ways in which Vanilla was more anti-group than later expansions. But hey, the devs didn't know any better.
---
I would bet the marketing budget is.... Direct Mail Campaign to anyone with a B.Net account. Some free interviews from the team and maybe a Beta or Headstart campaign. Beyond that i wouldnt expect too much because they, in the buisness devlopment, dont actually belive that people want this game.
---
Personally i think they are wrong, the initial cost to getting a server up and porting over expansions is cheap compared to making a new expansion. Especially the older expansions where the world DIDNT change and they actually have the Data and know it works on lives servers right now. EQ has been doing this for years and it amazed me that blizzard didnt want to exploit this opportunity sooner.
---
This is the best news ever! I was just reading/sifting through a few forum posts on WoW site (Classic Discussion subforum) and read the 'rumors'.
---
Thanks for posting this.
---
Another pro could be synchronizing professions. Tailor/Enchanter with Herb/Alchemy for example. One gets their gear enchanted for free other gets free Potions.
---
I know I did RFC first, but that wasn't very memorable. For me it's willing caverns on my enhance shaman. The insane quest reward (crescent staff) from thunder bluff. First ever blue boss loot, first ever loot with a set bonus! The leatherworking recipe!
---
Everything about it was just perfect.
---
I think the best class if you want to play warrior would be warrior. 
---
Still having a hard time deciding between druid and mage for my main. I was leaning more towards druid since that's what I've mained the longest on live however I main feral and balance on live and I know some of those builds aren't the strongest in classic depending on what type of content you're doing which is why I also had mage in mind but I feel like theres going to be a lot of competition for a mage spot.
---
What I really want to know is how enjoyable is healing in classic as a resto druid? I want to make sure I like healing since I know that's what i'll be doing the most if I want to get in groups as a druid. 
---
Except there are never enough mobs in an area, which means that you're *always* waiting for those 5-minute respawn timers to rotate just so everyone can get their quest items / kills.
---
I hate to say this, but Vanilla is very unfriendly to grouping up vs later expansions, likely because the devs didn't know what to reward vs what to punish yet.
---
I wouldn't sweat it dude, look forward to release and have fun with like minded players in game. Ignore all the hate and negativity, like i said they can go back to pservers and none of us will notice.
---
fuck them if it's not summer. We've waited for years. We hoped for 2018. Then we hoped Summer 2019. Now they make it ambiguous - fuck their wait time! I' m on the edge of my seat. I've even went against my creed and played some private servers because I'm boiling with anticipation and can't wait. Just... fuck them if it's not summer. 
---
Huge fan of the show /u/joshcorbo82 keep up the good work - you deserve a much bigger audience 
---
YeH WC was much more memorable to me.  I ran it countless times skinning perfect deviate scales to make deviate scale belts for the 19 twinks.  
---
This ^
---
Early in vanilla, Volchan could be kited from Burning Steppes to SW.  It would fall easily to a small group or single well-equipped 60, but it was always fun to watch it tear things up.
---
I'm probably going to do it again as well. Just to relive the memories. 
---
There's kind of a funny story surrounding my first dungeon, Ragefire Chasm. WoW was my first MMO and I didn't know the concept of grouping for anything except to save time on a kill quest. I got a quest to kill a dude for his heart, the NPC pointing me to a big portal only a few meters away. I went inside and something was different; there were golden dragons surrounding the enemy portraits.
---
My Hunter sent his pet in and watched it be eaten alive by a roaming rock elemental and a worm before I decided to run away and think "that quest must be a challenge mode I need to level up for." I discussed it with friends and we all thought it was overtuned or something until one of them said it was supposed to be done with 5 people. I felt really dumb but it all clicked after that and I learned how to form groups for this hardcore, elite challenge at level 16.
---
I think Ragefire Chasm is pretty good at teaching people how to pull small groups and avoid patrols but otherwise I look back and laugh at myself for thinking that place was scary and potential endgame content.
---
It really seems that way. Any mention of #nochanges is instant downvote it seems. 
---
could be in closed beta now with nda of course. 
---
I'm not a video gamer. I used to do consoles when young (last console I bought was a Sega Genesis ... I just played on friend consoles until around Sony Playstation 2). After that I turned PC only.
---
My background is PnP RPG and always will be. This got me into mmorpgs in 1999. I them was pretty hardcore starting with AC then Daoc, SWG, CoH, AO leading into Wow Beta. I got into beta in nearly all old school mmorpgs other than AC (because I didn't even know about until it's 1st launch month).
---
I have zero interest in modern mmos. They are a shit, industrialized product with nearly zero connection with the roots of the genre. Classic Wow reflects the last of the style of mmorpg I am willing to play. Other than Classic, I am currently only looking forward to Pantheon and Camelot Unchained. I could even live without playing a mmorpg as long as my core RPG group still keeps going. 
---
Always protect reasons for getting together in real life to do things. It's sad that many play PnP RPGs now over the internet and never get together.
---
\*raises Gorehowl\* "We will never buy loot boxes!"

"HEY THERE fellow World of Warcraftians! Getting tired of farming for those bindings? Well we have the solution for you! For just 29.99 you can get a random roll of either the left or right binding! Who knows which you'll end up with as the chance is left to RNG! Good luck! And may Thunderaan be with you!"
---
G'huun was an allegory
---
Hey, it's not your fault that we as newbies can picture tanks as good for offense *and* defense! I used to think "tank" was just a heavy armor melee class so I assumed Shaman and Paladin would also be potential tanks in a group. At least your healer wasn't tanking.
---
I can imagine that because it's built on the current client, that it may be easy to get those addons developed and running.
---
same here.  I got one in '05 in tanaris, was pretty useful for me as well, so I used it.  I played on plenty of pservers over the years, never got any epic boe, although the AH was always full of them, so they must have dropped for somebody.    To be fair I was always notoriously lazy on the grinding, I usually kill the minimum amount of things for quests and played as much in 5 man groups as possible.   So my chances at getting random loot would be lower than average.   I would rather hang out in the city on my bank alt, trying to earn the gold on the trade market. 
---
Probably.  But we can't base our expectations on Vanilla addons.
---
thank you :) my files are not high res enough for that site but they're good to go on inprint and redbubble (RB has a metal print option too) if you are interested:

Do it.  It's pretty fun to learn something new.
---
I still play diablo 2, i just want to play vanilla forever too.
---
Thanks so much fresh_avocado, I appreciate that. The show is doing great, but for sure a lot of people haven’t heard of it who may enjoy it, so hopefully word slowly but surely gets around. In the meantime, I’ll keep pumping out the episodes!
---
My main complaint with the honor system is the impact is caused on open world pvp. I turned from participating merely out of fun to a grinding green players for honor when waiting on your BG tier. 
---
Entire lvl 50 zones get locked down by one faction grinding lower level players to gain honor ranks. This isn't fun participation. It's just grinding real players with no intent of fair and fun play.
---
Well, I hope I don't need to pug - although that might not strictly fit casual. Just laid back, relaxed raiding, hopefully with people I can get to know. Maybe playing more modern WoW and FFXIV has left distaste for pugging in my mouth.
---
Still, great thanks for the insight! Might consider priest more strongly, now. Maybe still keep thinking of warrior, too. Plenty of time to make my decision. 
---
Oh yes, a great idea. If you encounter other players, instead of grouping and working together, you can kindly ask them to leave the area so you can have the whole spawn for yourself. 
---
If the option is to solo in an area with 4 strangers or group up with 4 strangers to clear faster and safer, grouping is better.  
---
Even if there is 5-10 wolves spawn, do you think that you will get all of it for yourself.
---
That's a false dichotomy and a pretty sleazy framing of it too.
---
It's been shown over and over again that heavy policing of speech in communities (this includes moderation and *gasp!* censorship) improves the quality of those communities over time. 
---
How? Because it turns out the only people generally affected by this kind of reporting are the fragile, white gamerbros (the true snowflakes, let's be real) who hypocritically cry about protecting our *#Gamerwords,* such as the n-word or the f-slur.
---
There is no need to protect these insecure hypocrites hiding behind the veil of “muh free speech.”
---
The level of willful delusion required to believe that right-click reporting is a net-negative on the community is insane. It's a level of [belief perseverance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance) so powerful, if it was an energy source you could power the world on it.
---
I'll look into their metal print quality then
---
I bought ATVI like two years ago and the price is now nearly the same 
---
Unless you're in a guild where you KNOW your main tank will be fed threat gear and you KNOW you can rely on him to put out immense amounts of threat, human will edge it out simply due to Salvation. Your theoretical DPS will be higher on horde but you are more likely to be able to do more DPS on alliance side simply because you're won't be (as) threat capped.
---
Classic is not the old vanilla client. Combat text (including healing) is built into the base game.
---
Good info here. 
---
I'd recommend OP find some breakdowns of threat per rage for each ability, as well as threat per second for each ability. When you know the priority for each of those lists you can choose your abilities based on how full your rage bar is. 
---
Outside of that tanking is mostly about knowing the pulls in a dungeon well enough to mark mobs for cc and kill order. That comes with practice, and there should be enough new people that you won't be expected to know everything. As long as you can figure out how to use a ranged weapon and LOS ranged mobs towards the group you shouldn't have too much trouble.
---
Blessed Starting playing Vanilla 2 months into the game up till wrath of the lich king when i quit . In that time i got married had kids had jobs on and off. I was a full time househusband with jobs here and there. My wife worked full time. I played when i was not so busy with the three kids and other stuff. Then after i quit wow got divorced, hardly see my kids. Been waiting for a decent MMO to come out was hoping for WOW 2 but thats not going to happen. Now classic is coming out cant wait. This time apart from my job i will have alot more time to play Classic. Which i bet my arse will be everyday. 
---
I had a lvl 80 warlock at wrath, did all the raids had all the purple gear. I was in a very good guild at the time. Great adults, we had ventrilo server for voice coms at the time. No discord back then lol.  Apart from my ex wife nagging me for raiding till 230am in the morning it was great. And yes it was my ex wife which got me into WOW. 
---
I was a counter-strike bloke at the time. I had a bet with my ex if i lost i would have to play wow for an hour. I said to her before i created my warlock, this game is going to be shit LOL. After 15 minutes of gameplay that changed forever. Ive still not played counter-strike since :)
---
That would actually be a good thing. Demo was in a very unfinished state and they confirmed that it was pretty much identical to their internal version. 6 months is not enough for a proper release. Now year - that might do the trick, especially with proper beta testing and enough time to fix the found issues. I liked their old approach it's ready when it's ready and I hate their current approach with fixed plans. It's obvious that fixed plans screw them over and over again, forcing to release unfinished games.
---
My experience has largely been that droughts happen for one of two reasons:
---
* People get through the content too quick, before Blizzard can put out the next content
---
* A new expansion has been announced so people don't care about this one anymore
---
TOC was a content drought because it was 5 bosses, and it largely superseded Ulduar.  When TOC came out, you didn't do any Naxx, and didn't do much of Ulduar anymore, because your focus was on TOC.  It was only 5 bosses, but you had to do them 4x per week, which added to burnout.  
---
On the other hand, when Cataclysm was announced, suddenly getting more out of ICC didn't really matter, and you were looking to form your 10-man only guild that you wouldn't have to raid with 15 idiots every night.
---
In TBC, I never felt there was never a "drought", until WotLK was announced.  People were working their way up the ladder until then.
---
In WOD, the "drought" was as soon as you finished your garrison and all you were doing is Facebook missions.
---
This is why there will be no drought in a Vanilla or TBC server, because they are not made to push you into the highest tier, nearly instantly gear you to be ready for it, and then quickly defeat it (on whatever difficulty).  They're made for you to grind your way up the totem pole.
---
Even WotLK will be pretty good so long as they make Ulduar a longer patch and ToC a shorter patch.
---
Run. Literally, Run.    
---
No mounts till 10 more levels.
---
And I live where it gets over -40c. Summer is when I can have some air.
---
Report someone? yes.
---
Easy reporting system that is easily abused?  No.
---
There should be a way of reporting folk who break TOS.  There should not be an easily abused system that lacks moderation, which can be used to ban anyone a streamer doesn't like.
---
BFD. Don’t think I got any loot (was a hunter, no real hunter loot in there, believe it or not!). It was my first multiplayer experience in any mmo. The group taught me about need/greed. I remember loving it. The added pressure of playing with others made it so exciting. 
---
I played an F ton of wc3 but I was like 11 when it dropped so I couldn’t remember/wasn’t engaged in the story.
---
Even Wow I didn’t know the story or even wtf I was doing yet it still sunk it’s claws into me
---
&gt; For all intents and purposes, the MMORPG genre is effectively dead.
---
I'd say it's the MMO aspect. Games like Skyrim, Final Fantasy, and ESO have shown that people do enjoy and want the RPG element still - Blizzard has managed to remove the RPG aspect of the game from WoW, so it's no longer an MMORPG and is just an MMO. It's what happens when you try to coddle the playerbase so it's "less confusing" and "more streamlined".
---
&gt; Oh yes, a great idea. If you encounter other players, instead of grouping and working together, you can kindly ask them to leave the area so you can have the whole spawn for yourself.
---
I know you're trying to make a joke here, but I don't think you've been playing Vanilla, have you?
---
This is the problem. If you're a class with an instant tagging spell then you can literally steal every single mob in the area without any of the group getting them. It's really that fucking stupid.
---
The addons will not actually heal for you. They are simply a visual &amp; clicking customization so that a player can more efficiently decide what actions to take.
---
How do you measure the "quality of a community"?  Do you think all WoW players would agree on this metric?
---
Nothing wrong with tokens, though.
---
Spam sapping a group trying to summon people to the stone was incredibly enjoyable.
---
"Hey, everyone in guild, join LFG and right-click report this other guy because he's also looking for a tank."
---
I always wipe when I get to the lake
---
Mages are completely impossible to stunlock.  We'll assume the rogues manage to land a cheap shot on a mage, because probably one of them will, or can force it with vanish.  The mage can either iceblock immediately, or he can blink.  Lets assume he chooses to blink.  At this point, the rogues have to give chase and stun him again, and many are slowed.  Just as the rogues get to the mage, he ice blocks.  
---
The other mages, who have somehow all been blinded (even with blinds very low range compared to mage spells- I guess the huddled for easy CC), can either wait out the blinds, or they can iceblock themselves.  
---
This is a great deal of effort and cooldowns to eliminate about half of one mage's HP pool, and probably one total iceblock.  
---
Stunlocking is a 1v1 thing against enemies that can't break stun.  You rely on using CC to regain energy, and are playing a game that is slower than normal.  
---
No, actually ive never seen a warrior touch a mage surprisingly 
---
Yeah that guy is weak. Screw sleep and only take 20min naps as needed.
---
Trust me. It still lives up to the hype.
---
I vividly remember the first time logging into a pserver, seeing ram packed starter areas, cities bustling with characters of all levels.
---
It’s some magical shit. It won’t be like the first time it will be *better* because you get overjoyed being able to replay it 
---
I have mentioned prior that end-game grinds like the Artefact weapon and Heart of Azeroth create the perception of endless levelling.
---
It could very well be that.
---
However, although WoD had its many downsides - the levelling was outstanding.
---
To be fair, it was the first time they introduced World Quest (Progress bar) spots - so it could've been a 'new' factor.
---
When you set up a never-ending grind at end-game - you create a perception that you'll never really hit 'maximum power'.
---
That can be disheartening for most.
---
I could have sworn i used to use thunderclap all the time when tanking in vanilla.
---
I don't love Scarlet Monastary, because it's always a half-hour fucking ordeal to get to it, for Alliance. Especially since there's a ~99% chance that at least one person in your group doesn't have a mount.
---
There's no such thing as a perfect system. From my experience with DSK people tend to camp their spot because they really want a specific weapon, and they end up undergeared as a result. It feels terrible to use your spot on some bracers and then lose your BiS weapon.
---
Alternatively I might just have a second reel which is used for weapons.
---
lack of dynamic spawns, five minute spawns and non shared quest item mobs are not anti group. they are "spend more time in my game" *items*. and of course the game has to be balanced somehow like professions or choosing a spec but overall the game rewards are far better in a group then solo.
---
haha, my bad
---
Don’t let some random internet strangers judgment bear on you.
---
I’m not saying don’t take responsibility, because certainly some of it was yours, but also Vanilla wow was new and so addicting to many of us. 
---
I know guys who dropped out of school because of it and then ended up doing amazing things in their careers that they may never have done if they followed the traditional school route 
---
Who knows, maybe it was for the best
---
This already exists. In Retail it's against ToS to falsely report a person, especially as part of mass-harassment.
---
And yes, people have gotten suspended because of mass reporting.
---
I was not a teenager when I first played the game, when Classic was released I was already a Veteran gamer and a young adult.
---
But let me tell you from experience, when I Install games like Lands of Lore 2 or play Secret of Evermore.
---
THEY ALWAYS hit the sweet spot. Don't you worry about it. The games of our youth will always hit that spot...
---
I will just join, because WoW is legit a really good game, no nostalgia involved here.
---
I strongly disagree, if you go solo you die a lot, so groups are the way to go as I've read everywhere and experienced myself.
---
Respawn timers will be adjusted depending on population I wouldn't worry about that.
---
Deadmines it was fun but S- show at the same time. We had to develop unique strats on the fly it was the first month of release and no one in my group had attempted it. I don't think we ended up completing it in our first attempt. Many deaths, many pulling the whole ship because of mobs wandering off and the odd LOS aggro you would sometimes get from things above/below you. I am pretty sure the first emberstone drop I would have like to win on my mage went to a hunter.   
---
It was awesome plus I got that whole goonies vibe at the end with the ship in a cave. 
---
It's not a precise measurement, but I'm pretty sure that less toxicity and harassment in chat is a good start.
---
And no, I don't think all WoW players would agree, but that's because WoW players tend to be *gamerbro* neckbeards who have no empathy and are probably on the spectrum.
---
Its possible, though usually there is a leak that the F&amp;F is going on.
---
I feel like Salvation was mostly just used on healers. DPS got might, agility, etc (can't remember what they were called)
---
Sure, it's a balance, but dynamic spawns made grouping up infinitely more desirable in future expansions. This is inarguably a good thing.
---
What do you mean axes are useless, they are bis for dw during bwl and aq40, amd pretty much equivalent to swords in mc. Even most of naxx progression axes are almost as good as maces, its just until literally endboss of the game on farm that swords pulls ahead. 
---
Great story! Thanks for sharing. Nice to see some fellow old time EQers around for WoW Classic :) 
---
&gt; Respawn timers will be adjusted depending on population I wouldn't worry about that.
---
This is not true. This would be a *huge* software change that didn't exist until TBC.
---
You're also wrong about grouping up, but hey, I actually play on private servers that try to be as Blizz-like as possible, so what do I know! 
---
There is more math to it than that though, it’s 55 threat per party member buffed, divided equally between mobs. You also get the threat bonus for def stance. If you buff all, but are fighting 2 mobs, you get good threat, if you buff all, fighting 5, it’s less threat than demo shout. 
---
A lot of people see 55 threat per party member buffed and think that means ~300 threat per mob in the pack
---
Hypnotic blade was great for us casters, we could pair it with a nice off-hand orb. Pretty sure I kept that thing well in to my 40s. 
---
Great guide but not fully 1.12 
---
Those rings were green and crap in 1.12 for example
---
all's fair in love and warcraft.
---
But in the meantime, someone else gets suspended erroneously.
---
The fact people have gotten suspended because of mass reporting means that the punishment hasn't stopped the crime.
---
Considering there is no way you can do it solo because people will tag a ton of mobs around you, group is sill better imo. Maybe on a half-dead server you can solo properly, still dying often though.
---
Hopefully it gets cancelled.
---
No way dude
---
You either dont play at all or you play 60 hours a week minimum
---
You know this is true
---
Yeah I agree it would be better if they left it to us and if mistakes are made then it’s our fault too bad wait for it to drop again. It would definitely make people think twice before trying to loot before the master looter in guilds cases.
---
I'll try to keep this short and simple because I do not believe many here have a true perspective on why old mmorpgs hit the same cycle of content creation.
---
Massive horizontal and world content, typically can only be done in pre-launch development cycles. This is why you only see small content pushes with post-launch dev teams. The team has been minimized post-launch and they are bogged down with continued system development, fixes and balancing.
---
Classic Wow was originally designed as an open world with ZERO though toward Raiding. Raiding was added as a post-launch solution to being unable to match the scale of developing pre-launch content.
---
Raiding, at the most basic level, is minimal content for maximum player participation. It's a cost thing ... and always has been. All this did was shift the problem to another area. The more emphasis on raiding means less horizontal content growth. More horizontal content growth means less emphasis on raiding. This also alters who your core audience is over time.
---
Content lag will occur no matter what. The real, long term result however is that you eventually shift your entire development focus and your game becomes something it wasn't originally.
---
That, and the shift toward a stock market driven industry and AWAY from a genre specific community feedback loop sustaining a singular product, is why we are await a rebirth of what was ... it's because of how the original growing pains of an mmorpg was originally handled.
---
no one said it was a bad thing
---
It’s free with retail tho 
---
No. You die a lot only if you suck. It rarely happens solo unless you truly don’t know what you’re doing
---
I think it'll slip to October or something. So sad =(
---
Take anger management.
---
IIRC that threat calculation was based on a bug from a specific pserver. 
---
&gt; Your "skill" in dungeons, is patience. Pulling well so you dont pull more than 1 pack,
---
This is highly variative. Good groups can easily pull multiple packs most of the time.
---
Lack of dynamic spawns are not anti-group?
---
If we're measuring being anti-group as a bad thing, then yes, you implied they were. If only because having dynamic spawns made grouping up infinitely better.
---
not if your tank is fury too
---
holy shit, that is beyond fucked up. nice one.
---
By that time you will have lost threat on at least 2 mobs. It takes too long. Cleave through the group and Tab-Sunder the rest.
---
I left during tbc to give Warhammer Online and Age of Conan a try, since I missed vanilla world pvp. Warhammer at least held my attention for a few months. AOC was garbage
---
&gt; The fact people have gotten suspended because of mass reporting means that the punishment hasn't stopped the crime.
---
Holy shit. You got me dude. This brilliant use of logic. You should be in a research think tank or something coming up with future policy for U.S. legislation.
---
You're telling me that because a rule can't be applied *perfectly* therefore it's not a good rule!? *Mind blown*.
---
Yeah, skribsbb, this is called [Letting the perfect be the enemy of the good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good), and it's a common tactic by conservative fucktards to try and preserve the toxic status quo by constantly pointing out that a solution isn't 100% perfect in 100% of cases. 
---
It's a form of *concern* trolling, btw.
---
I was mostly joking lol. Druids are great at escaping so they may not win, but they won't lose either.
---
Horde largely ignore any fear mechanic because of shamans. It's arguably? Maybe objectively better than fear Ward. 
---
&gt; If their job isn't needed anymore, 
---
Says who? From what I'm gathering they're mostly laying off "[support staff](https://kotaku.com/the-fallout-of-activision-blizzard-s-massive-layoffs-1832597892)" 
---
&gt;The layoffs were largest in non-development departments like IT and QA, according to those who were there. 
---
So, basically games are going to get shittier? GREAT!
---
&gt;Missed expectations doesn't mean that you automatically have to try and find the money by firing 800 people.
---
Try telling Blizz that, because that's exactly what happened. 
---
&gt; After all, if Blizzard was looking to develop more games without spending more money, they’d need to lose headcount in non-game-development departments. But management said nothing. With no union or other method for collectively communicating with executives, employees were left with nothing but whispers. As November turned into December and the new year came, all they could do was wait.
---
[Same article](https://kotaku.com/the-fallout-of-activision-blizzard-s-massive-layoffs-1832597892)
---
Horde 20% threat reduction with increased threat from windfury &gt;&gt; 30% threat resuction.
---
More like, now we can start milling rumors that the cash shop will be coming to Classic in all its modern glory. If not at the start, it will come sooner or later.
---
Wow, pure evil. I love it
---
As long as you're not a warlock, or a hunter, or are waiting around on mob respawns, 2 person leveling is just as fast as solo leveling.
---
I really liked the base raid frames in legion, pretty easy to manipulate and easy with clique. Hope its the same for classic
---
&gt; (Lol strawman btw)
---
&gt; Ok, Ben Shapiro
---
:thinking: Ad hominem btw.
---
&gt; This isn't about “the guy wanting to be alone” vs “the guy wanting to control everyone else”
---
Controlling what other people do and say isn't about controlling what other people do and say? Are you even listening to yourself?
---
&gt; Self-policing of speech in communities (this includes moderation and gasp! censorship) improves the quality of those communities over time.
---
No, it turns them into echo chambers where people are scared to voice their actual opinion over the fear of being exiled.
---
&gt; How? Because it turns out the only people generally affected by this kind of reporting are the fragile, white gamerbros 
---
And we have a two for one on ad hominems in a single post, man what a steal.
---
But no, it negatively affects EVERYONE, even those who you're trying to so valiantly protect.
---
&gt; The level of willful delusion required to believe that right-click reporting is a net-negative on the community is insane. It's called belief perseverance.
---
Right back atchu fam, your problem is you measure the quality of a community based on the use of words you don't want to hear, when in reality it should be measured by how easily it is to avoid people you don't want to hang out with.
---
I'd much rather play a game where people are free to use the n-word if they so choose so I can easily tell those people are not the people I want to hang around instead of actually investing time in them before figuring out they're horrible human beings.
---
&gt; maybe but there can only be so many mobs around
---
If you aren't partied with someone who is killing the same mobs you are, you're still competing for mobs.
---
&gt; and you have to kill way more for quest item drop quests. 
---
In order to finish your collect 8 bear asses quests, the two of you have to kill exactly the same amount of mobs when you are partied, as you do when you are next to eachother, but ungrouped.
---
&gt;It's not a precise measurement, but I'm pretty sure that less toxicity and harassment in chat is a good start.
---
I think it's far from precise.  There are plenty of groups of friends or online communities that bond over being shitty to each other.  That may seem ridiculous but that's just how a lot of people are.  I actually joined my original guild in 2005 after doing a dungeon with them and having them call me a "fucking retard" for causing a wipe.  I laughed it off and asked if they had any room in the guild for "fucking retards".  They thought it was funny and we went from there.  Still friends with most of them.
---
&gt;And no, I don't think all WoW players would agree, but that's because WoW players tend to be gamerbro neckbeards who have no empathy and are probably on the spectrum.
---
So who are you even making these rules for then?  
---
Also it's interesting that you brought up the spectrum, it reminds me of something.  Where do you draw the line with regards to what constitutes "toxicity"?  I was doing a dungeon about a year ago on a pserver and someone got legitimately upset about my use of the word "autistic" as a way of describing the amount of research my friend had done on his talent spec/gear.  I disagreed, but I can't say that he (or she? can't remember) didn't have a point.  Using the word that way could legitimately offend people.  Should I have been reported and banned?  Why not?  I was certainly toxic according to that person.
---
Great to hear mate, I recommend your show to everyone I meet IRL who plays wow - really impressed with how you balance RL work with producing such a professional and regular show 
---
In a 40 man raid, ideally there will be 4 paladins, so people will get all important blessings - Kings, Might/Wisdom, Light, Salvation/Sanctuary. Salvation is by far the most important blessing because any dps worth its salt will be hard threat capped without it.
---
And then you realize that kings is broken and that tanks *and* DPS get kings/might on top of salv and that there’s a reason why every single top dps parse is alliance side. 
---
&gt;I loved to stealth (night elf race spell) and surprise attack people with my hunter
---
Your type were the bane of my existence in AB when I would try to cap the Stables, thinking no one was guarding it. I look forward to seeing you again on the battlefield!
---
I really appreciate the recommendations, word of mouth helps a lot. It’s tough sometimes with the amount of work the show takes, but I manage to just squeeze it in haha
---
Great read, yes i agree on this.  When you do find that balance though it is magic.

And giving people tools to harass others reduces harassment?

Holy fuck, are you for real? You talk about empathy and toxicity and at the same time you have no qualms making fun of people with mental problems?
---
Rules for thee, not for me.. amirite?
---
Well yeah
---
&gt; But you're also not taking into account that there's never going to be 50 wolves in one area—more like 5-10—so you're going to be waiting for the five minute respawns over and over.

If there's five people, each unpartied, in that area, you're going to be waiting for respawns regardless of whether you are grouped, or solo.
---
Don't talk absolute shite. 
---
good time to pick up the FP, but the easiest way to SM was to cross the lake south of undercity and creep past the east side of the city. 
---
Same here when Vanilla first came out i was dating my ex wife at the time. It was here which actually got me into WOW i lost a bet and the end result was too play wow for an hour lol. I played everysince up till wrath of the lich king" But even before i meet her i was a PC gamer. I was a house husband when i first started playing wow in vanilla. We changed roles , she wanted to work and i wanted to spent more time with the kids. 
---
If i look back at it now i do have some regrets spending too much time on the dam pc raiding and playing wow most days. But that didnt mean i was lazy, far from it. I still did everything around the house, looked after the kids. did homework with them, made them dinner,cleaned up etc etc. But when i did have a break i logged in to farm matts for crafting, did dungeons raids with my guild up till 230am in the morning. Anyway after i quit wow in wrath of the lich king. Years after we got divorced and its not becuase of wow i think but we just grew apart, i was interested in PC's and she was not soo interested. 
---
Now Classic is coming out im free from nagging ex wife. Im 45 now and yes im going to play classic and will have more time. In between work like. 
---
I was asked a while back are you too old to game on the PC. Hell no. My mum which is 64 plays Retail wow with her friend which he is 55 they have both been playing WOW since Burning Crusade and still play 3 to 5 days per week together.

---
I’m not joking. 
---
If you saw the shit I have to deal with on this forum, you’d agree. People fully on the spectrum who have zero empathy for players they’ve designated as being outside their group. 
---
Right-click reporting is a boon to everyone, even those neckbeards! 
---
Just ran VC last night. First group was exactly like this. Everyone charged in, wiped and got the “what the hell?” type responses. Second group was OG vanilla dudes like me and other than one bad (accidental, pat) pull we cruised through it twice with no issue. 
---
I foresee the first few weeks of classic will be quite the mess for the newbies. 
---
There's no summoning stone??
---
Not if you’re a Hunter or a class with a fast tag. You’ll be done faster by staying solo than grouping up with those same players. 
---
I’m telling you, it sucks but it’s how Vanilla works. 
---
Like i said, kings + aq20 might is worse than windfury + strength of earth. And if youre talking about parses on the most recent server thats purely because 80% of the top pve’ers rolled alli this time around, they usually flip flop every server between alliance and horde to keep it fresh
---
So, for the 75% of the server that isn't playing hunter, it makes sense to group.
---
Except it wrecking the vanilla economy by injecting a ton of gold into a system where gold was scarce
---
You can do it a little later on once you’ve specced into tactical mastery and can stance dance - but it’s not really viable to do that until much later
---
Yuuuuup.
---
&gt; If you saw the shit I have to deal with on this forum, you’d agree. 
---
I'm seeing a bunch of shit I'd rather not have on this forum right now, but I don't want to censor it, I find the thought of others reading your posts and laughing at your hypocrisy hilarious.
---
But let me ask you, why is joking with skin-color or sexual orientation nok ok, but joking about autism fine?
---
You're right those are for higher levels, I must have been mistaken. This was on kr\*nos when it first came out.
---
Since this is posted on the Classic forums I’m assuming the content drought you are talking about is related to Classic? By drought are you referring to their current plan of rolling out 4 major patches I think it was? If so no one is complaining about the lack of content in those patches just the way we are receiving them. If they release some of this content at the same time it’s going to completely trivialize certain raids/dungeons in terms of progression and itemization. 
---
It is known
---
So what does the mage do with his giant stack of soulbound black lotus?
---
Rogue is the best answer.
---
Doesn’t make sense for Mage, or Warlock, or Priest after they get Holy Nova, or Shaman (Flame Shock). 
---
Am I forgetting anyone else with a Pet/instant cast?
---
i get where you are coming from. when the server is still fresh and lots of people around, grouping up could be the right choice if you want to progress at a reasonable pace rather than trying to compete. I'm just saying if you can get away with soloing in ideal conditions its definitely better than with a group.
---
If it's not too much trouble would you mind listing these axes? I'm not familiar with warrior itemization.
---
There is a decent learning curve, but it goes along with the difficulty curve of the dungeons. If you do RFC/VC you should get a grip on basic aggro keeping mechanics. Damage mitigation is pretty basic in Vanilla. For warriors it's just about keeping Shield Block up as much as possible. CDs for emergencies. A quick guide online can walk you through it for your class of choice. 
---
I told you, I’m not joking. I wish I was!
---
Yes ideally you're right, don't think that's gonna be the case for the first weeks though.
---
Yeah and what’s the issue?  It’s not that bad.  Getting to deadmines as a horde is bad.  SM is not bad. 
---
Okay then, why is attacking people based on their skin-color or sexual orientation not ok, but attacking them because they have an illness ok?
---
That's so not true, it only takes a low level character with almost no skills and a mobs spawning nearby and you find yourself fighting 2-3 mobs and that's a walk back from the graveyard my friend.
---
If you're speccing holy to level, there's something wrong with you. Shocks have a 20 yard range. Warlock dots take 3 seconds to tick. Fireblast has a 25 yard range.
---
All of these are half-assed solutions for tagging... But they work much better when you're actually working together in a group.
---
Three mobs just spawned but you're out of mana? If you're solo, you're missing those tags. If you have a partner, they can tag and tank them while you drink.
---
Tanking in classic won't be that hard, largely because you can't tank without CC.  If people don't want to CC, get new people.  Tanks and healers just can't mitigate away the damage enough without CC.  More time will be wasted recovering from each pull without it too.
---
Tanks have the talents and abilities to get and hold agro, but the DPS has to deal so e CC and has to focus their damage on the primary target.  
---
DPS pulling agro from the mobs that are not primary, that's their problem.  Not that I wouldn't try to help them as a tank, but it's part of being good DPS... Don't take extra damage so the healer can focus the tank, don't make the tank spend resources saving you from yourself. 
---
Tanks letting the HEALER get agro, that is your problem.  You can easily do enough threat to keep the extra mobs on you and not the healer.  Sloppy DPS will regularly take hits and die, they will learn.
---
I would say the next biggest problem for tanks is runners, when low health mobs run and pull more mobs.  I am a bit on the fence as to who should be dealing with that.  Odds are one of the 3 DPS will have a stun that will work.  I would prefer my tanks don't move to much, no matter what role I am doing. It's one less thing everyone needs to worry about.
---
Ah I see your thought process now. You think that censoring someone is a form of “attacking them”. 
---
It’s not. It’s moderation. 
---
yeah probably only places you'll be able to find those ideal conditions in the fist couple months will be in silithus or remote spots of azshara.
---
Thats the thing. I dont think i stance danced at all. Apart from charge -&gt; def stance.
---
I might be remembering some tanking from BC or Wrath.
---
Not in Classic.
---
Thanks :) And yes I  agree... I hope that with the perspective I've gained, that I will be able to strike a nice balance when classic roles around and I have more time to play again. Another funny part that I didnt mention was how its interesting that when you are aware of "this" path that we are discussing, its funny to see other younger players on their own path and not aware of these things.. but you can see the big picture since you've been there before if that makes sense. You can see your younger more ignorant self reflected in them and their opinions etc. Especially when its someone new thinking that leading will be a walk in the park. It truly is a 2nd job and takes a special personality type to get it right. Hopefully I will keep myself out of a leadership role this time around, because I feel deep down that the social parts are more enjoyable for MMO's and pve especially. I can get my tryhard fix through other games. 
---
Thats another reason I liked TBC. I could raid with my guild of friends and "not care" about pve.. while doing my own tryhard stuff separately in 2v2 and 3v3 arenas where the onus of responsibility is more on yourself since you are 1/2 or 1/3 of the population instead of simply 1 out of 40 people.
---
It was a thing if you were geared up enough. I remember running guildies through Deadmines or other instances and almost dying because I pulled too many mobs, or because my spec wasn't really optimal for mass-pulling dungeons. 
---
But pre-made groups with voice comms could and will easily do semi-fast pulls.
---
Sounds like it. Thunder Clap is Battle Stance only. I’m looking at it right now on a pserv 😜
---
Sure, keep thinking like that and you'll be disappointed, there will be respawn timers adjustments and/or sharding or the launch is gonna be a total failure.
---
Shadow priests melt faces.
---
The question really is about how much threat your tank builds. Orcs has higher potential to do dps, but humans do less threat so they reach threatcap less easily. 
---
If would pick based on your personality here. Pick alliance if you want to be certain you are high dps every raid. Pick horde if you want infinite power and don't care about the risk involved getting them. 
---
I did! Had a human warlock named Jorsalfar. I quit playing about a year after the release. 
---
Warlock Pet tags mobs at distance. 
---
Holy Nova is necessary to AoE grind at 40+ 
---
Mages have Blizzard, Cone of Cold, etc. AoE tagging as soon as groups of three mobs respawn together. 
---
I know you’re trying hard to argue every little point but you’re literally arguing with someone who levels Vanilla *all the time!*
---
The real, practical outcome of Vanilla mechanics is that grouping up is almost always worse than solo. 
---
That's not what I think, I think you're attacking a group of people, who according to you "are on the spectrum", by calling them various names all throughout this thread.
---
Even then, what's the difference between calling someone n-word, f-word or autist?
---
Mc patch Onyxia mh axe is bis followed by swords. Some memey weapons like ironfoe ans empyrian demolisher are very strong this patch because their base damage isnt too far behind raid weapons. 
---
Bwl bis setup is onyxia mh and crul’shurok oh followed by swords, chromatically tempered sword mh with mala oh
---
Aw40 bis setup is the aq40 imperial armaments axe mh with nef axe crul shurok oh, followed by chromatically tempered sword/qiraji ripper mh and maladath offhand
---
Nax bis setup is maces but the naxx axe drop mh with aq40 armament axe oh is still very stronf and only slightly worse than castigator/misplaced servo arm
---
Not going to list ranking weapons because you get swords or axes for humans or orcs respectively, and dual wielding them is bis until naxx with the exception of maybe maladath offhand as human when you get cthun gloves
---
Be a level 30 Priest on a PVP server, get sapped by a level 16 Rogue while hoofing it up through SilverPine.
---
You're right. Im correct AND I'm an asshole. Haha but seriously, I'm just blunt and honest. People often mistake that for being dickish, but in reality  people just aren't used to hearing things in a non-sugar coated man er. Believe me, I did the same thing when I was 19 and playing MMOs, totally neglected my relationship and it failed because of that, so I understand exactly what went wrong, and I also understand that it is in no way the games fault.
---
Is there not xp freeze in classic? If not do bgs not give xp?
---
For raiding, yeah, but for soloing 5 mans, prot paladin is the best spec in the game, specifically for its thorns tanking and armor, even in classic. 
---
Prot had a lot of issues to iron out going into TBC. 
---
Oh. I mean. I wish you were right. I actually argue *for* dynamic spawns all the time. 
---
No I dont really care. I’ll ignore people who harass me, although I find it fun and like to shit talk with people. I can not find a good reason to want to censor and ban people for what they say, you can ignore them if you want, or stick up for yourself.
---
I think the biggest misconception on dungeon tanking for vanilla/tbc is that there is a "rotation"
---
As soon as you stop thinking about rotation and start thinking about priority, tanking becomes much easier.
---
For example if you've got 3 mobs to tank, your priority is using what moves you have rage for to get a hit on each mob, before unloading moves into the skull target to keep initial threat, and then moving extra rage into the additional mobs to maintain aggro building across the pack.
---
Compare that to going in with a rotation in mind and trying to unload a full rotation into each mob...
---
running around STV (and other contested zones) and fearing people into enemy mobs. no ganking, no killing, I'd let the jungle decide who's worthy.
---
another thing, which was technically fair, but got me a *shitload* of angry messages was a little trick in 2v2 arena. holy paladin + arms warrior was the flavor of the month, and we were playing the anticombo, UA lock + shadowpriest. troll shadowpriest, to be exact, which is important...
---
We've quickly learned that when you put out enough pressure, holy paladins bubble so they can heal up their friend without a barrage of spell lock + silence, and they tend to use holy light, which a great big heal, but with 2.5s cast time. it's not exactly the best trick, since most priest just mass dispelled bubble (1.5 sec cast) then spell locked the shit out of them, but better than nothing.
---
what I realized was that berserking + mind control can easily shorten the cast time to 2.1 sec, and you could often anticipate bubbles... and you can't heal a hostile target. cue to our team specializing in snatching up enemy warriors milliseconds before that big lifesaving heal was just about to hit, making it fizzle harmlessly then letting them slowly die to dots.
---
I'm pretty sure we've personally broken up multiple arena teams. one paladin told me that his warrior was more or less frothing from the mouth about not getting healed and calling him [string of expletives redacted]. couple of others simple made new chars on our server and cursed at us in whispers. *it. was. amazing.*
---
the best thing about it was the fact that they would've lost anyway, it was a hard counter... but hey, if you're already winning anyway, why not get some entertainment out of it?
---
As I stood in Atranaar, a little gnome warlock bounced around the feet of my nelf rogue.  "Wanna do a dungeon?" he asked.  I agreed, and wrongfully assumed that this gnome knew what he was doing.
---
Soon enough we were in BFD.  By "we" I mean him, myself, and a hunter.  The closest thing we had to a tank was the hunter's pet owl.  We... we were there for a very long time.
---
It's a sad world when people consider straight forward honesty to be "dickish". I'd hate to have been coddled so hard that I couldn't take hearing the truth for what it is.
---
For raiding, yes. In the context of farming low level dungeons, prot paladin is still the best spec in the game. 
---
There's a lot of niche uses for shitty specs and classes. Not necessarily in raiding, but in the game as a whole. 
---
I did! Was an altaholic and genuinely can’t remember the name of my Tauren shaman main, though I can remember all my friends characters names... 
---
&gt; All of this seems like it would take a LIFETIME for one person to complete in just the VANILLA part of WoW, so why are people talking about content droughts? 
---
Because some people don't want to roll alts, or PvP, or may not care for the other faction. 
---
Their options are to do the same old boring content, or unsub.
---
Blizzard doesn't want them to unsub. Hence, it puts out new content.
---
Someone has to feed all those starving goldfarmers
---
Oh, right. My bad.
---
&gt; Especially since there's a ~99% chance that at least one person in your group doesn't have a mount.
---
More like a 100% chance. Considering it's a sub-40 dungeon and mounts are only available at 40.
---
For people who play retail and know vanilla well, how similar is healing raids in vanilla to live? Specifically with shammies. I am strongly considering rolling a shaman in classic with the eye towards the 30/0/21 build for pvp/world/early raids. In retail, I don't mind healing raids as I find slinging chain heal to be pretty satisfying but don't particularly enjoy high end dungeon healing/M+ as resto sham. I am sure I could suck it up to get through dungeon healing but would like some idea of how much I would like raid healing. PS- I also enjoy micromanaging totems as I know that is something people complain about
---
I know. I never needed an addon for that
---
Well, for starters, one is a medical term and the other two are slurs. 
---
Though the medical term can be a slur too, which is why I don’t use it either. 
---
It’s weird that you’re so rustled, trying to find some source of hypocrisy to “get me” on. You’re actually claiming I’m using that word. I’m not. Being on the spectrum can mean a wide range of behaviors, from mild anti-social ones, to deep disability. 
---
Obviously I’m not referring to any deep disability. 
---
But you can think whatever you want, really. I know you’re just trying to change the subject cuz you got blown the fuck out. 
---
Well I got to tank the polymorph boss in gruuls lair as boomkin so that’s a huge step up fir that spec from vanilla.
---
Lost a bet was my ex wife. If i lost the bet i would have to play WOW for an hour. At the time i was a Counter-Strike bloke. I did say to her i think this game is shit LOL. After 15 minutes of gameplay on my warlock in Vanilla ive never looked back. I quit in wrath and is looking forward to Classic. Anyway ive still not played counter-strike since :)
---
But again, we are discussing the "droughts" based specifically on what endgame raids were available at the time - do most people really look at WoW as nothing more than a grind to pre-raid gear and then raiding to the last available boss as a payoff for that grind? Did the majority of people play the game just for raiding? Raiding may have been the true "endgame content" of WoW, but to me WoW was about more than JUST endgame - WoW was about scratching whatever gaming "itch" you may have had at a particular moment. If you wanted to just grief some players, you could do that. If you wanted to level professions, you could do that. If you wanted to level a new character, you could do that. But people put ALL of the focus on endgame/raiding. I know, I know, different strokes for different folks - which means there ARE people who were all about endgame and nothing else, but there must have been the other side to that, people who enjoyed all aspects of the game, not just raiding - so why are all the discussions about the longevity of WoW strictly having to do with raiding? 
---
To top it all off, only a small percentage of players were hardcore enough to complete all the endgame content - that tells you that longevity of WoW should NOT be based on the hardcore players, because they will quit as soon as they complete the endgame content. 
---
You think Ben Shapiro is an insult?
---
Hey, there’s hope for this subreddit yet!
---
I mean it depends on your guild/server. I was the second best healer in 40 mans usually and highly sought after for everything else. I don’t think min maxing was much of a thing on rp servers 
---
rather than you sucking its much more likely that your dps will be mindless and make you look bad
---
&gt; Warlock Pet tags mobs at distance.
---
They have either travel time, or cast times.
---
&gt; Holy Nova is necessary to AoE grind at 40+
---
If you're AoE grinding as a priest, you're doing it wrong. Just SWP, bubble, and wand. Seriously. Mages can AoE grind, to some extent, on PvE servers, but all the good AoE grinding spots have way too much competition for tags.
---
&gt; Mages have Blizzard, Cone of Cold, etc. AoE tagging as soon as groups of three mobs respawn together.
---
I'm not sure you're reading my posts.
---
&gt; I know you’re trying hard to argue every little point but you’re literally arguing with someone who levels Vanilla all the time!
---
I've leveled five characters to level cap, through Vanilla (some of them on pservers) (a rogue, a warrior, a priest, two mages), and five through TBC (all on retail) (A mage, a warlock, a shaman, a warrior, a druid). I think I've got a pretty good idea of how leveling works.
---
This is the best part.
---
Retail shitty tank: Find a new tank
---
Classic shitty tank: well you're our tank... So let me help you and give you some pointers. 
---
Addons allow a healers skill to truly shine. Healing is crisis management and thinking 3 to 5 seconds ahead. The less time a healer spends hunting through frames and selecting the right spell, the more time they can spend preventing tragedy from getting a foothold on the group. The global cd is bad enough when trying to heal. Anything else that delays executing decisions only inhibits a healer showing his skill at health juggling.
---
I think you're using it as such.
---
I will say though, I find it interesting how you avoid everything you have to say, either by outright ignoring it it or throwing strawmen and ad-hominems at me.
---
Your thoughts on the matter are very limited and devoid of experience.  Because of this you should also limited your own messages to shorter and concise posts.  Or learn something about human behavior. 
---
you gotta learn how to do things like heroic strike on swing timer when tanking multiple enemies, you sunder armor one and on your attack swing timer you change target and heroic strike a different one and then sunder armor another different mob etc...
---
That's lovely! What an amazing way to meet friends, both old and New alike! :D
---
Allow me to give you a creative analogy, just to show that I’m a reasonable person... 
---
When you were in kindergarten, when little Billy called you a jerk-face and made you cry, all you had to do was raise your hand and report it to the teacher... Fine for Kindergarteners, they should be babied... This analogy represents Blizzard’s reporting system
---
No that you’re a grown up (assuming), do you still have a raise your hand and report system? No, if someone does something that is truly wrong, you call the police and lodge a complaint... This analogy represents Blizzards ticketing system...
---
Try to keep in mind, the reason the game was destroyed in the first place was because of every person that cried about wanting something a little easier... The leveling process is too grindy, make it easier... I don’t like having to travel or talk to anyone to get into a dungeon, give me a LFG option... I don’t want to spend weeks learning my toon and leveling up organically, give me a pay to win option... 
---
This is supposed to be a re-release of the original game, not the original game plus extra options to make it feel more like retail! There was no reporting system in 2006, and there shouldn’t be one in Classic! Time to grow up, or just stick with retail... No Changes!
---
Mages can AoE tag without having to spec any differently than normal. I’m not sure you know how Vanilla works...
---
Also, Warlock and Hunter pets travel faster than any casted long range ability at far range, but nice try there too. 
---
Stuff like decursive/OG healbot. 
---
Spam 1 button to dispel and spam 1 button to auto-target/heal/downrank? No way they’re letting that in happen in Classic. 
---
Surprised there's no healbot hate in this thread yet. I loved old school healbot so much. Although the current one used for private servers is a travesty of an addon and nothing like what I used in wrath and cata. I believe I used grid for pserver because it was the best I could find. Haven't played pserver for a few months now.
---
Lol, I play on a pserver and that literally happened to me last week. I was the healer, and the warlock kept doing that over and over. Finally pulled aggro and was like "what why'd I get one shotted". My Mana is for tank first, me second, you if I happen to have time and you are not doing stupid shit.
---
&gt; Three mobs just spawned but you're out of mana? If you're solo, you're missing those tags. 
---
&gt; Three mobs just spawned but you're out of mana
---
&gt; but you're out of mana
---
&gt; out of mana
---
Yes, let me drop a CoC on them, so that I can get a free trip to the graveyard.
---
BGs do not give xp
---
Nah, I’m not getting into a concersation with a fragile gamerbro who seriously thinks that it’s better to have n-words dropped in chat and that the community should just have this Libertarian fantasy of being robots able to pick and choose what they allow into their attention or not. 
---
I don't believe it's blizzards fault. They've been owned by a parent company since near the very beginning.
---
Vivendi were the ones who owned both companies and eventually merged them. 
---
It is more difficult than later expacs. It feels clunky, it gives me a headache and you're responsible for more than a dps player (who may or may not be sleeping). You need to be aware of your surroundings, making sure party members aren't walking into rooms of mobs, keeping an eye on healer mana while keeping a decent pace.
---
That said - it's worth it. It takes courage and ego to march through the waist-high field of crap before you get good at it. Don't be scared by negativity (especially your own!), take even the harshest of complaints as constructive criticism and just keep practicing and learning and you'll be a good tank and a better player overall.
---
The time investment isn't really bad, you are expected to be reliable though. Leaving may mean having to end the raid or miss out on gear. There's a bit more learning involved, but there's no shortage of resources out there (videos, guides, mentors, test subjects, etc). Everyone will likely know your name and be willing to spend time to help you gear up / practice.
---
Anyone who is talking about a drought?  I assume so.  
---
As to why discussions of longevity go to raiding - because that's how Live is.  You get funneled quickly to level cap, funneled quickly into raids by getting gear thrown at you, and then all you have left to do is raid.
---
I hope you’re talking about casting with mouseover and custom raid frames and not talking about shit addons like Healbot/LazyHeal. 
---
psychology class 
---
But if it wanst for vivendi and after activision wow would still be good maybe.
---
Exactly this. If you level with friends most people will decide you’re not worth it because they can’t get as much of a jump on you, or CC doesn’t automatically give them a massive edge like it does in a 1v1.
---
Mages don’t run completely out of mana while Frost-kiting. Now I know for sure you never played Vanilla!
---
&gt;Well, for starters, one is a medical term and the other two are slurs.
---
And you dropped plenty of slurs in this thread as well, but you're just gonna keep ignoring that, don't you?
---
&gt; It’s weird that you’re so rustled, trying to find some source of hypocrisy to “get me” on. 
---
I'm not trying to find it, you demonstrated it pretty obvious, I'm just trying to get your thoughts, yet you keep dodging, every single thing I've said, you've dodged.
---
&gt; I know you’re just trying to change the subject cuz you got blown the fuck out.
---
Hahahaha, thank you, that genuinely made me laugh. I've given you so much shit to respond to and as I just told you, you keep dodging it.
---
Yeah probably. When I first played BFA, I was telling my friends its their best production quality to date and I still think so for most things. But it ended up not being fun for me. Everything just looked and worked nice but ultimately felt even more streamlined than previous versions.
---
Cata, WoD, MoP, Legion were all a blur for me. I literally don't remember more than one memory (it's in MoP btw) from any of those expansions combined, while leveling up. I just sped through them as quickly as possible and quit playing pretty short after. At this point I don't know why I kept giving them chances to go back to vanilla roots lol, the game is vastly different from vanilla like you said. 
---
I definitely got disheartened by some of the stuff like world quests never ending, the table missions always wanting you to pay attention to them. I viewed them as a chore and something that kept me away from what I'd usually want to do in wow like help friends, world pvp, dungeons etc. 
---
Can you tell me what slurs I’ve dropped?
---
I’m honestly curious to see just how fragile of a snowflake someone can be!
---
It is so tough to be in a raiding guild’s leadership, but I think that is what I liked the most when I played. I really can’t dedicate myself like that anymore. I hope it doesn’t diminish the fun for me when I play Classic.
---
Shhh my popcorn just came out, let me enjoy the show.
---
Even more slurs thrown at people. Why do you keep pretending you're not a hypocrite?
---
You realize this is exactly why the right-click to report button isn't needed right? Because people who spew stupid shit, like you've been doing in this thread, are going to realize it's not worth the effort to be an asshole when people call me out on it.
---
I was a human paladin named Zhangfei, and I was terrible. I had a great time, though, and am still RL friends with some of the people I met on the server.
---
I am not sure what "massive horizontal content" is, but I take it from your post that it is everything else there is to do in the game besides raiding, so my following paragraph uses that term to that extent (my apologize if my interpretation is incorrect).
---
But WHY did the introduction of raiding shift the "problem" from horizontal content to raiding content? Only a small percentage of players was able to clear all of the raiding content, and to my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong) even a smaller percentage of players actually "cleared" the massive horizontal content this game has. It's not like creation of raiding deleted the horizontal content. To me, gaming is nothing more than setting a goal for yourself and then completing set goal (sound boring, I know, but the "journey" to completing that goal is the fun part of gaming, and when things go awry, it's actually a positive thing, because successfully dealing with unexpected obstacles is what gives players their satisfaction from playing). To that extent, even if you are hardcore enough to complete Nax and fully gear yourself with Nax gear, why quit when you could then try to climb the PvP Honor ladder and become a Grand Marshall/High Warlord? If not that, why not grind rep for every faction just to see every one of those bars say "Exalted"? Perhaps you want to make Booty Bay your enemy and see what the Bloodsail Buccaneers have to offer you and possibly be the only person on your server who is Exalted with them?
---
You see what I mean? There is never an explicit end goal that the game gives you - you set your own goals and you complete them. But people have interpreted the end goal to be the last boss of the latest raid. There is no content drought - there's plenty of content, the drought is for raid content specifically, which is for a small percentage of hardcore players who do not NEARLY represent the entire population of WoW. So what if they quit? They are the 1% of players, why would Blizzard cater to them? Cater to the 99% of players that stay to experience ALL of your content, not the ones who quit after they complete the latest raid.
---
I’m not sure why this tip hasn’t been stated anywhere yet, but you should have all of your instance/exp giving(quests) gear BEFORE hitting 19...in my opinion hitting 19 is the last thing you do
---
Well, how about we start with this very post.
---
* fragile
---
* snowflake
---
Yes. Although I'm not aware of healbot ever having a smart heal function. When I mentioned 'not wasting time selecting spells' I meant the hover feature. I used a razer MMO mouse with miniature keypad on the side for your thumb. That allowed me to choose a spell by moving my thumb fractions of an inch, rather than clicking a name or frame and then choosing a button with my other hand.
---
Letting an addon choose a spell for me goes against every reason to play the game.
---
Blessed and cursed.  And sexy af
---
Don’t support the company so long as he is CEO.
---
Why are you in silverpine?  How are you getting sapped by a level 16?  So many questions. 
---
i have no idea what you're measuring since you came out of the blue with "This is inarguably a good thing." while no one assessing the contrary.
---
plz quote the part where i implied they were a bad thing.
---
yeah these are not anti grouping they are made to force you spend more time in game. they affect the solo gamer the same way they affect the group(eg fire mages kill mobs very fast, locks can multi kill clearing the area so they have to wait, also you are not alone in the area even in solo play if you are with 5 other players they will clear the zone same as a group will). vanilla was a huge time sink, it was intended that way. more time spend makes you think twice about quitting the game since you invested so much in it. it is now one of your possessions that you treasure so much harder to abandon.
---
you're trying to push the *bad thing - good thing* i have no idea why, maybe you lack drama in your life. not everything is a fairy tale with good vs bad.
---
grouping is definitely superior to solo play even without dynamic spawns.
---
Where is this painting of Sylvanas with bra armor you spoke of
---
..for a friend.
---
All you really need to tank in Classic is a willingness to fail once in a while.
---
If you're OK with that feeling, you can tank. If you can't live with that feeling (not everyone enjoys it), then you'll struggle...mostly with that feeling.
---
Difficult is relative. Once you know how to sunder and have a "feel" for threat on targets as well as knowing how much damage you can take i wouldnt say its that hard at all. All of that is knowledge.
---
The most difficult part is focus, because you pretty much have to be focused on the game the whole dungeon/raid otherwise youll be delaying or wiping the group. DPS and healers have a lot more time to mindlessly spam 1 or 2 buttons and are a lot more chill in PvE
---
&gt; most servers
---
The only server that is horde favored is kr*nos and that’s because armor is broken on that server. 
---
It’s slightly tilted towards alliance for MC/BWL warriors and mostly alliance rogues for the same raids. AQ/Naxx is 90%+ alliance in both rogues/wars. 
---
If you’re going to use LP to back your argument you might want to actually look at the data instead of only looking at the first thing you see (which is kr*nos being kr*nos). 
---
I was about 30 give or take a few years cant remember "it was such a long time ago" . I was married and had kids at the time. Now im 45 and divorced shit i feel OLD. 
---
But im still going to come back for Classic. Most people where kids when vanilla first came out and now are married with kids for Classic. Ive gone past that lol. I was married in ORIGINAL Vanilla and now im divorced with more time. 
---
I feel the the odd one out here shit :)
---
Definitely. Same feelings here.
---
Thanks for sharing your story and getting everyone talking like this, was a fun read all the way down :)
---
Always felt weird doing it as Alliance. Not just the travel times, but the sheer lunacy of traveling all the way to the other end of the continent to kill some people who lost their homes and their kingdom, who have held out against an overwhelming enemy in a dying land for 5 years, for the sole crime of their leadership being corrupted by some demon. Yes, they're kind of zealous and paranoid, but it's not like they'll ever be a threat to Alliance lands.
---
I am discussing this on Classic forums because I often see discussions relating to longevity of WoW Classic. People seem to think "well, we can't just have them release a Classic game, then all the patches, and leave it as is - people will clear the content and get bored" and I seem to be the only one sitting here thinking are those people insane? 1% will blow through that content, get bored, and quit - the REST of the people are the ones who make up the population of the servers - if they aren't going anywhere, neither is the game.
---
I am discussing this because I see people say "Maybe we can release TBC after that" (I'm all for that, but with the option to keep Classic, and only FAR down the road when just about everyone has done everything in Classic there is to do), and even worse, I see people discuss "well, may be we can have them release more raids and content post-nax, but keep the spirit of vanilla" - no, because then it's not vanilla anymore, even if you "keep the spirit of vanilla" in mind as you release more content.
---
That's why I'm ranting - I can't believe people honestly think "well, JUST vanilla isn't going to be enough, we'll blow through that content" - no you won't, the 1% will, 99% will just enjoy playing the game, not blowing through content.
---
Damnit man focus! I'm talking relateable actual good story telling, I'm talking... aww fuck it, [here](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/k42zZl)
---
But do you see my point about how asinine that logic is when they make up such a tiny percentage of the actual player base? Let them quit - 99% of people won't (IMO - although I have been wrong before)
---
Just added mine to the list. Lo and behold, I see that someone I remember from Dunemaul (we weren't friends, I just remember them) is already there.
---
You will melt faces as shadow priest.
---
As far as raid DPS. Swords&gt;Axes. Sword spec is way better then Axe spec. Also if you decide to tank all the best tanking weapons are swords. 
---
As far as pally vs shammy. In a purely selfish manner you would much rather have a pally. In PVP you get cleanse and blessing of freedom. I don't care what a shaman can do. A buddy cleansing all your slows and snares away is a friend for life. In pve you gain access to Blessing of Might and blessing of Salvation.
---
As someone likes RP servers, I want the option. Lots of things can be disruptive besides what someone is saying in a chat. Ignore is not he solution for us. Ease of reporting players who harass, disrupt, or otherwise spoil roleplay with their actions and names is a welcome addition. 
---
Hey at least you weren't like me needing on every piece of gear that dropped. I was like 9 or so I didn't know it was wrong lol
---
You have to filter out the speedrun guilds that mind control their entire alliance raid in orgrimmar to get the buff from horde completing their ony attune. This is cause the 15% attack speed is much better for alliance as windfury resets swingtimers, making alliance pull ahead. Most top top top (literally 3 or 4 guilds total) do this once a month with dmf, and is completely beyond reasonable in classic for not just the average raider, but even the 99th percentile of good top end raiders
---
lol 
---
Reminds me of those players who level in a dungeon, yell they are porting out to train up skills and for the warlock to summon them back.
---
The group is forced to spend 15-20 minutes running back to and from the entrance ... because warlocks can't summon into instances.
---
That's one of the things I don't really like about retail. The content is actually GOOD, but you get "pushed" past most of it to get you to end game instead of taking the time to enjoy it. I LOVED Kul'Tiras and the quests there, but let me complete them! 
---
That's one thing I look forward to in WoW - you rarely outlevel quests of a certain zone, you complete most if not all of them before you move on.
---
&gt; No decent private server has just randomly closed anytime in the last 3 years
---
You must be joking. Spektrem was one of the best closed down. Just gone.
---
You and everyone will have to live with WoW tokens in Classic. It's the same client, the same subscription and you can use tokens to buy game time.
---
I want to be able to report people that offend me, whether or not it was intentional. If I'm offended in any way at all that person should immediately be punished regardless of what they did.
---
Well I sure hope to find some of my old mates from back when I was 2 years old!
---
Once again, I think we are over simplifying a very complex issue. What constitutes roll play? I mean even someone who is a troll can be roll playing it, it is not unheard of to be a troll in a medieval fantasy, someone who is just trying to piss people off. If someone is just typing over you, why don't you just simply ignore him? Remember folks, the ignore function is already more overpowered than anything we have in the real world. In the real world we have no such option, we are forced to read and listen to rude people, but in this game they already offer you a tool that is powerful. Why do we have to go so far?
---
I rest my case. 
---
You will truly never know until you try and even if you do fail, you should look it as a opportunity to see where you went wrong. People can try to bring you down but only you can  build your self up. Do what you want man and let the world be your oyster.

---
Except we really don't.  I foresee pservers becoming even more popular and plentiful once "Classic" launches.
---
Reported.
---
You literally told me in another response that “fragile” is a slur to you. 
---
I mean, fuck. At this point I rest my case about gamerbros and this topic. 
---
I really enjoyed their story in BC. Suffering from withdrawal, and sating it by enslaving a Naaru? And then siphoning that holy energy to power their paladins? So cool.
---
So you're admitting your hypocrisy?
---
I’m admitting that gamerbros are the real fragile white snowflakes, yes. 
---
imagine 5 new players from retail running a full BRD run.  At the end boss its probably not gonna be any from the originale players left because of all the ragequitters.
---
Yea, it is "an insinuation or allegation about someone that is likely to insult them or damage their reputation." so yes, it is a slur.
---
You're doing exactly that which you supposedly is trying to protect people from, yet you're refusing to admit you're being a hypocrite.
---
&gt; I mean, fuck. At this point I rest my case about gamerbros and this topic.
---
You haven't even made a case, all you've done is saying slurs are bad and then thrown slurs at me for disagreeing and throwing slurs at some strawman version of wow players.
---
Warsong is a 10 player bg. Having one player be effectively useless factors in. A lot of people had their Jimmys rustled as soon as they saw my gear set.
---
Wow you’re literally equating calling gamerbros fragile with someone using the n-word at a black person. 
---
Everyone! This right here is peak r/fragilewhiteredditor 
---
Amazing to catch one in the wild. Wasn’t even that hard!
---
And the raids are amazing, but you do them on LFR (now you've done it, but it doesn't matter) then you do it on an intermediate difficulty (you've already done it, but it still doesn't matter) and then if you do it on Mythic, you don't care because the boss has died a dozen times already anyway.
---
Goes to find Oceanic friends...forever alone :(
---
Now I want the people that are for the first option to admit that they are not for #nochanges and should therefore not be hypocritical when someone proposes changes. They should also, because they are clearly such servants of the good, accept that they are in the minority (I mean I didn't even give the "report someone for offensive behaviour, let it be reviewed by a GM first option", which would have split that vote further) and that they should allow the majority to have its way. Stop harassing Blizzard to make these annoying changes. If not, then at least admit that you are being self serving and the fact that you should not be offended is far more important than the offense towards the majority, which the majority clearly is, by reading their replies and peering at the vote. 
---
I like to exit Southshore and take the left way thru Silverpine and around the left of Undercity. The only real trouble is if you are passing by the zeppelin when one is arriving.
---
It kind of reminds me of that scene in Lord of the Rings when Frodo, Sam and Gollum reach the foot of that mountain right outside the gate of [Minas Morgul](https://i.imgur.com/qFJrRPE.jpg) and then all of a sudden the gate opens and the an army starts marching towards them.
---
Still happens in the NBA too.
---
Memphis literally BOUGHT a draft pick a few years ago. Gave up nothing but cash.
---
Hmm, I literally told you earlier that you could do that shit all you wanted because I found your hypocrisy hilarious. So I'm curious how you reached that conclusion?
---
Also again, you keep dodging my questions, why is it okay for you to use slurs but not for others to use them?
---
Not enough people mentioning Warlock. Rogue or Warlock is best option for "killing fools"
---
Wow you’re literally equating calling gamerbros fragile with someone using the n-word at a black person!
---
:( 
---
There is OC guild recruitment on the Discord though!
---
Also note how OP didn't give us an option to manually open a ticket and report like in retail vanilla.
---
Another tactic to make it seem like if we only have both extremes to choose from.
---
(I'm against right-click to report btw, i would prefer the old method of reporting players).
---
I don't prefer the method of ignoring everyones BS, this isn't a private server, we deserve moderation.
---
But, as a tank I'll be leading my own dungeon runs so if someone wants to be an edgelord or spew racism they're getting boot. Everyone is replaceable, I don't need fuckheads like that in my party. Problem solved.
---
Except that's not the case. The gold already existed, it's simply being given to someone else in exchange for play time. The gold DOES NOT materialize out of thin air. I'm not really for or against tokens (I played a lot of EVE so it doesn't bother me conceptually, but I also understand that a fast injection of gold in vanilla WoW provides longer-lasting power through BoE epics that are never removed from the ecosystem like EVE ships/mods are on death) but everyone who pretends that this will somehow create gold where there was none is fundamentally misunderstanding how the system works.
---
Holy shit, you're actually a homophobic white supremacist, that explains so much.
---
You legitimately think that being black and/or gay is worse than having a mental illness or being fragile.
---
&gt; Things are generally more methodical
---
Just how God intended Classic to be.
---
Good follow up, thanks for clarification.
---
&gt;  I would like a system where people who get a sudden flurry of reports find themselves muted in chat.
---
So you want an easily abused automated system? No thanks, mate.

That was always part of the fun. I have a huge amount of nostalgia for running to SM back in the day. Sneaking through unfamiliar enemy territory.

---
As someone who has dealt with this, it's very clear who is roleplaying as an eccentric "troll" character, versus just being a troll. I've handled both players. If the report system makes it easier for players to find the option and use it, I'm for that. 
---
And again, it's not just about what they do in the chat. If you're looking for an immersive experience, you know what behavior fits with that. If I'm in a bar, I don't typically deal with someone leaping over my head and spamming random motions on top of me. In real life if that happened an even more powerful tool would be used, a bouncer or a cop. That real life analogy seems pretty silly doesn't it? That's because comparing our gameplay experience to our real world doesn't go very far. 
---
Roleplayer servers were advocated for, and created to have a tighter control on the environment being fostered by the community. Tools that help with that are welcome. If you don't want a community where your name/guild name/out of character and disruptive behavior can be reported, you shouldn't roll on a RP server. Just like if you don't like WPvP and ganking behavior, you shouldn't roll on a PvP server. 
---
Are you planning on playing combat with swords in pvp, if so, it's a consideration, but normally most pvp rogues are daggers in which case the human racial doesn't help very much.
---
hypnotic blade was pretty garbage compared to the staff tbh... later in tbc it was greatly improved when they added spell dmg to it
---
Just keep coming, all I've been doing all thread is pointing out how you want rules for others but not for you, and you keep showing that that's exactly what you want.
---
You're thinking of the healing text that was implemented in TBC.
---
I agree, it's beautiful and satisfying to see.
---
So far on vanilla private servers I haven't found an addon that emulates this the same way. I really don't like the healing text to be on my screens foreground.
---
Hopefully they implement it as an option into the UI (like cooldown timers on the buttons) otherwise I hope an addons is made that stays true to the aesthetic.
---
You can't thunderclap in defensive stance in vanilla, its a lot of tab sundering.
---
Not sure but i think it was Deadmines but i do remember doing stockades in stormwind. But that might of been later. Its been so long. My memory is abit faded on that.
---
I played on an NA based Oceanic realm so I think it's under NA anyway.
---
I am planning to play hemo swords in pvp.
---
Hi, /u/Mkey_ftw
---
One of my favorites, if not my favorite classic wow dungeon. Great loot, good fun, super lore driven and pretty difficult. Doing a full SM clear was awesome and I'm excited to get back in there! Stand aside my lady!
---
Tanking is super easy I have found. The only difficult parts I have is when you run a dungeon/raid you are unfamiliar with and don't know where to go next, or the most optimal routes, and the try hards will be mad because you are slowing them down.
---
But otherwise, tanking is pretty ezpz.
---
Oops, me too 🤭
---
Because none of your finds are there, or aren't you searching in the NA servers? 
---
Actually when I rolled my priest I believe TBC had dropped, so that sounds about right. 
---
I did Deadmines on my human rogue first and I was so trilled. It was my first MMO and then someone invited me for a dungeon and I had 0% knowlegde what that means... I only know that we had 5 people in the group and that we went inside. I was so nervous hahaha. Epic times &lt;3
---
I just breeze past the repetitive stuff I don’t want to see.  Seems to be an easier solution.
---
I mean the community will just deal with that person by ignoring them and not taking them seriously, I don't understand why you need daddy Blizzard to hold your hand.
---
If someone is spouting racial slurs I don't even give them to time of day, why would I? That's what they want and them getting banned only entrenches them more into doing it. Fighting fire with fire doesn't put the fire out.
---
Taurens could easily get to level 20 without realising org even existed. 
---
+5 weapon skill is a nice dps increase but no guild will decline you for not being human. Most non-human rogues like to go dagger spec anyway. It’s far easier to get good daggers than swords. 
---
Hemo pve is not viable at all. You’ll be bottom tier dps. 
---
Respeccing costs 50g and it decays by 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold.
---
Also.. classic WoW promotes patience so the people you'll do dungeons with in 25+ will not only be happy to just have a tank in the group, they'll be patient people most likely.
---
Yes, enlightened redditor. You think this. 
---
But it’s not remotely true. This is a wishful fantasy of how Internet community moderation works and if you’ve ever worked as a community moderator you’d instantly know how untrue and naive this opinion is. 
---
Nah, it's not going to get any more popular than it has been. 
---
The people willing to play private servers have all joined the communities when nost was around or shortly after it died.
---
Checking in! Played on Mag-US from late Vanilla to the beginning of MoP.
---
I can understand the annoyance, I just don't think it deserves a 24 hour mute (which doubles each time) and the bouncer example you use is absolutely true. Once a person is thrown out of the bar however, he can still converse outside for 24 hours with whom he chooses. At the end of the day, it is a minority that roll plays on RP servers and should a person be muted for 24 hours, therefore rendering him unable to pug dungeons and raids, because he annoyed one or a few RP guys? I mean if I also annoyed a raid leader on a PvE realm, casting emotes constantly around him, should I also get muted? Perhaps we shouldn't be taking the RPing that seriously. I mean how many people actually do this?
---
I think this is going to be one of the biggest gut punches to retail players trying out Classic for the first time. You cant just requeue and have a new group in two minutes, and being an ass will only slow you down more. Trying to be friendly and helpful will get you through the dungeon much quicker than rage quitting and trying to make a new group.
---
I never had a problem healing. I never encountered any of those problems. I didn't have to think about what ability to use.. i just knew. What frames are you hunting through? Just look at green vs no green... heal the one with less green. Know what spell you are going to use based on the amount of green they have in their bar. I don't ever think I just do. It is second nature. I never used addons to help healing and I have always been number one/two healer depending on the fight. Healing addons are a crutch.
---
 **Hello and welcome!**
---
 I am currently introducing an offer to all who are interested in playing in **Classic WoW**. I have a team of dedicated players behind me and we are looking for even more dedicated players who are interested in both **PvE** and **PvP**. We are still determining if we are picking **Alliance** or **Horde**. Right now we are leaning towards Alliance! On our Alliance guild the name will still have to be decided and we will accept people of all classes and specs. We do not judge if your spec is not viable, if you are good, you are in! If you are interesting in applying please use this template to apply in the application section where I will be reading them all! 
---
If you are not in the guild and are interested you can directly message me if you are interested and what type of role you are going for. **Raider** or **PvPer**. And yes, you can do both roles like I will be doing myself, this guild is all about trust and skilled players, please do not attempt to bother me if you have no idea what is coming with the release of **Classic WoW**. Once trusted you will get promoted to a higher tier of raider and pvper, where you will have more permission and power in the guild with the potential to be a substitute as raid leader when I am offline during a raid. 
---
**We have already been recruiting for months and already have members in! You can come chat and apply over in our discord!**

My pre-raid hunter on a tbc server has about 2/3s as much ap (less than half counting world buffs) as my naxx geared vanilla hunter and has 10% less crit. They got some ap back but certainly not all of it
---
Steady shot is nice in that it doesn't restrict hunters to super slow weapons, but if aimed didn't reset autos in TBC it would likely still be the main shot in the rotation. I'd call that one a wash
---
Longevity was never an issue for vanilla hunters, runes and pots could keep you going for a long time, and naxx gear nearly makes your shots free
---
traps aren't damage, could be used in combat in vanilla with fd, and while they are better in tbc they still break and resist with no way to reapply them. You couldn't really chain trap forever in vanilla though so slight improvement
---
2 out of 3 of the 41 point talents are crap
---
I have read that combat sword is the best for pve, isn't it?
---
There are 2pvp spec, dagger backstab and the hemo sword. Which was more common and which is better and why?
---
Those guys are running off nostalgia and delusion for views.
---
What you do to bypass this is each person has a character they play on their own and one they play only with you.
---
Both. 
---
Never got to experience naxx, since my guild crashed after being stuck on twin emperors for months. Would really love to experience a full naxx clear.
---
I do, however, remember how insanely time consuming and grindy it was... And I'm 33 now so not alot of time.
---
I have the exact same problem. 
---
yeah, combat swords is definitely the best for PvE.
---
For PvP I am not sure what all the options are, but I'll be going for dagger backstab.
---
This here. Tanking in vanilla isn’t difficult what’s difficult  is that as main tank you HAVE to know the pulls and as such you are default team lead. What’s difficult is that  your dps is  on the same page because you have to make sure that they are:
---
A. On the right target 
---
B. Using cc and interrupts when appropriate 
---
C. Dispelling
---
D. Dispelling
---
E. Not a hunter 
---
Just communicate well. People are going to mess up but that’s the fun of it, it’s just a game. But seriously, hunters and their damned pets drove me CRAZY!!! 
---
The +5 sword skill is around a 5%~ dps increase. In a raid environment you likely won’t be allowed to use hemo on a boss so you’ll be stuck sinister striking like a combat rogue would but with 21 points in sub for nothing. 
---
If you want to go gnome I highly recommend going daggers for pve. You’ll do near the same damage as human sword rogue, have your pvp racial, and daggers are ALOT easier to get than swords due to less competition. 
---
I wanted to heal on a private server. I stacked up on intelect and spirit. I tanked. I was good enough.
---
Basically, anything that has bear form, defensive stance or bubblehearth, was enough.
---
Tiberium did. Such good jokes in org
---
I'm not necessarily talking about the mute option myself. Just having easy access to a visible report option I think is important. A big problem many of us had trying to police our own servers was that a lot of people didn't know how to find the right report category for certain behaviors. 
---
&gt; At the end of the day, it is a minority that roll plays on RP servers and should a person be muted for 24 hours, therefore rendering him unable to pug dungeons and raids, because he annoyed one or a few RP guys?
---
Should someone be punished for breaking the rules that those "few rp guys" fought to have created for their game play style? Ya. Same way you'd want someone who was hacking in PvP, or win trading to screw up a rating system to get punished. It's not about annoyance, it's about someone trampling on how someone else plays the game, in a space that the gameplay style was created for.
---
If someone can't be punished for disrupting roleplay, why even have a roleplay server?
---
If you're counting world buffs, then that affects all classes and isn't a balance issue.  You have 2/3 the AP, but what is your DPS?  I'd imagine that Steady Shot and and pet scaling bring it back up pretty well.
---
Longevity was never an issue...as long as you've farmed runes, bought pots, and/or have BiS gear from a raid that 1% of people did.  Brilliant!
---
Some traps are damage, especially for AoE.  I was more thinking of 5-man CC and PvP.  Especially the ability to temporarily CC 2-3 enemies.
---
All 3 41-pointers are amazing in PvP, I don't know what you're talking about them being "crap".  Pretty good in 5-mans, too.
---
&gt; It looks like this sub found it’s new ion 
---
Old ion* this man has been hated in gaming since before we knew who the hell ion was.
---
&gt; If this man died today, I would literally burst out laughing. People like Bobby who only suck the life out of everyone, do not deserve life.
---
Only to sadly be replaced by someone even more shrewd and younger than he is.
---
Combat sword and combat dagger are pretty even. Dagger pulls ahead in a lot of fights. It’s very valuable to have dagger rogues on Vaelstraz. 
---
Dagger backstab is far better for pvp. Just watch any perplexity movie to see why. 
---
and have every patch first, a week or two before the US. Revenge!
---
well, I"d prefer a CD drive.
---
i remember tanking in shadow fang keep, and was doing an absolute shit job (didnt understand multi tanking and sunder armor on multiple targets) and instead of yelling at me (well a little) the group gave me better pointers. Mostly because they didnt want to spend another half hour spamming lfg for a new tank
---
&gt;tbc style macro, tbc add-on api, tbc style ui
---
I guess that"S not happening. Either WOW or BFA.
---
&gt;  I'm also against vanilla macro api - too much automation you can do with them 
---
Back then, Blizzard was actually banning people for doing such automatic thing, even though they used just an unmodified client and legit ways.
---
An example, some guy got permbanned for afk skilling.

&gt; umm no. Half Life 1 and mods had built in voice chat.
---
&gt; 
---
that really matters if all you played previously was diablo 2 and heroes 3 in offline or LAN mode
---
Regardless if anyone expands this is super helpful and I agree with all the points.  Would be really interesting to see this further theorycrafted by the likes of Taladril and co.
---
Thank you!
---
&gt; Absolutely terrible statement, how old are you?
---
61, is that too old?
---
If you hit submit and it didnt give you an error, your name is in there. It may take up to 2-3 minutes for your name to show up on the page. As of now, both of your submissions are in there. Thanks for joining!
---
I just cleared Scarlet Monastry as a Ret Paladin "Tank".  
---
Here are the facts:  
---
In Vanilla, you are not expected to always hold aggro, that is the beauty of the system.  
---
By the time you are doing Dungeons, you will have learnt all the basics; what not to do when it comes to over-aggroing and being cautious. Just make sure you and your friends are stocked on items ahead of time and eat/drink between pulls. Keep an eye on who is taking the most damage and do your best to taunt, stun and split up your damage to try to maximize the amount of enemies attacking you and you are golden.
---
The fact you are on reddit months in advance to playing the game seeking help means you have the perfect attitude to learning and improving, and as others have rightly pointed out, people are not going to turn a tank down.
---
If you have any questions feel free to ask.  
---
Perhaps one can have a "report for not roll playing option" then, which perhaps just teleports you far away. I have read the terms of conditions, the so called rules and it is so broad that you technically can be muted for anything, it is merely at the discretion of Blizzard
---
No worries. I spent a long time wondering why I couldn’t hold Agro of large packs by spamming battleshout... then I found that out and it all made sense! 
---
I have actually had instances where charging in, thunderclap, def stance, blood rage, battleshout has been excellent initial agro. The best thing about it is you have mobs hitting you, giving rage and then you do some sunders, cleaves etc to really get that initial agro. Skull is almost dead by then so I’ll move on to focusing the 2nd and 3rd target. 4th and 5th are hopefully cc’d :P
---
Yeah got to echo this, I was a career tank in vanilla and Thunderclap was really useful. However, you had to know what it was for.
---
The best builds for tanking dungeons all had 5/5 tactical mastery and 1/1 Anger management and this lets you quick-swap to Battlestance to Thunderclap, and swap back to Def stance, great for mitigation and actually does more threat than you think due to the way Battleshout threat splits across active mobs.
---
Charge -&gt; Thunderclap -&gt; swap to defensive -&gt; Demo Shout -&gt; Battle Shout -&gt; tab sunders/revenge was a perfectly good opener if it was safe to Charge a pack. Of course, often you'd be pulling with ranged weapons and LOSing round corners so the TC would come later in the rotation.
---
The key thing to note as a Warrior was that you had three major AOE threat moves -&gt; Thunderclap, BattleShout and Demo Shout. To be honest, none of these did overly much threat compared to the moves of today, but they were all useful. Tabbing Sunders between mobs and using Cleave on high rage was super necessary.
---
Note that on some private servers I believe some of the Shouts did too much threat (particularly Battle Shout) so some Warriors think spamming BS is the way forward. It helps, but it's certainly not the best vanilla option.
---
Level 20, already had a level 8 or something mage alt, to understand how does frost nova work. And, obviously, I did know how does pulling work, as well as line of sight.
---
But, that gnome mage didn't, and started pulling everything around, then blamed the healer for not healing him (through walls, that's it)
---
and, nobody knew what to do. The group just disbanded and people said they'd come back at higher ledvel.
---
It briefly says something like they'll show up in a couple minutes after hitting submit, the page refreshes quickly afterwards though, so I can barely read it in time. But I first added them 2 days ago, then again about 15 minutes before my post. 
---
Ah I see, we'll see what they end up going for :D
---
If you have no experience with vanilla, what makes you think you’ll be topping the dps charts next to warriors who’ve been minmaxing on private servers for years and years. 
---
Most early build get 11 in Arms early on anyway though, particularly as Anger Management is so good for levelling and 5manning (assuming you realise the tooltip was always broken and it was far stronger than many expected).
---
Thunderclapping when tanking was fine as long pretty much as soon as you got 11 Arms, both as an opener after charge or as a quickswap, but you did need to know what you were doing and have good keybindings.
---
Mine was Blackfathom Deeps. I rolled paladin, but wanted to play with my friends who were all Night Elves. After finishing Coldridge Valley I hiked through the wetlands and caught a boat to Darnassus, then quested the treetop, Darkshore, and Ashenvale. They told me there was a paladin trainer in Theramore, and to make sure I picked up that flight path before heading over on the other boat.
---
See, that trainer doesn't offer quests or breadcrumbs to the Eastern Kingdoms where all the Paladin quests are. My first BFD run I didn't have redemption and got teased quite hard about it. Finally set foot back on the home continent at about level 25.
---
In my experience, they already tend to err on the side of not punishing someone for these reports. I don't think you need to worry about them punishing people for anything. This isn't an option to report someone who isn't roleplaying. It's an option to report someone who is actively disrupting it. The teleport option is there, but honestly that doesn't do anything as a deterrence. Trolls don't care if they had to fly back from the Wetlands (saw that one once). 
---
So, you're horde on a pve realm I'm guessing?
---
Oh, I raged when it happened! This was back in BC and I wasn't waiting for a summons and was running on the road from Southshore, I think after this I stopped taking the road and swam the lake instead.   
---
It had to be a less than 50% hit chance with the level disparity, and I was completely dumbfounded when it happened.  
---
**Schedule:**
---
Tuesday,Wednesday,Sunday (Progression)
---
Demo shout was very useful in BWL when clearing suppression rooms. Just keep spamming demo shout to keep whelp aggro while the rest of the raid moved through the traps.
---
Dagger backstab is only a guaranteed win if the enemy is a terrible player or if u have thistle tea, as u will see in his vids :)
---
This is obviously due to how much slower combo points are generated which is how a rogue controls a fight - much more important than short burst damage.
---
MOAR DOTS! I used to say this to my friend as we went through our adventures. Referring to the yellow dots which mark herbs and nodes, and referring to the infamous Ony vid. =) Of course, I plan to recruit him when vanilla returns.
---
The main problem I had with retail wow is the progress system itself.
---
Every time they planned an expansion, the motivation dissolved for me due to better gear is coming up and leveling again.
---
Games like Dark Age of Camelot kept their level cap at 50 and is still busy after 17 or so years since release. They introduced different kinds of items such as 'increased cap of str' since 75 was the cap for stats. It kept the game alive with that idea alone.

I was in the guild LoD, Perseverance and We ran out of good names. (chronological)
---
Ill be looking for Bloodfeather eu in the realmlist if they reuse old names. 
---
Scouting gloves of the monkey is bis, not gloves of the fang
---
Choose the name Hank and search for minerals
---
Especially in dungeons, it’s all about just knowing the layout of what’s happening and being observant to miss a pat or stuff like that. It’s not so much super hard mechanics that you might have encountered previously in other games. You got this! 
---
Currently on a phone, incognito didn't work either.

They only make up 1% of the playerbase? Citation needed.
---
Not sure if Hemo Swords was especially good in PvE - the debuff limit makes Hemo rather unattractive. Top DPS builds in PVE were Combat Swords and Combat Daggers depending on what tier and weapons were available.
---
I'd imagine you're more likely to be refused a Raid Spot as a Human with a Hemo Swords build than as a Gnome with a good combat build I think.
---
Perhaps potentially best, or just best up to BWL, but all of the best rogues I've seen have been daggers. It's always about the player.
---
Might be worth mentioning how some guilds prioritise weapons to races with +5 skills? (assuming attendance and performance is similar) I know my Nost guild did with axes for orcs...
---
Tanking is "hard" because as the tank you should be in charge of leading the group/understanding the mechanics of each dungeon for the most part. Otherwise you will die. Unlike in retail where it is very forgiving and there isn't much need to know info. Ask mages to poly, rogues to sap, wait for healers to drink.
---
my first time tanking as warrior (in stratholme, which is pretty difficult to begin with), we must have wiped like 10 times at least. I was horrible, so much to learn! But people didn't flame/abandon me, yes they were frustrated after the many failures, but kept giving advice. Because the alternative is to go back to IF/Org, and get another tank. And that was on a supposedly toxic private server (not my experience btw).
---
So yea, tanking is hard as warrior, but rewarding once you learn it, and if you start at low level you will probably have an easier time than i did.
---
Are these uploaded to YouTube :)? Funnily enough, I can access specific YT links at work but can't access anything else!
---
They all get uploaded to YouTube eventually - usually about a week later :)

I needed on some gloves and made the group mad as they had spirit, but I didn't understand anything about stats.
---
I also gave myself soulstone and that made the group mad
---
When I would be in a dungeon and RL would come into play id say some BS excuse like 'OMG EARTHQUAKE GTG' people would usually have a chuckle
---
Would this work as a taunt: 5/5 Spiritual Focus with Concentration Aura. It means you can cast healing spells, which generate threat, with no interruption. It heals the DPS who aggroed to that amount (I don't know if overheals count as aggro...), and draws that aggro back on you. Then the DPS loses their BoK/BoM/BoW as punishment and gets branded with a Blessing of Salvation. I know it *would* make you more juicy a target, but I don't know if it makes you juicy *enough.*
---
You are showing now also. It may take a couple minutes to show up in the database or you might have to refresh your web cache. Some browsers cach the database and you would have to update it. 
---
You, clearly never eve attempted mass clearing any of the fields in WPL or the troll city in northern STV.
---
Ok stop dots
---
Warcraftrealms doesnt find my old server, Bloodfeather. Do you know why some arent listed? I played on EU if that makes a difference.
---
ya! I had a paladin, and then took over a warrior character that my friend 'gave' me.
---
Tried hemo spec raiding when I was a rogue noob on Nost, didn't pass trial because I literally did half the dps of other rogues lol
---
Would not recommend.
---
Bookmarked this gem! Hope more people find it as well :)
---
&gt;Things are generally more methodical. So you taking a few seconds to mark a target, to do a good LoS pull, all that stuff is expected and very rewarded.
---
And let me tell you right fucking now, I have really missed that methodical tactical sort of gameplay. Modern day pugs who just want to AOE burn everything as fast as possible so they can grind out everything and blow over the experience of it grind my gears.
---
Not just WoW either. ESO was full of people who were just spazzmonkeys about grinding dungeons, and flip their shit if you make them wait longer than 0.75 seconds between packs.
---
Except there's no shortage of raid tanks, the problem is 5man tanks for farming pre-raid, especially in the later phase of the server's life. In that context druids are excellent.
---
Yes, I did.
---
Kingnothing, tauren droood
---
Horizontal vs Vertical progression are core development concepts. I suggest you research the differences in design direction. I would suggest not "assuming" my solutions and alternatives when I give no specific evidence of it. I merely pointed out what Blizzard ended up doing and we should all know the direction of development the game headed.
---
Why does the demand for Classic even exist? Because of where the game is now, how different it is from its original design, and how different the audience focus shifted over time. 
---
Content droughts are easily explained. Players end up repeating existing content when nothing new in introduced. Fine. Simple. Now what is the long term effect of the TYPE of content added? That is the real question, and we have an amazing example of being able to analyze such a result when exploring the development history of Wow.
---
What if Blizzard didn't make TBC but expanded the existing World and capping the game at level 60, preserved the scaling disparity between levels and added other content gating other than stat scaling? It would be a game far more closely identifiable to the World of Warcraft that launched and met the expectations of the majority of players who played within the 1st year of launch.
---
But there would still be content gaps.
---
At least now you know to get PVP trinket ASAP.
---
Hope that guy got laid off
---
do gamers nowadays have a comparabl MMORPG on Classic WoWs level?
---
Lots of good replies here. Not sure if this was said somewhere but until you feel good about tanking a dungeon, ask if someone else can direct pulls, marks, and cc assigns. Then you can just worry about actually tanking. Pay attention to what they do and don't feel bad about asking questions. You have the disadvantage of not seeing other good tanks in action, while dps and healers will have seen a variety of strats, some good some bad. 
---
For raids, its not nearly as good as going bread and butter sword spec (assaination combat, 20/31/0)
---
For solo, some PvP and 5mans, combat hemo with sword spec is pretty solid. You won't excel at raid DPs because you lack the crit damage bonus, relentless and adrenaline rush. PvP you lack cold blood.
---
Its fun for grinding and stun locking players with prep and help tho.

I'm going to say sometime between June 25th and September 24th.

Involuntary fear mongering might play a role but there's something to be said for automating the report process and abuse that wasn't inplace back then.
---
It's like you're reading directly from Saul Alinsky.
---
Ok, that fixed it. But you should probably fix cache/header settings for site data. 
---
Great! It certainly is one of our highest priorities now.
---
Thanks for bearing with us, it still very much is an amateur project :)
---
Wat.
---
I really need to get a hold of what some of these posters are smoking.
---
I met one of my best friends in TBC. I used to play wow with all of my friends in high school, now I barely see or talk to any of them (with the exception of my BFF) but the friendship I made online has withstood the test of time. We don't even play retail anymore, haven't touched it since Nightwell, but even when we take breaks from wow we're playing together - be it Diablo, Monster Hunter, Black Ops 4, you name it.

This is how I learned to tank. Fresh 60 druid and I wanted to tank. Went to stratholme and I was doing a shit job. They coached me through it and we finished the dungeon. After 2 hours or so of step by step I could do the dungeon easily front then on. 
---
BDK mitigation? You mean kiting?
---
*  Laughs in Horde  *
---
Yep. Likne ud rogue. 21 days played to 60 from griefing people in stv. Transferred off after 3 weeks of vael because my guild was scrubs then cleared bwl in 1 night with the new guild. 4-5 people from UConn were on mag actually. 
---
Late vanilla, aimed shot or any cast would break shadowmeld instantly.
---
Early on it did not tho.
---
I've heard people say that battleshout only generates threat when your party members are going from the unbuffed state to the buffed state. If they are already buffed by battleshout, and you reapply the buff, then no threat is generated. 
---
And I've also heard people say that it generates threat regardless if they already have the buff or not. 
---
Do you know which of these cases is true?
---
Spell damage was added to hypnotic blade I believe in like the AQ patch of vanilla.
---
It will likely have sp on it right out of the box in classic. I doubt they will do progressive itemization.
---
I agree with you but those things will be learned over time. You cannot be living in the past and with a company the size of blizzard, activision or not, they will be looking into as much automation as possible. 
---
Its just how things are going to transition. 
---
I know I got engi 225+ before level 35 on some pservers.
---
Some professions like alchemy require 35 tough.
---
Ive played a but of 30-39 pvp on my 38 warrior on a pserver the last couple of weeks. At those level with a healer you can take on some really high lvl players in zones like stv and desolace/tanaris.
---
At 30 tough you can have a lot of fun in duskwood and redridge aa horde for exemple :) 
---
The extra weapon skill is greatly diminished versus even level targets, which is what pvp will be.  There are, for instance, no glancing blows to consider.  If you are choosing a primarily pvp rogue, and you want race to inform that, consider the effects of the racials and basically nothing else.  A night elf with +5 stealth is stealthier than other rogues, and shadowmeld can help when stealth is on cooldown.  A dwarf being able to wipe debuffs, most especially bleeds, allows for a clean vanish at very common times when no other race comes close.  Escape artist gives you an extra mobility button, which is obviously important for rogues.  Humans have perception, which is very important when sweeping an area  for horde stealthers.  
---
While weapon skill is very important in pve, in pvp it is on the same level as +10 nature resist, which will probably save you from a shaman's burst once or twice in your career.  
---
The alliance races all bring something arguably similar to each other in magnitude to rogue pvp.  
---
For pve, this conversation is pretty different.

I listened and I gotta say, I liked how much knowledge all the people talking had as well as the pace of the show. Also since I listen to podcasts while I work, the long format really helps...since as I get into the zone I don't have to get pulled out of it by a short show ending. *subbed*
---
They were implemented in patch 1.3, relatively early in vanilla. 
---
I think if you ever do Valley of Trials [Hana'zua should be in a picture](https://imgur.com/a/ZjoCYdc) with the hero kneeling down with their hand behind Hana'zua's head.
---
The entrance of the Burning Blade Coven and the exit of Valley of Trials heading to Sin'Jin and of course Org entrance.
---
&gt; Is it viable to pve in my hemo sword spec/build?  
---
It absolutely is not.  You can't even hemo without wiping out important raid debuffs.  Even if the debuff limit was not a thing, a hemo rogue deals at best 60% of the damage of an actual pve spec.  
---
Bringing a hemo rogue to a raid is honestly disrespectful in vanilla.
---
Remember thubdercats? Instead of saying, "Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!" You're supposed to say, "Sunder! Sunder! Sunder!"
---
It's the law.
---
yes, that is a compelling.... plot
---
Hilarious. This article points out the goals of every single CEO of every single large corporation. This shouldn't surprise anyone.
---
I just got shit on in several threads for saying EXACTLY this AS FACT and NOT OPINION (emphasized for cool) both on this reddit and on other mmorpg sites. The Kool-Aid is strong. It will take Blizzard lemmings a very long time to fully understand where this industry really its and has been for a very long time.
---
Aoc intro section was amazing though. But yea, after that it was shit.
---
At least I got those playboy images with the collectors edition.

Warlocks can sell dungeon runs to lower levels - their AoE and tankiness for a clothie makes them one of the better classes for this, or just AoE farm out in the world. 
---
The hardest thing to learn as tank is all the nuances of a dungeon. Where do you pull, what do you pull, where do you LoS, what mobs should you tank, what mobs should you cc, what mobs you should kill first, what you can charge, what you need to bow pull. 
---
The only offensive behavior I care about is Chinese gold sellers 
---
I was questing on my lowbie druid.  I saw two horde druids questing, both were kinda in trouble.  I /waved at them, rooted one of the mobs in melee near them, and helped them finish.  Once they healed up they turned on me, chased my across a quarter of the zone before they finally got me.  
---
Quickly logging to my main, I flew there immediately, and camped them until they graveyard rezzed.  I caught them at the graveyard, and camped them for about three hours until they logged off.  
---
Swapped to my horde account, friended them both, with the intention of hunting them down later.  Despite repeatedly checking over the next several years, I never saw them log on again.  
---
I believe I camped them so hard that they quit the game.  Whatever, they started it.
---
Spam Demo Shout, and Battle Shout in low level dungeons.  Mark targets.  Use Cc.  Use LoS.   Keep gear updated.  Learn pulls with a ranged weapon.
---
Bosses stack sunders, keep shield up, bind HS to mouse wheel for rage dump.  
---
Oh yeah yea defense stance and have a shield.
---
&gt;there is no way they would make classic if they werent sure it would be massive profit included, aka sub boost.
---
No offense, but this is incredibly naive thinking. A sub based online game is not profitable enough in today's gaming market, especially not for a company like Activision. Or can you name me a single game that makes great profits purely based on their subs? No, you can't.
---
WoW makes money through expansions (that's why they release a new one every two years. No matter how broken the expansion is, see BFA), their ingame shop with mounts/pets, character servies (or why do you think they went from new races every two expansions to a billion allied races? No new starting zones, barely any lore, just new skins and broken racials so people spend crazy sums to change their dozen characters) and the wow token (which makes the game literally pay to win, pay to achievment or pay to gearscore).
---
You have no idea how much money people are spending on character services and wow tokens. The income from subs gets absolutely dwarfed by the money they make from character services and wow tokens.
---
A company like Activision will NEVER consider the WoW classic subs to be a profitable enough business.
---
I am 100% convinced that we will see all sorts of character services in the future. Don't fool yourself into believing they will offer free character transfers when realms are dying a few months after release. Gold sellers in classic were making a fortune, but the players back then didn't spend anything compared to what today's players are willing to spend. (60€ game, 60€ season pass and hundreds maybe thousands of € on loot boxes every single year in COD.) 
---
They will realize how much money gold sellers will be making in classic and introduce some sort of wow token in classic. I guarantee it.
---
Indeed they will all cough up 5 silver each
