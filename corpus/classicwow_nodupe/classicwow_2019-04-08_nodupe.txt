Was tied to the ZG time gate, which is the same as BWL, which has gear with hit that solves a lot of problems. Also UBRS turban is attached to that time gate as well.

---
I don't like either DKP nor LC.
---

---
The problem with DKP is not just the saving up part, it also creates a bidding minigame where people screw over eachtoher. DKP is based around *personal* loot, not guild loot.
---
LC is in theory nice, but extremely hard to do right and I doubt that even half of the guilds that are using it are also using it right. How do you decide off-spec gear? PvP gear like most 2h melee weapons etc?
---
In my personal opinion there must be a way to distribute loot with a decision algorithm/tree. It should be set in stone who gets which piece of possible loot, before people even enter a raid dungeon. It should be 100% transparent and mathematical even. The question is: Is it possible to do this?
---
I honestly think dwarf priests are more sought after for pvp premades.
---
I wouldn't say it's playing well. I mean some abusive mechanics were pretty dumb. I watched a few duels the other day on retro and they are silly to me. People using weird item mechanics and bugs to gain advantages. It's not that great to me. Though I love vurtne and he uses the shit out of engineering but I don't find it to be abusive  like skill of impending doom
---
Not even invited to the party lul
---
I wasn't sure if it was blue poop or a petition but yet... I clicked.
---
Haha some are ok, but they’re never Classic
---
So I think its because they take up debuff slots, meaning when they cant use as many debuffs they dont do that high dps or the raid does less dps as several debuffs are not taken by the shadow priest. 
---
But i dont know, nice video anyways
---
Only if your tanks are retarded and can’t stance dance 
---
Azshara is brutal and beautiful. 
---
Stolen from my page 😅
---
I had a priest friend who played WoW during classic. So many people would accept him in raid groups thinking all priests were healers, but he was pure shadow and never said a thing, lol.
---
Yeah unfortunately people take this shit to an extreme. I see a lot of actual hate between players. So many Horde and Alliance players currently want worse gameplay or story for the other faction’s player base because of perceived favoritism. To the point of people attacking each other.
---
Neither LC or DKP is perfect. LC relies massively on the entire guild being on the same page, and the GM and officers having the trust of all members. If they do, then LC is great.
---
But honestly, isn't it fair that you and your wife get lower loot priority because you contribute less to progress being *"inconsistently available"*?
---
I'm not sure why you think you would get more loot in a DKP system when you are  *"inconsistently available"*. If you are not there, you don't earn DKP. Your odds of getting loot is probably higher in LC than DKP.
---
And DKP has all the age-old disadvantages. Cartels get formed. Passive DKP independent of performance rewards underperforming players. Etc...
---
&gt;calls other people retarded
---
&gt;doesn't know that Berserker Rage has a 30 second cooldown and cannot be used for every single fear
---
What did he mean by this?
---
As an undead rogue I only had when alliance would come into PvP zones and complain on the forums when I killed them. I didn't ever even do that annoying sap spam or mace stun-lock BS. I just used Garrote, maybe Rupture, and then stealthed away lol.
---
Oh shit. Maybe they were mad because I did 50-80% of their health as a DoT and they couldn't see me or bandage. HM....🤔
---
Pulse every 5 seconds can easy mean 2-4 seconds of being feared
---
Tanks just need to stance dance not that hard 
---
Thank god someone said this (about the story)
---
In some ways the way WoW presented the story is more believable in terms of worldbuilding. There's heaps of local issues that players intervene in to help friendly factions. But some of these issues span multiple zones (black dragonflight, Qiraji bugs) and can present a threat to an entire continent. The idea of a single villain driving the entire story of a game feels more like a movie or novel than a world.
---
Take these videos with a large sprinkle of salt, I love shadow very much and they can do good damage but they run dry on msna and a lot of their potential is cut down because of debuff slots.
---
Also no BM but his fury video is off, he plays the spec wrong.
---
Berserker Rage has a 30 second cooldown.
---
Bosses/trash mobs fear more often than 30 seconds.
---
Also you can time the dropping of tremor totem so that it pulses shortly after the fear goes out.
---
Except he posted it *over two years ago*
---
Pretty sure it's 75%. I was talking the debuff that reduces your stats, not the damage your gear takes. 
---
I posted it 10 years ago.. 🥴
---
Good point. Same reason we don't want / see affliction warlocks in raids. Didn't even think about shadow word pain taking a slot. Same is true for mindflay?
---
Yea, it’s perhaps the greatest game ever made—certainly on the short list. If you’re a RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. 
---
As for what it will be like, who knows. Obviously it won’t be the same as launch, in terms of player-base. But there will be plenty of people who haven’t played Classic before. 
---
And by the time you get to 60, if you decide to push further, you’ll be on relatively even ground with everyone. Lots of time during the journey to learn your character.
---
I'm not seeing much proof here
---
Thanks! Appreciate you.
---
Sealfeate with improved sprint once you have 5 pieces of tier 1 is really good. Its actually the best spec for killing flag carrier druids in wsg but it works for wpvp too. I used it for both dps and pvp when my guild got into BWL. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhxdoxpAoGcM0bZVM  last point can be put anywhere you like
---
Approximately how far behind are Human Combat Dagger rogues compared to Human Combat Sword who have the +5 sword racial?
---
elitists aside, wow community is heaven compared to an average online multiplayer game, and i think it's especially gonna be fine in wow classic
---
Prep is so damn good I don't know why you wouldn't want to spec it. Going 17/12/22 gives you imp sprint, relentless strikes, prep, and hemo - works great as a farming build using swords.
---
Seal Fate daggers is very popular as well, 21/6/24 gives you Prep and SF.
---
Gonna be interesting to see how all this plays out. If the prevailing notion on Classic PVP servers is that you need engineering and gimmicky shit like skull of impending doom to "play well," it's gonna be a far cry from the PVP environment that existed in vanilla. And tbf, that's probably what some people want. It's just not gonna be what a lot of people are nostalgic for. 
---
Yes, still have him too. These are my original screenshots. 
---
That's called TBC.
---
Yea, I want WoW 2, but I have no idea how they do it. 
---
Engineering is not a must for pvp.
---
Jesus christ 
---
&gt; It's not that bad
---
It really is bad. It's one of the worst 2-handers in MC, only beat out by Vendorstrike.
---
Nobody asks the hard questions quite like Gaston!
---
If it was done late enough, and transitioned using stuff they had meant to go into vanilla but didn't, i could see it being fine.
---
As long as they dont fuck the community or the uniqueness of classes i think people would be mostly fine with more content.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ZG beserkers.... PTSD activated....
---
No they don't, every boss post 3.0 does.
---
Shadow priest will be a rank 1 mind flay manabattery.
---
Thats not lateral
---
i think nochanges people just want that for launch and to experience vanilla. i'd suspect they'll be open to new content after a year of naxx
---
 ¿por qué no todos? 
---
I don't really mind it. but if they want to go on to TBC, I hope they remove the flying mount. it killed the world PVP and sense of MMORPG.
---
thats some major bullshit, i raided with shadowpriests on private servers up to aq, they always did very shitty dps. nowhere near these numbers with way higher gear. they also run oom. 
---
also no way a shadowpriest in preraid do 500+ dps thats just way too high for any dps in this gear level. pretty much noone does this dps in preraid. thats some wrong ass numbers.
---
I don't know whats wrong with his testing, he also doesn't show mana and debuff slots.
---
If you want some real shadowpriest (or any other class) raiding numbers from private server, just search on youtube "shadowpriest classic raiding". ppl upvoted whole raids on youtube so you can see how it goes for real. for instance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOAw6NXelRM
---
Nowdays there are recordings for pretty mcuh any class. its not some mistery, you know.
---
I've seen of his videos before, i don't kow what the purpose of his tests when there is a real raiding recording widely accessible, i think he is misguiding ppl big time with his videos, wouldn't reccomend it, if you want to build the actual picture of the game and how it all actually goes. not some wierd wringly done tests, with big conclusions..
---
Yes it's a 10 min debuff that reduces your stats by 75%.
---
If you are getting corpse camped in STV for example, you can spirit res then take a flight path to Arathi to go quest there. By the time you reach Arathi your res sickness will have worn off, so it doesn't really affect you at all.
---
What the fuck.. I never got this one. Is there some secret OG Warcraft lore where the gnomes eat Tauren for Thanksgiving or something?
---
Never RP'd
---
Leaning this way myself. 
---
Can someone explain exactly the day to day that happens.... because I don't want to offend people trying to have a good time and I ruin it
---
Leveling - Druid
---
World pvp (mostly solo ganking) - Druid
---
Premade pvp - Shaman
---
Casual pve - Shaman
---
But it's close on all four counts. Just flip a coin!
---
We don't hate the Alliance because we think the more is real. It's because they fuck with us while questing. And they hate us form the same reason. 
---
Alliance is just shorthand for "those fuckers that kill us in barrens"
---
&gt;"concise"
---
&gt;10 minute videos
---
hmmm
---
Oi, gnome master race. This is disrespect!
---
I've looked everywhere and couldn't get a concrete answer, sooooo.... Could you Inspect another player in Vanilla?
---
Aren't we getting that?  Updated client and all, I thought people were talking about new graphic options.
---
Its absolutely a debuff thing. So the question comes down to what debuffs are better. And I am fairly sure a lot of it is player stigma. 
---
Just look at current wow where (mostly in na) people acted as if shamans were literally unplayable because they did some 5% less theoretical dps on a sim.
---
People hear "this is the best" on a video and they literally follow it like a bot, because digging in to the framework of why, is terrifying.
---
Hell, i got downvoted for saying a frostmage could do about 1k damage (based on this guys vods). Becase that was obviously a lie, and no frost mage could ever do that. 
---
I mean I'm cool with no transmog in Classic because that's part of the authentic experience, but ????? this seems like a weird thing to focus on, lol. Particularly since you haven't played since it was implemented. Transmog is one of the best-regarded features of Cata and continues to be hugely popular. There are plenty of valid criticisms of modern WoW, but IMO this hardly qualifies.
---
Yes, just right click their portrait. They have to be within range.
---
Thanks, dude!
---
You have no clue what you're talking about. A fury warrior in pre-raid bis is still the best dps in the game.
---
There is -100% chance that Blizz will develop anything for 1.12 beyond Naxx.
---
Lol k
---
Just do classic+.  
---
  It's a golden opportunity.  
---
  For the no changes crowd simply keep a couple realms that are on 1.13 forever and allow character copies.  
---
  No issue what so ever.  
---
 Interesting, good points and information. Though I didn't find FruitNut to be making any big conclusions. He pretty objectively tries to produce / show data, nothing more or less. Some others have said his methodology may be slightly flawed (not optimized rotation for fury dps)
---
Wotf ends any debate pvp related.
---
I like how WoD handled LFR gear. They had completely different models than their main raid counterparts, and were significantly simpler in design. They also weren't class-specific in appearance, so the Mage set looked like the Warlock set looked like the Priest set, and so on for the other armor types.
---
But, WoD only had two tiers and every other expansion before and after it just offered tier recolors in LFR. So, that didn't last.
---
The fact that you are being downvoted makes me excited about all the noobs that will be available in classic.
---
The bigger factor which people tend to overlook is whether Troll Priest's Hex of Weakness (20% less healing received) curse stacks with Mortal Strike. On private servers it does and there has been a lot more discussion recently about bringing a Troll Priest to premades because of it. We wont know if it stacks on Classic until there is a beta or release happens.
---
Oh man! The first shoulder piece and the first gold were the two most rewarding things
---
This guy sounds like a real jerk.
---
Warlock. I just flipped a coin .. no other reason
---
Same. I usually play from Europe with 20-30ms. Now while I’m in China, 300 is not great, but it really doesn’t affect my gameplay that much. You get used to it.
---
I fail to see how bringing up a few cherrypicked exceptions are relevant here. Both your examples are also from TBC bosses when we are discussing Vanilla.
---
That would be a good trick considering they don’t have vamp touch in vanilla.
---
Very informative and funny indeed
---
There's a lot of truth in this comment regarding skill levels and video's. The players that are most vividly remembered aren't necessarily the best at their classes, but more so the most entertaining.
---
Grim was definitely a good player, but more than anything I'd call him an entertainer. A clip like [this one](https://youtu.be/oWNt_8xcOZw?t=14m15s) is a great example, where Grim just completely styles on someone just because he can. The cooldown usage is far from ideal, but it's great to watch. Vurtne was also great, but again, I think he wouldn't have gotten as famous as he did if he wasn't also simply damn good at being entertaining.
---
I personally think this also holds for Perplexity. He seems to have been turned into the holy grail of vanilla PvP skill, and yes he is undoubtedly a superb player, but there's plenty of clips like [this one](https://youtu.be/AM1bSJm6GTE?t=14m9s) where he just does stuff that is effectively stupid but looks really awesome (pop sprint, sap rogue, open up on warrior, just to instantly turn around and prep + vanish and go back on the rogue, has to pop thistle because he wasted all his energy on a useless sap/cheap shot). It looks great because he's popping all these cooldowns, running around and CC'ing everyone, but effectively he just blew 2 cooldowns and a consumable to achieve nothing at all.
---
I don't mean to trash talk the skill of any of these players, to begin with they're intentionally playing to entertain instead of to be optimal, so I frankly can't even judge them for such plays. All I'm trying to say is that viewers really like to confuse entertaining play with optimal play and end up glorifying the skill of the people making them too much. There are definitely others out there that are just as good.
---
Hope gms will be swell in classic
---
Well going off what the typical player is in wow. I really don't see many people even knowing about the gimmicky items or engineering. Most players in wow are straight trash. The only reason any of them seem harder to kill presently is because blizzard spoon fed terrible players with all classes having some sort of oh shit button and CC/healing. Even on private servers I don't see the majority using them. 
---
I don't understand the inclusion of leveling. Are you just going to be constantly leveling the class you're choosing, or are you just asking the ease of leveling to 60 initially?  
---
Demon hunters are essentially night elf spellbreakers. Illidan was originally a mage. 
---
You can also try to get the Wailing Caverns set / Scarlet Monastery set. You'll like outlevel it as soon as you finally complete it but damn. That Embrace of the Viper set especially is good looking.
---
Rpers often fight using emotes and /roll
---
They dont actually fight. Could be why
---
I have raid healed as both a priest and druid and enjoyed both. I'd rather heal than anything, but it just depends on your personally. When my dad died a few years ago, I rolled a rogue and just felt like stabbing things instead/

Hardly. Mc has 1 fight you need to off tank. Also 2h slam or 2h hamstring is best fury dps spec until aq40 or bwl is on farm. Druids are also the superior off tank in mc (1.12 only) so not a bad idea to drop a feral or resto for a druid tank on domo fight. You really won't need to tank much as people think. 
---
Yeah blizz took warcraft in a weird direction...
---
They made thrall become orc Jesus and bring everyone together to hug under a giant rainbow.  So dumb. 
---
So in other words, you are a confessed asshole.
---
No thank you. Don't want your kind.
---
Does MF not take up a debuff? I imagine swp + shadow weaving will be preferred
---
Fury was always #1 dps of all classes. It got better on pservers as tanks itemised better for threat. 
---
Well you seem to enjoy pvp more than pve so I would go with shaman. Druid is literally only kiting in 1v1 fights, BUT the best flag carrier in the game. Meanwhile, shamans are beasts in solo pvp.. probably one of the most dangerous classes you can meet 1v1 and you can easily find a spot in premade because of your totems, purges and what not.
---
But if you want to become a designated flag carrier in a premade group then go for druid, keep in mind though that that's basically all they are good at if you ask me. You can learn kiting and become really strong against certain classes but.. you will mostly get demolished.
---
Also, for casual pve raiding you as a shaman will always find a spot or at least have an advantage compared to some other classes.. druid included.
---
Ret is a nightfall bot with heals. It has higher uptime than hunters and can contribute with buffs and heals.
---
I understand if you grab it on a holy paladin to go hit things with but it's utter garbage for both ret and enhance.
---
was his name Feraud?
---
t1 and t2 are tank sets for warriors....
---
Hardly underrated, I think most people love Winterspring.
---
Oh yes, "Have Fun", the most cancerous phrase on earth. I hear it is a banned phrase on Overwatch now.
---
Someone playing a Nightelf priest isn't harming any group at all. If a group really wants to minmax to that ridiculous degree they won't invite them anyway.
---
It's also not selfish to choose a race that you want to play. It's also not selfish to play less than 40 hours a week. It's also not selfish to burn less than 500 G on consumables and engineering doodads per raid.
---
It is selfish to demand that from random people on this subreddit though. It is selfish to demand that everyone confirms to your playstyle. You somehow got that exactly the same way around.
---
They probably understood perfectly.
---
Ye, it's all about debuffs.
---
As a long time shaman, I’m going to vote you off the fucking island if you keep saying “ench”.
---
It’s Enh or enhancement. 
---
Mage with enchanting
---
Dwarf mage isn't in Classic.  
---
&gt;Which class would you say is the most useful overall in a social/community aspect.
---
I’m going towards mage, specifically Dwarven but not that it matters.
---
What do you think?
---
Dwarves can't be mages in vanilla. You have to choose between gnome and human.
---
GL with that dwarven mage. You’ll have to clarify what you mean by social to get any useful answers. Levelling? In a guild? Raiding? 5 mans?
---
It’s the same timeless answer: tanks and healers.
---
Thats a lot closer than any of us would have thought.
---
I think he is talking about Onslaught Girdle, which was added to the MC loot table in the patch before BWL. 
---
Seconded by my vague recollections as well. A demonic descent dungeon would've fit very well in the game imo
---
You know it's vanilla when there are no keybinds
---
I agree, but don't forget about all the consumables you need for raiding. If you'll only have 10-15 hours a week it's gonna be a close call to get there.
---
Warlock. You’re in a dungeon and your tank leaves mid way through. Normally that would spell the end of a group. But you could find another one and summon them right to you. 
---
Every item in bwl has more stats than Mc except rag drops. Hence T2 items...
---
I don't even know why you are trying to argue this. You've clearly never played. I'm done
---
Vanilla flavors is hilarious and fun to watch!
---
I can severely disappoint you - that was what we used to talk to our sister guild before they had things like Greenwall ect. 
---
Biggest change was definitely the black tabby.
---
https://imgur.com/mEWCPEG
---
Ye, whatever they do next, they'll always displease people.
---
Great thanks 
---
I used to play on Rexxar - Horde in a guild named The Exiled. The key members of the guild passed me by because like an idiot, i had a job and family lol.
---
I would really enjoy playing with some of those people again, recruited from EQ2 back in the day. 
---
I have experience in all aspects of the original game, my account has been active through every miserable expansion.
---
I’m confused by your statement of most people not knowing about key bindings, it’s always been easy to let bond even using the default UI and Bartender existed during Vanilla. And some of what you say isn’t true. Back in Vanilla TONS of us used things like Thottbot for various things. It’s true there was a lot more player communication but acting as if we never used the internet for various things is just incredibly untrue. 
---
Main tanking in anything but a super casual guild with 10-15 hours a week is going to mean you have to be insanely efficient with your time outside of raid if you want to keep your spot. Like, every second basically has to be spent getting your fire res set, your reps, your professions, your consumables for raid (the big one). It's doable if you don't plan on doing content while it's current, but again, you won't really have time to do anything except farm gold/consumables and raid.
---
It doesn’t lock schools though
---
and this would be manageable as a healing priest rogue or hunter?
---
It looks like you printed it out, wrapped it around the can, colored the top black with a marker and then added blur to hide your sloppy work.
---
Am I right or am I right?
---
Once u figure out how to get around Thousand Needles is strikingly pretty bad very cool.  And judging by the fact it hasn’t been mentioned here makes it underrated.  
---
There used to be no flight point in Un'Goro for almost all of Vanilla. 2 years of riding across most of Tanaris and down that path into that crater.
---
If anyone dislikes this beautiful zone I expect it's because of that.
---
I for one don't care about this grind since I will never bother doing it and will only get to rank 3 or 4 for the rep boost and nothing else. But as the OP pointed out, this system did lead to major real world issues, namely obsessively playing so long that real health concerns began. And this was during a time period where there was no social media pressure to achieve this goal. 
---
What I'm concerned about is that, if this system comes out now, it will 100% lead to real world issues and THAT will lead to extremely negative media (both commercial media and social media) articles/videos, and THAT will lead to blizzard or Activision drastically changing the system to combat the negative press, or even potential lawsuits. So, instead of blizzard making a change that makes sense and is balanced, I can see them overeacting and giving us a system that nobody wants. 
---
There's a reason to be concerned about r14.

Shamans are really bad when they are being focused.  And one interrupt shuts down all healing as well as your nature damage spells.  It’s really frustrating.  
---
I didnt have fun at all PvPing in a full Resto spec, but really enjoyed the 30/0/21 elemental spec.   
---
&gt; Believed to be gifts granted by Ner'zhul
---
While its a long shot it could have been taken from the nerubians that share some kind of ancestry to the arachnids of silithus.
---
thanks
---
agree to disagree :)
---
I've clearly never played the game...You're the one who said that the top parsing class in MC is unviable before BWL.  
---
Have none of you stumbled upon decades old cans of beer?  The seal isn’t perfect. Over a long time, gases escape, you dullards. 
---
Give it a try! I haven’t played WoW in ages but am hyped for some reason. Maybe nostalgia?
---
Anyway, give it a shot if money is not an issue. It’s a slower pace game, rewarding pay off, deceptive depth to classes and mechanics. Typically great community who ultimately “work together” and i imagine it’ll be an older crowd this time around. Give it a run if you like RPGs for sure
---
Thank you I’ll look into it 
---
If you're a warlock and the tank leaves you can also just solo the dungeon while the other three guys watch. I had to do that a couple times on my warlock back in vanilla.
---
I wanted plus poop
---
ARCANITE REAPER HOOOOOOO
---
In general DPS/healers will require a lot less time investment because you need less gold and random pieces of gear than a main tank. Especially something like a Hunter, where you can easily clear 40-50g/hr in Maraudon solo and get your gold for consumables/epic mount pretty easily compared to something like a Prot Warrior that doesn't solo farm very well.
---
Offtanking is pretty cool though if you're worried about the main tank time crunch and you get to play Prot and Fury so that's fun
---
Also shadow weaving and vampiric embrace. I think bare minimum a shadow priest is still taking 2 of the 16 debuff slots.
---
alright thanks man, username does not check out!
---
NA pvp player here. I plan on going alliance rogue and paladin and looking to raid weekly and be active in world pvp. Looking for other players to be ready for lunch with! UNTIL THEN, I would like to play some other casual multiplayer games to get to know everyone. Basically trying to create or join a group of cool, casual/competitive gamers to play with on launch and before! PM me if interested.
---
Chess is from the 6th century. How's that for "archaic game design"?
---
Is that the 1tb Hd or 256 ssd?
---
not as viable as in tbc with the better drain life talent but it definitely works.  leveled  warlock and switched to mana battery imp at 40 and could pull 4-5 green mobs and dot/drain them down.  pretty sketchy on a pvp server because you're constantly juggling low hp/mana but it's really fun
---
It comes down to the childlike of mentality of "if I don't like it no one can"
---
I really like shadow priests, and I'll play one as my second char, but some quick research had them doing less than half the DPS of the top few classes in endgame.
---
This is sad, but probably true.
---
That's not a long shot, that's actually canon. The Qiraji and the Nerubians share a common ancestry in the Aqir. They were an ancient insectoid race that worshiped the Old Gods, until their masters were defeated and their empire was split in two (or three, depending on whether you take MoP into consideration).
---
These events are delved into deeper in ["The Twin Empires."](https://www.wowhead.com/object=175854/the-twin-empires)

*OwO, what's this? * It's your **3rd Cakeday** MomoSinX! ^(hug)
---
Why are people saying mages?
---
DPS is a dime a dozen.
---
Simple answer is tanks and healers....
---
U need to put points in armor to unlock the other talents.. and I personally prefer overall mitigation vs shield blocks that block more.dmg
---
Definitely go for the SSD unless the other one is cheaper - but even then only if you're planning on replacing the hard drive with a bigger SSD or SSHD. Running a hard drive as a boot drive in 2019 is disgusting and it honestly shouldn't be an option at all. So either go 256GB SSD, or get the hard drive if cheaper and immediately replace it with a bigger SSD. 
---
There's definitely a debate
---
Arent those from a private server and showing overall dps throughout an entire raid? Including trash.
---
If i dont misremember there was a ret pally that dealth like 800 dps on patchwerk back in 2007.
---
It was a long time ago tho so my memory might be a bit foggy.
---
I made a post like this a couple weeks ago but it covered all the different things they could do but its very similar to what you said by adding new raids and even 5/10 man dungeons.  doesn't even have to all be naxx gear epics.. could be some of the better blues or a Tier 0.7 or something that's a long expensive quest chain to give you gear for shadow priests or prot / ret paladins.. but in a time where no one cares about those offsets because the server is 3 years old and naxx has been cleared multiple times and everyone is speed running naxx. 
---
Not as bad as STV
---
If you are trying to top DPS meters, a priest is not your best bet.
---
you can always throw fear wards out, specifically on rogues 
---
How would you describe the playstyle? One interrupt would also shutdown all healing and nature damage spells, wouldn't it?
---
You got to heal or do damage most of the time?
---
I hear it praised relatively frequently, but usually not as succinctly as you did here. This is a great summary, good call!
---
Definitely, beautiful scenery in parts of it too!
---
Dude yeah it looks insane, but I know I'd get really bored of bombing one guy and having to wait 5 flaccid minutes to do it again to the next one you know what I mean?    You seem like you know stuff haha, do you know how valuable the off-hand damage buffs actually are from the combat tree? Coming from ESO 50 % weapon damage is a god buff and wouldn't make sense
---
It was strong, but it also sucked meeting a pally or priest if i recall correctly. This was back in Beta so can't remember everything :)
---
For extra accuracy, it would be great if someone could share the link on the classic forums. I don't have an active account at the moment
---
Never seen or head of this ret pally but if you have a screen shot or something I'd love to see it.
---
&gt;They're always in demand for dungeons
---
Can't say I've ever seen demand for mages in dungeons at all honestly, and there's usually enough of them that they're not exactly in short supply for raids either. 
---
Sadly, that is part of the true classic experience. I remember people typing pages and pages on how horde/alliance quests/raiding/pvp is unbalanced and the other side should be nerfed to the ground. The forums were lousy with posts like that.
---
I’m not talking nerf cry’s. I’m talking people being so vitriolic that they demand a faction be in the gutter or out of the story for multiple expansions. And almost every time the factions are brought up I see personal attacks and entire threads being deleted.
---
Tank/healer &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any DPS (mage included)

Hannibal ad portas.

Thanks again for the response
---
That latter thing is part of Classic though. We became buddies, working together by the time 1.9 came out.
---
Please just take your time to polish it.
---
Also wait until Winter 2019, then you can make it release on the 15th anniversary of the game, which is much nicer.

Big fan of his content

I'm going to make it out to Norway at some point in my life. My godfather was a foreign exchange student from Norway with my parents in high school. Only met him a handful of times though. 
---
Modern game design is based around attempting to appeal to every possible demographic out there to please investors while alienating the actual loyal player base from the game. Then using micro transactions to make up for the fact that the player numbers are plummeting to keep the game profitable. Instead of making a good game that knows what it wants to be.

Oh man, 29 warrior twinks were such powerhouses. I wouldn't even mess with someone who had the [Corposemaker](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6687) twink or no twink.

Not that easy, you have to be outside the instance to summon them to the instance. Then you have to /who a main city and start messaging people. By the time you find someone, all the trash has respawned.
---
Still useful but nowhere near as easy as you make it sound.
---
Mages are too common. Roll a tank and half the server will have you on their friend list. 
---
People like mages because their CC options are all easy and stable. That and free water make them the top choice for DPS slots in dungeons.
---
Serious guilds typically bring eight mages to raids. That's four times the number of slots they typically have for hunters or druids but mages only have double the population.
---
That’s just how the rogue class works. It’s a very cooldown dependent class. There is no spec that turns your rogue into a warrior. You will always be very cool down dependent no matter what spec you choose. All Prep does is give you more cooldowns to play with. 
---
Pallies really are amazing in pvp depending on your specc and skill. I had a guildie who loved to tank and pvp. The two of us (pally/warr) would go around and wreck entire groups of players in EPL. I couldn't tell you his specc but he had enough off heals to keep us alive and BoF for those annoying mages. Good times.
---
Wait for Classic to launch. My wrath shall be swift, peasants. 
---
And in your mind you cant fathom that many people like the idea of actually having extremely useful racial abilities in raid and that many guilds will not invite non dwarf priests into their raids. There is a playerbase that dont remember vanilla that well or started in a later expansion or never played wow before and are looking to forums to see what the discussion is about. They then see all these posts saying "play what you want! it doesnt matter!" .. well what if that person wants to be wanted in decent guilds? What if the plan on being in a more hardcore guild? I know that if i wasnt knowledgeable about wow and read a thread saying "everyone gets invited to raid in guilds" and "dont worry about what you pick!" and then did just that... only to realize that no decent guild wants to raid with a prot paladin then id be pretty pissed that my only option is to join a more casual guild as a ret or become a healer. What if i wanted to tank and came across some of the threads parading sub par specs as "everything is viable, play whatever you want xd" and then leveled to 60 thinking I could tank? Even with dps it feels shitty to literally pull HALF as much dps as other classes, people should be fully aware of what theyre getting into with this stuff. Same with boomkins. These specs are just really really bad and this isnt about minmaxing, its about not being an idiot when the difference in viability is so large. 
---
Classic will not have more players than retail. 
---
I doubt even during the launch period it would, and even then it will be short lived.
---
I bet you the gold for an epic mount it won't have more. feel free to PM me for the gold when you prove me wrong.

Being a pink-bearded gnome with engineering. Nogginfogger shrink + world enlarger. Best 10 minutes of running around IF.

I remember that as well.
---
I realized there was something really wrong with pservers rates when the rate turned out to be so high on my latest playthrough. Because it was so low, I remember spending the better part of an hour on vanilla on it
---
yea better hope they dont get crushing blowed while in zerker stance and they dont die , sure would be an awful way to wipe. Better hope that they can time their zerker rage correctly to not get stuck in defensive stance when they fear. Cause its totally possible to switch stances once already feared.
---
No idea both systems are easily corrupted but one requires me to trust strangers to be honorable and I dont see it working out well. Maybe pug and pray will be best option for us...
---
This is what I'm banking on. TBC is my favorite "game" ever
---
It's one of the very, very few zones in vanilla I could conceivably get lost in without a minimap and discover new places during Classic. If you were Alliance, it was just that remote
---
Why Jagex did it for 2007 scape. You have no idea what the future holds. We'll see, but don't be so confident that the thing that is the best example of what Blizzard is attempting won't be copied.
---
GAMER FUEL!
---
&gt;Also wait until Winter 2019
---
Shut up
---
Mix makes more sense than in the middle.  Unless we are supposed to imagine some gold farming scale with AoE on one end and boss farming on the other or something?
---
The fact that skill is rewarded, and being bad is punishable.
---
For example, I remember raiding and the bads would get kicked out because they couldn’t avoid boss mechanics to avoid wiping. Lol 
---
Drain specs aren’t great in Vanilla. SL/SL worked so well in TBC because it had great synergy with resilience. You were unkillable while slowly rotting your opponents. 
---
In Classic it’s all about outbursting your opponents. And Warlocks are amazing at this so there’s no reason to gimp yourself with a drain spec. 
---
Balthasaur, My arch-nemesis on the blackrock server.  
---
I can't recall where it all began but as a orc warrior this human paladin had to die, this was our world.  
---
I remember viciously camping one another in the arathi highlands every time we were trying to get some questing done. Thought is was over? think again I was just hiding behind that tree/rock until you over pulled, so I could kill you and take your mobs.  
---
I remember screaming BALTHASAUR at the top of my lungs every time a hammer of justice stopped me in my tracks or pulled me off my mount while I was exploring a new zone.  
---
I remember fighting each other for over 2 hours for a gurubashi chest, all so I could have that sweet sweet victory of a bubble hearth.  
---
I remember the endless emote spams of /spit after every time I died, making the blood course through my veins.  
---
I remember him re-rolling engineering months after we had both been 60, running into him in arathi basin Bg all so he could gnomish mind control cap me and emote "haha stupid kid".  
---
I won't ever forget in fact, because one day he was just...gone.  
---
What are some of your best/worst memories from Stranglethorn Vale? 
---
Mine happen to be Gurubashi Arena playing on Arathor. The place became a social, and pvp hotspot during the transition from TBC to Wrath. This allowed people to seriously screw over members of your own faction, which lead to the worst rivalries I've ever seen in the game.
---
One method is to randomly include a different member from the guild to witness the loot council decision making process in order to provide accountability from an excluded member.
---
Ah the old clit mouse.
---
I think it's kinda surprising that we didn't get blood elves/high elves considering they were such an important part of warcraft 3. I suppose blizzard didn't want to launch with two elf races. Gnomes were a rather surprising inclusion by contrast.
---
I remember writing it off entirely very early on and never doing more with Deadwind Pass than just passing through. Definitely one of my Classic objectives is to make the most of it
---
Runescape is for autistic kids

I'm in the same boat as you. I'm an European that is working night shifts, and my work starts from 21:00. It will be a PAIN to find a guild that actually starts raiding 17:00 or 17:30

I had a bottle of the Halo 3 game fuel saved from 2007. It was in my mini fridge that I've had since like 2005. Mini fridge was in my home office and at Thanksgiving last year, my sister in law went in there for a drink and grabbed it without me knowing.

She threw up a few hours later.

Serves her right.

In a similar vein, night elf glaive weapons. The NPCs got them for pete sakes, why didn't we?

I was doing this in retail a couple days ago just to see if it works on the modern engine. Fence kiting is legit.

Getting summoned in thin air over a cliff, and falling to my certain death.

Mind Controlled into lava, outside cliffs, or being used to attack my own faction members and then getting stomped by said faction members.
---
I remember on a private server, race to 60 I was the first person to get to STV.
---
I had a GM spawn in on me and we chatted a bit. He was probably checking to make sure I wasnt a bot.
---
From there, I had like a 4 level advantage, and was able to get through STV relatively unscathed. 
---
Over the next few days, as thousands of players hit level 30 they would trickle into STV their cries could be heard for 60s in global chat.
---
The resulting bloodbath from stealthing around  murdering was some of the most fun I ever had in WoW. 
---
Nevermind BGs, world pvp was where it was at. You could literally stall the progression of the other faction in many areas.
---
How about we all designate one of the pvp servers as the place to go for anyone who wanted an rp-pvp server? Anyone who wanted to make an rp-pvp themed guild could do so there. 
---
I want it SO bad!

Yeah platinumwow makes some of the best classic videos out there atm, he deserves more followers for sure

How much does a piece of gear vendor for these days?

That must have been amazing. I would love to see a coordinated group of horde dedicate themselves to dominating the vale at launch. Extra points if they are trolls.
---
Pugs require you to trust even more unknown strangers...
---
It seems you and your wife's commitment to raiding is low. Which is fine. You just need to find a guild that fits your level of raid commitment. You can't join an active guild when you are *"inconsistently available"* and then expect to be treated like a 100% attendance raider.
---
I hope I don't offend you, but reading your comments it sounds like you expect more loot than your low raiding commitment entitles you to receive. 
---
you don't need an active account to post to the official classic forums

also once u have 2 u want a 3rd so keep it in mind

I mean it doesn't really show much other than on some private test server in a vacuum he can get his dps meter to say X with priest abilities.  Not going to be able to use all of that on raid bosses, resists may be bonkers, how do we know spell coefficients are accurate on his test server, in a raid you would also have the lock shadow bolt crit debuff, otherwise ok, maybe? Really hard to extrapolate it to a live classic raid boss.  The 15% shadow damage buff basically equals another warlock in the raid if you have 6-7 locks plus the shadow priest dps.  If you have a lock heavy raid its totally worth making room for a spriest.  If you only have a couple locks.... meh.
---
You’re going oom so you use a Mana pot....
---
So no, literally everyone goes oom. But we need help so we bring consumables.
---
Therefore, mama IS an issue for priests(everyone really). I agree though, play whatever the fuck race you want. Everyone over thinks this. 
---
Not to mention he's posting BC levelling gear in a Classic WoW subreddit
---
Yeah I respect the effort he put into this but running all the way to darkshore and loch modan and crafting stuff just seems like a a lot of time and effort for lowbie gear
---
Oh, they would be trolls no matter their race.
---
&gt;I'm not complaining about a system I've not had experience with
---
&gt;How is LC not a corrupt system. 
---
Okay dude....
---
I think u/asc__ assumed you knew what LC is, since you have a VERY strong opinion on LC. It then turns out you don't know how LC works ref your latest comment... And you are combative and hostile AF towards asc__ so I don't blame him if he doesn't feel like holding your hand and explaining a loot distribution system. And I have no idea why you bring up vanilla in a loot distribution debate.
---
Both LC and DKP have been used since forever in all MMOs. And the pros and cons of both have been explained to you multiple times already. You just choose to stay ignorant on the topic, and apparently that doesn't stop you from having an extremely strong opinion. 
---
Its popular and I always used it but i never liked the fact they added it imo lol
---
Published 2010
---
How come, if I may ask?
---
I like the fact that everyone wants to play there own spec... But this constant "I don't care what this person says I'm doing it anyways" and the "You can't play the game this way it's wrong" bickering just has to stop! 
---
Play to have fun... Why does everything need to be accredited on a forum for someone's joy to be validated! 
---
Madness...
---
No, this i how I remember the World of Warcraft cinematic trailer:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZtzy80n8WI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZtzy80n8WI) 
---
This is true for old pop tops.  Not for modern cans.
---
Also you entire point about people not wanting people to play certain things has been totally invalidated by the fact you've said you are making a guild that doesn't want Dwarf Priests... What if someone new just happens to like Priest and like Dwarf? Is that person now excluded from your guild for accidentally Min-Maxing?! 
---
I was kinda hoping the poop for a ididntknowwhatiexpected.gif
---
Always been a fan of seeing the gear that other players were using.. not what they had just collected at some point in the game. 
---
Im a big pvper so judging people by there armor and weapons was a big thing aswell and Transmog took that away
---
Engineering is too important for raiding and pvp to not have it on your main if you are at all a serious player in classic.
---
What if there was an option? So you keep your #nochanges character and if you want to opt in to try out the new vanilla content it copies your character to a new server?
---
100% voting don't if those are the options.
---
WoW basically gives everyone a participation ribbon for subscribing.  You pay for that ribbon. 
---
Gotcha. That's a good point. I don't pvp on retail at all so that's not been a concern personally, but I can see why it would be detrimental in that respect. On the other hand, it seems like PvP gear is super similar these days anyway
---
So I should be gimped in every other aspect of the game just because the guild doesn't want to have a dedicated shadow priest spot? No thanks, I'm a healer, the warlocks can do less damage for all I care.
---
No one fights like Gaston
---
No one smites like Gaston 
---
No one bubbles and hearths in a fright like Gaston. 
---
Exhibit A
---
So in the actual World of Warcraft, it's likely that these races/factions would attack each other out in the world. So if you're roleplaying as an actual Orc, and a Dwarf runs by you somewhere, you're likely to want to attack him. Can't do that on PvE servers.
---
You’re probably going to be a little underwhelmed if it’s your first time. It’s definitely going to feel dated if you’ve played other newer MMOs
---
If you don't believe me you can go look it up.
---
I'm probably just being pedantic, but one of the two main warlock pve specs (sm/ruin) has 30 points in affliction, so it's not really true that you don't have affliction locks in raids, it's just that the locks you do have focus on keeping up the damage boosting curses (elements, recklessness, and shadow) and then casting direct damage spells rather than focusing on dots for dps.
---
On trash packs with high hp mobs you do get to multi-dot some as a lock, where you use agony and corruption on the mobs you're *not* killing first before casting direct damage spells on the priority target.
---
Just finished watching the series.  This guy's testing methodology is so broken it makes it impossible to compare anything to anything in his videos.  Which is unfortunate as his video quality is decent, but his methods make it totally useless info.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **2nd Cakeday** FetTR! ^(hug)
---
Azeroth does not encompass the entirety of the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
WC3 Reforged has new models and textures from scratch.
---
Classic WoW will have options perhaps for increased draw distance, texture resolution, particle and doodad density, shadows and maybe filtering, but no new models or fundamentally redone textures. Vanilla had a very particular art style which was quite coherent. Redoing the graphics from scratch would make it seem verrrrrrrrrrrry different and weird, and would surely delay release.
---
WC3 Reforged in my opinion seems to suffer from strange scaling issues because the old graphics updated now make the large characters seem absurd compared to the small buildings. With the original art style, this was less apparent. When you go for realism, artistic liberty is more restricted.
---
For 2004, Vanilla graphics are actually god-tier, and it actually is my favorite looking game of all time, though maybe tied with the first 2 Kingdom Hearts games, which were also "cartoony", but in all the right ways.
---
We're currently *still* in the uncanny valley for games, and I honestly don't like games which try to be photorealistic, including modern WoW, because they are never close enough. Vanilla is made fun of for being cartoony, but that's my favorite part! Zones like Teldrassil and Ashenvale are to my eyes totally perfect, like a living mix between an oil and watercolor painting. The non-realistic almost impressionist and stylized art of Vanilla was the most important factor for me in terms of immersion.
---
I have the cardboard cutout of the orc still! Such a treasured possession, though it's gotten a little banged up after a few moves :(
---
I was gonna say the same thing. It's not as easy in newer areas, but it's definitely still a thing and used in some dungeons
---
While this is true it’s also going to heavily depend on your the weapons available to you. MC is a bit more dagger heavy but once you get into BWL and Onyxia you will be able to grab some strong swords that will help you pull ahead. 
---
If you aren’t raiding at all you’ll likely end up trying to get the Dal Rend set (swords). 
---
That being said daggers are the way to go for PvP due to much higher burst damage. 
---
The people deserve to know the truth of the matter.
---
Well, summer ends on the September 22nd, so... you whish for the August 31st.
---
I would keep that can in my room rather than throw it in the trashcan.
---
Hah, never saw that one. Someone in the comments pointed out that you can see northrend and Pandaria on the map.
---
Platinum WoW is one of my favorite Classic WoW channels. I love his use of humor and his Dungeon dives videos are great. 
---
But just like blink, it still has some exceptions. Try blinking in Silvershard Mines. Some fences still do this, I used fence tricks a lot during Garrison Invasions in WoD. And in Freehold theres a few spots you can do this, although it's very tricky.
---
...though that doesn't affect Classic really, if nothing is changed pathing wise RIP most fence tricks. But I bet they'll use some older pathing, though I'd imagine they dont care about giving back evading issues
---
And what makes them so awful testing methods?
---
Undead priest or troll shaman.
---
The struggle is real 
---
Yea, you're right, but I think most people (and you) will know what I mean about there not being "affliction" locks in raids - i.e, DoT casters. While a pure affliction lock could do high DPS, their debuff limit locks them from that - no CoA / SL / Corruption on bosses for DPS meters to judge. 
---
&gt; I mean it doesn't really show much other than on some private test server in a vacuum he can get his dps meter to say X with priest abilities.
---
A little harsh of an overstatement
---
Do hunters fall off later towards aq in pvp like they do in pve? Or is it just a numbers game for pve? 
---
Why are you roleplaying a dwarf as a 13 year old edge lord
---
At least talk like a dwarf 
---
You’re thinking of BC expansion
---
HE CRACKED THE CODE! TAKE THE SHOT! TAKE THE SHOT!!!
---
Why are you shitting over a game you don't even play with horrifically wrong information?
---
Yeah and you have to stand right next to them to do it, the range is something like 5 yards I think 
---
The truth is readily available... People would rather play what is BiS. 
---
I have a blue and red can
---
It's because people don't want to see the game stagnate and lose players over time. Whether it takes 3 years, 5 years, or 10 years, that will be the eventual fate of classic if new content isn't added or if fresh servers aren't released. Look at osrs, they were losing players until they started adding content voted on by the community. Now because of their added content osrs is way more popular that it was.
---
In the 30/0/21 spec you’re going around blowing people up while throwing out quick heals, purges, and totems.  Getting interrupted while lighting bolting shuts down your healing too so you’re pretty helpless for a while. 
---
i mean..
---
Close. 1700x and 2080.
---
&gt;**private server.**
---
that's why you don't understand
---
lol
---
Random selection of consumables, not the correct enchants, not the correct rotations, incredibly short testing duration for a statistic that is incredibly variable (dps) in such a short burst due to crits, chance to apply buffs, etc (should really repeat each test 15-20 times or run each straight for at least an hour), no trinket swapping, no group utility, everything that comes along with expecting private test server mechanics to mirror classic at all, improper use of cooldown timing, debuff limits, the debuffs on the dummy are not even always shown nor consumables used... it just goes on and on and on...
---
&gt;  you do need to accept however that you are a niche 
---
Hardcore, min-maxing players are the niche and that is not exclusive to only optimal classes. You will find far, far, FAR more of the casual crowd that are very accepting of anybody playing anything than not.
---
My guild decided to do the arena for shiggles one night. We all took positions in the stands and waited for the chest. A couple of horde showed up to try their luck. We didn't engage until the chest spawned. They were killed first, then my guild began their melee. After a while, the horde we killed respawned and tried for the chest while my guildies were all fighting. I ran in and fear bombed them (I was a priest), then started looting the chest with no expectation of getting it. I watched the loot timer anxiously, and got the loot off just as a guildie started yelling "the chest! The chest!" A lot of moaning and groaning followed once they'd realized who'd gotten it. I died a horrible death as soon as I'd looted it, and we all had a good laugh. I'd never bothered with the arena before, so it only pissed them off more when I asked what the drops were good for.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I WANT there to be useful take home info from that series, it just is not there unfortunately.  
---
Very nice! I remember testing this back in vanilla. Here are some wow vanilla pathing exploit videos I created:
---

---
It's not.
---
Yes but what I was saying is that if you play for example a Prot Paladin. You are likely one of VERY few that play that spec, and therefore are a Niche. 
---
I agree that for the most part people will be very accepting of all Class/Race/Spec combinations, which is why this constant Min-Max Vs Niche bickering baffles me! It is a slippery slope and I think from what I've seen on the forums, there are a fair few people being scared out of their choices due to the fact they think they might not be taken into a raid. 
---
That's not what Classic is about, and that saddens me!
---
the elistists will be the minority, i guarantee there will be a lot of friendly people.
---
Something tells me there will be quite a lot of new players since pc gaming has become more popular compared back in 2006
---
Furthermore youll encounter shitty people from time to time but dont let that make or break the game for you, you will sometimes have to build tough skin or just ignore them. Just be self aware that youre not giving a shitty attitude, as for being newbish youll learn along the way and you can always let people know youre new and they will be ok with that.
---
You're right, he could be more clear with the enchants / consumables being used, but it seems roughly equivalent. I would say the time tested is statistically significant, and does not need to be run "15-20 times" in order to get a good hold on dps. Spriest rotation goes like this: "SW:P, Mindflay. Not going oom? Mindblast," rinse repeat. There's no trinket swapping in combat, so... should he test multiple specific trinkets for peak dps testing? That's very silly. And yes, the tests specifically are without the group debuffs, and I addressed that in the first post. 
---
That test duration is very adequate to gauge DPS, and I don't know how to respond to the fact you think it should be tested "15-20 times" that's absurd quite frankly. 
---
It's good content to at least bring some data to the table, be evaluated, critiqued, honed as accurately as possible. There isn't really anyone else making these sort of videos, so I respect the content creator in that regards. We should look at these with skepticism and again, try to base these as accurately as possible. 
---
If all you ahve is 10 to 15 hours a week I would suggest not main tanking.  Just off tank when needed.
---
If you liked Warlock then I would recommend Warlock for Classic. I played a Human Warlock on a medium population PVE Alliance server. I chose Herbalism and Tailoring. I farmed the Robe of the Void. 
---
This time I will roll a Undead Warlock with Tailoring and Herbalism on a high population PVP server. 
---
The Warlock community is very helpful. There are many macros that make using your demon easier. Shadowburn, fear, and Shadowbolt is very satisfying. You can take on 3+ mobs and end the fight with no downtime if you are smart about it. There is a macro to prevent soulshards from filling your bag. Farming soul shards isn't that bad, but they don't stack in Classic so bag space is annoying. 
---
SM/Ruin is fun to play, but leveling specs are also a lot of fun. Be prepared to provide health stones and summons, but it helps get  spot in the raid. 
---
You can breath underwater. Your first mount is free! This will let you save gold for maxing out Tailoring and getting better bag space. You can rez yourself with a soul stone. The class quests are also awesome. 
---
I'm rolling a Warlock again, but this time I will roll Undead for Will of the Forsaken and barrens chat. Good luck!
---
Pretty srue that can is old enough to give you at least four different diseases...
---
I read that as old pop tarts... X_X 
---
+1 vote for troll shammy, raptors rule!
---
Oh man, I forgot all about my raptor!!!
---
&gt; Spec to Kill, aka S2K raids and downs Onyxia back in vanilla.  This was an old video that was posted finally years later for those who wanted to remember our very first downing of that dragon.  It was a great feat for a guild to beat her with a paladin main tank.  Thank you all for believing in me.  It meant a lot. 
---
If only you could read.
---
I can agree with this. I quit around the time my daughter was born in 2011. Then revived the game sporadically over the next few years until I quit entirely in 2015. When I heard about classic I haven’t been able to get it off my mind. I feel like an addict about to relapse. For me it’s nostalgia, but I’ve also never played any other mmorpg. 
---
&gt; Not going to be able to use all of that on raid bosses 
---
Use all of what?
---
&gt; resists may be bonkers 
---
No, not really. People had already gotten Naxx on farm and made consistent guides for all forms of DPS classes. If resists "were bonkers" you'd know. Spell pen would be in every toolkit (and it did begin to show up). Not much more to say on that - this test could be on a test dummy but instead he's using a level (70? patchwerk?) for "raid" dummy testing.  
---
&gt; how do we know spell coefficients are accurate on his test server
---
Fair question, we'd have to see him show spell power specifically and then use a single spell for us to gauge, since we know coeffs from classic. Pretty sloppy if he tweaked those numbers (for some random reason favoring casters and skewing objective data?). 
---
&gt;in a raid you would also have the lock shadow bolt crit debuff + CoS, any agro consideration?  
---
Same goes for the other test videos. He's not using full raid debuffs, this is after all, just a dps test. I addressed the lack of raid debuffs in my post as well. 
---
I extrapolate this much; Spriests have significant DPS, though the viability of them in a raid as multiples is questionable due to debuff limits which in turn hamper their DPS through a lack of SWP. The damage a pre-raid BiS Spriest can deal is surprisingly not many tiers below end game BiS.
---
I'd buy one if they'd release a zero diabetes version. I'd buy a stack of trays just like that.
---
I believe there was a Blizzard employee who said something along the lines of "meetings used to be run by the programmers, now they're run by the financial officers."
---
I remember Ashakandi dropping and we had only fury warriors, and none had the dkp for it anyway, and one of the pallies got it for ret...........While they didn't care when I got finkles, they were howling for weeks when the other guy got Ashkandi!
---
I made a costume out of these for Blizzcon way back.   Wasn’t the best but I was proud of it :) https://youtu.be/VTgsPqT1siE?t=6m11s
---
Human Warrior or dwarf priest, if ur leading a raiding guild why not be one of those crucial roles 
---
Wow, Felwood and Winterspring are both great picks and are 2 places I go to farm when I want a change of place from my favorite zone. A place I call home and definitely underrated due to it's aesthetic. That place is the Burning Steppes. Literally a burning hellscape but one that is loaded with riches. From the numerous rich thorium veins to the mobs that drop all manner of good cloth and random blue and epic drops Burning Steppes is my home. 
---
The ogre caves in the mountain north of the alliance FP has at least 2, up to 5 rich thorium veins. The ogres on that mountain can drop mid 40 epics well and they drop blues fairly regularly. On the western part of the map, the cultists also have solid drops with the fire elementals dropping elemental fires and hearts of fire. Tons of thorium veins in the western part of the map as well
---
I teach 8 year olds (2nd grade). They don’t know about wow only fortnite, roblox and Minecraft 
---
it's not the same.
---
there was a tetris one in vanilla as well.
---
My apologies. Day drinking caught up with me then. Definitely came off a tad bit strong
---
I didn’t think wow would still be around by the time I had a kid old enough to play with me. Now I have a 7 year old girl who is great at console games and loves dragons. Maybe this is the year she learns wow. 
---
Undead warrior or undead warlock 
---
All of this information besides the three classes you listed you wanted to play is useless unless I wanted to social engineer my way into your accounts.
---
Warlock, Hunter or Ret.
---
Do you want to be melee or range? That one narrows it down to either 1 or 2. If ranged, do you want to be OP spamming one button (Lock), or just "okay"? Do you want to control your pets and force them to do what you want, or be one with them, tame them and fight with them until you learn their abilities and then teach them to other pets, and have to feed them all the time else they run away?
---
Tl;dr pick what you'll have fun with, only you can decide that. Also remove your personal info, it does nothing to help other than put you slightly more at risk. 
---
Why do kids do this today? Why are you leaving this up to a random group of strangers? Thats just ridiculous man. 
---
Just pick one for Elunes sake. We arnt your parents!
---
Ok I see we have a case of the blind leading the blind a bit here.  Please note that all of my criticism are not specific to the shadow priest video but include the entire series.  Trinket swapping is a technique unique to classes that can drop combat during a fight to get the on use effect from multiple trinkets in a single encounter (ie rogues and hunters).  
---
Your personal opinion on what you think is statistically significant is irrelevant.  We can talk confidence intervals and standard deviations but 4 min per test is horrible for certainty.  Critting once or twice on big abilities while CDs are popped vs not is going to be a MASSIVE swing in dps for such a short fight.  
---
If you are looking for some data to make any kind of guesstimate as to what classic may look like dps-wise, check out a few dozen legacy logs or the like from some of the top guilds back in the day for what ever class you are interested in instead of this.
---
I'd say it definitely was revived when BfA was announced and launched, including the commercials they released etc. However it was super quick to die out as it was completely stopped and forgotten once BfA actually launched...
---
Shame, it was the first time in years me and my friends actually have faction rivalry - dirty horde scum.
---
OSRS and Classic WoW serve 2 entirely different purposes though, not sure why that comparison keeps getting made
---
He’s not actually going to make what we tell him. This is a I wanna talk about wow because i’m excited post.
---
Or spend an inordinate time trying to build an early set, I'm looking at you Scarlet armor set, then realize at 40 their Warrior/Paladin gets plate
---
I can get behind that.
---
You could tank ony with a rogue in vanilla....
---
Funny enough, I think they had your "Warcraft III in WoW" idea [as an April Fools joke back in 2005.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/New_World_of_Warcraft_Player_vs._Player_Combat_Improvements)
---
Or you could just assign a number to each class, and roll the dice until it falls on the number of the class you like best.
---
Why are you making a war thread? Just let everyone play the game how they want to.. it's a game
---
It always bugged me how some class/race combinations didn’t exist for players when they’re plentiful among the npcs 
---
I am certainly going to take it in to consideration. I am looking for a random consensus to help me decide.  
---
Only if you are prepared to experience the single greatest MMO ever made.  There is something in classic for everyone to appreciate, and seeing this post on reddit leads me to believe you are not someone who won't give the game the time it requires to be appreciated.  
---
So come, join us, and experience the game that caused a cultural revolution.  
---
Some know a lot about the game, others want to tell people a lot about the game, but your own experiences will be yours, and you will have stories to tell as well by the end.
---
You dont have to respond to the post. 
---
I only over clocked to one of the motherboard prebuilt. 4.4ghz I think
---
Thanks for the response! 
---
RTX? You’re gonna ray trace the shit out of classic haha
---
Upvoted because platinum wow deserves all the exposition he can get. His dungeon dive videos have the best intros.
---
Sure... when they can get passed the trash.
---
2 for warrior right off the bat lol. 3 of my group are already playing war and one of them wants to be our MT so I was trying to hit another role than tank. A priest could work. 
---
I like how he gouges, pops evasion and then 1shots the guy.
---
Pro rogue play.
---
Lol
---
I was “BluntDeath”. I was a shitty UD rogue XD
---
Lol!
---
This guy
---
Or how the blink icon for mages is a dwarf.  
---
Don't know why you are downvoted.  The meme checks out.
---
lolz
---
Speaking of leveling I remember back when I was a kid people always used to say "gratz" or "grtz" when you lvld all the time while doing dungeons. Most the time I see anyone talk anymore while dungeoning is "this so and so sucks, kick him" very few worthwhile conversations.

&gt; I can't wait to be able to take a trip back into the game that I first started playing just over half my life ago!
---
Please. For the love of Azeroth. For my own mental health. Don't phrase it like that again.
---
Can't wait to see you back in the world.
---
He 2 shot him and if he hadn't evasioned the other rogue might've gouged him and killed him in a stunlock.
---
I7-6700k. 1660, 8gigs of ram, and the shittiest 720p monitor I've ever seen
---
Mace rogue was fun pre DR. I dunno what it's gonna be like in classic. I'll probably stick to a prep build as I ended up liking it so much more.
---
Without being specific enough, one could think to themselves, "Oh, I'll be a mage! That way, I can create food/water for people, create portals for people between cities, AoE clear instances for lowbies, buff passersby with Arcane Intellect..."
---
If a shadow priest has a group that is willing to take them 100%.  Otherwise, groups are looking for healers.  Any pug will need the priest to heal, or eventually the healer will leave, and the shadow will either have to heal or the group will disband waiting for another healer.
---
I'm not saying it can't be done.  Just that life will be difficult without having a carry group.  Not because of the damage.  I don't think many cared about that too much at the time, but because of the base amount of healers needed vs the amount of groups being formed.
---
Prot pally tanking, in endgame, is a horribly expensive endeavor and one that STILL underperforms despite the MASSIVE amount of farming you have to do to make it even remotely possible. You will need to farm the mats or money to buy ALL the mana pots. Literally all of them since you have to chain chug them to maintain your TPS. Itemization, particularly pre raid, is a bad joke for prot pallys. I cant recall if there are non set + def tanking pieces that drop in MC, I know there are in BWL, but your T1 set isnt designed for tanking leaving you potentially few upgrades even in early raiding. The lack of a taunt is a problem since people will have to watch their aggro. You can always bubble them but you can only do that once every 5 minutes
---
With that said, prot pally leveling and farming is pretty amazing. Dungeon running can be tricky but doable. It helps to have a mage since you will be drinking alot. I dont like to discourage people but prot pally is easily one of the most broken specs in Vanilla and isnt really viable until TBC. Sadly, pallys have 2 of the worst specs in Vanilla for PvE. PvP, on the other hand, they.have some specs that are an absolute blast to play. Shockadin anyone, lol
---
By chain chug I mean drink one every time it's off the 2 minute cooldown
---
Yeah, definitely no chance I upgrade mine or my girlfriends PCs anytime soon since all we will be playing is classic for years.
---
Shit you right.
---
BANG BANG
---
Thanks!
---
Both restos :)
---
Darkshore.
---
I spent so much time in that zone just because my internet was bad at the time, and the lack of players gave me decent fps on the poor PC I had in the beginning.
---
Scenery was great though, and the quests were stunningly varied.
---
Take legion as a base, but the shortened view distance in classic will definitely help with frame rate.
---
I mean at 2:52.
---
He kills a rogue, then gouges a second rogue....pops evasion, then kills that 2nd rogue before he can even do anything.
---
A Loot Council is good on paper, but the reality of the situation is that the people behind the Council are obviously Human (Some Trolls too though) and I have yet to see a Council that did not end up straying and going bonkers somewhere down the road.
---
Out of the 12 Guilds that I was in, about 9 used a LC and there was -always- an issue of favoritism down the road.
---
Since then I made it a rule to never get into another LC Guild and the same remains for Classic, if that means that I don't get to raid then so be it.
---
That threadripper could run 16 1.12 clients by itself!
---
&gt;WotF is very situational for PvP priests.
---
For a PvP healer its absolutely not situational... In vanilla a priest primarily ended up as a hybrid pvp tank if played right making WotF very much not situational especially against organized group play with chain cc call outs / coordination.
---
They're nice to have for that. They just have to be knowledgeable about their class, farm for their pots and elixirs and execute their rotation well. I realize this sounds obvious but shadow priest has a higher skill ceiling than other dps and their rotation is tricky due to the cooldowns on their abilities and debuffs. Most people are unwilling to put in the effort to understand the spec and/or be ready with their pots and elixirs. When this happens, they're trash tier dps
---
&gt; They say that we are selfish for potentially wasting people's time if we do not bring adequate dps to the raid
---
Don't try to get into guilds that want to play optimally and no one will fucking care what or how you play.
---
But if you expect people to carry your ass, then yes, you are being selfish.
---
Bahahahahaha it’s a special snowflake everyone!
---
As others have said, off tanking is extremely valuable, and just as important in the long run.  It also gives you the opportunity to main tank if the primary is busy.  There isn't too much of a reason to throw away the goal by rolling another class.
---
Also pug ubrs runs will always be looking for a tank.  If you aren't doing a raid there will always be a place at the front for anyone with experience.
---
I'm curious, what are the two different purposes?
---
Yeah, he kills him in two globals. If the other rogue had gouged him in that time he might've died instead of the other guy.
---
OPs post history proves they’re just trolling. 
---
It’s been said before and said better by others but if they ever put in transmog into Classic, so help me god...
---
False, SOME people would rather play. Not all, not most, SOME
---
[Shadow Priests be like](https://imgur.com/mEWCPEG)
---
And you can’t taunt bosses. So if you dumb dps would let the pally get aggro for literally 3 seconds you won’t be pulling it off
---
As an exclusive alliance player I actually had no idea this route existed.  As I've never had a reason to figure it out.  Always wondered why I rarely saw horde around trying to get into Gnomer.
---
... and hard to get. Because you're also fighting hunters, feral druids, rogues and possible enhancement shamans over the same piece of gear.
---
Also some of the items are just a pain in the ass to aquire, like Hand of Justice and the epic chest piece from BRD arena.
---
But being able to craft one of the best pve head and leggings reasonable quickly is a big plus
---
AQ 40 with the tier 2.5 set is where fury went HAM mode. Even before then it was was pretty solid though, like you said, you needed to farm for gear AND you had to wear a fair amount of leather if my memory serves. I know you needed the Lionheart helm and I swear there were crafted epic legs as well. I'm positive fury could be competitive even in BWL though I havent raidied in there in some time so please take that with a grain of salt
---
And at max 161 days!! [https://days.to/21-september/2019](https://days.to/21-september/2019)

No joke dude, if you’re not hitting 60 the first week why even play?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=2243
---
After seeing the Undead scorch the ground by just walking over it, with a thicc Infernal behind him.
---
Probably the coolest scene in the entire video
---
I voted in case it helps, but it is a little convoluted.  Not terribly, but for the common man not stuck to the latrine (like myself) at the moment, it may not be of interest to them.
---
I've played wow on a Mac laptop since TBC. It's been rough yet beautiful. I use my Mac mostly for work and won't switch to a gaming PC just for classic.
---
It's not optimal but playing in bed/on the couch is hard to beat. Pretty pro at using the trackpad by now too!
---
I'm not dismissing the possibility but when does their gear become good enough to overcome them going oom so quickly? Count me curious because I LOVE being a druid and the lazerbattlechicken is fun to play
---
Yeah but did you see notice his *'I came'* face towards the end when he is conjuring up his Frostbolt?
---
I mained a spriest in vanilla. I was in a very active raid guild and.progressed right along with them. I was never top dmg. I would say I was middle. But I remember vampyric embrace healing my group and would consistently beat out pure healers for total amount healed.  That being said, iplaued it because I loved pvp and spriest was amazing. Not being able to mount was annoying though...
---
Horrifically wrong? OP was trying to make a point about the patchwork of different armor sets that made people look unique pre-tmog or pre-heirloom.
---
At what point did pointing out an aspect you don't like of a game become shitting on it?
---
You sound unreasonably angry.
---
&gt; Blackrock Mountain was always dangerous to hang around too long in. You go in as a group and hit your instance portal, you don't hang around.
---
This.
---
The actual feeling of danger in that area is almost uncanny. Your word of describing it is so accurate. **You don't hang around**
---
Darkmoon Faire was the 4th week - so you’re correct it was a 4 week cycle 
---
As much as I piss and moan about huntards one of my best friends was a hunter and it saddened me to watch him steadily fall on the meters as we progressed. He became obsessive about info that could stem that tide but there really wasnt any way back in Vanilla. 
---
With that said, we used to WRECK shit in PvP with our hunter/druid combo of doom
---
grab your pitchforks at /r/pitchforkemporium. I've got mine! ------E
---
Wtf they had cans?!?!! I still have two unopened Mtn Dew bottles from the campaign they did back then but I didn’t know they had cans! Super cool man. 
---
Do you know 40 friends who will all be geared and available/ready at raid time?
---
All of my vanilla raiding I’ve never been in a guild that didn’t need about 10-15 pugs every run we did, yes I was never in a hardcore guild but 40 people is a lot. And after 30 minutes of spamming chat, you start lowering expectations of gear and consumables because your core raiders or other pug members start getting bored and leaving.
---
So no, unless top % guild it will be hard because you will never have an ideal raid comp, in skill or in gear. This won’t be private server players, you’ll see people who are brand new or haven’t played in years.,,and mid fight go “shit wife aggro” or “baby crying gtg” and wipe. Watch.
---
Kinda weird that a system of only a set look is unique over being able to combine different armors and create your own unique look.
---
Not really
---
Horde guild that I was in (private server) had a Google Sheet that listed every single drop from every boss, along with a note on which classes would get that loot first. I think that's the best way to do it given how few items drop.
---
It wasn't perfect. For example, Shaman weren't able to get Claw of Chromaggus - they couldn't get a caster weapon from BWL until Lok'amir. But overall I think it was the most fair system because you know up front which items you could get. If you didn't like it, then you could leave the guild. There was no chance that you were going to put in 3 months of time with a guild, then watch the raid leader give your best in slot item to a Hunter.
---
🤔 you’re on to something here 
---
It's not impossible, I don't think.
---
People in the #nochanges crowd who aren't willing to accept stuff like this really need to reevaluate what it is they want. I think it's way more accurate to call the more reasonable members of this crowd the "Blizzard Did More Harm Than Good With Each Subsequent Expansion" crowd. 
---
I wouldn't mind them making changes to expand the game while understanding what they did wrong, and moving to a more Everquestian model for "expansions." Where there is basically no power jump, level caps don't necessarily go up each "expansion" but there's maybe like Blood Elves and Draeni (with Paladin/Shaman) instead. Everquest expansions were annual though, WoW is biennial. It's really hard to translate the two.
---
I don't honestly think there is much room for #nochanges to argue with WoW developers taking baby steps for baby WoW. Just give new 40 man raids, small tune ups to balance for PvP and PvE and maybe a quality of life thing every now and again to keep it interesting.
---
I can't speak entirely for anyone but myself, I quit in TBC was before it was cool. I'd imagine peoples experiences are similar to mine, and got turned off by this incessant need to make a new game built on top of an old one every 2 years.
---
Oh fuck I'm asking for DLC instead of expansions, aren't I?
---
with only 16 debuff slots a shadow priest cant use all of their abilities. SWP, vamp embrace, mindflay...
---
I can't tell if resists are "bonkers" because I can't compare the number of partial resists and full resists from a reliable data set from the maker of this video to a vanilla data set.
---
Yea, osrs is a sandbox and wow is a theme park.  Therefore osrs should suffer less from having no new content, and yet it did.
---
Too be fair, Battle for Azeroth uses an upgraded version of the vanilla engine.
---
And if I'm going to be more accurate, it's using the engine version from the Legion expansion.
---
I find multinational guild runs to be hilarious at times. Rage breaks all language barriers
---
Wanna take another run at that sentence, champ?
---
Word salad followed by an opinion
---
What's that got to do with FPS?
---
I remember having both of them when these came out. I was visiting family in New York at the time for summer break and I kept 2 to bring back home. At the airport, we were told that I couldn't bring these canned drinks onto the plane. I chose to just chug the Horde one and toss the Alliance one. Funny thing is I was all for Alliance at the time, it just tasted better to me. Like licorice. 
---
No. Character boosts or nothing. Might as well go big or go home.
---
OSRS was made because a combat update changed the game so significantly it made a giant uproar, so they released OSRS with the intention to keep the angry people around, and made it very clear they will be doing player voting for updates from the get go... And started sneaking in content very quickly imo
---
Classic is intended to be a time capsule, a huge amount of people want it to never change, and even though this may open blizzards eyes into how successful progression servers would be, it shouldn't change and even advocating for it to get a little bit of content is exactly how we have current wow 
---
Are you referring to questions (and their respective answers) in the Filters section, or in the Results section? Or both?
---
I have a pretty good idea of how to do that! I should be able to add that either in a couple hours or tomorrow evening.
---
Also, on an unrelated note: all 18.7k responses should be available tomorrow evening to explore instead of just the 10.2k currently! 👏
---
Can’t the argument also be made that +Daggers skill is much more available, and will offset the +5 Swords to a limited degree?
---
More effort went into this than Tipsout videos.
---
Playing horde on a server rn, can definitely say vanilla brings the faction hatred back.
---
5 days /played as a warrior is definitely optimistic, I'd say 10 days IRL is pretty much a gaurantee if youve got some recent experience with vanilla (knowing the relative power level of you as a warrior vs the mob youre pulling, along with knowing what exactly what to do with certain quests, they might have an object to loot in a sunken ship for example for a quest item but its on a respawn cooldown.. since you didnt know where it was located you then spend a few minutes aimlessly looking for something that isnt there when you couldve spent time grinding mobs in the meantime while it spawns) There are a bunch of little examples like that that will slow the process down. Things you wouldnt think about or know of until actually playing, assuming you do not have recent vanilla experience of course. If you do then day 9 might be doable if you get lucky weapon drops while leveling. 
---
3-4 weeks. 
---
You can definitely run meme specs/bad players through MC and ZG though it will take some time to clear. The problem is Vael the guild killer in BWL WILL take a massive crap on that guild. Attrition was real back in the day and it will be real now. If it takes your guild too long to progress you will see people leave for greener pastures. One of the biggest pressures with 40 man raiding is being able to consistently field a 40 man, or close to, roster of consistent raiders. People are people and while some are going to be happy with whatever may come, some will not. Losing too many people, particularly from your core raid group, WILL shatter and potentially dissolve your guild. Almost happened to mine. We had to buckle down and get serious for Vael. Guess what we had to do? We had to dial back on meme specs, recruit to replace some dead weight and be serious about or potions, buffs and elixirs
---
That sounds VAGUELY familiar, maybe you ganked me in STV and I bubble hearthed at some point hahaha
---
You realise that won't come back though?
---
They made it abudantly clear that there won't be any GMs around, or at least not near as many as there used to be, and certainly not enough for many of these moments.
---
What we knews as "GMs" back in the day, were really Customer Support people, aka. guys sitting in a call center, doing a minimum-wage job for which they received a one-week training. If anything more complicated than "I deleten an item" or "I am stuck in a ditch" happened, they silently alerted 2nd level support.
---
These people are nowadays replaced by largely automated systems (player report functionality), ingame self-service (unstuck me, item-trade) and webservices (report-aplayer website).
---
You gotta either commit to being on top of the meters or being a pvp God... sure there are some specs that you can get away with that can be used in both but you won't be top of the meters and you might be missing something for pvp like cold blood or prep.
---
If you don't have the gold to respec all the time just stay as the spec you will do the most content with and learn to use it in all aspects of the game.
---
I do every warlock with 31 affliction and dark pact/drain tank with a phase shifted imp.
---
Really comes into its own when I’ve got then shadoweave set and full spell compliment. 
---
Can easily multi dot drain tank 5 mobs and then dark pact to 100% mana. 
---
Not as safe as a void spec but it is actually a very effective dungeon and PvP spec pre 60 as you are super tough to kill. 
---
You didnt read the post. Otherwise you'd know that I made the thread to attempt to understand and therefore stop the constant bickering between min maxers and other parties. 
---
Cheers though.
---
Well, that for sure doesn't look like what I'm looking for. Based on everything I've seen here, Druid seems like the best option for me(I refuse to create a Paladin). 
---
A Healer that actually heals and that can survive. Not having ress enrages me but I guess the Battle Ress is alot better on pvp. 
---
Are druids pushed to be flag carriers on BGs or can they assume a healing position?
---
Most people are going to not be playing Ret Pally, Prot Pally etc... these will be a niche. Therefore most will play what is BiS. 
---
Keep on dreaming though!
---
This is possibly the ***most poorly*** contructed poll I have ever seen.
---
Every guild have its first kill of every boss.  
---
That’s more like 20-30% of the player base.
---
You ask them to bring enough consumables so you CAN force it if you fail.   
---
The results (data). No need to make the filters re-arrange-able.
---
The problem is gear doesnt scale as hard on druids as it does for other classes and as such the damage barrier needed to actually kill your opponent before they kill you becomes much harder to overcome. 1
---
Good luck with your 150 dmg crit shadowbolts.
---
(Psst - or you can just find a more casual guild. He uses it like a dirty word but it isn't. A lot of people are going to be coming on that now got kids and a life. They'll be happy if you help them out.)
---
Sorry but no
---
They could always make it similar to ladder or "seasons" in diablo and poe, a few months after naxx is cleared release a new fresh server that will eventually funnel characters into the "permanent" server after content is cleared.  People would literally play classic wow for the next 10 years
---
That reply is so stupid I'm quite stunned.
---
You will not use Starshards on a boss, neither will you Smite. This is about the efficiency of the two spells in when solo. Unless you have something relevant to add to this, GTFO.
---
Alterac Mountains was cool. Barely any quests but it was a cool place to explore, especially when you come across the Dalaran bubble, or fight your way through the ogres to get to that book and discover a fella who sells a recipe for frost oil.
---
As far as actual leveling zones, Searing Gorge was really cool aesthetically.
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once. I LOVE BRD and I jumped at every opportunity to do a full clear of that place. Even when I was on Nostalrius it was the same way and I know it'll be the same here
---
The idea is that you can transmog in Retail WoW to make your gear look so much better than it really does. So you can put together great looking outfits and not have to look like a murder hobo.
---
That and the fact that most are using Heirlooms anyway in most gear slots and not even needing gear earned via leveling.
---
You sort of missed the point of the post I think.
---
Yeah I can see how stuff like that would slow it down considerably. I think I'll do some practicing before the launch
---
Female nelf and humans works fine as a cum dumpster after a exhaustive raid, that's the only reason they may get a spot.
---
You give them all fear ward then gove dwaves something ridiculously niche / minimal as well
---
Because the aspect he's pointing out about the game is wrong?
---
With an outdated, impossible example of Alliance armour from Wrath, an expansion that didn't have transmog, on an Orc.
---
If you think I sound unreasonably angry I think you need to stop looking for excuses to be mad yourself.
---
Yes, that's what Blizzard did. Fear Ward became baseline for all Priests in patch 2.3
---
Considering the time and general skill level, not really, no.
---
Literally against the law.
---
Till the dps pulls off you and you have zero way to get aggro back. 
---
Wow I can't believe you got down voted for saying that. I got the point you were trying to make with the meme. The intricate details are a mute point as far as I'm concerned. Frankly your post has 300+ upvotes so clearly most folks found it pretty solid. 🤙🏻
---
God I'm reading all these replies and getting all misty eyed remembering all the great moments in each...well except for WC. I always got lost in there. BRD is my favorite but as for the rest of my top 5
---
1. BRD
---
2. ST
---
3. SM (any)
---
4. Scholo
---
5. This is where it gets real tough since light Strat, SFK and UBRS all could get this spot depending on how I feel
---
Saying LC is loot council doesnt explain how it works or what a typical raid with LC looks like. I dont have a strong opinion yet although if nobody can explain what an LC raid looks like it's an easy decision. Combative and hostile when I only said he brought no new information, really? Lol. Classic is vanilla made over and my only experience with dkp or LC so it was relevant to the extent that his response was less educational than google. But apparently first hand recount of how LC works isnt going to happen. When you read it as someone not a part of it, it would seem to be a corrupt system I should have said. For me it seems like either the decision on loot is made ahead of time with favoritism or whatever criteria or this council would have to have a really quick debate to dolle out loot to not slow the raid down. So having never experienced it, I hoped someone would say our council has x number of people, majority rules and each person that wants the item gets x time to plea their case. Give me actual information on how it looks in practice instead of avoiding showing they dont know but have to pretend like they do. Like apparently everyone cleared naxx in vanilla.
---
so like level 25 
---
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. 
---
GREAT story!! Brilliant writing good sir. 
---
The argument for min-maxing is better than that. In Vanilla the overwhelming majority of players did not clear a single raid or own an epic item or even hit lvl 60. The players that have first hand experience at overcomming the difficulties of the game are all min-maxing very much. Talents, gear, preparation and tactical skill/knowledge.
---
Here is how i see it. You can clear all content with 30-39 players but you can't clear MC with 40 low effort non min-maxing players. Hell Onyxia can be cleared 5man but it takes an hour. 
---
Picking your class and race based on end game content performance is taking it further than i want to go but it does not make it any less true. 
---
Dwarf priest ---&gt; raid progress ---&gt; loot and content. If you are wiping due to fear or lack of heals. It is a shortcut through early raid content.
---
Healer &gt; tank/dps/pvp spec. If your raid can't get enough healers. 
---
High dps &gt; low dps. If raid dps is holding back the whole raids progression. This happens alot! It is much much easier for everyone if dps output is high. 
---
Fair points. Both the videos and logs you reference can be used for interested parties looking up dps in my opinion.
---
The fact you are still arguing about Spriest dps requiring 15-20 iterations of 5+ minutes of dps is entirely asinine. You are arguing mindblast which can not be more than 10% of the damage to be a statistical anomaly in these cases. That is the only crit'able ability. What else is throwing off this meter for this video?
---
I agree with you more than not, but your wager on this specific case mandating such a longer dps testing... entirely unnecessary. 
---
Saved
---
Walk with the Earth Mother!
---
Dammit, you just made me spit out my beer. Here, take my upvote
---
Wife wants to roll ally. Not sure what class I'll be yet. In vanilla I was a hunter. Dont really want to be straight dps class this time around. She wants to be a hunter, I'm thinking druid or paladin. But I can't fully decide.
---
Age of Conan. At least half my guild jumped to that, me included. Holy hell was that a dumpster fire
---
However, the argument is not for or against the crunching of numbers. Salad Bakers didn't do a WR Naxx clear by picking whatever class comes along.
---
But the constant bashing on players spec choices, calling players selfish for wanting to Play X,Y or Z is just daft. The game in its entirety is there to be played, and there are some things, that you will never overcome... It doesn't matter how many consumes you farm, Prot Paladin will never have a taunt. 
---
However if someone comes to the forum to ask for advice on how to play X,Y or Z, the community should be constructive and not reply "Don't play that spec." 
---
You talking from a purely guild perspective. If someone is hunting for a PUG, there is no healer &gt; PvP spec bullshit, because they will search for what they want for whatever slot they want to fill - Yes it may take longer, but does it affect anyone but that player? 
---
I don't think so. Unless you look at it for a personally selfish perspective and say "Waaahh kick the ret Paladin, I don't want to take and extra 40 minutes to do a raid" etc
---
Have they said it’s staying classic forever? I see no reason this would be the impression otherwise. EQ has done these servers for over a decade. After a while the next expansion unlocks etc etc. 
---
Pfft never had to worry about this. Was a huntard. They can wear and wield about everything and arent terrible gear dependent. Roll on anything cool looking and it all works out in the end.
---
Terrible advice dont do this I was younger and dumber but I did have a great time.
---
Play them all to 35 then choose then make the rest alchemist then profit.... /s but seriously if your having trouble picking play a few of them until at least 20. If by the first dungeon you aren’t really feeling the clas your probably safe to choose another. 
---
Plus that one stun on use item I forget the name of that comes from a rare mob
---
Gotta push it hard for a secondary 4k screen for movies and tv or video encoding captured gameplay while continuing to play. Though that monitor also has a Roku, Tivo, and 4k bluray player attached... so don't always have to rely on the PC. :)
---
Out of curiosity, what do folks in retail say the WoW killer will be now? There isnt shit for quality MMO's anywhere on the horizon unless you count Amazon's The New World and that's going to be PvP centric survival garbage in a wrapping that I wish would be put on something more PvE focused. I'm a HUGE fan of the setting but the rest of the game sounds like trash
---
There are 16 debuff slots, you have plenty of room for a shadow priest. If they don't want to go oom they need to prioritize mp5. If they want to do a lot of damage in 30 seconds and wand for the rest of the fight they should ignore mp5. 
---
Not your fault!  Can’t slowfall other people in vanilla 
---
There is a lot of speculation on how spell resistances work, but a lot of that comes from tbc or private servers. There was very little understanding of it from before the tbc pre patch. One of the big open questions with private severs and if they were blizz like or not was concern around spell resistance values and implementation.  I wish the ej forums were still up because there was a lot of good raw testing data that was being worked into theory but afaik wasn't confirmed before the game moved on. So a lot of what you'll find now is ok if you're looking for on the run calculations. The main difference from melee is the smaller number of potential outcomes and that it's impossible to push anything off the spell damage table. 
---
This site is decent at explaining it if you scroll down to the hit, crit, spell damage sections. https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-mage-guide/
---
Everything but resistances were well understood and that information should hold up just fine.  Defensive spell resistance is just the inverse of the table. 
---
This is what I was thinking as well. Probably going to get mining engineering on my main.
---
Having matching gear was such a status symbol!
---
Dwarf priest. Enjoy being needed for fear ward. 
---
Would it be so bad if it was an option players could toggle on for themselves and was disabled by default? I think that's the best of both worlds. Everyone wins.
---
We have the same countertops. Also if you drink that you will absolutely take time off of your life.
---
Most people won’t touch naxx, you get to own in PvP if you’re full naxx geared. And that won’t be for quite some time. 
---
Ret was fine. It’ll be fine. You don’t bring ret for their damage. It’s a utility/support class. 
---
Yeah, that's why it will be my second char. :)
---
My method is more late game but farming Burning Steppes was always quite lucrative. Tons of thorium nodes, particularly rich thorium with a large variety of mobs that drop a variety of mats and BoE blues and epics
---
I hated how rep would suddenly stop working at a random point. couldn't get exalted with these hefalumps.
---
Nobody cares about RP.
---
Yep, tons of TV and movies planned. Think I'm starting with Fringe, one of my fav SF series. Then may binge my fav movies list all in order lol. Currently 65 films, but Criterion Channel releases this week, so... I might have 2 dozen more by time classic releases.
---
https://letterboxd.com/quietvermonter/list/my-world-of-cinema-favorite-films/
---
&gt; I don't think in 2019 that this will affect the clearing or dungeons and raids that much. 
---
People can clear MC in 30 min and hit lvl 60 in 3 days all because of min/maxing.
---
It absolutely does affect every aspect of the game.
---
And people are still figuring out new ways to do things even faster.
---
 &gt; Does this mean that not rolling Alliance is gimping yourself? 
---
You're stretching you arguments a little to thin
---
&gt; The argument that, someone else's gameplay is affected by this class/race choice is ludicrous also! 
---
It is though... If noone has FW in the raid, that puts even more pressure on the tanks
---
But that's more of a fault of Guild/Raid leader for not addressing that.
---
That's why many guilds try to recruit dwarfs over other races
---
&gt; One of the biggest arguments FOR Min-Maxing is "You are slowing down other people's progression by playing that"
---
You cannot slow down anyone's progression if you're not in a guild that cares about progression...
---
&gt; how much longer does having a Night Elf priest make a raid? Does it make it so much longer, that the time afforded to finding a PUG Dwarf Priest is going to be made up within that specific raid? No, I highly doubt it.
---
That depends whether or not the raid can deal with fear mechanics without fearward. And if we're talking about your average PUG, then they most likely cant.
---
I think I'd rather spend a few more minutes looking for a dwarf than wipe a bunch of times on Ony...
---
&gt; where people will ask serious questions about their non-prefect class/race choice that become overshadowed by this toxic argument
---
And they get serious answers, just because you don't like them, doesn't make them toxic.
---
&gt; If you are a Min-Max player, the chances of you being affected by a Ret Paladin, Prot Paladin, Shadow Priest etc is slim to none
---
That's kind of the whole point of having different types of guilds though, is it not? 
---
If you enjoy trying to be the best you can be, there are hardcore guilds for that.
---
If you just wanna relax and see how far you can get with your ret, boomkin or w/e, you've got casual guilds for that as well.
---
&gt; accept however that you are a niche and one that is likely not welcomed in every aspect of the game
---
Everyone is welcome and encouraged to try every aspect of the game!
---
The only thing you have to accept is that different groups of people will have different requirements to join their group.
---
If you want to play ret, you can still  do raids, you just won't be able to do it with the group that clear them in under an hour.
---
Parting of being a truly great player is knowing what items to make use of to better your chances in any given situation.
---

---
What about South Park's WoW episode on loop? ;)
---
Lol, I mean if it sounds fun to you go for it. It just seems like a lot of tedious running around to me. Especially the staff is all the way in darkshore and would be replaced after one run of deadmines. Idk I don't think me thinking that putting together a bis deadmines set is a bit unnecessary makes me some kind of rushing elitist though
---
Well said.
---
If you do let me know how your /played is, a few quick tips would be to try and keep your weapon updated every 5 levels or so if possible. Blue weapons are worth the gold investment so long as you have enough for abilities. Only buy the most important abilities to save as much gold for weapon upgrades and mount purchase. Only level up first aid, bandages are pretty useful as they can practically fully heal yourself in just 8 seconds. So be sure to grind some cloth mobs to keep a bunch of bandages on you at all times. Dont try to kill high level mobs or do high level quests that a quest guide says to because that usually means they made that guide for a hunter , warlock , mage or druid etc that are capable of completing high level quests and mobs. As a warrior your resource is based on how much damage you output and against high level targets you will get glancing blow penalties a lot which will reduce your dps by a lot in addition to getting less rage for even less damage output. You will often die trying to do higher level quests as a warrior as well in comparison to other classes. So try to grind (more often than other classes) in order to be on equal playing field as other classes. Id suggest killing mobs either the same level as you or a couple levels below. However, if you plan on duo leveling then your options are a lot different. You can actually jump ahead and do higher level quests earlier (only do this if the quest has a good weapon reward such as getting this https://classicdb.ch/?item=1566 quest weapon at an earlier level with a duo, if youre with a non healer then be sure to kite with hamstring if you need to, if youre with a healer then it should be a breeze doing basically any quests compared to a warrior as solo). Sure a duo partner will split kill xp in half but youve got the potential to kill twice as much to even it out. Plus, completing quests always gives full xp and in a duo youre able to complete most quests twice as fast than you normally would. Id suggest going arms for sure as that opens up strong cleaving potential which is more useful in duo especially with a healer. Cleave / sweeping strikes / whirlwind mobs down and try to chain pull as much as you can
---
Yeah that's why people developed the shadowweaving/healing spec
---
A stamina/int stacked spriest at 49 was my favorite. Over 3500 hp self buffed. Only class that could beat me in a duel was a BiS enhance shaman 
---
Thanks for this! I'll give it a try one of these days, when I get a free couple of hours.
---
Im moment haben wir nur 3 priester
---
Enh shaman stat priority do be like that
---
Never have to deal with this on Hello Kitty island Adventure!
---
For me it was 2 people my brother in law and a guy who went by Qoon. My brother in law helped me learn to think outside of the box when I’m playing. Qoon was a 19 and 49 twink who was insane at min-maxing and raw skill. On top of that he was also one of the best PvPers I’ve ever seen and he played using 4 buttons with /cast sequences on them. 
---
What, you actually use the trackpad? Plus you are pro at it? You probably play mage because obviously you must be a wizard. :D
---
I‘ll play on my iMac. Can‘t take it to bed or on the couch with me though :/
---
Everyone and their nan gonna be on classic something for everyone. It's long as hell just pick a class you'll enjoy longterm. You cant change race or class. So if you pick a priest thinking one day you'll switch to armor and tank it dont work that way. For that I'd recommend class fantasy&gt;what others say. For example think do you wanna be a wizard or a melee fighter and go from there. When I started back in vanilla I picked hunter because being an archer was what I thought was cooler than anything else. Let your imagination run wild and ask is there a class that does &lt;insert whatever&gt; and the answer is probably yes.
---
You have the lifetime of the server to level to 60. That's at least 100 years.
---
&gt;No, this post is messed up. Where are you trying to get at ? Who is mad at who?  
---
You at people having discussions about the game?  What?
---
And now we know that tier pieces usually are pretty crap, so it's the clowns at 60 you have to worry about. 
---
Until T3 at least.
---
Nice save attempt but every single comment, reply and the original post is about how dwarf is considered the must be race for raiding.  It's why this comment you replied to was written hence the term "melee coverage" being used.  No one ever spoke about solo once.
---
I appreciate your attempt though &lt;3 I wish you luck in your future endeavors adventurer.
---
Why wouldn't you both want to be the same race? Just speeds up being near each other for that sick party xp
---
Really?!? Pallys, especially ret pallys, are usually a dime a dozen
---
Same here, OP. I'm just going to bite the bullet and play on a NA server. 
---
&gt; EDIT: Oh wait.. as long as classic doesn't have a different leash for him.. Oh I hope not!!
---
And as long as the pathfinding works like that.
---
If I'm in a guild that wipes on Vael for 3 weeks straight I'm out. BWL will be released 6 months? after launch which is plenty of time to gear up appropriately for that encounter. 
---
I'm not here to fix your guild. I'm here to contribute top damage, have some fun, get some sik purpz, and kill some nubs in BGs.
---
(Basically I agree)
---
Probably star wars galaxies. But it could be somethin else.
---
It’s not a bad point regarding raids because that is the context we’re discussing in this post. In addition you can disagree with someone without being a dick about it! 
---
I don't think Cata made casuals and hardcore look alike. It was pretty much only Dragon Soul and that entire patch was just a huge clusterfuck. It was really the BadgePlz patch of Wrath that gave tier items for running super easy 5-mans and the huge nerfs to LFR that came mid-MoP and especially WoD where they became complete facerolls. During late Cata and early MoP they were still not easy, a fair amount of LFRs went up in smoke after the first boss or so. 
---
Fury is very viable even premc.  It is expensive, because many of the items are boe (lionheart, stronghold gauntlets, etc) but especially with world buffs warriors are the highest dps by far until aq40.
---
Well you can get T3 in Classic, what's the problem? 
---
"Unfortunately Starshards isn't a good spell. It's better to spam smite and then wand if mana is an issue."
---
Please tell me when that is relevant in a raid, because that is what I replied to.
---
Yup but I'm also getting back into PC gaming for the first time in 12 years so I want to be able to check out this PubG stuff too, and Apex Legends is fun on PS4 so it's probably cooler on PC once I'm not a baboon with a mouse, so why not drop 2k$ on a setup?
---
I'm an adult now. When I buy a toy, it's *a badass motherfuckin toy*.
---
Warrior tank though that slides a bit for raiding due to needing only a tank and OT for the grand majority of fights and any class that has a healing spec by FAR. You will never want as a healer ever. As a warrior tank you will have insta queues for dungeons from the first dungeon all the way to 60 and that's a fact
---
I have only ever played vanilla. If all that weird shit you said is actually what goes on in wow today, what the fuck. 
---
The one sided drake talon always fucked with my OCD, just feels so wrong to me.
---
If you're someone who really wants to top the meters in classic, you can pick and choose among the top performing classes.
---
Buit it's okay if your preferred spec isn't a top performer. Lots of guilds will bring you to raids.
---
Why not both
---
imo anything that involves selling things on AH is not going to make a lot of money on a fresh server.
---
Noone has any money to spend, so most of the stuff will have to be sold way below it's actual value. Plus the the AH cut will eat a big chuck of already small profits.
---
It's a great time to buy and stockpile though... if you have the money...
---
Farming mobs that drop high value junk can be good if you can find a quiet spot.
---
Certain classes can also solo farm dungeons to vendor all the blue gear you get from bosses.
---
Enchanting is only profitable if you are one of the first people with bis endgame enchants. If you won't be that guy it's a money sink.
---
Early wands will definitely be huge. Skinning is best bang for your buck, mining and selling unsmelted silver nets a good amount as well. I like to get quest items required to be bought off ah, then go stand by quest givers and double the price I paid advertising in general chat, convenience fee for instant exp. 
---
Also keep in mind that T2 is mainly a PvP set in Classic. Depending on whether they do patch progressive updates on the gear, you'll mostly have the PvPers going for T2. On the top of my head I don't think any piece is BiS for healing after the 1.9 spellpower update. 
---
Oh and the set is also decent for tanking 5-mans since it has a lot of stats, armour and spellpower.
---
Drain tanking is doable, just weaker. While you're leveling you can juggle 3+ targets fairly easily.
---
Again, you are looking way too much into this. The guy was using broad strokes to make a broad point. He wasn't making comment on this specific armor set being a problem. Just that everyones appearance tends to homogenize when you're able to customize gear appearance without consequence to the stats
---
What you are talking about is an asshole they are everywhere and they are not the same as a min-maxer. 
---
What should i tell 10 young aspiring enhancement shamans? Don't worry about finding a raid spot? No, it is better just to give them the truth. 
---
All guilds be like; "When are you going to respec resto?"
---
It breaks my heart too, because i love the hybrid classes but they are not that good in end game raiding. Sorry.
---
For most players it will not be a question of 40min longer clear times. It will be about clearing anything at all. Atleast for the first long while in a servers life span.
---
Maybe i will tell the enhancement shamans, you can always PUG later down the road if you like. 
---
&gt; That's not what Classic is about, and that saddens me
---
And who gets to decide what classic is about? 
---
I would like to be on that committee
---
&gt;Give me specifics, give me examples. 
---
You are so entitled.
---
Imagine if you had spent 5 seconds googling what LC is. But no. Instead you barge in here, instantly claiming corruption in a system you didn't bother reading up on. Then you DEMAND that we educate you. You spend more time complaining about random shit than you do educating yourself.
---
It's bad enough that you expect to be treated as a 100% attendance raider when you are *"inconsistently available"*. You seem lazy, ignorant, entitled and quick to anger. GL finding a guild with those personality traits.
---
You have three options:
---
* Join a guild with higher commitment to raiding than you. Because you contribute less than the average member, expect to low priority on loot because you are *"inconsistently available"*.
---
* Join a guild at the same level of commitment as you. Since you contribute as much as the average member, expect average priority on loot.
---
* Pug runs and hope to get lucky.
---
You do you, man.  You don't need anyone's approval to play what you wanna play.
---
That being said.. That video isn't the best argument in the world for prot paladin main tank.  He's fairly reliant on fear wards in this video and when he didn't have it up people died.  
---
It seems to be all classic gear, random leather and mail greens along with Herod's shoulder.
---
But that staff confuses me, I can't recall seeing that recolor of Staff of Jordan.
---
Let's add flying mounts while we're at it!
---
Karma guide for classicwow:
---
1) Find a difference between retail and Vanilla. (Doesn't matter if it's good or bad)
---
2) Post that difference (Doesn't matter if it's accurate)
---
3) ???
---
4) Karma
---
There is also a talent in the disc tree that gives you 15% of your mana regen continue while casting. The 3-set T2 set bonus gives you another 15% so roughly a third of your spirit-based regen continues while casting. Therefore spirit is usually assigned to priests and druids (who have the same kind of talents/set bonus) and mp5 is given to paladins and shamans who don't have any regen at all while casting. Doesn't mean mp5 is bad for priests, it's just more worth for paladins and shammies. 
---
Unless you manaburn... 
---
Agreed, I don’t understand why people think they should be rewarded for doing things by themselves. If you want to rank you’re going to have to be smart about it, and that means joining a team. 
---
Seriously lol. I’ve only played up to cata and played a couple hours of WoD and even then, current BFA is a whole different world that I dont even wanna touch
---
I had just gotten my resurrection spell as a paladin and I convinced a group of 60s to take me on an Undercity raid because I promised to revive them.
---
Don't remember how well I fared, but it rocked my world
---
Ok but Orc stun resist
---
I didn't realize you only read his first sentence then keyboard spazzed like you do in most of your reply history. My bad man.  Sorry about your karma.
---
You do have binds letter keys, right?
---
Increasing the cooldown past 30s would probably help. It's amazing actually, just how long blizzard left fear ward in the game in that incredibly overpowered state.
---
What I replied to. In what raid scenario is that relevant?
---
It's not vanilla if it's not on a 4:3 display
---
This video was my exact first thought lol. Don't drink it op, it's time has passed.
---
This is the real answer. Everything has its place, I played an unhealthy amount raiding top end and PvP every chance I could. Rank 8 gear was still useful for a time. Had I been able to get to rank 8 easier I would find it hard to raid. 
---
Vanilla WoW was extremely incomplete. I'd be fine with them taking stuff that they completed later and adding it as level 60 content.
---
By this I mean things like adding Kara and Hyjal. I do not mean to change any of the current zones to their cataclysm changes.
---
They also have the option to develop things that can be added to BOTH classic and retail, like a level balanced version of Emerald dream for each.
---
Z,X,C,F,G,T... then shift + numbers.
---
This is what I do, too!
---
This is awesome! Definitely want more in this series.

I really want to go Engineering on my druid since it sounds like a lot of fun. I was thinking of going Mining with it but then I read that Druids are rather good at herb farming due to stealth etc. Is it viable to go Herbalism and Engineering and just sell the herbs and buy the needed ingredients for the Engineering recipes? Or is Mining a must have with Engineering? 
---
Actually I am not. I very clearly stated that my criticism is of the entire series and not just the shadow priest test.  What do you compare that shadow priest dps test to if not his other tests.  Is 500 just an okay number to you? or 700? or 1000? or 50,000? It is completely arbitrary without a frame of reference for which there is nothing reliable to compare to.  If the other tests are more flawed than the shadow priest data just how flawed are you willing to accept as "useful" data.  Shadow priest is the only spec whose dps is so marginally affected by crits.  Other specs not only have crits to deal with but also effects such as improved aspect of the hawk procs, flurry, poisons, nightfall, etc.  Those are not going to have insignificant statistical variation on 240 second fights where up to 30 second burst cool downs and on use trinkets are coming into play.
---
I guess at the end of the day tho what it really comes down to is how useful is the information for YOU.  If low quality information is enough to help you make a decision about what class you want to play or how you want to build your raid comps then power to you.  Anyone in my raid who tries to justify something by pointing to this as a source of "reliable information" will get a swift dose of reality tho.

You people are like the fat pigs on jerry springer. No one gives a shit, you’re not special and your need for attention is obnoxious. 
---
While I understand your point, it's still gear that I have unlocked, so I earned it.  
---
Why shouldn't I look like I wear a T2 set, even if I'm playing BfA?  
---
That's the whole point of the transmog system.
---
Hmm - are you sure you're not looking at parses with shadow damage Lupos (which is what the big private servers have prior to AQ)? It seems very unlikely that this will be the case in Classic, which will definitely hurt Hunter DPS.
---
absolutely stupid post and this discussion really isn't worth continuing, lol.
---
Well its not defias mask,but i remember you can start the Dangerous! quest at level 19 in hillsbrad which gives you a white quality head coloured red.
---
How much effort do you want to invest in this gold making scheme? 
---
Enough for mount at 40 and a good way towards mount at 60? Or something much more?
---
Generally professions will cost you gold for your first 200hours of gameplay. Skinning can give you a some gold but it also costs some time. Skinning in effect makes you kill stuff 10-15% slower. 
---
An hour spent grinding at lvl 60 gives way more gold than anything you do low level. Especially early on in the server lifespan. So getting to lvl 60 ASAP is your best gold making strategy.
---
If you are looking to play the AH mini game you should get some addons like Auctioneer to help you out.
---
&gt; Frankly your post has 300+ upvotes so clearly most folks found it pretty solid.
---
TIL 0.6% appraisal is "solid"...
---
Same here. But my family was into EQ and the Realm. So I didnt get to play classic until about halfway into vanilla when I finally convinced my dad to buy it. 
---
Heck anything blizz put out back then was hype. 
---
I also keep some gear over better gear cause the new gear looks crap. Sleeveless robe on my warlock for +4sta +4int? No thank you.
---
And still no examples just avoiding the questions and jumping to other personal attacks. You dont "barge in" to an open forum for questions. You dont "DEMAND" to be educated in a thread for questions. Conversation over you are clearly incompetent.
---
I don't think you understand why we all want classic wow back.  I think you might be better off playing retail.  You can go run through all the raids still
---
\^ This. Oceanic realms from Japan is probably the best bet.  
---
NA and EU will likely be much worse latency
---
I'll be really excited to see if there are any major shifts from 10k to 18k.
---
Wouldn't the fact that someone is consistently playing for 20 hours or more a day be a pretty obvious metric to ban someone? 
---
I’ll be sure to let you know my /played time. My duo party will be a paladin so it’ll help out a lot. I def plan on going arms for the cleave potential. I’m trying to decide when my buddy and I should start duo leveling (as in what level). 
---
Thanks for the info dump, I appreciate it!
---
speedrun to 60 and farm dem black lotuses, sell them to the top raiding guilds for 150 g a pop when they start making flasks.
---
Don't. Trust me. 
---
Okay, thanks. I wasn't sure if that was what the reason was.  While leveling, I never had trouble finding groups as a shadow priest healing though.
---
Did Blizzard ever say that they wanted it to be a time capsule, though?
---
They are making Classic for the same reason that Jagex made OSRS: to get the players who left because Blizzard fucked up their game back.
---
I see this "oh but slippery slope" argument numerous times, but there is no logic to back up this argument. People say "eventually they'll end up adding the Dungeon Finder to Classic and they'll turn everything into BFA!" But they're not idiots. The Classic team knows what they're doing, and they are passionate enough about this game to go out of their way to recreate certain things such as spell batching, even when not many people expected them to, in order to make this as authentic as possible to Classic. They wouldn't decide to stray from what made Classic unique, and if they were to make new content, they would stick to what people love about Classic. Who wouldn't want even more of a game they want?
---
Hell, I would argue this whole slippery slope argument applies even more to the possibility of TBC servers than it would to 1.13. That expansion added controversial systems, overhauls to existing Vanilla systems, and lore that was enough to make many Vanilla veterans quit the game. Is it really a good idea to repel those people away from Classic by adding servers that divide the population?
---
Wasn't it done in ToC patch (i.e. 3.2)? It's been a  while so I might be wrong. 
---
Warlock. They're cool and there's probably going to be at least eleventybillion rogues. Plus they got sweet tiersets.
---
That’s BC tho?
---
Took near a month iirc.
---
Murder over ruthlessness in pvp and 1 point in imp cnd? What in the actual fuck is this?
---
Very useful trick I learned probably on reddit, flip a coin on if you're going to do something - like roll a shadow priest even though you don't get shadow form until 60. If the coin flip makes you happy/remorseful you know what you actually wanted
---
&gt; It was really the BadgePlz patch of Wrath that gave tier items for running super easy 5-mans
---
I started raiding hard core in WotLK, and this statement of your is only partially right.  
---
Sure, you got badges through 5-men, but there was a limit to how many you could get.  
---
Plus, it took long time to get the current tier pieces, and the best way was to get them through... Current tier raiding, surprisingly.  
---
5-men heroics were "easy" if you were well geared, moreover, with some giving issues also with mid-high dungeon gear (the Black Knight in ToC, the ICC5 dungeons, as examples), and you can't in general forget that gear has never been a "guaranteed" in WoW at any time (Light be damned, I've been the joke of my friends in the past 11 years, I'm always behind with loot!)  
---
So, yeah, you could get raid tier with badges, but it wasn't as easy as it is with LFR today, and I say it as someone who doesn't hate LFR, nor retail in general.  
---
In my opinion, the main issue with LFR would be solved if it awarded heroic dungeon ilvl gear, if not even normal dungeon ilvl.  
---
I'm perfectly fine with a "story mode" raid, so that I can see how the story unfolds without having to dedicate time I don't have anymore, I'm not fine with such story mode giving me high level gear, and I'm pretty sure most people who do LFR just to see the story don't mind the loot.
---
&gt; If everyone who's playing has this epic looking armor, nobody stands out.
---
If everyone who's playing WoW has this epic looking armor, it's because they obtained it.
---
You mean leveling in retail vs being max level in Vanilla?
---
I'm playing Factorio until Classic launches. It's fantastic.
---
Devilsaur leather.
---
PvP was the goal ;)
---
Why would you even want to pvp without prep is beyound me. Especially since its pre nerf state in Vanilla.
---
No, if they put a toggle into the game I will not play classic. 
---
Ok fine. Just to uncover how many basics we need to cover so you don't get left behind.
---
* Do you understand the core principle of a Loot Council with officers distributing loot for the best of the guild?
---
* Do you understand how loot is distributed on parameters such as performance and attendance?
---
* Do you think it's unfair you get less loot when you are less valuable for the guild, because you are *"inconsistently available"?*
---
* Do you understand how you would ALSO get less loot in a DKP system because you are *"inconsistently available"?* You realise that when you aren't there, you don't get DKP?
---
4 pretty simple yes/no answers. Once you have answered them we can see where your understanding is lacking and we can help you move forward.
---
Except, armors in D&amp;D are never the hodgepodge you wear while leveling up in a MMORPG.  
---
All editions of the P&amp;P game have one, maybe two depictions of the same type of armor, with later editions (3rd and onward) offering more cartoonish, impractical designs, but still sticking to "full body" armor.  
---
It's only with the *Complete Fighter's Handbook* from AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, and the *Dark Sun* setting from the same edition, that we get the concept of "piecemeal armor", where you can combine plate chest, mail legs, leather arms and a cloth cap.  
---
Otherwise, it's always a "suit of armor".
---
Can you name the item or the quest pls?
---
Doubt it JB hi Fi here in South Australia has a couple of those boxes for last couple of years 
---
It has everything from vanilla to wotlk, that’s just the box art. But it’s a new release apparently
---
Wrong.
---
Thanks for sharing! Wonderful story - For the Forsaken! Lok'tar Ogar!
---
I have only a few letters bound, like T for wand or other things like that. I do have a lot of CTRL+1-4 binds as well, which I guess is uncommon, but my thumb tucks nicely under my hand and can hit CTRL very easily, like second nature to me. I mentioned it in the past to a few people and they looked at me sideways and told me I must have a really flexible thumb because they couldn't imagine how uncomfortable that would be.
---
Yeah, no.
---
TBC added many controversial systems and overhauled many Vanilla systems, which made many Vanilla veterans quit the game entirely.
---
TBC was also the first iteration of WoW that actively discarded Warcraft III lore, turning Outland from how it looked in Warcraft III and its planned Vanilla iteration into a scifi mess that looks like they smashed 7 separate planets together into one. It also didn't do either Illidan, Kael'thas and his blood elves, or the Naga any justice whatsoever, being quite a controversial addition to the lore. It also added draenei to the alliance out of nowhere and took the high/blood elves of Quel'thalas who would have been a clear pick for the Alliance and instead assigned them to the Horde, solely so the Horde could have a "pretty race."
---
Q E W should stay as default, I like them that way just as they are :)
---
How can you move efficiently in PVP and press shift + another key ?
---
Release date has to be 28th of July. Mostly because we just got to know our annual summer holidays. I decided to put mine to end of July to August because that's what most people (me included) seem to think launch will be.
---
Just keep the consumables for rank 1 if you want to be able to res anyone.
---
You are totally forgetting to say when you want these things. For the next 2-3 years. Absolute No from me. 
---
5-10 years down the road Blizzard adds Karazhan, well ok. 
---
Not entirely true. OSRS is seeing a power creep slowly but surely. While it’s strength is that the gear is still niche at most points, some of the recent ones are way too powerful for what they do, and they arent even at the highest tier of weapons yet (level 75 reqs as opposed to 99 max). It really can’t be avoided, just needs to be controlled
---
But there’s only like four races to choose from.
---
AH is more than a mini game; it’s a legitimate economy. My ex GF’s Grandpa used to play WoW, but ONLY bought/sold things on the AH.
---
Obviously You're the only person who gives a shit. Good job.
---
It’s the new version of the battle chest
---
Not entirely true. OSRS was made because most of those players did not like the direction rs3 was going in as a whole. Combat was a big part of it but the ease of rs3 and microtransactions were big factors too, amongst others. It didn’t feel like rs anymore, which is what I imagine classic wow players feel about current wow (community part too, which is why OSRS didn’t get the GE till a long time later)
---
Don’t forget OSRS was meant to be a time capsule too for the most part, but when people finished all the content it got real old real quick. 
---
They're really old bundles, nothing to do with Classic.
---
"Its kind of a dick move but you're playing a rogue so you're probably dick anyway"

*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** teach_me_how_to_die! ^(hug)
---
The last time I talked to a GM, they took a moment to fanboy over my Hand of A'dal title. I'm not exactly complaining, but it kind of takes the awe out of the experience of talking to a GM when you've been playing longer than them..
---
Depends on supply and demand and which patch you're on, but you can make good money with Alchemy.
---
You just need to find out which potions are in need now and how many people sell them.
---
And if you're undercutting the competition and someone starts undercutting YOU, it might be a good idea to start selling a different potion.
---
The release date online is listed as  16/10/13 so they've been selling them for 6 years.
---
This doesn't make sense though?
---
With current retail you just need to buy the latest expansion, all previous ones are included in the sub.
---
And they've said Classic only requires a sub, no purchase.
---
Wtf? No dude. Why are you using numbers. What are you, casual? 
---
I moved with ESDF instead of AWSD. (Leaves A and W for hotkeys. I had the entire left side of the keyboard hot keyed up until U, J and N and 1-6. 
---
Also had SHIFT modifier and CONTROL modifier for ALL hotkeys. Yeah, I had like 50 hotkeys memorized. 
---
Get good.
---
It kind of depends on what kind of PvE and PvP you're talking about, but back in retail vanilla I rocked your typical raid dps combat daggers for both. For PvP it's not as good as a build that's *meant* for PvP, but you still get huge burst potential from using daggers. From what I recall, I had to be a lot cheekier in my 1v1s, such as using blind to run away and exit combat in order to re-stealth, instead of just stunlocking someone down. I recall it being not optimal, but doable and fun. Ymmv.
---
Full sets in vanilla looked better then in retail. You just had to get a full set first. 
---
were retri palys good in pvp?
---
were they able to kill healers without any interupt or ms effect?
---
Silence on 6. Talk about wrong buttons! 
---
Been kind of staying out of the loop but its finally gotten to me. I know it's "summer" release but any details on phasing or how "classic" it is?
---
It's nice progressively looking cooler as you level. It makes earning your gear more rewarding. Fuck transmogs
---
1-5,q,e,r,f,g,t,v,z,x,y, plus shift of all those and Ctrl of all those. also tilde for an extra trinket slot, and all mouse extra mouse buttons for controling my pet
---
Was a joke...
---
Totally viable. Herb tends to be a pretty good money maker since every class needs raids consumes which herbs go into making. Conversely, not every player is an engi or will really ever even need ores or arcane crystals. You might "save" yourself some money converting ore you mined into engi goods, but the opportunity cost of not farming herbs instead may be greater.
---
Maybe. In either case it's definitely viable to go herb/engi so do it!
---
You can get shadowform at level 40 though
---
In a truly fresh server gold only enters through quests. Npc kills. And vendored items iirc. Until gold enters the game the ah will be slow gains probably. Vendoring skinned stuff and mining ores while farming npcs is probably the best fresh server money. But idk for sure not ever been on a new server with an unestablished economy.
---
Isn't it profitable to sell the Lesser Wands at start? So I can get mount at 40 faster?
---
So it's wise to stockpile on Elemental Earth/Fire's, and common Herbs like Steelbloom / Fadeleaf etc?
---
Hey man, warlocks cant manage their threat without those debuffs and certainly wont with them. 
---
Have seen so many warlocks wipe us in AQ because ”OmG ThAt ShAdoWbolT criT AgaiN”.
---
Find yourself an old Sony FW900.  Still up to par to the latest LCD screen with the only exception being weight and size.  The only thing that will finally out do it, I think, will be the OLED.  By that I mean the real ones, not the ones advertised as such that are just LED backlit.
---
I liked the horde 'enemy' on my PVE server. I remember saving them from being killed by mobs sometimes!
---
I would've healed them if it was possible.
---
This is so incorrect it’s bizarre, listing a hundred things which are actually in vanilla wow, why do I have to read this junk. Shame I can’t say what I really think because mods will ban
---
People were 5 manning ony for lolz in vanilla. Tanking ony isn't exactly the paragon of achievement in vanilla. I bet a shamana, warlock, melee hunter, or hunter pet could all do it too if you really wanted to.
---
Woahhh spicy
---
What is the "automated mute system" ?
---
Just added it! There is an eye icon in the title of every question in the Filters section that will toggle the display of that question in the Results Section. You may also notice the text at the the top of the Filters Section that will reset all hidden Questions to show.
---
Hi! 
---
So, I'm really looking forward to rolling the original shaman again. 2h spec is missed by a lot of people, including me. Now I'm looking for a horde EU guild that ain't to serious with progress and will do both the pve and pvp aspect of the game. Preferably older people, that like my self, has other obligations (work, family and so on). I'm thinking a guild that will allow enhance dps in dungeons/raids for example. Nothing serious! Pure fun!
---
Anyone know of any planned guild?
---
You can't use heirlooms for a freshly released expansion, and people generally don't transmog their leveling gear since that's a waste of money. I suppose I wasn't even considering alts here. And an orc wearing Alliance exclusive armor is still wrong.
---
And make sure to just play the class/race you think is coolest and don't base it on anything else.
---
Priest.  
---
Easy to level. Sick in low level pvp so people won't bother you if you plan on playing on a pvp server.  You can also heal dungeons to 60 with your leveling talents.  
---
At 60, shadowpriests can still perform really well in pvp with minimal gear.  
---
As far as raiding and dungeons go, you wont have any issues getting in groups as a healer. As shadow, you'll be able to do dungeons, not sure about raiding though.
---
I have some empty feelings about it
---
Troll priest. Always played ud priest, now is the time to try out troll.
---
I do have a feeling that half of my officer team in our pserver will roll priest in classic tho :D
---
Nice video mate 4Head
---
Outside of just saying play what you want I'd probably say like pally or shaman tbh. You'll still get brought to raid groups even if you're pretty casual because of how desired you are and you're pre bis farm isn't too bad because you won't have to fight to the death for stuff like dalrends or true strike shoulders
---
I only remember pats respawning in an instance, not all of the trash
---
Thanks! This is the kind inspiration I need to make more videos.
---
Maraudon was so beautiful! I have a great memory of lanning with two of my buddies and doing mara together
---
UBRS as a 15 man was really so epic feeling. I managed to snag a spot in a group at level 58 and even won the magisters robe. Im happy I managed to experience the 15 man ubrs, 10 man strat, and 10 man scholo before they changed them to 10, 5, 5 a little while after I hit 60. I kinda hope they do bring back the raid versions for a little bit
---
haha and leatherwork for salt shaker.  not a bad money printing setup there
---
At first I was excited! Then I was triggered by the blood elf on the box art. Finally I realized that's exactly what you wanted, and that I walked straight into it!
---
Well played, Sir 
---
Hi, /u/ScholarCC
---
For your questions. Yes, not really, no, and it depends. Not going into dkp but from my experience there were ways to gain and lose it outside of just raiding so it worked out fine for an alternate or B team member like myself. I dont expect loot over a core raider if its like bis or something nuts. However i also would find it unfair if its this guy's alternate spec/role set and he gets the loot over say my wife who would be stoked for the upgrade. I didnt realize loot council was primarily attendance based like your example. I figured size of upgrade and all kinds of things were involved in the decision. Say we're only available 2 nights a week or even every other week or something but its a huge upgrade. Will someone that lives on the game get a miniscule upgrade or would we have a shot at it? How long are the conversations on this and who gets to hear it out? Like is it cloak and dagger or are they upfront about why decisions are made? Does looting go smoothly or is every boss a court session? Like your second question do i understand the parameters is a no. What do most councils base things on and what weight is given to each thing? Will this even matter at the speed we will be raid ready is also probably a big question hell people may be vendoring most things by time our casual butts get there. No idea really dont have experience on that.
---
This is turning into the ballad of Sir Robin.
---
Druid
---
I mean eventually I’ll have a bunch of alts for that but it won’t be till 6mos or a year later. But if classic only cost a sub to play I’ll probbably run a full time auction house account  so when I’m on I won’t miss them deals. 
---
haha, posted it now. 
---
:)
---
Thanks
---
How do you know he's handicapped? It doesn't say he's a mod. 
---
Aw shucks, glad you like my content!
---
Yes.  You should.
---
I'm not even going to explain further.  Just try it and see if you like it.
---
I play alliance. I never really hated horde but they werid me out. I think most of them are edgy teenagers who want to be undead horde or warlock and care more about pvp and making other people's experience less fun. They're the types of people to get horde tattoos and yell LOC TAR OGAR and FOR THE HORDEEE In a really cringy way. Like they're real life outcasts so picking the "bad guys" made them feel more rebellious.
---
To me horde players just seem sort of autistic and edgy. The type of people to hit you in the back or the head and when you turn around they run away. To me they're the type of people in real life who just don't care about others and are maybe a bit more emotional and the type to be prideful over something insignificant.
---
When I picture a horde player it reminds me of a smug upper lip British person saying how much better the UK is than anywhere else because their superior health system and tea. Horde are the type of players to tell alliance "I feel sorry for you" and the alliance says " I don't think about you at all" like the mad Men guy meme.
---
Overall horde players are just really cringy and I'm glad I don't have to talk to them when I'm playing wow 
---
From a lore perspective it's simple. All the races practice their religion differently (Priest being the primary religious race) like Nelfs believei in Elune, Humans in the light, Troll in the loa etc.
---
But shamans are basically the same. I don't know in which order they designed the Vanilla classes but since Horde content was designed later than Alliance content, I'd think that less work went into the Shaman then other classes. Correct me there if I'm wrong.
---
Don't forget Q E R and T! Prime hotkey realestate there.
---
For me the main spells of the spec fall on 2-4. 2 is the one I spam, 3 next important and 4 after that one. 1 is a bigger spell with a long cd. 5 might be ofter an escape. Kick/counterspell on mouse thumb button.
---
I use 1-5, E, Q and a couple of mouse buttons. I have a modifier on all of those on Ctrl and Shift.  Might have used Alt as a modifier also, not sure. Space is jump. WSAD to move and A D are strafe. Also forward moving on pressing both mouse keys.
---
Thats 21 buttons and 2 on mouse (perhaps could modify those too) and no problems with movement while reaching the buttons. It might not be the most optimal layout but I quess I just have gotten used to it. (I tried a little and I hit Shift and Ctrl key with my pinky. Shift with the joint and Ctrl with the tip. The finger is always resting curled up on the keys)
---
I myself play the AH.
---
Dude nothing is wrong with that. If you wanna go Big Dick play Warri, dwarf priest etc. but judging other ones by their preferences and intimidate them by saying they wont get a raidspot is fucking far-fetched. Nobody will reject any healer in raids unless the spots are full or no dwarf priest is in the raid and they look especially for dwarf priests.
---
Again play what ever you want guys and dont let other ones tell you what to play or not but do some research. If you wanna go Big Dick not everything is viable enough to do so in hardcore raiding guilds.
---
I'd like my mount at 40 (Hence the question about the Lesser Wands crafting).  And after that it's just rushing to 60 to have better tools at my disposal for gold income.
---
So the questions should be: 
---
1) What can I do best to maximize my gold income to get a mount at 40?
---
2) What can I do best to mazimize my gold income to get the epic mount at 60? 
---
do both, and film it.
---
i have to choose between rogue, paladin, priest, warrior, mage.
---
rogue is already 60 and everything tested. the other classes are all around 20. currently leveling paladin in the direction of 60. i would not have thought the decision would be so hard. (I am set to only play one class once classic hits)
---
This
---
I'm confused. I am absolutely certain that I used to have a Peggle add-on during vanilla. Not the Warcraft themed one, but a classic Peggle one. But I can't find anything on Google. Maybe I was just alt-tabbing between WoW and Peggle, and I'm just misremembering it?  Really strange.
---
&gt;personally i have no problem with a tank, that says in the beginning of the dungeon, "hi guys i've never done it, where to go?" " or "what should i do here, please guide me, i don't know".
---
That would be a excellent tank that deserves praise. A lot of people just sit there quiet and hope they dont mess up.
---
I only ever played vanilla (and like 3 weeks of BC) so I'm not going to be able to answer your question directly, but I do think it's worth noting: The players you play against on p servers are not a good representative of what the players on classic wow will be like. Even though there's tens of thousands of people playing on p servers, the people who have played on p servers will be a teeny minority compared to the rest of the population who are returning to vanilla or playing it for the first time when classic (re)releases. I feel like you really shouldn't, in most scenarios, be able to 1v2 with any kind of consistency UNLESS you are playing against people who are literally clicking their skills with their mouse, or using arrow keys to turn, or whatever bad habits casual players pick up along the way that they then stick with because it's too hard to unlearn or never realize how bad their habits are holding them back. These people don't really exist in p servers, I don't think, but they do (and will again) make up a huge portion of retail populations.
---
I could be all wrong, it's just my suspicion.
---
You dont need ruthlessness when you have sealfate, that 1 point is just a spare point it helps for PVE. This spec is approved by Perplexity himself on the pvp discord don't need some random name on reddit to approve it. 1/10 troll
---
Pretty sure you're right as I remember it as well and I didn't play wrath. 
---
Impossible without the old WoW team. The classic department is doing a stellar job so far, but still, do we really trust today's Blizzard to even be able to deliver on this?
---
that is great. would also watch that for other dungeons. already searched for something like that but never found.
---
Tidal charm if anyone is wondering.
---
You don't HAVE to be engineering at all. It just helps out in various situations with reflect trinkets/nade stuns/cc helmet etc..
---
I am planning this route (also as a rogue):
---
\- Mining/Skinning to 40ish until regular mount
---
\- Swap skinning at 40ish for engineering (Mining/Engineering)
---
\- Swap mining to herbalism at 60 once i have certain engineering items made &amp; epic mount OR if in BWL/ZG phase already as herbs should make more gold
---
There is no such thing as horizontal progressions in wow. If one item is even somewhat slightly better than another, it is better and will be the one that's used.
---
What you really want is more vertical progression where it's lacking. More progression for different specs or maybe provide some in-between items like how some of the pre-raid bis you don't replace on some classes until naxx or not at all.
---
Troll priest, duh.
---
Retail is basically a "fun" p server. 
---
That's very good to know, thank you!
---
You can have fun without but why limit yourself?
---
Jesus
---
On pservers healers are overpopulated, groups will still be looking for tanks and dps long after heals are full. I know pservers arent classic but still, its the closest example we have.
---
You dont need extra combo points? Okay, you're def trolling atm.  
---
Also, talking about randoms on reddit, doesn't get any more random than some dude with 300 karma and numbers in his name.
---
already thought about something like that. i felt in open world and in dungeons there we some players like you described, but in bgs i felt like most people were geared very well and knew what they were doing. (like in the leveling bgs &gt;80% of the players were lvl x9 pvp twinks ;) )
---
Thanks for commenting! I'd like to cover more dungeons as my friend's and I progress our characters. For Deadmines I am considering rolling Alliance to show the quests but also show how I get there as Horde since some new people might like to see that.
---
Welcome to world of gearcraft mate.
---
Also if you want to 1v 2, play a mage, warlock, hunter not a rogue
---
Thank you for the suggestion and insight into how Priest is in Classic.
---
Mount at 40? Don't buy non-mandatory spells/skills, and don't spend any money on crafting professions or the AH in general. The questing and grinding from L30-40 will be where you earn the bulk of that gold. You'll get a 10% discount for being honoured with your own faction and a further 10% for being rank 3 in pvp. The latter is really only something to consider if you're getting close to rank 3 already in the 30s so more relevant for the 60 mount.
---
ah yeah thats it, thanks
---
No you don't need 3 points to have a 60% chance to get 1 combo point after your finisher when your backstabs give you 2 combo points already. Except i'm not talking random shit when a similar spec is listed here [https://discordapp.com/channels/458777803664654336/459480709552406539](https://discordapp.com/channels/458777803664654336/459480709552406539) by arguably one of the best rogues to ever play vanilla, without ruthlessnes. i'll wait for you to show how good you are before I take anything you say seriously, you're a nobody. 
---
I mean, it came from the fact that they DO do mediocre dps lol
---
It's an unfortunate side effect of expansions being mandatory for leveling and new class/race combinations becoming available.  
---
Worgen Death Knight isn't even the worst - you can have a void elf being a champion and general of the Alliance before they even existed in Legion. But it's not like they have many other options, unless they made the new races' minimum level equal to that of the expansions.
---
Then pick another one asshole!
---
pservers are the best reference you can have atm.
---
old game in modern era, you should 100% base your assumptions on it.
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
The main strength of a retri in PvP is reckoning ... that usually wont proc against healers.
---
Against healers, you Need to be a bit lucky. Need to stun them while they dont have shield/hots and then gamble for 2 weapon crits with seal proccs. For that very Moment, it would prolly be wise to use max rank SoC to get a bit more damage from judgment.
---
If you are engineer, you can actually stun/interupt them more and would prolly be able to kill them.
---
Still, a warrior will have way better chances of killing a healer.
---
Get those Orcs and Tauren out of my Westfall!
---
I feel on private servers in pvp you get one of two types. Either hardcore pvpers who have engineering, tidal charm, optimal pvp gear and consumables, or raiders who have top end gear. 
---
Being in pre raid BIS against a raider with top end gear or a hardcore pvper, you’re going to have to either have a large class advantage or largely outplay someone to kill them one on one. There are others out there you will be able to beat, but vanilla is definitely not a game balanced around 1v1s
---
Additionally it only worked for your faction.
---
i dont directly want to do it, but i like at least a chance to try it ;)
---
yesterday i attacked a wl with felhunter out. i brought him to 80%, then he deathcoiled me and gave me 2 dots. then i died in 3 seconds. dont want to know what gear he had xD
---
so you say gear is that important, even without resilience?
---
No matter hard you believe it, and whether anyone has a better analysis or not, tips analysis is worthless.
---
&gt; If we're dick wagging 
---
You literally falsely claimed that I never played Vanilla because you react like a 3 yo kid, and now I'm dick wagging by answering what's true? Yeah I'm not arguing anymore, you win. Gratz.
---
Enjoy Classic.
---
No he didn't. 
---
I think it would be pretty nice, but I get the feeling they wont do this simply so there isn't any confusion between the live and classic realm.  I honestly hope they do but thats my guess.
---
"Ashbringer" 
---
Im assuming these people probably have better gear(if they can nuke you that fast they do), why should you have a chance 2v1?
---
Unfortunately classic wow is pretty gear dependant for a lot of classes. Also on pservers there is a much bigger percentage of tryharders, where classic will be more like retail, with someone in full greens stumbling around in battlegrounds at low levels for their bracket.
---
Certain classes, especially warlocks, scale incredibly well with gear.   If you wanted to outplay him, you should have shadow reflected his coil, or I think you can vanish it?  But yeah, gesr is really important on some classes.   Ele shamans can’t play their OP spec without a decent amount of gear 
---
I did 2 gathering professions while leveling up on a fresh server and I was rolling in gold.  I had enough to buy the mount for myself and the enchanter in our group (who was perpetually broke cause enchanting) and had 200 left over by level 40.  Then at 60 you can go after the more rare nodes profitably so it scales well.  Also sets you up if you decide to do another profession later you can keep the relevant gathering.
---
Hunter would also be a good choice.  Has a relatively fast and low stress leveling experience and will always have a raid slot in PUGS due to tranq shot.  Which will help if you have low time to play but still want to see and do things. 
---
How the fuck do people not understand that this was a joke?
---
The battle chest doesn't exist anymore
---
had to google what shadow reflect is. i dont have that trinket ;) but nice to know it exists :P
---
6 years. So it's a new release ^(in Australia).
---
Yeah I guess it can be true that some people want to get geared for PvP but that's extremely selfish in my opinion. The way people usually do it is just raid normally and then take scraps for off spec when no one needs them.
---
I wouldn't be comfortable having one of those specs on a core spot for a raiding roster only to take gear from maybe Mages / Warlocks and then one day ditch to just do full time PvP because that's what they wanted to do all along.
---
Well you can make money on the AH but it costs time and it always depends on other players. It is risky and only do it if you like playing the AH. I just save money from quests. I pick a skill or 2 that i don't train and this is always enough for a mount at 40.
---
I like getting an addon that tells me the value of mob drops. With this i can farm at any point from lvl55-60. If i farm all 5 lvls i am able to get my 60 mount when i ding. Done that with a druid at 6days and a hunter at 5days ish /played.
---
1 hour spent at lvl 60 will give you 30G without much problem. 1hour spent on the AH at lvl 35 might give you 1-5G at best. At worst you will have a bunch of stuff that you have to either vendor or put in your bank because the market is full. 
---
... that edition came out in like 1990.
---
The bottom one is objectively better
---
If you want to be competitive in vanilla PvP, get used to using engineering items like grenades and reflector trinkets. You should also get other consumables like potions which give freedom of movement etc 
---
What? no they didn't I certainly didn't
---
Vanilla wasn't really made for PvP and it's super bursty. You basically want to one-shot your enemy before they one-shot you. Of course there's all kinds of cool stuff you can do but that's basically what it boils down to and you either like it, hate it or grow to like it.
---
Who doesn't love walking into Nessingwary's camp and seeing hundreds of skeletons while immediately hearing the stealth sound?
---
Well, let's be honest. That's what you always look like unless you have a full tier set.
---
Vanilla wont be very fun with all the private server newfags ruining the core experience.
---
Not to be like that, but maybe you're not that good yet? What spec are you running? Gear in vanilla is important and of course someone in AQ gear is going to have a big advantage over you in preraid gear but they definitely shouldnt kill you in 3 seconds. Here is a clip of a preraid rogue killing people in AQ gear [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZUeir2PkY0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZUeir2PkY0)  
---
Youtube rogue right here boiz. If you had any experience playing the game you'd know that what you see on montages is far from reality. Backstab doesn't crit nearly as often.
---
Even if backstab had 100% crit change, there's no scenario in which, 2/2 Muder and 1/3 Imp snd is better than 3/3 ruthlessness in any pvp situation.  
---
Lets say you KS. You backstab twice with tea or Renataki's and they both crit somehow. Now you have 4 cp. With Ruthlessness you'd have 5 cp, 60% of the time. 
---
I could see them doing server names such as "Classic: Blackrock" to avoid any misinterpreting even if there's a tab that separates the two. I would assume mostly high pop servers would be remade opposed to lower, but it depends on how many servers they release.
---
I would Name myself Warpalhuntshamdroodrogmagelockpriest then
---
Usually sets implies that there is a theme with stats and a theme with the sets strengths and weaknesses  
---
This set has a little bit of everything, which means that if you wear this set - you will be really weak regardless of what spec you go. Because it's strengths has been split out on all specs...   
---
And the agi stats? I have no idea what they're doing on a paladin item.
---
Pretty much all your questions have the same answer: Depends on the Loot Council system. There are just as many variations on Loot Council as there are on DKP systems.
---
In regard to whether you and your wife as inconsistent alternates would get a big upgrade over a main raider's small upgrade: That depends on how progress focused the guild is. If you join a guild where you're in the minority being inconsistent and everyone else is at +90% attendance, then the only loot you'll get is probably stuff that would have been disenchanted. You simply don't contribute enough compared to the rest of the members.
---
You need to look at it from all the other players perspective in that raid. Sure, it would be a big upgrade for you. But you contributed FAR less to the guild downing that boss and every boss before that, simply because you aren't there as much. And you will probably also contribute FAR less to downing bosses in the future, simply because you aren't there as much. It's also very likely that the main raider waited ages for that one drop and it might be ages before it drops again.
---
However, if you join a guild where it's the norm to be at 50% attendance, that's a different story. Then you are just as valuable as the average member and you will get average loot.
---
It boils down to finding a guild that has the same level of commitment as you. Regardless of loot system.
---
...or you can join a guild with higher commitment than you, and get carried. But then you'll have to accept that you receive loot as deserved. This isn't necessarily a bad tactic, since guilds more committed than you will down more bosses -&gt; more loot -&gt; more leftovers for you.
---
Cant wait to spam moonfire and run

or roots and run xD
---
Legion had spaceships. Spaceships, in space, in World of Warcraft.
---
I know TBC had a "spaceship" in TBC in the Exodar, the Draenei capital city, but it's lore was as a dimensional one: it didn't fly through space, it moved through different dimensions. That's still *passable* fantasy. 
---
In Legion you're actually in a spaceship in space.
---
Druid. Sort of the same boat as you and that’s what I’ve decided to go for. Always needed and not a lot of competition for gear in raids. 
---
Fast and easy to level. Good in wpvp as well. Can tank 5 mans or heal. 
---
Otherwise Hunter or Priest.
---
Play a warrior (:

Most guilds will happily funnel stuff to their MT to keep him happy/loyal.  Stuff like enchants, pots, gear etc.
---
typically, jokes are funny
---
If it is primarily for the looks, I totally get it. But when it comes to performance, the dreadmist is only usable for 5man dungeons :-)
---
Very Yes xD i have a feral buddy as well ... he hates boomkin xp but he is bribeable 
---
yes, thats what it felt like. in wotlk i remember fights being a bit longer with the chance to use your larger toolkit of skills.
---
Clown gear wasn't really a problem until TBC, in vanilla leveling gear was usually generic looking and not that colorful, so different pieces matched together just fine (with some exception of course).
---
At least the chest and legplates are better statswise than most plate items you can get untill lvl 50+ \^\^
---
Double pink pony tails Gnome is the master race to get salt from Horde. Tested
---
I think the kind of people you described as Horde are the kind of people that are the resident assholes who make up a small but loud percentage of almost any population or large group of people. I think it might say more about you, I'm sorry to say, that you think an entire faction of thousands of people could mostly be this kind of person. There are ugly stereotypes that are very occasionally true about both Horde and Alliance players, but 90% of Horde and Alliance players are indistinguishable from each other. There are plenty of Horde players who would never play with the kind of players you describe, and, on the other hand, the Alliance is not without their small but loud share of insufferable assholes.
---
played a hemo/cb spec with swords and a prep/backstab/improved sprint build. will have a look at that video later on. currently no one on the server has aq gear yet.
---
This needs more attention, it's not getting the signatures it deserves. 
---
I'm already Tracer
---
GM's can read all chats, it's fairly simple to figure out when it's abuse or not.              
---
A month long ban would show a good example of "don't be a dick".
---
Lol I had one called "IrwinsBane"
---
Agreed, people have to understand that these fights have been out for a loooooong time now, and the mechanics themselves are insanely simple compared to today’s standards. Information is so readily available, videos at your fingertips. And please, if they allow deadly boss mods or anything similar... it will be nothing less than fun.  As you’ve said the hardest part will be 40 people, and just like before, you’ll have troves of people wanting a spot in any half decent raiding guild.  Gamers as a whole are generally better, we shouldn’t have a problem with mechanics more than a decade old. 
---
Bold of you to assume I can out-DPS a warrior tank as a ret pally.
---
lol what does montages have to do with anything? Backstab on average with MC gear is 55-58% crit chance, meaning more than half the time it will crit. I've never ever seen someone spend 3 point in ruthlessness when specced into sealfate during these 3 years i've played with pvpers on all kinds of vanilla server. Murder adds 2% flat damage in both PVE and PvP it's far from useless. 
---
Yes I did raid MC - Naxx in 2006. Claiming people didnt wear or need FR in those days is outrageous.
---
Are you sure YOU actually raiding back then and not instead on some private server recently?
---
In general I think time travel and alternate dimensions is cool AF, but it kind-of- ruined wow. I would've been fine if they kept it as a side-thing/dungeon occurance (caverns of time) but basing entire expansions on it majorly fucked it all up.
---
*cries in Retribution*
---
As long as you can 1v1 each of the 2 players a 1v2 is definitely possible. If you have prebis you will be able to do some fairly okay damage to people but getting gear from raiding will help you massively.
---
If you're trying to 1v2 with your current gear against people in T2 and AQ gear then you have to make sure you're using the best consumables and engineering devices to stand a chance though. Use the goblin rocket helmet to incapacitate 1 of the guys. Use grenades and the engineering trinkets(The net, death ray, invis, reflection trinkets for shadow/frost/fire). As a rogue or hunter you are able to switch armor in fights by using vanish and FD to leave combat. This let's you swap your trinkets quickly or swap helmet. Having the world buffs is a massive advantage and things like elixir of mongoose will be like an item upgrade when consumed.
---
Keep in mind it can be expensive and/or a lot of hassle to do this, but if you're trying to 1v2 people who have a lot better gear, that's what you'll need to do.
---
Make sure you know your combo as a rogue as well and are using the right spec. Also don't try 1v2 certain classes. I know hunters can be a nightmare for rogues if they know what they're doing... they will trinket your stun, scatter shot you, then FD+Freezing trap you. If you're prepared for this, you could play smart and use the engineering frost reflector on him to counter this as soon as you see him trinket. This is the kind of niche skill/advantage you need in vanilla PvP to get the edge over other people. 
---
Other than that all I can say is you will enjoy it a lot more on fresh classic servers, particularly at the start when everyone is on a level playing field in PvP.
---
Por que no los dos
---
i would not want to play reckoning, but deep ret. how are they doing in pvp? are they able to put out enough damage to kill something? are there specific classes they cant win against?
---
It was definitely at least TBC, I was playing it with a friend during Al'ar progress while it was doing its thing up on the platforms
---
Honestly think the classic client will be listed separately on bnet and will be a completely different executable.  Its too much of a hyped money maker for them to tuck it away under the hood that is retail. 
---
If ever you change your mind/circumstances, I'll be happy to share my Pathfinder conversion stuff with ya.
---
Damn name checks tf out
---
I actually ported the peggle addon to 7.3 back then. I think it should just work outright on classic but I will look into it if beta comes around or when classic releases.
---
1.2.3.4.5 - QERT - SFGHZXCV - with shift versions of each as well. 2 mouse binds as well. 
---
I love when he’s naming all the totems in that slothlike voice
---
Wester Plaguelands.
---
Everyone is always talking about Eastern Plaguelands but westen had such iconic quest hubs. 
---
I did read your post. It seemed very delusional. Scroll through the subreddit, there isn't bickering between min maxers and other parties. Honestly, your straw man discussion reads like a high school essay that didn't meet the word count so you had to beef it up with superfluous language. 
---
great post. i dont have engineering leveled, so i miss a lot of the mentioned possibilites. gets me a bit more optimistic about pvp in classic over all :)
---
I firmly believe this subreddit, and the current Classic WoW community in general, has a very disproportionate slant towards hardcore players such as minmaxers. It seems that every week there's a thread having an argument over it.
---
It makes sense, because the hardcore fans are the ones that will be hyped most for the game, and so are the most likely to be active here and in the various Discords etc.
---
I believe this is a mountain made out of a molehill. When Classic releases the vast majority of more casual fans, who aren't in here theorycrafting every week, will show up to play.
---
Minmaxers will have their hardcore guilds and compete for world/regional/server firsts, while the majority of the players play a less hardcore experience.
---
I believe the minmaxers represent only a few thousand people at most. Spread them worldwide across Blizzard regions and servers. You're going to end up with exactly what you ended up with back in Vanilla: on every server there'll be 2-3 guilds per faction that are the "top raiders", with every other guild being semi-hardcore or casual.
---
Look - prebis gear is for raids. It is specifically a glass cannon set meant to optimize damage output.   
---
If you want to pvp, you should chase gear with good stamina. Also if you are facing opposing players that have raid gear, you are at a disadvantage.  
---
There were many Addons back then, some that were completely broken and wouldn't be allowed in today's live game. If you did anything like that it would just be restricting code to what was capable then as it could have been made and just not made public by someone who makes their own Addons, so just because you didn't know of it, doesn't mean it wasn't an addon used. 
---
Honestly we are gonna see a ton of new addons including ports of stuff that is used in retail.  The classic client is being built off the current retail client/api and it remains to be seen if they restrict that in anyway or not.  I fully expect to see stuff like Deadly Boss Mods and other retail staples.   So as long as the API allows it I expect to see it.
---
It would be wayyy too unfeasible for blizzard to investigate every new addon and review it for the classic spirit.  
---
You jest but I'd really love a flying mount in vanilla. If cata didnt ruin the world in order to bring in flying mounts to azeroth, I'd still be playing retail.
---
This is wrong, fresh destroys the raiding scene as some player that currently raid move and the pool of players that would otherwise look to raid feel obligated to move to get into guilds starting out on the new server. I.e. easier to get into than a guild already mid AQ40.
---
Hi, /u/captainkaba
---
Best to not understimate your opponent.
---
Best you could do is make a ton of alts and have them wait in an Inn and fill up their rested xp bars, and only play each character every 10 days. 
---
Where did you find this OP?
---
Damn it, I fed the troll.
---
3rd Edition came in 2000, with 3.5 following 3 years later.  
---
The *Complete Fighter's Handbook* was released in 1989, but the optional rules for piecemeal armor were rarely used because:  
---
 1. they were optional  
---
 2. they involved lots of bookkeeping, which took away from playing time  
---
 3. it was only of limited usefulness, if you for example wanted to play a gladiatorial campaign, or some sort of post-apocalyptic setting (hence its inclusion in *Dark Sun*, released in 1991)  
---
 4. it further diminished the already fragile "realism" of the armor class system, which refers to the capacity of the armor to "deflect and absorb" incoming blows, by having different sections of the armor contribute to the overall capacity.
---
The "authority" in regards for armor, in 2nd Edition, was the *Arms and Equipment Guide*, one of the DM splat-books, released in 1991 and, surprisingly for its scope, it doesn't mention the piecemeal armor rules introduced by the player splat book.

58% crit is hardly every backstab.  
---
Why do you keep going back to pve? Who would even pick up this build for pve?  
---
You havent seen anyone goes ruthlessness with sealfate? So 2 out of the 2 seal fate rogues you've met in your alleged 3 year experience on private servers weren't smart enough to pick up ruthlessness. Great sample size.
---
Nah at first they just had the &lt;GM&gt; tag - I assume they decided to introduce the more official-looking tag(in early TBC I think?) after so many people tried to trick others by doing the tag themselves-
---
Hi, /u/kmaevers
---
Because I've seen what so many people on this board consider "confirmation" of Classic facts. This could've been a legitimate post. 
---
Your premise was that warriors are crit immune because of shield block and boss attacks being "much slower."   
---
I was just pointing out your bad example. I don't claim to know all there is about tanking or vanilla, but seeing as you cherrypicked a lot of other things in this thread it seems obvious that linking a boss from the next xpac is just that.  
---
I don't think there will be only def capped warriors running MC. Not sure where you came up with that one.   
---
What you're saying is because of your extensive knowledge and experience (albeit 15 year old memories) that you definitively know what would happen with or without progressive itemization. You can guess, you can estimate, and you can agree/disagree with them doing progressive itemization but that doesn't mean anyone that disagrees with you has "logical fallacies." You are the one that pointed out: " Rag was world first killed in 1.4 with 1.4 healer/caster itemization ilvl changes (along with a shit ton of changes, like fixing weapon skill). Rag has never been killed with 1.1 itemization." At this point the only real "logical fallacy" is you thinking your decade old memories of a time when rag was killed in 1.4 has any real indication of what progressive loot will be like with 1.1 itemization.
---
I might bookmark this page just for the laughs tho dude, cause you're a mental case.
---
Then go for it! Shouldn't be impossible to get a Draconic Maul or even an Azkhandi and those weapons do some serious hurt in the hands of a reckadin or socadin.
---
What about all the players who want to do Naxx bit are not no life'ing the game. Seasons presume everyone has a tonne of time to spend in the game. The joy of classic should be servers and characters that we know are not going anywhere so that we can enjoy all the content at whatever pace we like.
---
The idea of regular FRESH (every 6 months) or seasons (every x years) goes against that and I hate the idea.
---
I liked looking at people and seeing what gear they had on without tmog. Your first shoulder pad was a big deal.
---
Well, you can't exactly have one without the other! 
---
You sir are a hero! 
---
Because op is asking for a spec that doesn't have preperation, asking about combat talent tree he obviously wants to PVE too. And vigor/sealfate backstab is perfect for that. Alright man agree to disagree, i'll stick to the talents linked by well known and good pvpers rather than random opinions on reddit. Good luck.
---
You're expected to be in the correct spec for raid. What you do outside of raid time is your thing.
---
I think our guild usually gave MT flasks out of guild funds.  They usually didnt need to use any other consumable the majority of the time and I am sure if needed the guild can always spot them for it.
---
If by that you mean a holy priest with shadow weaving sure.
---
Thanks man, gl to you too, you'll need it with your obvious lack of critical thinking.
---
Yeah the majority of jobs are 9-5, Quick google says its the same situation in Norway again being one of the mild EU countries. 
---
There are all types of guilds raiding at all times you just have to seek them out and not be picky if your raid time is abnormal. Or heck corner the makert and run your own, Betting there are more people like yourself looking for a guild. 
---
I always do Herbalism (Druid Tauren spec) and enchanting (easy to farm low dungeons and sell the first reagents). You will get a lot of gold by level 40. 
---
Well, have you seen speedruns of Mc and bwl? You don't go oom when boss fights last 15 seconds to a minute. 
---
Isn't it great on a holy/reck build?
---
Touche, lol
---
Vigor with improved sprint but you need 5/8 tier 1 for that. Works fine for both PVE and PVP, is actually the preferred spec for defending the flag in WSG.
---
Your guild should only contain members who insist on having the worst spec/class combos, like protection pally, ret pally, survival hunters, balance druids and the like.
---
You're trying to fight BWL/ZG geared opponents in pre-raid PvE gear on a melee class (inherently weapon dependant on their weapon). I don't really know why you're expecting to be able to consistently 1v2.
---
I think you're probably overestimating your skill (in vanilla) as well. WotLK and even BC is a very different game in terms of PvP. They massively increased survivability over the course of expansions. Vanilla PvP is incredibly punishing in that a single mistake can cost you the fight, due to health not being inflated compared to damage. You'll need to learn to deal with the bursty damage and class matchups, and yes you can absolutely deal with it.
---
Tanks were needed the most in vanilla as well.
---
In our hearts it will live forever.
---
It's good enough for leveling if you have some +shadow dmg gear on your character (30+ lvl), or if mobs are green.
---
I love having the entire color palette on my character.

Was looking at some late quests in WPL/EPL and found Battle of Darrowshire rewarding players with "Tea with sugar" just to give things like Ring of Protection: [http://classicdb.ch/?item=15855](http://classicdb.ch/?item=15855) which is a really good and cool feral tanking item.
---
After leveling and raid healing with a shaman I'm planning to go mage/druid or mage/shaman if I would need hard raid healer as an alt. If there won't be to much pressure on more shamans druid for tanking or healing will be more fun (although bit selfish ;) from a perspective of a player that plays healers on retail and on the *other version* of WoW).
---
When I made my first character, a dwarf paladin, I fell in love with the dwarf starting area. It was so surreal, it felt like I had been there before and it was just incredible. When I finally made it to ironforge, I shidded and farded and cummed in my pants, it was so damn cool. An entire city in a mountain. I explored the whole area for days, and found the airport on top of iron forge. That was the coolest thing ever.

This video is from 2006 lol hes obviously going to adapt to todays standards. Just look at Spoh, dude was rank 14 in 2006, came back to N\*rthdale in 2018 and kicked ass there too. If someone was ahead of their time in 2006 they will have no problem adapting in 2019, it's not like vanilla is a hard game. Stuff like vanishing deathcoils, using skull on rocket helm and trinket management is the pinnacle of vanilla pvp and it's not hard to learn.
---
WoW (Vanilla especially) Is so easy that min-maxing a comp and especially a race is so dumb that I dont understand it.
---
Even Naxx is easy as shit as long as you are prepared, got 40 geared people who have farmer consumables. The hardest part is getting 40 people prepared, that shit aint easy, but as soon as that is done, start collecting your loot.
---
So what kind of priest you have wont matter. But, as he states, dwarf priest are objectively the best race, so if you dont care what race you are, pick a dwarf cause they are the best.
---
If you really feel like playing a human, play a human, cause it wont matter. Thats how wow always is and will always be. Low tier players ask what race is the best, when the difference is so small that it does not even matter.
---
i have never said that i am expecting to be able to consistently 1v2.
---
besides that i also felt the burst heavy pvp style. and the gear dependence. 
---
i didnt expected the gear depenence in pvp that much cause there is not resilience in vanilla. 
---
Yes, you should. I've played many different MMO's, and world of warcraft is hand down the best there ever was, and probably ever will be. I never got to play classic, as I came in at the start of the second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, so I am beyond excited to finally get to experience WoW in all its former glory. I cannot fucking wait to finally raid Onyxia.
---
I know for sure they respawned in raids after a certain amount of time, I remember having to kill them all again in MC and ZG sometimes on long runs and wipes. Maybe not in dungeons though?
---
This makes sense. I wonder if there are some classes that simply get to the end of the rainbow quicker and their gear becomes up for grabs or disenchanting quicker than others. From everything you read most chart toppers wanna be warriors rogues mages and such. So if wife is really hoping to be a hunter maybe there will be less people after that stuff so our more casual approach wont be as big a deal. It's not like everybody gonna be after bows if that makes any sense? We will be ally side and I'm currently on the fence between druid and paladin. Both have alot of appeal to me.
---
Hunter or Priest.

I bought a mechanical keyboard, a 31.5" screen and a new mouse.  
---
My current machine can run a downscaled BFA well enough - but those inputs/outputs are important.
---
Just a note: Passive movement speed modifiers from items DO NOT stack, but mounted speed increases DO stack. 
---
The items dicussed in this video are:
---
Highlander/Defilers Boots - 8% movement speed increase.
---
Enchant Boots - Minor Speed - 8% movement speed increase.
---
The PostMaster's Set - 5% movement speed increase at 5 set. 
---
Runeblade of Rivendare - 8% movement speed increase + 20 health per second (low drop chance but easily the best one on the list).
---
Enchant Boots - Lesser Riding Skill - 2% mount speed increase.
---
Mithril Spurs - 4% mount speed increase.
---
Carrot on a stick - 3% mount speed increase. 
---
Let me know if I missed anything. I do know there are buffs you can get, but these aren't as actively available. As far as I'm aware passive movement speed does stack with skill/talent based movement speed increases.
---
Well, you got healers for that. Might as well bring one of them instead. 
---
Those evil min-maxers
---
They do require good gear though, and you will need to raid as resto first, very probably. But boom in is the least terrible of all meme specs by far. 
---
It's pretty easy to hit  [Shift] + [Q]/[W]/[E] + [1]/[2]. 
---
Pinky on shift, middle on 1/2, pointer on strafe or W. 
---
But usually I'm moving with my mouse (only) in PvP. So my pinky is on Shift duty. On my Pally I also have blessings bound to ctrl modifiers and speed buffs on alt modifiers. 
---
Depends on what races you guys plan on going but if its the same race then i think after the small starter section (level 1-6 usually) since the beginning is so easy. If youre human and hes dwarf or something then maybe once hes level 6 he could come over to elwnn and then you could grind mobs while waiting so you dont pass him in auests. Or maybe a bit later at around lvl 10-12ish after each finishing the first zones

---
u can, but it will be worse.
---
there is btw a very strong backstab build with prep and improved sprint. (what you describe as soft cc cleanse when you sprint)
---
Healing Touch Rank 4 is the most mana-efficient spell in the game. Paladins can also be pretty efficient with their Illumination talent and no mana cost.
---
They did say it was to preserve Vanilla: Brack: "This is an important game in videogame history and there’s not a way to go back and experience that today. This is also about preserving something that we think is really important." (https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/)
---
stonetalon mountains (although its not really that open) and also some parts of feralas. great places
---
I'd argue there's gear dependence precisely because there is no resilience. In later expansions you could just kit yourself out in resilience gear from BG's and you were on a roughly level playing field with everyone else, as raiders basically weren't allowed to use their gear in PvP.
---
So there isn't hundreds of threads full of people asking genuine questions about X,Y or Z only to have tons of people respond with sarcastic remarks (like this one) such as "Don't, play a proper spec" or "We are not carrying you through raids" 
---
That is the argument here. About people becoming accepting and not pushing community members away with unhelpful and stupid comments. 
---
Clearly I am not the only one here who thinks there are many arguments throughout the sub BUT please continue to look at it all through rose tinted goggles! 
---
Again, it depends on how progress orientated a guild you're joining. If it's a hardcore guild, then druid and palas will probably only be healers and anything else considered off spec. And you gear the offspecs of your core healers before you gear your Social members.
---
And even your wife as Social hunter will get bows AFTER raid rogues and raid warriors. Again, because you aren't as valuable to the guild because you simply aren't there as much.
---
If you're fine with getting carried, then sure, see if you can join a guild above your commitment level. But you will probably be considered Social and probably only get items that would have otherwise been disenchanted.
---
In case I wasn't being obvious: I would recommend joining a guild that has the same level of commitment as you.
---
I think its a reward from the Hellfire Peninsula quest out the front of Thrallmar where all the Infernals are raining down. Not 100% sure so don't quote me on that.
---
On RP serv? Nah thanks mate i'm fine, but if you can't stand free world PvP i advise you not to go on Classics especially Stranglethorn or Barrens you'd meet a bunch of "assholes" and it won't be fun for you going back and forth from graveyard to your corpse
---
Rogues are very poor at teamfighting in general in vanilla and really need to find openings to make an impact in BGs.
---
These have been in JB Hi-Fi and other electronics stores for years. Don't know where you got the new release info from.
---
Have you cleared Naxxramas before?
---
Hunter pug spots are always ultra-competitive. Most pugs want a gear check on every hunter and bring less than 5 to MC or BWL. You can make it work out by being awesome at your class but it's no shoe-in.
---
no they cant cos they all died in the first 4 seconds when they accidentally pulled aggro :D
---
Check outward, made me feel like starting up wow for the first time
---
I had no idea what it was. I wandered in, was in my mid 30’s, whole lot of 60’s ganking each other. Walked to the centre and looted the chest.
---
I made it back out again before anyone bothered to take notice.
---
There were a few unhappy souls about that one!
---
I feel like Un'Goro is one of the scariest places to be. No where it feels save. Giant elites walking around scaring the shit out of you and a ton of world pvp and no real "roads". 
---
This is the true vietnam.
---
i have narrowed my choices between rogue warrior mage warlock priest. 
---
Not even joking :P am torn. eliminated hunter as i played it on Pserver.
---
Shaman and paladin and druid i have little interest in playing.
---
Learning most towards warlock as i have never played the class before.
---
Hard to have any rivalry when most serious guilds are horde and pvp has been dead forever (save for arena, but it's its own game anyways.) 
---
Yes, I have cleared all raids in a private server setting (yes, not exactly the same as classic, I know, before you start whining about that) but close enough.
---
But mechanically every single vanilla fight is an absolute joke. That does not make the game bad, or raiding in vanilla boring, its just how it is.
---
I just add undead rogues to that least and yeah, agreed. 
---
1) Yes people can clear it in 30 minutes, and level in 3 days. As I said at the start, Min-Maxing impresses me. You have missed the point. It is not the only way to go, maybe people enjoy boss fights in their own niche spec that take a little bit longer? No one is saying don't min max - all that I have said is stop bashing those who do not wish to, and when someone comes to the forum to ask about a NE Priest, give them genuine advice rather than troll and say "Roll Dwarf" 
---
2) Am I? Is that not when ended up happening in Retail... Min-Maxers pushed their opinion so hard that by the end of cataclysm the Alliance had SPIKED in popularity due to "Human being the only way to go" - Telling people that it is pointless to play anything other than dwarf might only affect a few, but that's a few to many IMO
---
3) It isn't going to affect anyone. As much as anyone has the option to play their choice of Class/Race combo, it is other people's choice to play with them or not.
---
4) ???
---
5) If we are talking about PUG's then the person crying about a dwarf or a Ret Paladin should probably have joined a guild rather than PuG if they wanted the perfect composition. 
---
6) Sarcastic, unhelpful and pointless comments such as ones I've mentioned previously may have an air of seriousness too them... However they don't help the OP very often and are rather unconstructive. If that is a new player, that is there first impression of this community - They get better answers from goofballs on the retail forums. That doesn't look good on our community, maybe we lose a player and therefore is toxic.
---
7) Exactly? So why does anyone need to belittle anyone else? 
---
8) This is exactly what I have said... So I agree with it whole heartedly. I don't get why you couldn't have said this point and then just been like /thread.
---
If someone starting a thread about them starting a NE Druid and asking for help, advice and tips on their class is the recipient of only sarcastic remarks such as;
---
"yeah don't roll NE roll dwarf" 
---
That's not a discussion. The post is about everyone including everyone. As they should do, Min Maxing is impressive and great, but there are those who just don't want to. Which should be met with open arms also!
---
The High Elves famously are quite adept spellbreakers and their racial capital guard is made up of mostly Spellbreakers IIRC (who even goes there) but which other ones would be a bit iffy. It would require bit of a different angle on the lore to have Spellbreakers from other factions though. I would also say a shaman is the closest we get, but their magic being elemental and mostly offensive I think there's enough room for the Spellbreaker. 
---
there is no tree form in classic lol.. 
---
Addons have always been a part of WoW. Just like shortand long macros.
---
The good think about it is, that it's a players choise to use them or not.
---
As long as addons dont abuse the game to give an unfair advantage, I see no problem in letting players who spend time on making addons get creative :)
---
I hope so, because it would be really nice to decide to play with a bunch of MemeSpecs out in the world; without them all being scared off to play something for someone else.
---
pvp videos really make me want to play balance, they have so much utility and seem. invincible

i just found out there are skill ranks that you cant learn by your class trainer. is there a list of those skills and how you can get the book to learn them?
---
Classic is about playing your way, the openness of the talents and the sheer number of ways you can build things! 
---
Hell of you really hate warlocks you could go full resist get and just plonk around!

Have fun and have a community. That's what's bringing so many people back, and drawing so many others to it!

Sorry but you're so wrong, for the standard back then Grim was an exceptional player, I know you've already been called out for your comparison so I won't go there - but Grim was way ahead of his time, his movement in general was one of the biggest things that stood out, he was very fluid and had good mechanics, this guy was doing expose armor over sap trick in vanilla.
---
After he stopped making videos he played high rated arena in BC and was one of the best on his battlegroup, Gladiator+ every season he played, he was not just some flashy video maker that would get dunked on in a real competitive environment, and trust me there were plenty of 'famous' players that fall into that catagory, but Grim wasn't one of them. 
---
... back when magazines were still a thing. :D 
---
There is nothing wrong with hard truths told in an constructive manor! Hell I bet there are still some shamans out there that have not seen this Reddit, have seen a shamtanking video and decided - YES IM GOING TO BE THIS! 
---
Hard truths but constructive is all I'd like to see, but yes arseholes to tend to appear everywhere 
---
I've been thinking about this myself. However, I highly doubt this will happen.
---
The problem is, that there were way more servers by the end of vanilla, than is nessecery for Classic.
---
So which server name gets to live again and which doesnt? Would be a bit unfair to pick some, and not others, right?  
---
You could argue that the most popular servers get revived as Classic servers, but then if Stormscale wasnt on that list, I wouldnt really care. So its a bit of a tricky situation.
---
ah, the daily "holier than thou" and the daily "retail players bad hu hu" combined into one, what innovation!
---
Honestly, no idea. I never really focused on Pally specifics.
---
Mechanically they are simple, yes. But for me it seems that Naxx is insanely overtuned requiring everybody to min/max their stats.
---
You can make a tank and spank bossfight difficult just by introducing an enrage timer and making the boss hit for a crapton.
---
Thanks for sharing these. Although similar, I'm definitely going for a different style than this guy that people might like more/less depending on the person.
---
I see you have a paladin main.
---
^ this. 
---
You're correct, I've played against both Grim and Vurtne in BC, albeit Grim was in arena and Vurtne was open world as he refused to play arena, Vurtne, although probably my favourite pvper of all time for his videos - wasn't all that amazing in reality, fair enough it was a different time in BC and he did a lot for the mage class in terms of being ahead of the curve and carving the mage playstyle, but by then anyone remotely serious competitively was levels above him. Grim stood his ground in the arena scene until he quit, he was a gladiator + level player
---
Yeah, in T3 you will be finally able to use a shield.
---
They are not as tight as you say, they are actually pretty relaxed as long as you know what you are doing (But good luck finding 40 people like that)
---
Anyway, that counts to preparation and still proves my point
---
I'm sure grinding 34-40 beasts and selling loot is more profitable than that.
---
I like how the Blasted Lands are in Northrend originally.
---
Any class will do. It's just going to take a different amout of time to level and gear it, if you have limited gametime.
---
10 hours a week is not a small amount. Once you're done leveling, you can do plenty of 5mans to grind pre raid BiS with 10 hours of gaming time.
---
Primary action bar:

Just from the top of my head. I'm sure I'm forgetting some...
---
Tried ultrawide. From someone that can't live without a second monitor a ultrawide was not worth it for me.
---
I also played windowed mode so I can move my mouse to my second monitor without alt tabbing.
---
Classic community is quite toxic, though. You can’t compare them to 12 year olds playing Fortnite, that is true.
---
Creating the same class just because that level 14 chest didn't match your beard.
---
viral &amp; stuck were 2 examples of rogues way ahead of their time
---
OP, is this TGM?
---
Man you were lucky. I had to wait on my turn to play with only 1 pc in the house. 
---
I see you're an Orc of culture as well
---
I feel like I saw you applying to the guild Im in. But was dissatisfied with the raiding times. &lt;Hate&gt;
---
Hope you will find a guild that fits your scedue!
---
After a certain amounts of reports you can get automatically muted ingame before ever being reviewed by a GM. For most people this won't be an issue, streamers might be f'ed.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla and on private servers, also in TBC and wotlk. Rogues have never really been a class that can take down 1v2 non retarded opponents unless you outgear them. You rely on burst and cooldowns and you can't burst someone down with crap gear. You also don't have a cc breaker which is the main hinderance in a 1vX scenario. You eat a stun as a rogue vs more than one opponent you're pretty much just dead. Warlocks can tank it, mages can blink it, hunters out range it.
---
When everyone is wearing blues rogues are very strong but they don't scale as well as other classes so the further into vanilla wow you get, the worse they get vs opponents of equal gear.
---
And if you are in blues now you are massively behind in gear. If u're in blues vs tier 1 you'd manage, but the AQ40 gear is miles ahead. You probably have half the crit, AP and hit of a AQ geared rogue, probably 1k HP less too.
---
You're in wotlk wearing the blue arena set trying to kill people wearing S7 epics. It wouldn't work there either.
---
I did. Everything I find is about it starting when mana is being spent. Which makes me correct, since starshards uses it at the beginning.
---
Don't! You'll just throw up and then it won't be as cool anymore.
---
You don’t use ret pallies in raids 🤷🏻‍♂️ Also, both from my experience on pservers and the recent census, pallies are the least played class with the exception of druids. 
---
Totally agree! I think you elucidated this better than I did. "Medley of narratives" is an excellent way of putting it. I understand why they wanted to get the major lore characters from WC3 in the game but they did a very poor job of it.
---
Even with end-game in vanilla. There was no "one big bad" for the whole 'expansion'. I think having multiple villains to fight adds to the flavour . Feels more organic. As one threat is quelled, another arises.
---
With the single mega-villain it feels more like a superhero movie plot. Especially the later expansions where every player is the "one true hero of the universe". Blech.
---
Remember a time where me and my friend played on the same table, tables collapsed and my friend grabbed the table, while i continued playing upside down lol
---
I just miss everything about classic, from class quests too getting your first piece of epic armour using all your saved up DKP.
---
Amazing!! 
---
Hence the winky face :p I know you meant 3-4 weeks ofc. 
---
thats a L2P issue mate, rogues can definitely kill most classes even with bad gear, you just have to control fight. stun stun gouge vanish sprint etc. never get hit.
---
1v2 is also possible but depends on who you go up against
---
There's 64,000 people subbed to here. There were 150k active (though you can be conservative about this because "active" can mean quite a lot of things) accounts on Nostalrius.
---
Those numbers represent the most hyped fans, the most eager supporters. As is the case with *every fanbase for anything*, these people represent a small minority of the total audience.
---
Oh.. kinda thought you meant which version of Windows will we play on. Like anyone cares about fucking mac users.
---
Such a lovely read.  I can totally relate to some if this; I used to play NWN religiously just before Vanilla and it felt like such a nice transition from one to the other.
---
What is this statue left to the middle monitor? Weird candle? Dwarf with hands up? Massive dump?
---
Time to drink some water and straighten your back.
---
Hi, /u/Silentopia
---
Demon hunters are fighting-mages.
---
Let’s the Alliance bicker while the Horde destroys them all!! 
---
^ Inside the mind of an idiot
---
Very true, we were 2 lvl 40s (Rogue and Warlock I believe) and a lvl 60 (warrior). Didn't think to mention that we had 1 more buddy tagging along for the boost as it didn't seem important, but I'll edit the post. Thank you
---
Any threat drop bosses will be a problem. However, there is an item come AQ that arguably if you get 6 of them and set of 6 healers that can optimally rotate them and change who is MT healing is great.
---
This item gives a damage shield based on a % of the heal - which because paladin's aren't reliant of rage mechanics is amazing. The issue is A) getting 6, B) your not MTing any threat drop mechanic bosses
---
Which combination of gather did u do? skinning/mining?
---
Up until some patch in mid-vanilla, you could cast spells from stealth/shadowmeld and it wouldn't break until the cast finished. It was changed to break upon starting the cast instead.
---
So no, it won't work.
---
I'm intrigued by this idea of off-tanking, similarly to OP I want to tank but I don't have tons of time. Can you reccommend some good resources to learn this role?
---
Please will everyone stop with these pally and druid threads they are so tired. They arent good specs and you will make it harder for those around you.
---
There is an ancient of lore in Darkshore.
---
Bugs me way more that they shoves a bunch of nonsensical class/race comboes into the game as it progresses. 
---
I raided as SP until C'thun. It does nice damage, i was nearly always in the top 5 DPS of my guild. It's surely not a meme spec.
---
That's some legacy warcraft 3 mechanics.
---
Weird candle-dwarf with dump all over it?
---
I don't have a list but some are world drop from high level mob and other are drop from AQ20, all books are BoE tho so you can buy them from AH
---
Yeah, definitely one of those things that had to be changed even though it was... flavorful.
---
2 warriors, save your gold from respeccing
---
sounds like mega meme specc to me ?  
---
You want to be DPS or Healer ? or a combi ?
---
Ele is not an optimal build, but it sounds you want to combine the best of the 3 worlds.  
---
What is called a meme spec. :)
---
Considering Peggle was developed in 2007 I doubt thats the case.
---
There are plenty of values between a bonus 5% and a bonus 500% where it is neither "useless" or "insanely OP" for a Priest.
---
As deep retri you have Repentance, if you use it well combined with Hammer of justice and engi bomb that stun you can do crazy combo with Seal of Command as it does more damage on stunned target.
---
I meant tree form in tbc hence I'd have to change mains then
---
I played nwn on a semi permanent rp server just before wow. I can't think of the name. They retarded XP after level 13 or something. I played a pally but good based characters wouldn't group with me if i summoned skeletons (too evil). I didn't know what the hell I was doing but i had a lot of fun.
---
Wow, this sub is full of low effort garbage now. 
---
Yikes
---
Probably felt good to start casting Starfire while going shadowmeld. Wonder how NPCs behaved when they got fucked from the invisibility with the pillar of arcane energy out of nowhere.
---
Totally agree on your point, but if someone is comitted, it can work out, but if i would play dps and would have to watch KTM cause my prot pally cannot generate enough threat, well i go and look for a better tank 💁🏻‍♂️
---
I've been a Troll Priest ever since real vanilla, over 100 days played. Awesome combo, was really sad when they removed the Priest Racials in WotLK because Trolls got some really unique ones - shadowguard and hex of weakness!!!
---
Loosen up
---
Wow what a grown up opinion. I think this is a valid question. Sorry you feel offended when thinking or talking about those „fucking“ Mac users. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Don’t bother with him man. He’s clearly a private server try hard who never actually played classic. Everything he is saying is 100% irrelevant when it comes to raiding. Like 10 guilds in the world are going to be so strict that it’s dwarf only, and those are the guilds pushing for all the world first kills. And if you are in one of those guilds, you already know the situation, and if you aren’t, it’s too late anyways. 
---
It’s really disappointing how negative all these private server players are. The amount of hate they spew out because they are so elitist has such a bad impact on any random casual player who decides to check out this subreddit.  They want the sub count to beat out retail, but they also don’t want casual scrubs to play their game because they don’t play it their way. 
---
Mining is fore sure the easier way if you want to be engineer but herbalism is also viable since herb sells pretty well.
---
You might have a hard time during the firsts months tho since most people will still be in the leveling process and won't need much herb thus decreasing the demand and therefore the price
---
You don’t really need to specc into Resto while levelling. If you don’t wanna go deep Enhc then just spend the points to get imp GW then go deep Ele. 
---
ow dam.  
---
Classic is a journey. 
---
If you want to rush to end game content you should be playing BFA / Retail.  
---
Classic is a leveling journey and then more content will happen.  
---
No boosts and no XP pots.  
---
They are going to create a Vanilla WoW experience and these leveling things, where not a part of it, and (hopefully) never will be.
---
Not according to  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090706033528/http://www5.popcap.com:80/promos/wow/](https://web.archive.org/web/20090706033528/http://www5.popcap.com:80/promos/wow/) 
---
The AddOn was developed by Popcap for Wotlk or VERY late TBC, and there only exists a version that works on the Wotlk client to my knowledge.
---
And lets face it. No regular addon developer would port an actual game into addon format. Its too complex and you might run into rights issues. Most likely you just remember it incorrectly I guess?
---
\+-5% dps
---
this must have been so much fun!  i always played online with school friends but its not quite the same as LANing
---
looks like a Buddha maybe?
---
player are humanoid, npc are generally undead, forsaken npc it's one ore the other
---
Imp. ghost wolf is not that huge in vanilla since it's a 3 sec cast and even when maxed out talent won't make the cast instant.
---
Personally I would recommend pure Enh for leveling, maybe Elem if your friend is a mage because you will spend quite a lot of time drinking. You can heal 5 mans while leveling in any spec anyways, so there is no real need to prio resto untill you start farming BRD/Pre-bis in the mid lvl50's.
---
My priest was NE
---
And I used starshards as a grinding tool for getting felcloth.  Double for one mob smite another to death.  It allowed you to get in to the mp5 window while grinding.  
---
Fearward is nice for raids. But warriors can stance dance.  So it’s not that mutch of a hassle.  As long as you create a macro for it.  
---
Oh god!! Need to prepare. love the website!
---
Rough but beautiful describes it well.  I love playing on my Mac and forgive the stalls.
---
When I played on Emerald dream we used to have one shadow priest, one boomkin and one feral cat. Worked great.
---
Yea usually getting to 60 ASAP is your answer, whether its black lotus or devilsaur skinning. Or just AOE farming higher level mobs.
---
Im taking my hunter to maraudon as fast as possible.
---
Wirst tanking video i ever saw 😂
---
can you recommend a retri pvp spec? would it be something like this? https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxZVMtZVbItrcqo

**&lt;undecided&gt; Semi-HC [PVP] [A] **  🇪🇺 
---
**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
-	We are an international group of currently 40 people, consisting of various backgrounds. We have both (very) experienced and (very) inexperienced members.
---
-	We are looking to create a mature gaming community where everyone is valued and people support each other.
---
-	While it wasn’t common back in the day, we are open to hybrids and off-specs if people are willing to make them work.
---
-	Our goal is to clear all the content (again)
---
-	As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values. 
---
**Guild Structure**
---
-	We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
-	Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers. 
---
-	Reasoning for all important decisions are to be made public internally and are open for debate. 
---
**Raid information**
---
-	Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
-	Loot distribution system will be voted on by the majority before launch (leaning towards Loot Council)
---
-	While full optimization regarding buffs, potion etc. is not required, but people who put in the effort and support others will be rewarded accordingly
---
**About you**
---
-	No matter if you are a single person or represent a group, we are always glad to hear from you. 
---
-	Do you want to push damage meters and optimize but don’t have the time like you did 15 years ago? Then you’d find yourself right at home.
---
-	Do you just want to go through the content at your own pace and just want to have a nice community to play with? Then we‘d definitely suit you.
---
-	Do you just want to play something that you didn’t have the opportunity back then while not being treated as a second class citizen? Again, then this project is you’re looking for.
---
For any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to message me here or on discord. (tom#8446)

i wish i could find the pic of my old wow setup
---
i essentially had one of those pc desks with ny crt monitor and the tower.
---
i the  put a piece of wood on top of the tower/monitor and a second crt on top of that.
---
so basically vertical dual crt so i could look shit up on the second screen.
---
lol im not sure if you could even do that in software i bet i had to mouse off the side of one screen to get to the top one rofl
---
the massive lcd's we can get now are so good
---
&gt;Classic community is quite toxic
---
Wow there ?  
---
Based on what, are you making this assumption ?
---
Not everyone wins. I would *not* play classic if it had transmogs and I would instantly unsubscribe if it indroduced them. No matter the toggle or w/e mechanic.
---
I want to play an MMORPG, not that crap with transmogs, vanity mounts, vanity races, daily quests, achievements, raid tiers and so on. I don't even want to hear about those things because they turn me off so much.
---
It really was not passable for me. 
---
With the introduction of the draenei the way they were depicted in WoW:TBC in contrast to the WC3 draenei it made gnomes look *retarded*. Like full on helmet so they dont trip and smash their head open retarded.
---
The draenei had motherfockin' spaceships while the gnomes tinkered with malfunctioning parachutes and battle chicken.
---
Seconded, beautiful.
---
Ok. Priest in full bis with buffs have about 450 spirit. Human spirit would account for 22 additional spirit.
---
Mana regen formula for priest is 13 + ( Spirit / 4 ) per tick.
---
Therefor human spirit will give you roughly 5 mp5, or 1 mana per second in addition to 6 bonus heal if specced into the talent in deep holy.
---
It's entirely useless compared to fearwarding a DPS on trash or bosses for extra uptime. I agree with you that players should pick whichever race they want to play the most though, but thats besides the point when we are talking about comparing racials.

#&lt;Pertento&gt;

#EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE** ***with a social atmosphere***
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, **we may also try to vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule**:
---
Wednesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 - 24:00 **CET**
---
(With Monday as an additional day for progression nights)

The internet was lousy back then, so my friends and I only played in LAN mode and we took turns on who will play the dungeon master. I remember destroying everything with my unarmed monk. Such lovely times....
---
NPCs would instantly aggro you like normal, since the server always knew who you were. I remember a common usecase while leveling was actually simply hearthstoning out of a dangerous place while in shadowmeld/stealth, at virtually no risk. I didn't play a spellcaster nelf but there's some mind control videos where the priest simply casts mind control out of shadowmeld onto unsuspecting lowbies, from bridges or at the lava near molten core.
---
Apparently this is OPs attempt at humor.
---
**GLAMORAMA** **(Alliance EU - PVP) is recruiting!**
---
**Classic is coming! We are already over 30 people but still recruiting all classes!**
---
Finally, we will all be able to play the best game ever made. And we hope you will do it with us!
---
We are a group of friends who played the original vanilla wow from near launch up until patch 1.12. We want one more stab to **clear all raid content**, enjoy and compete in world and BG PVP and just mess around in Azeroth.
---
**Our background:**
---
We used to play in a server first guild, clearing everything from Hogger up to Four Horsemen in Naxx.
---
**What we offer:**
---
\-          Focused 40 man raiding Tuesdays and Thursdays at CET 20.00 -23.00
---
\-          Knowledgeable and experienced raid leading
---
\-          Balanced raid groups
---
\-          For those interested we will run 20-man PVE and PVP content on other days
---
**What we require of raiders:**
---
\-          Average attendance 1.5 times/week 40-man raids
---
\-          Suitable PVE spec, consumables and knowledge of encounters
---
Guild language is English.
---
We have no age requirements. Everyone is welcome to apply. We will not stand for any harassment or discrimination within the guild.
---
We want to create a guild for those who can commit to twice a week raiding. We **strongly** believe we can clear all raid content, including Naxxramas. We also believe it is important to not fall too far behind in progression as you risk losing players to other guilds. We thus aim to be **“geared and cleared”** of current raid tiers by the time the next raid tiers are released.
---
If you wish to join as a social or pvp player you are most welcome!
---
**Loot rules:** We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: [*https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing)

**We look forward to your application. Contact us on discord** [**https://discord.gg/92V5CCD**](https://discord.gg/92V5CCD) **, send us a message or comment in the thread if you have any questions.**
---
**Sincerely,**

Best tip on a fresh realm is just that. Get high level and get on looting rare materials. It'd be enough with 20 black lotus farmed over the first 3~ months and you'll be richer than 99% of classic players will ever be.
---
You can stealth mine too.   Like in the caves of wintergrasp.   Arcane crystals sell like hotcakes as everyone and their mom wants a legendary.
---
The outlands ruined it for me too.
---
I stayed on to game with friends, but the new gear was easily obtained and far out powered the hard earned dungeon gear i had.
---
Then i had to quit when i saw potals in dalaran.
---
There were so many portals... i lost immersion.
---
I tried to use dungeon finder, in order to remove travel from the gaming equation altogether, but the runs were robotic and impersonal.
---
Then you could just boost a lvl 100 character. Uuuuugggg, how is that fun?
---
Im not a #no changes guy.
---
I think some small QOL changes are ok.
---
But no TBC... ever

Moderate | PvE on PvP server | Based in the UK | Horde 
---
**About us:** 
---
Mok’ra! &lt;Guild&gt; is recruiting new members to join our core group of players in the upcoming Classic WoW. Our team has experienced members spanning across WoW’s timeline and we are looking for enthusiastic players to join us and create a tight-knit raiding community. Becoming part of &lt;Guild&gt; is an opportunity to play with others who share your passion for vanilla and want to be involved in the raiding scene. We’re also rolling up on a PvP server, despite our PvE goals. You might think that you’d rather roll on a filthy PvE server to do PvE, but in the words of a man far wiser than any of us, 
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
**Our Goals:** 
---
\- Upon the launch of Classic, we’ll be aiming to hit level 60 within a couple of months and start gearing up in dungeons. We understand this won’t be possible for everyone, so we will be lenient on this, and help people out where we can. However, we do expect people to be levelling regularly and making progress consistently, even if this is a little slower than ideal. 
---
\- We are planning on progressing through the end-game dungeons, then jumping into Molten Core and going from there, doing raids as they come. 
---
\- We aim to try our best and clear as much vanilla content as possible. The most important part is having fun, but also working as a team. It’s rarely “That one guys” fault every time and we will openly communicate to improve our strategy.
---
**Expectations:** 
---
\- A willingness to learn and do your best. 
---
\- Actually showing up! 
---
\- Putting in the effort to have what you need and turning up prepared. This is really important to ensure nobody is wasting the rest of the player’s time.
---
**Looking for:**
---
We will be showing preferences to melee DPS such as Arm/Fury Warriors, Rouges and also healers
---
**Schedule:** 
---
\- The days will be chosen closer to release. 
---
\- Time will be 7:00PM GMT and include a break for 10 minutes at 9:00PM to keep everyone at their best. 
---
We will be using Discord as our recruitment platform pre-release and as a communication hub throughout the game. Feel free to PM the Guild Leader (Orinus#1430) or Recruitment Officer (Trauzek#7247) for any queries and join our discord server: https://discord.gg/m2j9mgZ
---
The trees are speaking orcish!
---
Yes!
---
The toxicity of a game is highly influenced by the fact its free to play. All you have to do is lie on your age and therr you are 7-8 year olds can't even read or write properly but they can play fornigt, apex, pugb etc. Wow classis thanks to the fact you need to pay for a monthly subscription means you need to have a bank account and a card or acces to your parents cards. It will be toxic since the general population is going downhill mentally(antivax, feminiats, a million genders). We will have to see what modifications will blizz make to the original to make life easier. If they put it in as it was a lot will get bored real fast. You needed commitment in vanilla to do shit. 
---
That's almost exactly how I felt, except for that I loved TBC (but agree on no cool hub like IF to hang around in). I seriously almost cry if I watch blizzcon again today. 
---
Classic is here to stay baby! With RP-PvP servers plz!
---
I know, right?
---
This ine came with Rayman 1 bundled in, my first legit PC game... good times.
---
Classic WoW btw mode please
---
The one on the left is the youngest, yet he’s the one doing *gnomeregan*. What a legend.
---
Most importantly, it gives everyone some sort of a character. Some people prefer to level quite slow and run a lot of dungeons. All that awesome blue gear makes them loot better than the rest.
---
I still can't get over how many of these photos are of kids. I'd assumed everyone was at least older teenagers
---
Who the fuck cares just enjoy the meme asshole
---
Based on being on this subreddit for more than 5 minutes. The unsubstantiated hate towards retail players is a prime example of how pathetic parts of this community can be. 
---
You should have a stroke and die for not just enjoying the picture
---
**Loot rules:** We will use a DKP system with fixed prices. Read more about it here: *https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W9dx1pk3BY7ahdsmAVdlZFwfy0F6jISZs4hmRAojDx8/edit?usp=sharing*
---
Man, this looks fun as hell. Never played WoW in a lan setup (and I think as a working adult it's probably far, far too late..)
---
**South African Guild before Classic's launch**
---
I am looking to get in touch with fellow South Africans who are planning to play Classic WoW when it launches. I don't necessarily want to start a guild myself but rather start talking to other fellow South African players so we can decide which server we will be playing on.
---
I am also in two minds to play Resto Shaman or Hunter and knowing I am going to form part of a guild that has the intent to raid I will rather roll Shaman than hunter.
---
If anyone fellow South African players out there are already planning on forming a guild from day one and need a Resto Shaman healer to level with please message me.
---
I feel like part of this relaunch of Classic is to build new friendships and start over with a fresh community so I doubt they would do this. But you never know I suppose!
---
I don't think the colour matches.
---
I would recommend you look into these specs:
---
For leveling: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbuL0hZVibzV0z](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbuL0hZVibzV0z)  (18/21/0) +12 available talent points left to 60 to spend wherever you want. It's an elemental/enhancement hybrid build for leveling, combines shocks with melee for a steady flow of dmg output and flurry uptime.
---
For lvl 60:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zAcMqZZxcIz0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zAcMqZZxcIz0xo)  (30/0/21) great allround hybrid elemental/resto spec. No ghost wolf or full resto as requested though. Tip: nature swiftness can be used on offensive spells too when you are farming or PvP'ing.
---
What you are asking for specifically would be this I suppose, but I don't recommend it: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zycMVZx0bZxcfz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zycMVZx0bZxcfz)
---
You miss out on key 31 or 21 talents at 60. For leveling, if you really want to level as elemental, do it at 39. I'm pretty sure that you really need the Lightning Mastery talents which reduce casttime for lightning bolt and chain lightning.
---
It's not gonna be that easy to render on most demanding resolution/framerates. 4k 144 FPS or multimonitor setups will require a pretty modern PC.
---
Why are you being self-deprecating? Are you all right mate? Is this a cry for help?
---
sick bruhh!
---
Well for one, the link is full of pop ups so some people probably went straight to the comment.
---
Haha, that was our lucky Buddha that were supposed to help us with rolls! A massive dump would have probably worked just as good though!
---
That music isn't very paladiny.
---
WotLK has its flaws... glaring flaws, that I hope can be mended when Blizzard revisits it. But the Lich King storyline is so enthralling from start to finish. The ending was slightly cheesy but that didn’t stop it from being a rewarding experience. 
---
It's much easier than these guys had written. Just wait in shadowmeld until unsuspecting hordie comes close and then MC them into lava/off the cliff.
---
The draenei should never have been a playable race
---
Most probably were but a parent is less likely to barge into a teenagers room to snap a photo.
---
Is there badass looking gear in Vanilla? 
---
 I'm not new to leveling but new to how the end game is in vanilla since I never finished leveling to 60
---
Yeah, I know that you can do that. But if you could actually stay in the invisibility while shadowmelding it can be easily a double kill mind controll instead of getting CCed by another guy if you try to perform something like that.
---
i have to admit, the caverns of time idea was a really cool one.  that was one thing i did like about &lt;whichever expansion that was, i cant actually remember cos i only ever played vanilla and wotlk for a serious amount of time&gt;
---
Same boat. I hear all these people wanting tbc legacy servers. Hell no.
---
What if there is no option left to flip the coin again? Do I just stay sad? 
---
I wouldnt have minded if they were the ugly folks you were helping seizing the black temple. Atakama with his razor blades was pretty cool, but these guys were more like assassin with a pinch of shamanism. All could stealth and some could use abilities like chain lightning, spirit beasts and chain heal.
---
same. i started wow in bc when i was 18. really started playing videogames with 15. this still feels strange to me. dont want to sound like a grumpy old man, but i dont think i want my daughter to play something like wow in that age.
---
Think the idea is that you can mog to look good during leveling
---
Who hurt you?
---
I think it's fairly obvious all races are going to work as priest, there's just some races which are much better than others. That's all.
---
I was sure of it, the writing style is absolutely theirs!  
---
I don't know why, but each magazine had its own "identity" in the way they wrote.
---
Your experience is exactly the same as mine. Flying mounts ruined the game and leaving Azeroth for different lands was a total mistake. I kept going back to WoW in hopes that it would have returned to its former glory, however the same problems still persisted.....Instant gratification systems that ruined immersion.
---
The way I look at it is that if the game gives you an opportunity to use something to get an advantage, using that something isn't gimmicky, it's simply making the best of what is available to you.
---
It's the same thing as using flashbangs, smokes and molotovs to take a bomb site in counter strike, rather than just hoping to win every aim duel. It's like using wards, sentries and smokes in dota to gain a vision advantage and control larger parts of the map than your opponent, etc.
---
Same thing can be said for other things in wow too, I remember people being looked down upon for using free action potions when running the flag in WSG, but why? If you're running flags, a free action potion can absolutely make the difference between getting away and dying, so why not use it?
---
Best in sloth. Lol
---
1% hit isnt going to break the game. caster are still going to be shit compared to melee in stage 1.
---
Among all the priests you've had in your guild and applied to join, what's roughly the percentage of alliance priests that are dwarves?
---
Uh, you just needed to know where to find people to inspect if you wanted. PVPers were gathered all around arena masters and BG queue NPCs. Raiders were always either near AH or bank to get the consumables/mats for raids, less geared people were around Badge vendor and daily quest ethereals.
---
You're not aware. You're willfully ignorant. 
---
tltr lots of moaning

I'm currently waiting for the "How to Move Guide". I'm hoping Icisoioslilsol puts it out before launch so I know how to move around in the game before then. Fingers crossed.
---
What hate? They say they dont like retail and that theres no comunity. Which is true.
---
They can also say retail players are dumb for liking retail.
---
If you consider that toxic, then you have been poisoned by virtue signaling snowflakes that consider different opinions as toxic. Cause thats all it is
---
The post is about the priest racials in PvE(raids). He said that Starshards is bad in raids because you use up a debuff slot. That debuff slot could be put to better use by a warlock. How useful starshards is outside of raids wasn’t the topic of the post. 
---
Link it, and Link other pictures of your character 
---
Depends completly on your enemies. 
---
The biggest "Problems" of ret is the cooldowns. You can do great stuff, but only if your Major cooldowns are available - bubble, stun, rep, freedom. Without These, you are basically a chasing NPC autoattacking the enemies for some damage.
---
I suggest to use engineer to have some more cooldowns Overall. It also synergieses with the stunned damage Bonus for SoC.
---
Good find, man!
---
I agree with everything except the "participation trophy generation." There are plenty of older people who have played wow and helped shape it into what it is today. 
---
Fingers crossed for RP-PVP &lt;3
---
It's a good and a bad idea at the same time.
---
It will be super great for nostalgia and easier to find your old friends.
---
But it will be impossible to have as many serveur with max population. So how do you merge servers ? Using the old server names already means Cross Realm
---

Was a Dwarf Priest in Vanilla, didn't make it to 60 before BC.
---
Got a list of specs for Classic that I want to try:
---
Prot Paladin
---
Arcane Mage
---
NE Holy Priest
---
Oddball Rogue and Warrior 
---
I remember seeing a warlock soloing some HC dungeon bosses in tbc. There was some walljumping and "clever use of game mechanics. "
---
I instantly rolled a warlock. Don't remember which dungeon though and I've tried to find the video in later years but no luck. 
---
Clownarmor is the way it should be (with occational cool sets).
---
Mogging ruined the feeling of progressing your character in a aesthetic way.
---
Sometimes your character looked like shit, and you had to just accept it, but sometimes every gear piece you had on, just complimented eachother and made your character look awesome. 
---
Nowadays every gear piece is trying to look as edgy as possible, and colorful pieces are long gone.
---
God, I miss the times when everyone looked like adventurers instead of world-saving heroes.

**The Philosophy**

We're a guild where the leadership have experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. 
---
However, we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.  
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm first and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.

**What we expect of you**

We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. We expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay. However, we’re always here to help you improve.    
---
We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release, on our very own Test Server. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release.    
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule** 
---
(GMT+1) Wednesdays 18-23 
---
Thursdays 18-23 Mondays 
---
18-23 
---
Obviously we don’t expect to need all of the raid days to clear the content in the early stages. Most likely only one or two might be used. But when we start needing more days, these are most likely the times. During new content release we expect to raid when servers open up   
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or an officer from the guild. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge! [https://discord.gg/vwhNZdj](https://discord.gg/vwhNZdj)

I know right? I see all these pictures of kids. Like actual kids. When vanilla was released i was a teenager. I feel like i have a lot in common with people who played vanilla, but then i see pictures like this and it's just a little strange. 
---
You see a lot of those posts now with people saying how they played vanilla and they're like 22 now. I can't imagine how many little kids played back then, it's incredible.
---
It's funny to think that today a 25 year old and a 30 year old are almost the same. But back then there is no way i would have played with a 10 year old.
---
Really love your content Thraex! I'm perpetually surprised that your channel doesn't get more love; your dungeon videos in particular are a great resource, and I really enjoy the no commentary runs you do. Keep up the great work!
---
Different opinions:
---
Player A likes retail. Player B likes classic. They respect the fact that people like different stuff and don’t insult one another for it.
---
Not the same as:
---
“hurr durr retail players are &lt;generic invective&gt; because they enjoy retail instead of classic”
---
I don't really understand what you're saying. If you want improved ghostwolf for levelling then just spec into enhancement. Speccing into elemental or resto while levelling is useless unless you either want to only run dungeons (in which case you dont need imp. ghostwolf), or you really like the idea of playing elemental shaman while levelling (have mercy on your soul).
---
You can easily heal all dungeons as any spec while levelling. Just go enhancement and keep some healing gear with you.
---
Probably not hunter. Too competitive at end game for spots and the like. 
---
battle royal man bad
---
Bops and judgment. Oh look it came back. Also good luck taking agro in the first place. Only thing that is hard, is taking aggro of a tank. Which  should also be doable with bops. Also can you bops and use limited invul potion after each other?
---
&gt; But it's not like they have many other options, unless they made the new races' minimum level equal to that of the expansions.
---
IMHO, that should have been the way.  
---
We already have DK starting at 55th, and DH starting at 98th.  
---
A DK's starting level is only correct now, since you can land in Northrend already at 58th, while before it was too low, but Blizzard didn't want people to have it "easy".  
---
To have vendor NPCs in Dazar'Alor being level 110+, while my Zandalari troll starts at 20th, is more than ridiculous.
---
Warlock or Druid are my suggestions. Warlock for easy leveling and end game viability. Druid for versatility.
---
📜 **&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an **EU Alliance** guild that intends to roll on a **PvP** server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
***What to expect***
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. We hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week, and additional nights may come into play after launch. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out &amp; play internet games once or twice a week for fun. Additionally, we host our own vanilla server, but we don't plan to raid on it, as it is just there for us to jump on and have some fun now and then, and also test out the classes and make our final decisions until launch.
---
We are currently accepting Raid Leader applications!
---
**Raid dates:** Thursday --&gt; Tuesday
---
**Raid times:** 7:50 PM GMT

Feel free to PM me for any questions you might have - Join our discord server! [https://discord.gg/2C6gJZw](https://discord.gg/2C6gJZw)
---
I'm admitting throughout the thread that Fear Ward is better. But I am willfully ignorant. Your train of thought must be wonderful.
---
Everyone being Fear Warded saves in Ony 3sec (duration + First time everyone) + maybe 1-2sec over the course of the fight from single dps in case of 5 dwarfs. In Nefarian that's 4 sec + 1-2 sec. 
---
I am pretty sure a human rogue with swords saves more time over the course of a raid night than a dwarf priest in 1 or 2 encounters.
---
But please, go on. Tell me how everyone just needs to be dwarf priest and everything else absolutely sucks, but that dwarf rogue is absolutely fine because only the most extreme minmaxxers want humans.
---
Dayum the dude at the right must feel very special having a widescreen monitor
---
Oh damn right. Anytime a game more movie starts exploring time travel / wormholes and all that, I know for a fact that the story is going to end up screwed up and unenjoyable. There are very few exceptions to this.
---
This was pretty awesome
---
I played all vanilla and tbc on a rig with such low specs, I can not recall the exact numbers and models but the end result was I raided and pvp'd pretty hardcore on:
---
- 512 by 384 resolution
---
- everything turned down to lowest settings
---
- constant 5-10 fps in raids and capital cities
---
- 150 ms ping which was a "good day" for me, would go into 300ms range on evenings and weekends (dial up connection)
---
The desire to game was that great that such small inconveniences did not bother me much.
---
Now, in honour of my 14 year old self I am sitting on alienware 17 with specs that can run anything released today on max settings without a hitch on broadband of 50 mbit.
---
My body is ready, reddit!
---
Please just allow people who want TBC to have it. I've seen this so many times now, people are really against Blizzard making TBC servers. Some of us love TBC, and I don't think it's fair that we get vanilla and not TBC. I'm all for 1.13 too, but we can have both.
---
I dont know, i'd just hate it if in a couple of years this subreddit starts getting into a pointless war because Blizzard is thinking of making TBC servers. At that point there is no difference between the retail players who hated the idea of vanilla and you.
---
I really love TBC. It has the class balance that vanilla didn't. Sure it had some bad things like flying mounts, and in my opinion arenas, but it was mostly good. Vanilla had bad things too, every expansion does.
---
I didn't even know there were widescreens back then. I didn't have one until wrath oO. That kid must've been spoiled af
---
Still, imagine the amount of tickets they'd get from people that still accidentally went to classic wow, ignored the login screen, and then complain that their characters arent there. I have no doubt in my mind there will be plenty. 
---
Sure it is. The real question is why do you feel insulted by it?
---
Also, you just came here and insulted everyone by calling them toxic. You just did the very thing you claim to be against
---
Yeah, wotf is good but in the end used relatively rarely, even more so with plague, as the mana cost is too insane to actively use it.
---
How do you farm black lotus on Classic when it respawns like once a day? 
---
Id say 15 mins is pushing it. As a horde with WF you really should be a LOT faster. Theres like 85 guilds in the biggest "fresh" server guilds that have posted logs that do it under 10 minutes. Fastest ones are doing it in 3-4 minutes.
---
There are so many things you can do differently, when doing it in vanilla the 20% rush was really a tricky thing. Now, i dont even notice the rush, because mages and people with engineers kill those so fast that they never even get to the healer area. Only thing that can make you fail if mages are idiots and manage to sheep the tank.
---
Most memorable thing about nefarious was doing it in vanilla, cant remember if it was before we got first kill or after that. Got feared in phase 2 for some reason and due bug in the rocks in the area, dropped through the floot. I could see my guidies fighting him while i dropped down ... a looooooong way. 
---
To each their own. :p
---
Coming from WC3 i felt the faction conflict was terribly contrived and kinda stupid - Especially with the random faction assignment that was going on with some of the races.
---
I didn't play on a PVP server though, coming from the competitive FPS scene MMORPG PVP felt...dumb lol (No offense and i actually do like to PVP from time to time).
---
You're going to BOP your dps? So you're going to cause a massive dps loss just to make up for the fact your class doesn't have a taunt? Really?
---
What exactly was the scam? I dont think you know what that word means.
---
Yo atyon, thanks again for the feedback about the tooltips! I've implemented it now and will do as well for future WoW content.  [https://radmag.nl/games/mijn-top-9-beste-pvp-items-in-world-of-warcraft-classic/](https://radmag.nl/games/mijn-top-9-beste-pvp-items-in-world-of-warcraft-classic/)  Much obliged! 
---
My god, imagine reading this and getting hyped for wows release, only for it to come out 3 years later.
---
I guess we're lucky classic is coming so soon
---
lawl. kids! vanilla came out when i was 20.
---
I never used the word toxic, only you did. 
---
How is what I'm describing side-grades? None of what I said put one piece of gear for a spec on the same level as another piece of gear for that spec.
---
&gt; calling players selfish for wanting to Play X,Y or Z is just daft
---
&gt; There is nothing wrong with hard truths told in an constructive manor! 
---
Can you make up your mind?
---
Moooommmmm pottyyy
---
Vanilla wow PvP isn't about the arena, so, your tools are not limited by the arena rules. You can use whatever items you want (even a quest reward back on lvl 9 from Sen'jin village that made you root enemies can change the ending result), whatever consumables and trinkets you want(some of them have 30+ minute cd). Classes have core abilities like you've mentioned WL's death coil or Pyroblast from PoM Pyro mage that you need to counter or stun chain of rogue that if you can break via potion (or trinket/ability if your class allow it) you can shift the tide of the fight. Does the priest have no chance against hunter because of mana burning poison? Just bring a bunch of Antivenom/Jungle remedy and fuck him up as a shadow priest or drink limited inv potion if he is BM during enrage. Vanilla is all about tools that you and your enemies have in your bags and how well you can use them, not only abilities of your character.
---
Human paladin dead in combat leveling as a undead warrior trying to recover his holy power
---
I don't see the way those two are remotely linked ... Is calling someone selfish remotely constructive? Is it remotely helpful to that players question? 
---
It isn't. 
---
It's important people are informed that YES Ret Paladin isn't good. That doesn't mean people should be convinced to play what the masses want.
---
To be fair, that only really applies to challenge mode sets(unless you paid for a carry) and mythic raid sets when they are current.
---
He pointed it out. They said BLIZZLIKE when it wasn't. Most of it was wrong. All private servers have wrong values, shit the spell resistances on bosses and enemies has NEVER been correct, therefore making content way easier than it used to be.
---
But but but "Wotlk Naxx was harder than vanilla!"
---
"People generally don't transmog their leveling gear since that's a waste of money"? Are you serious? Players in BfA are absolutely rolling in gold, thousands and usually hundreds of thousands and often millions of it. Most have the Grand Expedition Yak so they can immediately transmog when they get a new quest reward. 
---
Such accurate
---
That honestly used to be my dream as a kid. Playing WoW with my IRL friends. But I was the only one out of my friend's circle with a well enough family to pay for a subscription, let alone a PC just for their kid. 
---
Your edit is a pointless strawman.
---
You are assuming th dps is melee. And you're assuming the dps even CAN take aggro off you.
---
To do a pointless strawman myself. What if the taunt gets reisted? 
---
It was introduced in TBC with Durnholde keep dungeon and Hyjal 25man raid.
---
I mean, dwarf mage was in beta. It's not like it was a new thing when they did add it.
---
Sorry, you called them pathetic. My point stands
---
I’d like a guide. This method of leveling sounds like a great alternative to waiting on respawns. 
---
&gt;Do you guys share the same things across multiple classes?
---
Im often surprised by my own mind, really. I wanna Keep things the same for different characters to make it easier remember. Like no matter which class, interupt is always on ^. 2 is the Basic attack for every class. 
---
Frost/Freball as mage (depending on spec), 
---
Sinister Strike as rogue, 
---
bloodthirst as fury - Mortal strike however would be on 1 for me. I dont know why, im not strange, you are strange, go away.
---
It kinda also bummers me, that like you 1 is blink as mage. Charge? Lol fuck you, thats on &gt;, same like intercept.
---
Really strange Thing is, that all that hotkeys for all classes were kinda clear for me when I seriously started playing back in wotlk. Leveling up my shadow it was completly obvious to me, that Fear was on &gt;, my main ability mind flay is on R and mind blast on 2. 3 and 4 were dots. 1? ... yes.
---
I FUCKING DONT KNOW WHY BUT THATS HOW IT IS FOR ME.
---
When seeing other peoples Interface ist incrdibly bugging me that they have different hotkeys for some spells. Its weird, im weird. 
---
Gosh I cant wait for classic.
---
&gt;  Is it remotely helpful to that players question?
---
Telling people it's selfish to intentionally worsen the experience for other players for their own subjective "benefit" *is* constructive.
---
this ikea bed omg i had the same.
---
PVE realm players: \*crickets\*
---
PVP realm players: F Yeah!!!
---
I too can say any shit i want in video descriptions
---
He's an asshole for pvp'ing on a pvp server? Next you'll tell me RP'ers are assholes for RP'ing on an RP realm.
---
Haha yeah, we were jealous! Also notice the wooden chairs vs the comfy one! 
---
They are not worsening other people's experience! There is no forced groups in WoW... If other people do not want to play with these people, they do not have to! - Why on earth does everyone keep acting like "Holy shit this guys playing Prot Paladin, now I can't clear content
---
 because he MUST somehow be in my group" 
---
*facepalm*
---
Can confirm, I was 9 years old when I first touched vanilla. In fact almost every boy in my year at school around those times all graduated from RuneScape to WoW so there was probably shit loads of actual kids running around with you. I remember being very shocked and nervous the first time I hopped onto vent to find out that almost everyone was an adult as I just assumed that everyone would have been the same age as me.
---
Totally get that! Uniqueness in hunter pets are really cool ;)
---
If I look at the picture of these dudes I can just imagine the amount of shit they would've caused being out in the streets rather than hanging out in Azeroth :)
---
I'm 40 years old now and returning to WoW when classic launches. My oldest daughter is 9 years old now and I wouldn't mind her playing WoW. Unfortunately she isn't interested in gaming.
---
&gt; 2 is the one I spam, 3 next important and 4 after that one
---
Thats totally bugging me. I kinda noticed how its easiest for me to press 2 (mostly main ability) and then 4. 3 is actually the most annoying one to press for me there. Usually I dont put major abilities on 3.
---
There's Seal Fate as people already mentioned, however the class is still reliant on cooldowns as a whole.
---
I just Rebound R (whisper to las Person) to Z to have R available for abilites.
---
"comfy"
---
You  have a chance in 1on2 if you play well enough on most classes,  not only 1v2 but 1v3, It honestly much more than in wotlk. 
---
you just aint good, so you don't know boundaries yet, and what you cant do and what can, and how approach the each situation classes and combination of clases and power of the classes.
---
Thats how pvp goes, not only in vanilla, first you don't feel the boundaries and die all the time, than you slowly learn strength weakness and power of each class, how to approach each situation, what to do where you will die or not, and you can evaluate the situation properly.
---
trusts me the outplay potential and capabilities in "1 vs many" is much higher than in wotlk. in wotlk everyone is goddamn tanky, and has abilities to survive. so its much much harder to pull off. 
---
honestly i also started playing wow in the middle of wotlk, and had a similar impression of the vanilla pvp as you said, you just need your brain to adapt and learn the game, and what you can and can't do. 
---
aswell as more gear.
---
Yeah, makes me sad that it's a common thing. I play retail, I played the original Vanilla and have played every expansion to date. I will once again play Vanilla (to a lesser extent).
---
Both games have their pros and cons, some of which will impact how many play the game. Me for example, I have no chance of keeping up and getting gear like I did back then; job, other half, and a kid incoming makes that impossible.
---
I recent played a vanilla server and, having not played it since the original incarnation, it was a massive kick in the balls as to how different the game is, and that will put a lot of the players off who are seeing it for the first time having played retail. Hell even those who've played it before, like me, it is difficult to get used to. 
---
I guarantee a lot of people will quit very early on. They probably *will* make it past getting killed in two hits by a level 3 caster mob, because it's new and a novelty (that and the thousands of players nuking them all). But things like Echo Isles if they don't group up - which tis a good thing about the game btw - will definitely cut numbers. Grinding in barrens for zevra hooves, plainstrider beaks, raptor heads, and the centaur things will also cut players (this is actually where I gave up my nostalgia trip, about L17) . They'll get bored (I did), especially when they click on and realise quest loot isn't shared and grouping isn't quicker in that regard. 
---
Hunters if solo will be bitching about their lack of pet and how annoying it is to kill stuff. Gotta learn to stutter step if they've not done it before. When they get pets? Ooh feeding, that's cool. Until their 3rd or 4th pet runs away because they keep forgetting.
---
Drinking and eating a lot because of high mob damage/low regen, another time consuming/boring part of the game people won't like the amount of downtime. 
---
That's not to say those things are bad to clarify. They're brilliant for what they are in the style of the game, but they will be a huge cockblock for people who aren't used to it. 
---
Anyway, time to wipe, sorry for the essay! 
---
YES EXCACTLY!!!
---
I cant understand how People can unbind them, but well ... everyone has its own taste &lt;.&lt;
---
Then I mocking blow, yet another snap aggro ability warriors get that paladins don't have.  
---
Paladins are great tanks for 5mans or off tanking large packs off mobs.  But are severely handicapped when it comes to main tanking. 
---
My wife and I play it on our computers that aren't even a foot apart.  We'll be duo leveling together.  It's never to late for anything.
---
Although I have QWEASD for movement (not rebinding QE for abilities), Im mostly moving around with mouse (pressing both for movement or rightclick for strafing). That kinda allows me to press shift and whatever I want inbetween.
---
&gt; I moved with ESDF instead of AWSD
---
I dont even know what to say about that.
---
Straight out of the South Park episode lol
---
That's an heirloom!  Hold onto it!
---
I hate night elves with passion. I loved nothing more than to annoy them in goldshire.
---
We all know what you filthy elves were doing in front of innocent trees. 
---
You are fooling no one. 
---
I can agree the lack of taunt makes things unresonably complicated in raids. But not impossible for those brave enough to do so
---
Spot on brother!
---
Depends on the guild but make your intentions clear and be a good healer and you'll likely find a spot in alt raids. At least that's my advice.
---
Have fun man. I’m sure some people will play with you. But good players won’t. Don’t be mad. 
---
Lol no, but actually yes.
---
I was 15 back in 2005 when it was released in europe. So I guess I was older then these guys, but I was still very young.
---
Ah man. Good ole days. Prior to this before PCs were like 100% household items my buddy and me would play D2 in shifts since he was the only one with a PC he got for free from school for being an idiot. Lol. 
---
Why would you say retail players are dumb for liking a game? It has its problems (I play it, trust me I know), Vanilla also has many problems (I played it, again I know) and many people won't like it just as some people who prefer classic don't enjoy retail. 
---
Insulting people because of their preference is why the word toxic is being used above. Genuinely what does it matter? It [toxic] is not a bad scary word that will hurt anyone's feelings, it's a description. There's no "it's not toxic you're just a snowflake" in that. You can't defend insulting someone and saying it's not toxic behaviour, where does it stop? "hah you're a retard good thing your nan died of cancer before you were born so she didn't see you! Oh btw not toxic you're just a snowflake".
---
Everyone likes different things. Some people like pvp, some like PvE, some like collecting things, some like RPing, some like doing those things in a different setting, or with different abilities, or have different amounts of time to play, or don't want to play with people who can fly, or don't want to play a game without flying... Many reasons. 
---
A true relic.
---
It had to have been around 50% of the players that were under 12 at that time.
---
Why are you acting they aren't impacting you if you don't group with them?
---
But if you assume you don't have to group with them, you're now harming their experience by telling them it's okay to play something trash as they wont get group invites.
---
Hence why I said you farm it over 3~ months, since it's hard to get a hold on. 
---
And watching Netflix on your third screen.
---
No it doesn’t, calling someone out for bad behavior is not equivalent to insulting someone for having a different opinion. 
---
MOM, BATHROOM!
---
My brothers and I would wake each other up during the night "it's your turn" and if you didn't get up you had 2 sessions
---
I recently leveled a shaman. Healed all dungeons as full enhancement. If you want to go Elemental i would just put all the points there and not go for NS or imp. Ghostwolf. That being said NS is really good for world pvp.
---
From what I understand you will be able to choose to use the new graphics engine, models and textures, so that hardware might come in handy still.
---
Are you? Your harming there experience by letting them play what they want to play... Maybe they just want to play Ret Paladin, and maybe they just want advice on that subject. 
---
If they ask you a question on whether or not they get a group then sure, but why does this argument always turn into "You ain't playing with us" when all they are asking is how to play what they want to play. 
---
Sure hope so. Nochanges is good and all. But I like nice graphics. 
---
Check out the Mido videos from back in the day, I think they were 1-3? I always enjoyed and learned a lot from his montages compared to players like Grim that just popped AR + BF and killed people in 1 stun. Sure there is some of that in the videos, but also harder matchups. 
---
OOT, but my secondary choice would have been to play resto Shaman, mostly with a build like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZqbb0xxZE0htV0qo
---
This plus enginnering and the proper gear would possibly be a good PvP and PvE spec, very defensive and utility orientated. I haven't tested it unfortunately, but given how strong Shamans can be vs. caster dps in PvP, I feel like the physical mitigation would increase the survivability a lot.
---
Enhancement in raids if it is used at all is brought along simply to buff the melee group with wind fury totem and use the nightfall axe to keep the debuff up. 
---
You’re best off raiding as resto and rolling for your offspec pvp gear but as you said you would be competing with melee for gear on their main specs. 
---
Have you considered elemental pvp? Enhancement isn’t even that great in pvp due to the inconsistency of wind fury procs and you could have an easier time getting spell damage mail gear as fewer people will be rolling on it. 
---
Shamans usually pvp using a 30/0/21 hybrid spec for burst damage, utility in the form of totems/purge and offheals. 
---
Yeah, I agree.  I may end up starting my own guild to avoid it.
---
Anything is "viable". Is it good or competitive? No, not really. It wasn't until tbc that enhance did decent damage and also brought great buffs to a melee group. In Vanilla a resto shaman can drop WF totem while actually contributing greatly to heals. Resto is simply better in every way. However, that doesn't mean you can't do it. There were be plenty of guilds around allowing unconventional builds in the core roster. If nothing else, you could always respec to enhance for PvP and just heal raids.
---
Man I wish I could erase playing WoW so I can relive it again...
---
Love the stack of coke cans on the desk shelf, it reminds me of going to the local LAN cafe and pulling WoW all-nighters hyped up on caffeine and sugar before I could afford my first gaming PC.
---
&gt;I dont know, i'd just hate it if in a couple of years this subreddit starts getting into a pointless war because Blizzard is thinking of making TBC servers.
---
Unless Blizzard makes changes to the game, in a couple of years both this subreddit and the game will be dead so no worries about that.
---
When people come looking for advice on how to do certain things, sometimes the answer is *don't*, do something different instead.
---
True, that's why I did it only once :D
---
Had a three man LAN a few weeks ago playing WoW on a pserver and we are all around 30, one of the guys i had never met outside the game before. So it's not too late yet! :)
---
I also wanna play a goblin demon hunter, hoppfully blizzard adds that. Cant wait to fly over ogrimmar with my spectral drake this summer!
---
i think the only good thing about TBC for me was that talent trees were still interesting and the slight additions still had whatever it was that made vanilla good.  apart from that, and i suppose the beautiful music/ landscapes of outland, it kinda killed wow for me too  
---
in fact i joined TBC late.  I stopped playing wow and i told my friend at the time "an expansion will ruin the game, like it did with Planetside".  I was being pretty biased but i guess i was kinda right in the end haha
---
you're absolutely right about outland dividing the world.  i suppose it was an unfortunate necessity but it really did just leave the old cities as ghost towns and considering they were hubs of the regular world it made everything feel dead and lifeless.
---
shattrath was a horribly ugly city that was really big and spread out and just sort of felt like a place you had to put up with.  kinda like Orgrimmar but much worse haha
---
SW, IF, TB, Darn, UC are all gorgeous and thematic and feel alive (though darnassus is quiet because it's far away... but that fits it's aesthetic).  I was alliance in vanilla but mostly played horde on various private servers so i am hyped to be back in SW and IF when classic arrives
---
You might be better off posting his question in today’s pinned guild recruitment thread at the top of the subreddit
---
Yes, but if someone has set sights on class/race/spec - dismissing that at selfish, pointless and stupid decision making is just down right ridiculous 
---
Which is half of the posts I see on the sub Reddit. 
---
You can advice someone in how to play X, Y or Z and answer their questions. But unless their question pertains to CHANGING one of those then it's not required info. 
---
Current WoW is pretty dead so I don't know how many changes we want Blizzard to make.
---
Luckily i dont really give a shit if 10,000,000 or 10,000 people play this game, as long as i get to play it thats all i want.
---
Thanks :)
---
Are you the reddit police or something
---
Raiding as Enhancement will feel like trying to swim up a waterfall. Just raid as Resto and pick up an Enhancement set as you go if you really want it. Resto i really good in pvp aswell.
---
Same transition for me. Was playing Runescape in 2003 / 2004 (grade 3 / 4 in primary school), before transitioning to WoW. So I would have been 10 - 11 years old when I started up.
---
But bad behavior is subjective. And you decided to add an insult to the end because you somehow felt you were justified to do so.
---
Have you ever considered that private server players have been abused for YEARS for simply wanting to play vanilla?
---
They've been called every insult under the sun for not liking retail. Are they not alowed to call out the bad behaviour of retail players?
---
People dissagree, sometimes agressively. If you cant handle that, you should stay out of public discourse. Not demand that everyone adheres to your idea of what an argument should look like.
---
Some arguments are nice, some are not. 
---
Gz m8, that’s ludicrous amounts of wrong.
---
It's just a WotF vs shadowguard-blackout combo+ hex dichotomy. 
---
DP is likely gone if the target has a way of cleansing (either by his own spell, an ally or just a consumable, quite common among PvPers with stuff like the jungle remedy) and the other spell (touch of weakness) is procced only in melee (compared to hex, which can be applied to *anyone* since it's an actual debuff, no procs required) and it has a single chance of blackout proc (compared to shadowguard's 3).
---
The unique troll spells are more reliable. Racials, though, favor UD despite the usual lack of alliance locks (so WotF is there more for countering spriests AoE fear bombing or warriors' equivalent). So it is completely debatable even not taking into account the "long" cds. 
---
The 30/0/21 build is really good at 60 for PvP. And you can start leveling ele at 39 when you can put 30 points into ele. There are ele/enh hybrid specs that can be good (they prioritize mana efficiency). But what you’re asking for is tough to pull off. You can’t really be all three effectively. 
---
Defcamp and Melderon have a bunch of videos on leveling shamans; I suggest watching some of those. https://youtu.be/KwKBo6BnHe8
---
Elemental could be fun and easier to equip, but they went oom after 3/4 spells or so.
---
And a friend is going to play druid so if i have a healer behind me but im oom... :S
---
That's why i ask for enhancement.
---
This is asking for a movie ala Goonies.
---
&gt;he got for free from school for being an idiot  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Hahaha
---
I’m of the opposite opinion completely. What matters is if the abilities themselves are distinctive from all others. If so, it’s unique enough to be interesting and fresh. More than just that, how the abilities interact with the raid encounter itself makes each ability play out differently. The last raid I seriously did is black rock foundry. Every boss there had its own unique flavour that made each and every one fun to play, even the easier ones, especially since you’ll be doing different things each boss, whatever role
---
The first punch I threw at someone was at my older brother because he didn't let me level my deathknight in 2008
---
Yeah but how do you farm it? Run around on those high-level zones hoping to find one? I wouldn't call that farming.
---
To be fair leveling as ele is pretty good after level 40
---
Looks like big bro gets the nice screen and little bro gets the CRT.
---
No, picking a class/race/spec simply because it isn't best is down right ridiculous.
---
I think for me its a hard choice between Priest, Rogue or Mage. I think i might do priest because it'll be easy to level and easy to get groups
---
You could just go with HoTW and be okayish healer and okayish at feral stuff (like tanking). Some raid AQ40 with that spec. Obviously not good enough when you are progressing through a raid and there is a lack of HPS coming from the healers.
---
In 1.13 it would be cool to start adding the areas like quelthalas my hyjal etc and even the belfs/draeni into the world without the need to add outland/flying etc. Hell down the line they could add dks maybe as a class. We fight dks in vanilla like we do all the other classes, so while I never played one myself, it would be an interesting add without ruining the spirit of the game
---
&gt; Players in BfA are absolutely rolling in gold
---
Unless you're raiding or running high m+ keys. In which case you spend hundreds of thousands of gold just on battle potions. 
---
&gt;  In WotLK I always had a feeling that with most of the classes I have a chance 1on2 if I play well enough. (for example nuke one target, cc the other one, reset fight)
---
So, it's fine when you nuke a target while cc'ing the other thus winning a 2v1, but it's not fine when you are nuked in a 1v1?
---
Don't you think this is a bit contradictory?
---
So because someone like to play Night Elf over a Dwarf, or a Human over a Gnome.... They are ridiculous. 
---
Your part of the problem. That's all from me.
---
I don’t know, I think most people would agree that insulting someone due to them having a different taste in games is bad behavior. 
---
Wouldn’t you?
---
Thanks guys for the answers, yeah i probably end up as resto.
---
I really like being a healer in pve so no problem.
---
Just little bit harder to equip for pvp.
---
&gt; I’m confused by your statement of most people not knowing about key bindings, it’s always been easy to let bond even using the default UI and Bartender existed during Vanilla 
---
Haha, you don't realize how noobish people were. Like 30% of players back then Keyboard turned, despite it being fairly obvious it's way better to use the mouse/strafe/combination of these. Keybinds were a step above. The thing is, it's not only that Vanilla was new ; great many people were literally knew to PC gaming. Not that much because games didn't exist on PC back then ; more because many people didn't afford a PC, or straight down didn't need it, and there was often only a family computer at home for the youngest players. It's hard to imagine from today's perspective, but they simple idea that such thing as keybinds or moving with a mouse was possible wouldn't come to the mind of a good chunk of the comunity back then. And I'm not even exaggerating.
---
Then again, it depends on the generation you're from. Some people had more contact with gaming/MMORPGs because they were born in the right era and were in touch with that since childhoods ; others didn't.
---
&gt; And some of what you say isn’t true. Back in Vanilla TONS of us used things like Thottbot for various things 
---
I have not said that :( Of course many people used databases, but it's not even comparable to what exists today. If you're a guy who played Vanilla and who thinks figuring out keybinds back then was easy, I'm also pretty certain you do not represent the average player of that time. And that you played mostly with people who had a similar knowledge to yours, hence not that much with noobs.
---
 Actually the level of noobishness in Vanilla was off charts. I recently saw a Vanilla Paladin PvP vid in which the guy, when stuned, opened his character gear page to click on the trinket ! Obviously unless he was severly mentally afflicted it's fairly certain he did that because he simply didn't know he could just put the trinket in his action bars. So let's not even talk about keybinds or information research. You knew about it, but believe me, many many players didn't.
---
Don't believe the hype.
---
I'm over 30, not kids but have the rest and still can't wait for the release.
---
Moving forward is just an illusion. 
---
That blood spatter filter is a bit distracting 
---
You're in a similar situation to me. It took me a long time to choose what class to make. In the end I started using a private server to help me decide. Choosing the right class is important because, like me, you don't have the luxury of time, and rerolling after spending even a week playing a class you don't end up liking is really disappointing.
---
You need to consider what's important to you. Whether it's raiding, dungeons, pvp, leveling speed, etc. Make a list and order it in terms of priority and then make your decision based on that.
---
Whilst I'm still open to suggestions, I've decided to play Warlock because I want:
---
* I easier leveling experience
---
* Good battleground options
---
* The higher skill-cap of controlling a pet in PVP
---
* Be basically unkillable as SL in open world PVP
---
Ultimately pick a class you want to play and weigh up how happy you'd be changing that decision based on what kind of experience you want.
---
Exactly, no one would notice the details being funny because the only people looking are potential buyers. 
---
At that stage it was probably on some dev build where they hard coded a bunch of values to get everything looking how they want. 
---
I want to play Vanilla as it was, thanks.
---
Yes 
---
&gt; and people generally don't transmog their leveling gear since that's a waste of money. 
---
Costs a few hundred gold at most, which is chump change nowadays. I mean, granted, I don't transmog every bracer and belt I get, but if I weigh my Lightforged Paladin running around in trousers against a couple of hundred gold (at most) and a visit to the &lt;Transmogrifier&gt;, I'm going with the plate skirt every time.
---
I personally have great respect for anyone rocking a full LFR set. The patience required for that is unfathomable. 
---
You're contributing to the largest problem in gaming for the past decade, I'm trying to solve it, yet I'm the problem?
---
Dats racist 
---
That won't be happening anyway.
---
&gt; - dying &amp; losing world buffs in a raid makes ppl salty af (especially if it wasn't their own fault) because they can't get them back and have to raid the remainder of the raid while making half the dmg the ppl are doing that didn't die
---
See? There's already an in-game solution to your "problem". No need to change this. World buffs works only for the first try of the night.
---
You missed the part where undeads can't realistically drown (hello MC underwater) heal half their hp by eating a corspse, can break any charm and fear with their racial that is NOT shared with the pvp trinket AND they have an extra SHADOW DoT that heals them too.  
---
Sorry alliance priests, you are inferior.
---
"The largest problem in gaming" is letting people play what they want to play, rather than pigeon holing them into what the min maxers think they should play 
---
Hahaha. 2/10 on the troll! 
---
Cheers though!
---
That doesn't make sense at all, why would they release a new game that cannot be played? I think it's either an old game or a battle chest including up to legion, as it's sold online.
---
It will within reason. Completely changing the way a fundamental mechanic works is not reasonable in the slightest. 
---
Implying getting married and having kids are good things.
---
Some of the editing by today's standards is borderline cringeworthy! I do remember people being mystified by these videos at the time they came out, people hadn't worked out model replacing as commonly as now and so it really felt like Hector was some sort of wizard. I wonder how many people he introduced to Tool
---
I didn't ask for your personal descriptions for anything. But since you share yours, I'll share mine. Rotating through all Black Lotus spawn sites in the world to get as many as you can, daily I guess, is farming Lotus.
---
Just as farming Earth Essance is rotating through camps with earth elementals that might drop them. Just like Black Lotus, you're hoping to find it :)
---
Same here 34" 3440x1440P. The immersion is insane.
---
&gt; how easy LFR made them to get
---
I personally have great respect for anyone rocking a full LFR set. The patience required for that is unfathomable. I could certainly never do that, wiping hundreds of times on a mythic boss is fine, but wiping dozens of times on an LFR boss seriously strains my mind.

He literally said it was good to replace a blue with and your response was “it’s only good if you have nothing better.”
---
My gf left after 9 years and took our daughter, house is for sale... And I'm happy the b***h left so now I can dump all my free hours into WoW.
---
It's not like you will need more than 1 try for MC &amp; BWL apart from maybe the first 1-3 IDs.
---
If I were the conspiratorial sort, I would opine that, maybe, the pieces you got during leveling in Outland were carefully selected to give you the most garish look possible. I mean, seriously, those green/purple pants with the gold/black vest, *and* a blazing red hat? This *had* to be deliberate.
---
No, the largest problem in gaming is people putting their own enjoyment over the enjoyment of other people.
---
Having 1.12 talents and (maybe) 1.10 items (or item-stats) at the start of MC progression is a fundamental change. I know why Blizzard is doing this &amp; I don't disagree with it, but it still is a huge difference.
---
In what world is a person playing NE Priest over Dwarf Priest affecting You?
---
nothin special about that guy tho. Farming PvE players in typical pick-your-fight rogue situations doesnt require the slightest bit of skill. He doesnt use any mechanics or items that were basic knowledge at the time and are displayed in videos of other good rogues (or other classes, laintime etc) either.
---
[Here are the vanilla raid tier sets](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/5/5e/Tiers_1-2-3.png). But depending on what class you play you will probably use a lot of other random pieces instead of the tier gear just because it's better. 
---
I was 21 when I started in vanilla
---
Reddit skews very young. If you're over at the official forum, threads such as "How old were you when WoW was first released?" show very different outcomes. People answer 20, 25, 30, 40, even up to 60. Sure, some say they were under 13 but they seem to be in the minority.    
---
This is in no way in kind of judgment; just a commentary on how the different forums seem to attract different demographics. 
---
Word
---
I think both your and OP's opinion are valid, but objectively tbc was the only expansion that still had the social aspects and hard content of classic while also being improved expecially looking at class balance. Hybrid classes where now viable, there was more than one viable healing class, druids and pallys could tank raids and all that while every class and spec still felt unique unlike later expansions.
---
Also Black Temple which, let's be honest, is just the most iconic WoW raid in history and arena mode which was a great addition for pvpers.
---
So while I'm fucking hyped for WoW classic and really hope that IF they'll bring tbc servers, they will be optional and won't turn classic servers into tbc, I really hope that tbc legacy **will** come out as it is in my opinion the best version of WoW, balance and overall gameplay wise.
---
Feel free to disagree.
---
I'll just consider that person mentally ill and move on with my day. If I think he might message me again i'll block him, problem solved.
---
He's entiled to his stupid opinion and I am entitled to mine. We can call each other stupid and move on.
---
People can like what they want. But some things comes at the expence of others. Like dungeon finder and lfr killing the community and player agency. 
---
It just means you skipped out on the first round of divorces, don’t worry about it.

I will make a 5 minute Face Roll video just for you. :D
---
Who we are: &lt;Birds Of A Feather&gt; (Alliance/NA/PVP) is guild made up veteran MMO players who have been playing MMOs for well over a decade. We’ve played several games and have done some of the highest content in those games. We’re now hoping to tackle Classic WoW as it is a game that was near and dear to our hearts in our younger years.
---
What we are looking for: A person who is dedicated to the cause. We want people who show up to raids on a consistent basis (80%+). We understand things happen sometimes but just don’t make it a habit. We are looking for people who are more concerned with the progress of the group than the individual.
---
How we operate: We are ideally looking to raid two days a week. Our hours are still TBD as we are recruiting a lot of people at the moment. We encourage you to apply and put your availability and see what times work best for the majority. Will more than likely be some time between 7-12PM EST. We will also be running loot council. Priority will be given to people attend raids regularly and help the guild both in raids and outside. Commitment to the team goes a long way.
---
What we are recruiting: Pretty much everything and anything at this point. (Except Rogues) Will narrow it down in the future. 
---
If you have any questions you can message me on discord @ frail_#3482
---
Here is our App: https://boaf.enjin.com/recruitment
---
It makes it harder for everyone on the server to find groups?
---
Exactly, I don't want to have to reroll!
---
A Warlock doesn't really fit me conceptually I guess, but I can see why you've made that choice.
---
&gt; or in some instances like mage, I'll allow it on middle mouse to be able to cast it on the fly.
---
Well, but basically all silences/interrupts can be casted on the fly, so you should rethink this bind.
---
&gt; Frost nova is definitely on 5, but that is strange now that I think about it, because that's eviscerate on the rogue.
---
It's strange IMO. For me, my mage's frostnova keybind would be the rogue's gouge. (And the polymorph key would be rogue's blind)
---
&gt; Blink/charge, that's a no brainier, those are on the 1 key. 
---
Yup, that's true. I always have a "movement" key on my chars. For rogue it would be sprint for instance.
---
&gt; Do you guys share the same things across multiple classes?
---
Hell yes, I honestly don't know how canyone could play different than that.
---
Imagine playing a rogue and a mage, and have Kick on bind "R" and counterspell at bind "4" or something. I would not be able to play effectivelly at all
---
So here's the thing, people are friendly af when out and about in the world or when you ask a question. The problem is when you're ruining other players experience, which would be in dungeons. If you play tank or healer, (atleast I feel like this) i expect that you know what to do, that you use a shield, know how to get the aggro back and know how to not pull the entire dung. Because if you dont know how to press your abilities you're wasting everyone elses time. So i really recommend that you dont pick tank if its your first time playing. 
---
thanks for the pic they look cool, personally always disliked full sets its too easy... so mix and matching and of course prioritizing stats first is my go to
---
As long as you're happy man :)
---
I like the [Kul Tiras levelling set](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/696758.jpg) for my mage. 
---
I agree, don't get me wrong, I was merely confused as to how insulting someone, especially based on a preference/opinion, could be seen as anything but toxic. It's not super offensive or anything but, it's still toxic in general.
---
Also, don't forget cross realms and sharding/phasing. I genuinely hate it with a passion on live. It messes with communites but on the more hidden side of things, it fucks up any form of server nemesis' playing. Way back when you knew names of people, opposite faction or not, and you'd remember "oh that guy ganked me the other day, I'ma kill him" - whereas now... well... [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuYd7wKZBA0]They can just disappear[/url].
---
You wouldn't have to review anything, you would restrict access to APIs that weren't available in Vanilla.
---
Can we stop perpetuating this narrative already? There are plenty of good and bad people in both Classic and retail. The taint of current Classic is due to the shady, incognito nature of private servers. It is sort of analogous to the Stanford Prison Experiment in that the private servers have the necessary conditions for near unmitigated hateful behavior - and therefore it naturally happens; however, nice people exist there aswell.
---
The horse is dead. Stop.
---
I feel like I should be able to remember this, but what is VTC?
---
Cleared everything back before 2.0 patch ,and I never saw CTS drop despite clearing BWL every week. Ended up with Qiraji Ripper and Maladath before i eventually got dual mistplaced servo arms. 
---
No matter how hard youplan, it will eventually be decided by the loot gods. 
---
*You think you know why Blizzard is doing this. It still is a _huge_ difference.
---
Holy shit... So someone should dumb down their emersion, their enjoyment, their fun, so that YOU can get a group easier... 
---
That is the most selfish thing I've heard so far. Pay everyone's subscription, then sit there dictating what people should and shouldn't do with the game they pay for! 
---
The fun thing is that Vanilla actually had matching sets throughout the leveling process. The "Sentinel" armor made you look like a grunt from OG, the "Hunter's" was actually a very nifty green combination, the "Silver-thread" (with either Vest *or* Robe) armor gives casters a distinct and classy black/silver look, the Nightscape set was perfect for rogues...
---
The whole "mismatched armor" impression usually came from three things: Firstly, some of those armor pieces were strewn across a rather large range of levels, e.g. the Nightscape stuff went from around 36 to 42 - quite some levels during which you could and would exchange the first pieces for something better before having access to the latter pieces. Secondly, most of those sets are world drops: Unless you were insanely lucky, you would never get a full set of anything without specifically farming/buying it (like the Scarlet set). And thirdly, the real "Clown armor" was the armor you'd get as quest rewards during leveling in TBC - those look like someone went out of their way to mismatch armor pieces, like some kind of sadistic Azerothian fashion fiend.
---
Yeah, because it's unreasonable to try and replicate 1.0-1.12 progression across 6 phases in every facet of the game. They'd be knowingly introducing things that were only working as intended by the end of vanilla. 
---
Preventing world buffs is something that wasn't in Classic at any point and won't be in this, they're nothing alike.
---
&gt; I really love TBC. It has the class balance that vanilla didn't.
---
A thousand times yes. I also hope they'll bring tbc legacy servers in few years.
---
38 here, 2 kids, married and still I check this sub and the forums on an hourly basis.
---
Well, so when you are at farm status, the world buffs helps it take less time. I don't know how that's bad and why it needs changing.
---
Be mindful that Pservers have a metric ton of hackers and friends of the GM's, owner, etc. If you've ever tried running your own server there's a ton you can do to augment your stats outside of gear. Outside of that, if it's an older Pserver I'd expect most folks to be decked.
---
While getting nuked in a few seconds is a thing in Vanilla, that wasn't the majority by a Longshot.
---
In general yes. But some game features comes at the expense of others. Which is why no changes became the central pillar of all classic arguments.
---
When some loud retail players want to change the game for the worse, redicule has been the only way to get rid of them.
---
Trying to change a game that people loved, arguably ruining it again can also be considered bad behavior. So it gets hostile. 
---
31 live with my gf and have told her explicitly that I’ll be at home but not really here haha for a week at launch. 
---
The other page had a Warcraft 3 preview :)
---
Silence on 6? I bind all of my abilities to SPACE then use my mental powers to decide which ability I want to use when I hit space. I'm telepathetic.
---
Don't you talk shit about my shiny lightforge set, it's great 
---
I just find toxic to be an overused word for anything peiple dissagree with. Could be cause I play league
---
Even if they removed transmog from BfA you would still not be able to tell who has good gear most of the time. [this is my character without transmog](https://i.imgur.com/KzVpgpv.jpg). I have pretty good gear, but most of my pieces are still just dungeon drops, with the same model as lower quality dungeon drops.

Yeah, I was 11 yo back in the day when I first stepped my foot into eastern kingdom. Thanks to my big sister's boyfriend :)
---
Luckily tho I was mature enought (at least in my memories) to play with her boyfriend's guild mate (18+ at the time) and did pretty much all the content of the time except Nax. 
---
&gt; I’m worried it will be elitists everywhere who won’t be any help, aka the (git gud) guys.
---
Welll, it depends on what kind of "help" you want.
---
You want to ask players about stuff? Sure, most people will help you?
---
Are you that annoying guy that keeps asking for help to kill a non-elite boar (even tho you are a hunter) or because you are getting ganked by the same guy for 1 hour straight (it's never true)? Then you won't get much help.
---
Same here! Going Alliance this time around because she bled Horde for me the first go.
---
This is too true. Me and my brother would get pissed at each other because we did 1 hour shifts.. and if you didn't finish what you were doing, you'd still have to give it up.

I’m looking for a nice group of people who raid on Sydney time, I don’t mind if you’re hardcore or casual, just looking for somewhere I can meet other like minded people to play with. If not, post here or send me a message if you’d like to join one I’ll make :)
---
eh, I even convinced my fiancée to begin WoW for BFA. Now she is the one who can't wait for classic because we talked about it and me being so nostalgic. 
---
Raiding is funnier with someone beside you :) 
---
Vaelistraz the corrupted.  Second boss in bwl.  Called the guild killer because you really had to buckle down and kill faster than you died and there was no two ways around it, so dead weight made the fight basically impossible.
---
Its not that bad.
---
Few more years and mine will grind me all the gold i ever need. Should have started a few years earlier so she could be ready for classic.
---
Honestly i feel that 15 years is almost as close to "erasing" how your experience was :P
---
Gonna be great re-remembering all the stuff though as you go through it again.
---
His editing is very good too. The Scooby Doo intro to the SFK video was amazing
---
I don't know about less toxic but the rest is true. The private server community is extremely toxic so let's hope they spread out and non private server players are plentiful 
---
Enhancement and Elemental were not really viable until BC came out.
---
One does not simply joke about classic release. THIS IS SERIOUS BIZNIZ.
---
Oh god...
---
&gt; So someone should dumb down their emersion, their enjoyment, their fun
---
Please tell me again how playing night elf makes the game more fun and/or enjoyable.
---
I just bought one online for the nostalgia.  
---
Brings so many good memories!  
---
From [CDON.com](https://CDON.com) if anyone wondering.
---
\#nochanges, but what they should have done in 2006 was have a limit on number of World buffs you could have at once. Two maximum would give you the boost, but prevent trivialization of content.
---
Alternatively, and as Kevin Jordan might say “more thematically,” the buffs should have been tied to tiers so that if you went into higher-tier content, the buff would have removed on entry. It doesn’t make sense that the slayer of Onyxia has bonus stats in Naxx or AQ.
---
Finally, and this was probably a technical limitation, the buff should have only applied to those in the group, not everyone in the capital city. If anything, the group should get the full buff and everyone else get a minor version of it.
---
But, like I said, \#nochanges.
---
&gt; The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .

My god factorio community if really everwhere. When you aren't expecting at least
---
Wtf does this have to do with PC culture? O.o
---
tbh, I see the appeal of tbc servers but I would much rather have the raids and pvp options patched in to keep the communtiy together than break us up into thirds. 
---
fuck resiliance gear though. 
---
I felt like everyone I knew was moving forward with their lives when I was in my early 20s, meanwhile I see a whole lot of hardship now and i'm just getting ready for WoW Classic. Their are no guarantees so I just want to enjoy the experience and appreciation that my current age will give me.
---
Could also patch it in on the same servers, the only problem I see, is that this will render classic content redundant again, leading to ~10 years of fighting for classic servers being just patched away.
---
Resiliance gear sucks ass.
---
Because you are more invested in a character? That you like the look of? That you enjoy watching the animations of... 
---
If the look/feel of a character didn't make things more fun or more enjoyable or more worthwhile, then people wouldn't spend ages grinding gold for skins in overwatch, or paying money for the amount of dust they need to get golden cards or grinding the hell out of a pass on fortnite in order to unlock a dance/emote. 
---
It's mental to me that you can't grasp that OTHER people might enjoy OTHER things... And that your clear and outright mental outlook on your own self importance isn't on their agenda. Even worse that triggers you! 
---
My mind is blown...
---
It's a valid point, to add these "other races" without adding a new central hub.

&lt;RTK&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore
---
Raid Times:
---
* Raid Group 1: 7-11pm Eastern. Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday
---
* Raid Group 2: TBD
---
With the right group of people, a guild can progress competitively while putting in less time than we did back when we were young. We are actively searching for Raiders to fill out our ranks as we prepare for the launch of Classic servers. Not all of our members have played Vanilla before, but we do have Officers with experience up through Naxx. Unlike 14 years ago, most of us now have additional obligations that weren't present previously. We completely understand that real life comes first, but we do have expectations for all raiders.
---
If you’re applying to us as a raider, you’re looking to be an active member in our community. You understand your importance in a raid and will commit to being prepared and reliable. You may not necessarily have previous Vanilla raid experience, but you’ve ideally raided during BC or WotLK if you don’t have Vanilla raid experience. You’re a competitive person who plays the game for fun, but your idea of fun is excelling in all facets of the game. That being said, we are also recruiting all casual members looking for a place to call home as we believe community is paramount in Classic!
---
Some of our long-term goals are hosting 3+ raid groups that are self-managed. The leadership team of this guild is all for distributed authority. We want to serve as a guidance for other leaders and want everyone to hold themselves accountable. We're trying to build a large community of like-minded people. With a large community, we can facilitate fun things like large-scale PvP events and a variety of other things.
---
At this point, we have nearly filled up our first raid group and the backup positions for that group. We are looking for someone who is driven that would like to step up to the plate as a raid leader to help form our planned second raid group! This second raid group need not have the same raid times or days as the primary raid group. As the raid leader, you will be responsible for setting the raids expectations and raiding schedule as well as the pace you're looking for. This second raid group is perfect for someone who someone who wants to be part of a large community and isn't rushing to 60 in under a month like the first raid group. If you're planning a more aggressive playstyle on launch, you're welcome to apply to Raid Group 1 as well!
---
We provide 40 man raiding practice as well to help build group cohesion before Classic launches!

I think everyone looks back at the time and thought they were mature. I remember raiding when i was like 16 and i thought everything was fine. Now i look back at it and let me tell you i sucked so bad. We were probably pretty terrible players as kids, even though we might remember things as being fine.
---
At least this time I don't think there will be any kids. Though maybe it was fine they were there, and maybe it's gonna be weird that everyone is an adult now.
---
Same
---
It's also been referenced in studies as to the rapid spread of a disease through traveling etc. Pretty cool!
---
Considering how unhappy most people seem to be nowadays after marriage + children after a few years, I wouldn't be surprised if what you say is quite accurate. 
---
In the same boat, cant wait!
---
Things like this made vanilla such a great game! 
---
It's a shame we (probably) won't be seeing this since it was a bug that was fixed. I wonder if Blizz will allow it for a day before re-fixing it, for fun? 
---
Why are 99% of all videos using crappy annoying music instead of in-game sound?
---
Damn how come he gets the only non back breaking chair lol
---
I quit WoW because my credit card kept getting declined. After two weeks of trying to unravel the mystery, I gave up. It's solved now, though, however it was, since I can buy things from the Blizzard store no problem.
---
I agree! I can't wait to make new memories! 
---
&gt; Those players will quit and never look back if 1 pixel is out of place.
---
Wh... what? 
---
The exact same players that played on shitty scripted and guessed pservers for over 10 years now and fought several years for legacy servers will just quit and not look back when there are bugs on release? That really is pure overdramatic nonsense.
---
That's a fair point. 
---
Just the trend at the time, you have to bare in mind how old some of these videos are at this point. Generally the people making them just went with what they thought fit the vibe they were going for or what they enjoyed
---
Added to watch later, anything classic
---
You know what would have been way cooler and fitting? If the Dranei stayed Dranei, like they were introduced in WC3 and WoW vanilla. You know the one's that you find in Swamps of Sorrows?
---
This would have been a much cooler race to play and it would have fit the Horde theme very well. Ugly/badass looking outcasts, you know like all the Horde factions?
---
Then they could have put the elves where they belong: to the Alliance. Having elves on Horde side was the weirdest shit ever and so out of place.
---
Fascinating. This is the first time I've seen this. I bet it hasn't been posted before. Thank you for your contribution.
---
You don’t have to have kids or get married to move forward with your life, I have absolutely no intention of ever having kids.
---
I would like to go tank too but I like wpvp too much and I play solo because of my Times at work so I don't think it would work :(
---
Treating all the classes as equal is what gave us this mage tanking shit fest that is retail wow
---
Chewie, we're home!
---
Yeah Broken would have made so much sense as a Horde race, teaming up with the Orcs who almost hunted them to extinction and destroyed their civilization without provocation /s
---
Fun is subjective. For some people it is attached to play their own way. Blunt or aggressive approaches aren't the way to go for them. Careful coaxing goes way better. And even then there's times where it doesn't even work. Then it's just better to let them be, just try to get them compensate it in some way (like helping for consumables, etc for the guild). 
---
From someone who got its fun wrecked by this exact reason (spec version in my case) in the past as a tbc feral druid reconverted to resto (against my will) for guild roster matters. Sacrificing fun for justthe  tedium and unsatisfaction I got as resto wasn't worth it. It was better *for the guild,* but now I feel I should have stayed as feral even with all the hate.  
---
It does seem like a false dichotomy because there are genuine sets - not just dungeon sets - in vanilla that match at each level range. This behaviour is archetypal of this forum. When and if I rush on the to max on the main game transmog is something I would typically use if I'm certain I'm not about to swap out gear. I don't HS to the city to constantly update my mog and neither do a lot of people that level. It's very typical to see someone running around with lots of different colour schemes.
---
The current game has tried to make clown armour less prevalent and in doing so it often feels like the armour is just recolours. Of course none of this touches on why people dislike transmog.
---
For all of us who have done this, we know that room is probably hotter than a sauna.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **5th Cakeday** mrMalloc! ^(hug)
---
They probably won’t carry over well though if the API is reworked.
---
Well... we know at least OP isn't less toxic.
---
Looks more like Darnassus to me
---
Perhaps they'll release a modified version like the Great Zombie Plague of '08. Unlike Corrupted Blood, this plague was intentional and was dubbed by an authorized representative of Blizzard Entertainment as the "Great Zombie Plague of '08". It was compared to Corrupted Blood by The Sunday Times, which described the zombie plague as being more true-to-life. The plague was contagious, but in contrast to Corrupted Blood, which had 100% transmission to nearby characters, being in the vicinity of a character infected with the zombie plague represented only a small risk of transmission.
---
Not trying to be offensive but you're asking for help/opinions, then someone who seems to have some knowledge gives you a detailled answer and you just crush his comment by saying
---
&gt; but they went oom after 3/4 spells or so.
---
without even having played classic?
---
Then why do you even bother asking?

This was one of the coolest things in the game, especially if you where one of those people who got the plague and then logged off in the org inn only to log on in years later :)
---
Yeah, I didn’t realize you had to be single with no kids to play WoW Classic. Is it going to ask for verification when we launch the game?
---
Dangerous! If i recall correctly. 
---
:(
---
Perhaps, though if I remember right they stopped that quite quickly due to players crying about it.
---
&gt;Will the learning curve be too high?
---
No
---
&gt;will there be a lot of beginners at launch?
---
Yes, vanilla WoW beginners, but not many WoW beginners. 
---
&gt;I’m worried it will be elitists everywhere who won’t be any help, aka the (git gud) guys.
---
The WoW playerbase is pretty mature, average age nowadays is somewhere in the mid 20s probably. You should not have many problems getting help if you ask for it. You might get some angry people if you play badly when they expect you to know what you are doing. But that's more due to expectations, not because they actually have an issue with you being a beginner. 
---
&gt;Should I get into Classic WoW this summer?
---
If you feel like getting deep into an MMO, yes. If you just want to see what it's about or whatever, I dunno, there are other good games out there too that aren't as big time sinks. 
---
I would have used the "I tried to get you up like two times" excuse a lot.
---
Reddit's not a psycotherapy room u know. 
---
I was in 7th grade when I played wow.
---
Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness was the first video game I played after watching my older brothers play it. Then I played WC3 a few years later. 
---
Jesus, I completely forgot about this. I remember spending hours on the race/class pages while I was saving up to buy the game, and I still couldn't make my mind up what I wanted to play when I got my hands on the discs.
---
You think the average guild will need 1-3 weeks and then just 1 shot BWL? That will never happen. Most guilds will wipe over and over for months in BWL. The time it will take for an average guild to have a clean BWL run is enormous.
---
you dont rly understood what i meant :)
---
Looking for casual Oceanic Horde PvP guild, I have intentions of raiding eventually but just want to chill out with a group hopefully 18+ ( I'm 24 with kids mrs full time job ect)
---
LMFAO
---
Just raid as resto and snag one of 2h that noone will want, you can go something like 31/20/0 and use the same gear as elemental just with a 2h weapon. Your spells will be doing same dmg as elemental, but when you run out of mana you can still do some serious dmg with aas. Biggest thing youll miss fron 31/0/20 is ns i guess
---
Nope.

Fire is the better dps spec after BWL. 
---
It's far from too late. Me and my friends will bunker up in my apartment when Classic arrives and we're all 28-30 y/o.
---
I was about the same age as you when I started, I knew there were some kids that played as my friends and I’s younger siblings would, but I played with mostly people in their 20’s so I figured the player base was generally older.
---
I've been sick for a month, I'll blame it on that

The event, which Blizzard ended on 28 October earned the company both praise and criticism from its fans.

\[H\] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)
---
\`\`\`
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared.
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.
---
\*\*Raid nights will be:\*\*
---
\`\`\`Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)
---
Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!\`\`\`
---
\*\*Loot System:\*\*

\`\`\`Loot Council\`\`\`
---
\*\*Our Goal:\*\*
---
\`\`\`To progress at a competitive level, on a casual schedule, in a hardcore and mature raiding environment.\`\`\`
---
\*\*Requirements:\*\*
---
\`\`\`18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)
---
Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (\~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)
---
Showing up to raid on time and prepared for encounters being executed that day  (including proper add-ons, consumes, etc)\`\`\`

If you watch his latest video, I believe he is rolling a priest as well and lists reasons.
---
I searched for Morgan's Plot.  
---
I like priest but leveling via wand can get slow, hoping this time to team with a dps
---
Would love to see your face when you realize that Grim is nowhere near Perplexity's skill level. Btw, you are comparing footage with more than a decade between. Grim didn't have to use engi/items because 90% of players back then played like bots. Please refrain from commenting if your IQ is on par with a stone. 
---
I enjoyed Vanilla and TBC, but for very different reasons. In Vanilla, I loved the grind to rank 14, the world pvp, and pretty much everything else about the game. In TBC, I was hooked on raiding, enjoyed the crap out of it, however, that was the only aspect of TBC that I was really into. Everything else just felt... left behind.
---
Vanilla, by far was the best. When TBC came out, it fully upgraded the games end game PvE content, and at that time, end game was the best it had ever been. However, the xpac did indeed gut Azeroth, trivialized past accomplishments, made 90% of vanilla pointless, killed world pvp, and its this trend that continues to ruin the game today, imo.
---
Now that‘s a nicely formed sentence!
---
Being in a party splits the exp you receive among everyone in the group, unless you’re referring to how much faster you can kill mobs with multiple people. Either way, you’ll eventually be underleveled unless you grind a lot or go around to other zones and do extra quests.
---
You spoilt fucking brat.
---
Nothing irritates me more than watching a lock sit at low mana and 100% hp with my hots rolling on him.
---
Great you can afk in shatyrath flying on your meme spec that's now viable while you use dungeon finder and so dailies.
---
1 step forward 9 back.
---
Fully agreed. Any player can be impactful in a BG even w/o high end gear. There are so many items that are very specific to PvP and easily obtainable w/o raiding or grinding the ranks.
---
Grenades, Sapper Charges, engineering stuff in general, including the helmets, trinkets and so on. There are *many* engineering utilities that are just flat out more powerful than the stat piles you get even from AQ/Naxx, like all the spell reflector utility, Rocket Helmet, Mindcontrol Cap etc.
---
Weird quest reward items that are super PvP specific like Skull of Impending Doom, Med Pouch, Tidal Charm, Linken's Boomerang, Nifty Stopwatch, Arena Grandmaster, all the easily obtained Insignias and PvP trinkets.
---
As for straight up gear a well thoughtout combination of ZG/AQ20 plus 5/10mans, T0.5, PvP Rare, PvP Reputation and PvE Reputation gear is *very* competitive even with AQ40+ gear in terms of raw PvP if you choose the right stats, bonuses and combinations.
---
And then there's obviously Alchemy consumables that make up for gear as well and bring unique utility that is unmatched by anything else in WoW.
---
So combining all of those things you don't need to be a raider or rank14 to be competitive with just about anyone who joins the battlegrounds in terms of raw gear and consumbales.
---
On top of that the most important thing is player ability and coordination. If someone wants to be good at PvP they have to simply *play a lot of pvp* and play with groups/friends/premades to increase their impact.
---
The OP is *very typical* in that he joins a BG with PvE optimized gear that is behind in progression and then wonders why he gets "nuked". No mention of his spec and his playstile even. I wouldn't be surprised if he was running a PvE spec as well. The role of a Rogue in a BG is very specific and has to be learned to be able to have impact, just like any other class.
---
Much of what made it special was that it was unintentional and unexpected, just like many other things in Vanilla. You can't recapture the magic of stuff like that, especially when it's expected. Maybe they could do it as some sort of homage, but I'd personally prefer it if it was just a one time thing that can only be re-experienced through the skewed words of those who were there, eventually crystallizing into a legend. 
---
I was going to raise the possibility that there would be, and they'd all rush from Fortnite into WoW battlegrounds, but no... Free to Play is a much lower barrier to entry. They aren't going to be pushing to get money to play a 15 year old game with a subscription.

# &lt;Always East&gt;
---
**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role and have an understanding of each encounter.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday.
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so! We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this. Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more! All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we currently have 100 Discord members. Of those, 83 have identified what class and role they wish to play.
---
Q: **Are you using Loot Council or some other form of looting?**
---
A: We will be using EPGP in conjunction with ranking priority (if you show up and perform well for 95% of the raids, you are rewarded with the "Zealot" rank which has priority when it comes to loot over the "Member" rank.) The leadership has taken years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the main tank.
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460, Kegg#8900** or **Vexlander#9572** ) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!

Just give me pfui on day 1

Every single weekend I had a friend come crash with his PC. Wed carry his big desktop pc, screen and of course the dual pc subwoofers. Friday's were always early off school, and we wouldn't venture outside again until late Sunday when we carried his stuff back to his house.
---
I remember when he slept over during the weekdays too. He might've as well have been my parents 3rd child. 
---
You sound like a fantastic father...
---
I read your post and I see someone trying to exaggerate the comment to make someone that want's vanilla to, y'know, be vanilla.
---
&gt; it would actually change the game nontrivially and doesn't belong at all in Classic.

Now I could sit here and waste my time explaining why you shouldn't change small, minute, details for various legitimate reasons but the only thing that needs to be said is this wasn't in vanilla so it shouldn't make the cut. **Historical recreation as it was**. To take it any further than this makes it abundantly clear you're in favour of changing things. Looking at your comment history tells me all I need to know, you want to hijack the project and turn it something else. You're lobbying for changes. You're entirely, intellectually, dishonest.
---
i am 30, married, have a daughter and my own house. 
---
and all i can think about is WHEN THE FUCK DO WE GET A FUCKING RELEASE DATE???
---
I like how pservers have disabled world buffs the first month of new raid tier release.  
---
The real secret to life is that we’re all here by accident. Nothing really means anything. The good and bad get swallowed by the passage of time. And there is no correct path through any of it. 
---
The only thing you have is your subjective truth and experiences. 
---
Personally I don’t want to get married or have kids. Similarly I’m 29 with a lot of friends having their first kid. I’m in a happy relationship though, with no plans for marriage or kids (she feels the same) and subjectively playing an absurd amount of a 14 year old MMO would be really cool. 
---
I would say if it's an addon you would use, then others might want it too if you put it out there.  If you starting using it and find you don't need it then probably the same for others.  Im not really playing an ammo user so I wont really be your target audience here but just a general tip really.
---
So the addon will give  an exact number of arrows left and an attack time left being that same number multiplied by the attack speed of the ranged weapon?
---
Good luck with that lmao. Might have worked ten years ago but now everyone knows how this game works. Prep Hemo or Prep daggers, nothing else.
---
I know right, i love it.
---
&gt; use dungeon finder
---
Yes, because dungeon finder was totally a thing in tbc.
---
&gt; on your meme spec that's now viable
---
Oh you're right. It's definitely a GREAT thing that you can't play balance druids, feral druids, resto druids, ret and prot pallys, ele and enhancement shamans, shadow priests and beastmaster hunters comptitively because they are much weaker than the other specs in classic. You're totally right, meme specs were the best feature of classic. Absolute genius.
---
Just get the AV unstoppable force mace, it’s just as good as anything you can equip from MC.  I’d bet your guild would give you a chance to roll on the legendary rag mace as well.
---
You probably won't get into tryhard PVP premades without the optimal race/class combos, no. 
---
But if you don't care about playing optimally then you're not going to care about getting into optimal groups. Play what you want. There will be plenty of non-tryhard premades. 
---
It’s possible, however I’m not sure where you would end up getting +5 daggers. As rogues are pretty heavily weapon dependent it all really depends on what is available to you. Swords end up winning in the long run once you have everything available, but daggers usually edge out swords in MC. 
---
&gt; That won't be happening anyway.
---
That comment is so god damn retarded. Just because they are forced to make some changes within Vanilla doesn't mean that every god damn stupid idea from outside Vanilla or made up change is suddenly valid.
---
Your so right. Cause me personally idc where I was in life I know I would want to drop it all for classic. Those who can’t wish they could!
---
The stables are that way for the high horses
---
That's not quite true. There are many fights which are super grindy when both sides know what they are doing. If OP is joining a BG with a PvE optimized gear, possibly spec, little knowledge of the PvP meta and preparation, then yes, what you are saying is true.
---
Yup, did this.  Will probably do this again.  Could still heal with no problem.
---
Strong protect the weak
---
Well the future isn’t what it used to be. Not work to work towards when you know by the time you get there a robot will take the job over you.
---
The screenshots of Darnassus are quite interesting.
---
Risk of Rain 2 is pretty dope
---
Yeah that's very true. Maybe (surely) I got carried hard by the guild but it was awesome nonetheless. 
---
Yeah, I think this too, there will not be many kid on it. The mindset of classic WoW in term of gameplay is really far of nowadays standards. But I'm sure some dads (and moms) around there will want to introduce what gaming was back then to their child and play with them on classic :)
---
If I remember correctly (and it's been a long time), other abilities like Arcane shot also use ammunition. If this is the case your addon would have to start recording the player's combat data in order to properly analyse their estimated remaining combat time, since different people will play differently (some hunter players literally just autoshot and pet attack and watch movies). It's not something you could just get via weapon speed vs. ammo remaining.
---
A simpler solution might be intermittent warnings when a hunter has 3, 2 and 1 stack of ammo left.
---
Now you do professional MMA thanks WoW!
---
Meaning essentially the add on where you can send multiples will come as standard?
---
You could program that in a weakaura easy, no need to make an addon for it. I made one for my arcane mage that tells me how long I have till I go oom during my burn phase. Arrows should be even easier.

---
Self awareness much?
---
Edit boot enchant -&gt; glove enchant
---
I'm planning to play a hunter and such addon would be much appreciated.
---
I've been checking your guild out, among others. Didn't apply just yet, but could happen. Looked like a decent guild :)
---
Outlands. Shattrath. Daily quests. more welfare epics. 
---
The only improvement was talent for previously non viable specs. The game got worse in every other feasible way. Hence why we are here.
---
Night Elf squad
---
Play what you want and find a guild with a similar mind set and you won't have any issues.
---
Gear and skill matter way more. Play whatever race you want. 
---
For PVE though, yes there’s a few specs that just aren’t great. Too many of those and don’t expect your guild to hot knife through butter things. 
---
If you want to be the top of pve or PvP then yes.
---
For most classes, yes, race doesn't matter; the DPS differences are marginal.
---
But for Priest, you literally get different spells for different races, and Dwarf has an insanely useful fear immunity spell while Human has a short stealth detection and Nelf has a dumb channeled damage spell.
---
One of those three is going to be infinitely more useful in a raid than the other two.
---
They sure do. I went with a tkl Corsair mechanical keyboard and a razed naga mouse.
---
Mom! Bathroom!
---
Sadly this is something noone can give you any information about. Truth is: there's a lot of people who will NOT be like this. However, chances are, that still you'll be encountering these types of players fairly regularly. It's just how gamers all over the world have "evolved".
---
Especially in the beginning, there'll be many like this. However, waiting a couple of days and then just casually level at your own pace you'll most likely find enough likeminded people that are a pleasure to play with.
---
LOOOL THIS IS A FUNNY POST 😂😂😂
---
The game wants to know how much child labor you'll be using to farm gold while at work.
---
no. and fuck off.
---
Right, it would be a bit complicated to estimate, but I have a few ideas on how to do it accurately enough to be useful in theory. I don't have a lot of practical testing for my ideas as there is no beta and likely won't be...
---
I feel your pain. I had to switch with my twin sister after every hour. Never had the chance to do instances until I got my own PC.
---
That makes just as much sense as Elves and Forsaken joining the Horde, if you look at it from such a shallow perspective.
---
You can make it work, especially since Thrall was anti Old Horde. The New Horde had the same enemies as the Draenei had. And again the bottom line is that old Draenei as in vanilla and WC3 were way more fitting than Elves as a horde race. They didn't put Elves into the Horde for lore reasons, in fact they had to twist and turn the lore on its head to make it work.
---
Lol I used to watch big fish stream his paladin on a pserver. Leveling he would literally lean back and put his hands behind his head sometimes lol.
---
I have been playing on vanilla private servers.
---
And grinding as much of the way to 60 as you can bate yields good profits.
---
My parents would yell at me for playing video games all day. Taking a photograph to cherish the memories was out of the question.
---
Total bullshit another example of people playing complete TRASH private servers thinking they know how classic will be.
---
Whenever I go back to vendor, I get a full quiver and 2 stacks of arrows in my normal bags.
---
Never had issues with ammo, unless a run lasted like three times as long as a usual one.
---
Is that so? Hm... that is a little disappointing. I'll look into weakauras and see just how redundant my addon would  be, lol.
---
You've just destroyed all horde priests and rogues, well done sir.
---
No, we are here because the game got worse and worse AFTER tbc. The player population still grew even until wotlk. 
---
Classic is the most legendary part of WoW. It is where it all began and it was arguably the hardest one since nobody knew any strategies. That's what we all remember and want to relive.
---
But tbc improved the game in many ways and it **was** a step forward. There's a reason it had more players than Classic had. 
---
Like I said, I hope Classic will have dedicated servers that won't turn into tbc but I and MANY others really wanna replay tbc too, since it was the best state this game has ever been in.
---
Ctrl is not rare lol. Alt is, tho
---
As a guild master, no. I wouldn't decline these specs.
---
However hardcore guilds might.
---
What raid times would be optimal for you?
---
If I was in your shoes, I guess I'd want something like 16.00 to 19.30.
---
As one of three brothers I have to comment on the oldest having the best chair. What kind of backwards manipulative leader logic did he use here? 
---
Awesome! I am glad to hear it. :)
---
Elemental is still leagues better, there is nothing better than casting earth shock on some clothie critting him for 1500 dmg then chain lightning him out of existence 
---
You should be banned from classic :P.... And I from tbc haha
---
You can still write the weakaura and share it on Wago and people will download it if they like it. 
---
Same here.
---
She is playing with me since Cata release and are really exited for Vanilla release because she never played it but hate that you do not have to earn things and raids are just learn 6 Mechanics every boss with people that have 0 patients.
---
In decent preraid PvP gear, you shouldnt be getting stomped too bad at that stage. But ya, if youre in your PvE gear youll probably get killed fairly fast.
---
That being said, you shouldnt be getting stomped that bad and even in 1v2s, youre a Rogue, you have lots of CDs you can use.
---
As for WotLK PvP... all I can remember from that was spam instant cast abilties since every class had like 5 and it was solely about burst.
---
If youre having trouble with how to PvP, read a guide or watch some vids, it would take a very long article to write down how to PvP well.
---
People should play Horde Priest and Rogue. Horde is the most fun. No one shouts at you for not being a dwarf there.
---
Waiting for that original meme being living in perpetual disappointment.
---
Yo, how much for a run so I can grab thrash blade lmao
---
(seriously, how much would a hunter charge for this in your experience)
---
“You’re lucky we even let you play with us”
---
Think I should give it its own post? 
---
where did this date come from?
---
Yeah, not just *anyone can press Shadow Bolt!
---
Because a / d work better as strafe - unless I'm taking to a bunch of camera locked keyboard turning mongoloids!
---
You're not wrong.
---
Im on the exact same boat with you on every front, cheers
---
Id go with a mage. You can do PVP, PVE and grind gold. Mages are always welcome to a 5man because of nice aoe, cc and free water/food + portals.
---
31. Married. Home owner. Dog. Full time work. Gym 4 days per week. 
---
That leaves about 2 hours every other day mon to fri to play and maybe 4-5 hours on either sat or sun 
---
I CAN NOT WAIT 
---
The Rogue counter isn't really true. If anything that is one of the classes who is used to counter Druids. Stealth detection on PvP gear and Feary fire are tools to fight Rogues, who are the biggest enemy of a Druid trying to snatch a flag. They bring the three things on the table you need to kill a Druid: Suprise factor, single target CC, burst damage.
---
&gt;Now that's semantics. I'm pretty sure every single reader knew what I was talking about. Especially when, as you say, MP5 is constantly active anyways, and the spirit (M)ana (p)er (5) second rule is the only that can be applied to that...
---
You could have admit using the wrong term and not try to make up shit that doesnt make any sense.
---
Bring your own luffa, cleanup not included.
---
If your aim is to get into the NEET-est of mixmaxing groups then yes, it's true.
---
If your aim is to get into the other 99% of groups then no, it isn't.
---
I just need one more blue post blizzard. Please baby. I’ll do anything. 
---
The difference is that I like both and I want both ;)

	PhD student lf guild. **\[NA Eastern time\]** \[**Horde\] \[PvE server\]**  Tentatively maining shaman.
---
	So I'm not exactly a 9-5er, more of PhD student---which means that daily schedule and weekly workload can vary a lot (but are often demanding). I am planning to take leveling at my own pace (6 months to reach level 60?). I thoroughly enjoy dungeons. Working toward raiding with a good group of friends is a goal, but I expect to be behind the curve for any raiding. I could still be happy if I never raid. Fellow interest in heavy metal a plus. :)

	If it sounds like I might be a good fit, please contact me here or on Discord! (tag: Roy#1126 )
---
The fuck does this have to do with private servers?
---
Horde are just misunderstood pawns used by the burning crusade to destabilize Azeroth for a legion invasion. After Grom finally broke the curse the Orcs and Darskpear trolls moved as far as they could away from the Alliance because they just wanted to live in peace on their ugly little sun bleached continent, where they met the Tauren who are the most peaceful little Minotaur ripoffs ever. It was the Alliance that got all uppity under Admiral Proudmoore who decided to send a whole invasion fleet to fuck with them.  
---
Undead are ugly as fuck though and all need to die. Them being in the Horde was just Thrall having pity on them for being so fuck ugly. Ogres should have always been the 4th Horde race but we need that Eastern Kingdoms city. 
---
Exactly. I think that is what i like the most about classic WoW. One big relevant world, that stays relevant. The classic zones are my favorite as well. 
---
First time i played a hunter this would have been awesome. I’m really fuckin anal about having a full quiver whenever i touch town now, though.
---
I remember I was in the middle of a progression raid when a GM messaged me.  In the middle of a fight.  I quickly typed "/r give me a second we're in the middle of a boss fight"..  We killed the boss for the first time right then and everyone was happy and we were dividing loot.  I got an item and was super stoked!  We started pulling trash and about 30 minutes later the GM messaged me "So how's it going with that boss?".. oops.
---
You could have just made a Tauren on another server? My brother and I shared and just didn't play on the same one. 
---
"Human priest" "really shitty racials"
---
Humans have some of the best racials in the game. In terms of priest specific, humans get 5% Spirit, and priests value their spirit more than most other stats. His argument is that dwarves are better due to Fear Ward, but the reality is that if you already have 2 or 3 dwarfs with Fear Ward, it can actually be better if the rest are human for that spirit. 
---
Retribution Paladins are not as bad as people think. Are they better that warriors? No, but that doesn't mean they are useless. If played well, they can rack up some pretty hefty damage. Though in a raid you probably shouldn't have too many, still.
---
Shadowpriest being one of the "Literally worst specs possible" is the funniest thing I've heard all day. Spriests have Shadowweaving which increases shadow damage by 10% on the target, which means in a raid scenario Warlocks will love you, as they now deal way more damage per mana spent, which is a BIG DEAL. Such a big deal in fact that at least one Spriest should be mandatory for an optimal raid composition. Also, Spriest are absolutely insane in PvP, they melt faces faster than Lightning McQueen. (That means very fast!)
---
Protection Paladins are perfectly vaiable... in Dungeons! Though in raids you wouldn't want a Protection Paladin as they have close to no threat generation. However in dungeons they work just fine.
---
Druids who are feral with "pummelers" are a force to be reckoned with. All though that does entail farming those pummelers, but if you put in that work, they deal good damage.
---
As a proud boy in blue I can't speak for the shaman though.
---
This dude obviously has no clue what he is talking about :P
---
If by "deep resto" you mean the PvP flag carrier spec, then yes they mostly have Nature's Grasp. Roughly like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zL0hZVxzoZVE0oeq0o
---
&gt;Most guilds will wipe over and over for months in BWL. 
---
I would suggest checking this comment out after BWL has been released... And focus on the "most guilds" part.
---
Not exactly. As another has pointed out, shot rotation, attack speed buffs, playstyle, etc would all also factor in to an estimate. Since that would be almost impossible to estimate accurately for every player, I am thinking I'd do something more along the lines of comparing total number of arrows "now" to the total number of arrows "X number of minutes ago". Of course there are still things to consider when estimating, like purchasing arrows, but I think this route would result in an estimate that is more accurate for more players.
---
It seems crazy to me that we went from announcement to June with that first Dev water cooler without anything from Blizz
---
You make great points here... the best thing is to grab the rare stuff that has no competition once you hit 60. Devilsaur, black lotus... etc.. there won't be anyone to buy it so you just hold onto it for a while. You will then be rich later on.
---
**&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; Alliance | NA | Normal/PvP**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster before Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who currently play retail WoW and cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Classic. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing. 
---
**Raid Times:** On retail, we currently raid on Friday evenings. The Classic schedule will be similar and weekends only. We're aiming for two nights.
---
We are looking for any race/class at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles. 
---
**Discord:**  [https://discord.gg/8QV45fP](https://discord.gg/8QV45fP) (mention WoW Classic)
---
this takes out all the class specs i have thought about ... 
---
survival hunter not on the list so maybe that? dont we need tranq shot for chromaragon?
---
I always wonder why people hate on specific races so much. Did one of them touch you when you were leveling? 
---
I read this in Comic Book Guy voice. Accurate?
---
One of my biggest gripes with mmo's today is devs and players feeling that all content in the game NEEDS to be doable by ALL players.
---
One of the reasons Vanilla was great was because there were goals, long term goals, and impossible feats of strength. I think its a wonderful thing having content in a game that is only achievable by the most dedicated or the most no life players. No lifers need a game too.
---
Yeah, see I haven't played on any pservers, so I am simply going off of memory for how much of an issue arrows were. So feedback like this is very helpful.
---
Isn't it amazing that this choice is so important?
---
First off, when I started reading into your post and you only had numbers bound, warning sounds went off in my head. 
---
Ill start with movement key binds.
---
W is forward, I have no left/right turning and A is left strafe D is right strafe, you only need to turn with right mouse, also S is unbound because if you are backing up you're moving too slowly and will die.
---
Everything else keybinds.
---
E, R, F are my bread and butter abilities,  whatever I will open with in a fight and use every single fight. I always bind S to my O'Shit ability and same with shift-s. Then I usually bind q, z, x, c. And I just move character screen to V.
---
After I bind all those, I make the next open bars to Shift varients too all previous letters listed,
---
Finally I ALWAYS bind auto run to the forward top mouse button in front of my scroll wheel, and then space permitting bind 1, 2, 3, 4 and shift variants of those. 
---
Well, i can tell you, nobody had all world buffs in vanilla when we raided. Because people didnt spend 1-3 days setting up summons as fast as possible from buff spot to buff spot. Onyxia/nef head had CD on when buff could be used.
---
So do you want that or what you are used to in the private servers ?
---
One thing I learned in over 11 years of playing WoW: Never question someone else's keybinds. Everyone has different reasons and they all work, mostly. It's kinda like decisions in life - focus on your own and what works best for you, don't compare your keybinds to others' or think of them as superior/inferior. Obviously there are extremes, like putting a spell that needs quick reaction (interrupt in pvp for example) on the other end of the keyboard. However maybe that person would use the other hand for it and somehow make that work.. as I said, never question it. 
---
And you know how Classic will be?
---
With private servers we know for a fact how hundreds of thousands of players interact in Vanilla today.
---
I'm gonna play em all, but will probably not main rogue again. Been spoilt by better combat animation, human ones suck gnoll testies.
---
You sound way more successful than them, they probably won't even reach level 10! Ha N00bz :P
---
You might include the Pursuit of Justice talent. 
---
Thrall had been involved in cohabitation in WC3, well before WoW was out. In one of the Campaigns he, Cairne, and Jaina all work together. Jaina even helps Thrall fight off Jaina's own father. 
---
no, it became available in tbc/pre wotlk afaik. Holy Shock had a 30sec cd in vanilla/tbc
---
Until ur still in blue pvp gear and rogues r bis 1.10. Shit these rogues got strong af. Stay geared friends. 
---
Same here as you bro 28 years old no girlfriend no kids, i am only looking forward classic wow and riding my motorcycle. Normal life with moving forwards sounds boring!
---
Oh man you gonna hate me. Tilde is my push to talk.
---
Personal responsibility is the responsibility of the individual, not Blizzard, Activision, or any game dev.
---
If someone dies because they sit in a chair playing Diablo 3 for a week without getting up, that's on them.

---
What would a shockadin build look like.
---
Just judge crusader and wait 8 seconds and then blast with your judge righteousness + holy shock macro..
---
With a good spellpower gear it has the potential of bursting very hard
---
Never did charge for runs when I had my hunter but I think I saw hunters charge up to 50 gold for the Blackstone Ring-Run.
---
If you're not looking for a particular item-drop, just the quest-reward you might get away with 10-20 gold for a run.
---
Well of course it includes legion considering legion is included in the base game.
---
I'm sorry that it makes more sense for me to combine mana reg and the 5 second rule into mp5 when the context is obvious.
---
29 here, I have a kid and met my girlfriend when she had a newborn (almost 1 year old now!). We're making sure we can play Classic together =)
---
Your parents were awesome. 
---
From Sweden here, played on Stormscale back in the day and remember there was a lot of Scandinavians there 😁
---
For me it was just the gnomes. I don't like their whole personality in game and moreover, them being so small was irritating in PvP,as they were much harder to see than everyone else, especially in big fights.
---
Tjaswe?
---
I am sure there are ways to do it. People for some reason think lateral progression is a pointless. I disagree. 
---
although I am just one man and not a game designer so I can't speak for anyone else. A few years down the road this discussion will come up again and it will be interesting to see what direction the community wants to go. 
---
I just want to continue the game as if TBC never came out. The only reason they added a portal to render Azeroth a dead world was so they could sell expansions. It reminds me of when shrouded isles and toa came out of DAOC. Its just a gear wipe and cash gra b. No thanks
---
I'm the same. I won't kill for a quest mob or herb (depending on who got there first) but any Horde in Redridge or Raven Hill Cemetery are asking to die. No need to gank people 30+ levels lower than you because you hate your life so much you want to make everyone else miserable. 
---
"Grown-ups who appriciate good MMOS/games" I'm 17 and I have never dabbled in such atrocities like "Fortnite" and I am very much looking forward to classic. Also "Veterans" and "Old-school gamers", you don't think any of the younger generation have some actual good taste in games? You'd be wrong! See ya in Azeroth :)
---
I did some testing on an instant 60 server with a holy spec with Holy Shock &amp; Seal of Command. Granted you had the gear (I ran around with 5/8 Judgement and some other Spell Power pieces) you could do some very fun things in PvP, while also being a seriously strong healer.
---
Spec was something like this:
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExu0xotZxf0tr](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExu0xotZxf0tr) 
---
Undead Warriors aren't as bad as he makes them out to be. Will of the Forsaken is that good that just about any class is good as UD.
---
even better the 9th time
---
&gt;reality is that if you already have 2 or 3 dwarfs with Fear Ward in a raid, it can actually be better if the rest are human for that spirit.
---
Not true, the spirit increase is very small, having another dwarf on his place is better.
---
&gt;Retribution Paladins are not as bad as people think. Are they better than warriors? No, but that doesn't mean they are useless. If played well, they can rack up some pretty hefty damage. Though in a raid you probably shouldn't have too many, but one or two are great.
---
Ret doesnt bring anything to a raid, holy do their job just fine, they are just dead weight.
---
&gt;Shadowpriest being one of the "Literally worst specs possible" is the funniest thing I've heard all day. Spriests have Shadowweaving which increases shadow damage by 10% on the target, which means in a raid scenario Warlocks will love you, as they now deal way more damage per mana spent, which is a BIG DEAL. Such a big deal in fact that at least one Spriest should be mandatory for an optimal raid composition. Also, Spriest are absolutely insane in PvP, they melt faces faster than Lightning McQueen. (That means very fast!)
---
Not true again, you wont bring many warlocks to a raid anyways, and even if you do, you can just ask one of your holy priests to spec deep into shadow to get it.
---
&gt;Protection Paladins are perfectly vaiable... in Dungeons! Though in raids you wouldn't want a Protection Paladin as they have close to no threat generation. However in dungeons they work just fine.
---
​Even in 5mans they are just bad, I remember doing dungeons with prot palas and every pull he has to drink, and dps can go all in otherwise  theyll pull threat.
---
&gt;​Druids who are feral with "pummelers" are a force to be reckoned with. All though that does entail farming those pummelers, but if you put in that work, they deal good damage.
---
Well, this is the only one I can agree but finding a druid who is good enough to do that is very rare.
---
&gt;As a proud boy in blue I can't speak for the shaman though.
---
Enhance shamans are the ret paladins of horde side, and elementals just go OOM very quickly.
---
I second all of this. I may have made one on an instant 60 server and I have all blue gear. As shadow, I can 1v1 people that I have no business of beating. It is quite fun.
---
  **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
   
---
 **Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
 **Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
 **Membership:** 
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They      will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things      with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the      end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend      recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that      is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of      Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a      period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move      on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the      effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to      keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100%      sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they      are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have      a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to      keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no      special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known      each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is      great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and      stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any      major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and      will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---

You get 5g in a 2 minute flip
---
Mage is my vote.
---
Every kids dream 
---
As with any game attempting that type of option, you split your playerbase and double the support staff requirements.
---
That's why wow never kept legacy servers in the first place. you have one version to patch and one community to monitor.
---
Literally make any post on this sub and watch how quickly it gets downvoted
---
I’m from NA here. On private realms I’ve played with many a Swede. So there’s definitely a community out there
---
I am the same I have two dogs and nothing but time for this game. Recently single this is going to be the best summer ever.
---
Another Dane here. I've seen quite a few EU based guilds, but not a Scandinavian one. 
---
Can’t argue there are a lot of noobs out there and perhaps you are right that some had no clue, but that’s a bit shocking, as it was incredibly easy to figure out. I mean its a damn button and it’s not like key binds were a new concept - they were big in Diablo 2. 
---
Had you said macros I would have been less shocked but you could be right and maybe I just knew more than the average player (wow even typing that makes me feel like an elitist). 
---
Perhaps you could factor in time actually spent attacking as well. Also give players an estimate of how many minutes of actual shooting time they have left. 
---
Man that's sad you kids should be outside playing. I only say this because I spent a lot of my time indoors playing games and WoW but my best memories when I was a kid was doing stuff outside with friends. Now that I'm older and with less energy and friends, it's a good time to play wow.
---
I don't know about "elitists" as such but as someone who raided hardcore on PServers, I love telling new players about secret quests and areas and helping out. There will be plenty of helpful veterans, even if there are unhelpful trolls
---
so new!
---
what if I tell you you can do both? 
---
I never minded the "clown suits". It's bigger issue to me that everyone is running around in Ashbringer or some cool epic set that they didn't earn, they just ran old raids for the drops.
---
I'm totally with you. 
---
**&lt;Blood Moon&gt; [Alliance-PvP] EU-EN is now recruiting!**
---
We're in the *(very) early stage of forming a semi hardcore*, or to be more specific, **EXPERIENCED CASUAL** guild.
---
By "experienced casual" we mean that we do not actively encourage min maxing but we do want our members to be familiar with classic wow (or private servers). We don't want to rush to endgame, instead we will take our time to smell the roses (again), do quests and dungeons together (we accept memespecs, too :P ), some wpvp, etc.
---
Our goal is to be a *big guild with a friendly environment and an active, mature playerbase that keeps the guild chat/discord alive at all times and members who will not hesitate to help their brethrens in need even if it means to slow down their own progress in exchange*
---
**we WILL raid** at some point, although we do not have specific plans for endgame *yet*
---
feel free to join the discord so we can get to know each other until classic launch!

Say goodbye to your summer 
---
I din't lol, im going to try elemental too, it was just that i wanted to try enhan for pve nothing more.
---
I’m not sure how feasible it is to design this addons atm without having a classic client. Because in modern wow ammo doesn’t work the same way it did in classic. Since the client isn’t the original wow exe you may need to wait till they give addon authors more information. 
---
Can you give a bit more detail about the rotation?
---
Dude, my druid is now in pre-raid gear, mostly short and small leather armor pieces with green and brown color scheme. You have no idea how freakin happy I am. Does it look anything like the tier sets? No. It looks small and fragile, which makes my char look like a newbie when I step into a raid with geared people.
---
I have a button on my mic for that o.o
---
The whole reason I started playing it is because I used to play warcraft 2 and 3 with my cousin. he also hyped me to WOW and he was around the age of 20 back then. We are going at it again as soon as classic starts tho :)
---
So I too figured it would be mostly 18+ people playing it back then.
---
tilde-6 r t y a s d f g h z x c v
---
alt/ctrl modifiers of the above. This gives 60 key binds in total, and is accessible completely with your left hand.
---
Ma, bafrooom
---
I used to have my main abilities at 1,2,3,4. Then i discovered Q E R S and never looked back.
---
Jesus. And here I am remembering stumbling home hungover the morning after house parties to go and continue the grind to 60.
---
i hope they try and include some of the events like this and stuff like the mounts that became unobtainable (like the basic mounts that got removed)
---
At the end of the day, those arguments really only matter if you are min/maxing, which really isn't neccesary. My point is that most of them can do just fine. Sure, some NEET hardcore elitists don't approve of them, however people shouldn't play the game that those people want, they should play it the way they want themselves. :)
---
I agree. That's why I'm putting thought into deciding where I'm going next, for it may be the last faction I'll join
---
We had ways to communicate in the past. Most ppl used Ventrillo. Every raiding guild I ever joined had a Vent/Teamspeak requirement. So, we didn't have Discord, but we certainly had alternatives.
---
Don't get me wrong. I prefer playing Horde over playing Alliance if it is all up to me. I just love the sentiment of wanting to smash the other side, regardless of which one you are. Also, the sentence I quoted is well formulated ^^
---
&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance | NA |
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Website:** Please Please check this out, our screenshots, etc as it will help you better understand our past and what we do)**
---
&lt;https://www.prideofthealliance.com/&gt;
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server. in short we want you involved in the guild!

Using Razer Orbweaver Chroma and Naga Epic. 
---
On the orbweaver i have esc, tab, shift, crtl, 1234, qwer, asdf, zxcv. And then 12 buttons on naga.
---
I always group the keys the same way, regardless of char type. Example F is always a stun/interrupt. V is fear or antifear. Tbh these could be better in naga too, but gotten so used to those spots that unlearning it would take quite a while. But most essential skills, cd's and consumables (healthpots etc) are linked to naga buttons. Just because i want to have full char control while using these essential skills. Aka, like your frost nova on 5 sounds horrible to me. I want to move with full control and still be able to cast that. So it might be like 3 on naga grid. 
---
Spammy shit can be bound to mouse up and down just to reduce the amount of clicking required. Usually macros containing some kind of basic dps rotations/priority lists.
---
Struggle is real, its so real.
---
Is it UD wlock, priest, rogue or warrior
---
Maybe its orc shaman or warrior 
---
ooor nelf druid, rogue, priest or warrior
---
possibly even human paladin, wlock or priest
---
I hate myself
---
&gt; When Cataclysm was announced I got excited for WoW again.
---
Ouch.
---
Awesome. I always make it a habit to pick up all the relevant quests before going into an instance. 
---
Unfortunately, you are absolutely right. I am just trying to make sure I have a clear idea of exactly what I want to create so that I can hit the ground running as soon as the classic client is available.
---
BLASFEMY! nah jk, i was a fool and continued on retail but Bfa made me sick to my stomach, cant wait for vanilla again.
---
One of the last guilds I was apart of on a private server happened to be made up of almost all sweedish/Scandinavian people, and a couple of the only other Americans I thought had actually moved to finland and started calling themselves "Amerifins". Definitely alot of scandanavian people on classic wow
---
This is me minus one year. 
---
You're the blessed soul that can share most of the quests at the start of the dungeon! Cheers to you mate.
---
This right here is spot on what I'm looking forward to in Classic.
---
10/10 Best read all week.
---
Dalaran and dungeon finder in TBC ? wut? 
---
I think I must not understand the chronology you are using. 
---
Lol rotation. It’s basically a less powerful 3min mage, who can heal during his downtime.
---
Judge crusader, stun with hammer of justice, pop spell power trinkets, judge seal of command, holy shock, hammer of wrath
---
Got a six year old in the house 3-4 days a week. My significant other and I will play a shit ton.
---
Bruh, at the end of the day aren’t we all just insignificant dots on a rock hurling through infinite space and nothingness? Nothing we do really means anything, and the only difference between having kids and playing wow at the age of 30 is entirely governed by the metaphorical shifting of the line of what is and isn’t deemed acceptable by society...
---
That, or the mere concept of throwing countless, irreplaceable hours down the drain, staring into pixels and code rather than continuing the very cycle of life that led to our existance, is the antithesis of everything it is to be human.
---
Either way I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’ll see you in Stv brother. We’re going home. 
---

---
Its not much in raids but in 5 man, VE was great for helping the healer out.
---
Out of the 1-5 Id say 5 is the hardest to reach. Sometimes think about moving it elsewhere.
---
Don't let people give you grief about what you enjoy when it's harmless like WoW. You gotta make sure it stays harmless and take care of business and the people in your life first, but that applies to any hobby/passion.
---
40, gf, kid and work but will be playing as much as I can.
---
(From what I've gathered) all improved Slam does (when 5/5) is cut the cast time from 1.5 to 1 second. The whole idea of Slam is to not get interrupted doing it and most enemies already have 2 seconds between their cast times, meaning you can get a standard slam in immediately after they finish an attack. Those 5 points spent shaving the .5 second off are better spent elsewhere.
---
So did I, except in duels outside IF on Ursin.  I remember he raged hard about losing a duel against me when I used Chained Essence of Eranikus trinket against him to stop restealth.
---
Or warrior with a healer. 
---
There was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFZSHqgkpw) of a spell damage paladin in pvp. He had the meteor trinket from AQ and would go around WRECKING people. 
---
That would be 2v2 then wouldn’t it
---
Yeah, thats where I used to play aswell. I played Horde with &lt;nam&gt;
---
That spec looks fun! Still good enough to heal shit in raids / dugeons (fu, elitist minmax jerks no one cares) and looks very fun in PvP. 
---
Keep your ugly fuckin' goldbrickin' ass out of my beach community.
---
That's a pretty grand assumption that Classic will only be played by private server patrons.  Do you honestly think that Classic would be worth the time, effort and expense to develop and support if ActiBlizz thought it would only attract less than 100,000 players?
---
And yes, Classic players are going to hold the game's quality to a very high standard...just like they have come to hold private servers to an equally high "Blizzlike" standard.  /r/wowservers has accumulated years of nerdrage from players who quit their latest private server because 1 or 2 dungeon mechanics didn't work perfectly, a resource regen rate was screwy, quests weren't working or some other imperfection pissed them off.
---
Just wait until Classic releases and watch the forums fill up with crying and bitching about everything that players think is inconsistent with 2004-2006 Vanilla, along with threatening to quit if it isn't fixed immediately.
---
My dad made my little brothers and I read the manual before being able to play. I finished it and my brothers didn't. Needless to say who was allowed to raid with dad and mom..
---
Yeah,  my timeline is fuzzy for sure.
---
But the results are the same
---
It's fine to not relate.  But you are casting their playstyle in such a negative light just to explain how you can't relate and it comes off pretty crass, whether it's intended or not.  And honestly, it sounds intended when you talk about 'being a snowflake' and such.
---
They get enjoyment out of playing that class/spec.  You don't have to relate, but you also don't have to talk down about it either.  
---
Someone's having PTSD flashbacks ;)
---
Mine is more of a tl;dr. Retail sucks and I hate it and they've changed it so much that it's practically not even an MMO anymore, just a single player game with some basic online lobby functionality.
---
Classic wen?
---
I would rather live my life in wow
---
Can u link me because I think I heard the opposite somewhere?
---
Jeg er så gammel at jeg spillede i betaen, vanilla, bc og wrath (stoppede i cata).
---
Håber også at se mange danskere tilbage men spørgsmålet bliver nok om der er nok til at lave et all out dansk guild :/
---
I might have missed a lot of the LookingForGuild post. Most EU guilds tend to be allience, whereas I'm going for Horde.
---
6-12 months after naxx release
---
36, married, 3 kids, checks this sub for release date every hour. It's gonna be a rough summer :P
---
Nice, I like the random pieces more than the set pieces too, it’s way cooler! 👌
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**​Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
​
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.

Did you read my post?
---
I think they are adorable little ferrets. So curious it gets them into trouble all the time. I can see the pvp irritation. In the rare instances I'm actually pvping I'm either healing or afk fishing AV though so it's less of an issue for me. 
---

That fire breathing trinket you get from that dude in westfall mountains that makes you run around the whole azeroth.
---
It most definitely is! Most fun I've had with Paladin in PvP. Not sure why I'm getting downvotes though, that must be from the fun police haha.
---
Raids were probably not balanced with the idea that entire groups should get Heart of Hakkar, Head of Onyxia, Sunflower and Tribute buffs before entering the raid instance. That said, it is POSSIBLE to do these things, and over time it has become part of the meta to do so.
---
Was it intended for 40 people to simultaneously click a single cleansed Sunflower to receive a nice buff?
---
With all of these buffs combined, it's like having 2x or 3x the stats on your gear. I'm not sure they designed the raids around these kind of stats...
---
There are a lot of things that are technically POSSIBLE in an MMO. Some things (like the bombs on LK platform) were POSSIBLE, but considered an exploit. There were a lot of wonky/buggy things about vanilla that the simply did away with by releasing more content that eliminated the need for them to go back &amp; address from a balance perspective.
---
Yeah I'll be playing Horde too. Most Guilds seem to be alliance but there's a few EU horde guilds inbetween the masses. 
---
Same but I told my cat instead
---
Ha! 33 yrs old, married, talking kids soon w wifey 🥴, and hyped for Classic. I feel like one we get in there we’ll remember how much TIME it can suck up! I plan on playing a couple hours a day IF possible and maybe a long weekend shred. 
---
Honestly I work at a desk so my wrists and fingers can start to hurt 
---
Some arguments for choosing a NE priest over a dwarf priest: 
---
* They look sexy af
---
* They do flips and you can challenge yourself to do the most flips in a row
---
* They get tiger mounts by default
---
* They start in fucking Teldrassil, the most nostalgic starting zone out of the 3! (Obviously subjective, but for me it's the truth)
---
* You get to stealth at will, whether you use it to afk safely, to drink, or to wait for victims to mindcontrol is for you to decide. 
---
* You actually visually see when you change a piece of your gear. Gl having that with Dwarfs.
---
That's some that I can think of. Biggest thing I dislike to lose is Desperate Prayer and 10% faster rep gains of human. But I'll cope with those, and I'm certain there will be enough dwarfs so I can make my mission to be the best NE priest of my server.
---
I was seven when my dad got me WoW in BC. My brother got a PC at the same time and must’ve been only 3 turning 4 playing WOW and CoD4 lmao.
---
In PvP I don't really do rotations because of the dynamicity. However, if I get someone at 50% I usually try to go for the kill by stunning(optional), auto attack, Divine Favor into Holy Shock, Judgement and hope they are in range for Hammer of Wrath to finish it off.
---
Meme specs arw great in pvp and dungeons.
---
But are you absolutely fizzing?  
---
It was so great for the duration of vanilla, many of my real life friends and classmates played. We'd talk about it all the time and play on our laptops in the library most mornings. Good times. 
---
It depends on what your idea of "viable" is - people have FUN playing enhancement. If your goal is top-shelf performance in raids, there are other classes/specs you will want to look at.
---
My friends and I played WoW from 11-16 over vanilla BC and wotlk and it was fucking amazing. Very glad to have those memories now at 25 and I turned out okay. Just saying.
---
It’s absolutely not the purpose of this meme!
---
There's a huge difference between playing on private servers and official servers. When you start on a fresh private server and see that some mechanics don't function accordingly, of course you're thinking about quitting as you know for a fact that no private server lasts. The only ones that won't get wiped by Blizzard are the trash ones. So you know you server has a relatively short half-life - why would you stay there if core mechanics like energy regen are scewed right from the beginning?
---
First of all I'm pretty damn sure things like energy regen which are a huge part of the gameplay won't be overlooked or bugged. Those are too big and Blizzard knows that.
---
But there is, never has been and never will be a game release without bugs. That's software development. And players know that and they won't leave. 
---
&gt; That's a pretty grand assumption that Classic will only be played by private server patrons.
---
That's at least a big part of the playerbase and the other players, that don't even know classic, will never even recognize the small bugs that **may** be in the game for release.
---
I'm not saying Blizzard can be sloppy in any way with their development but if there are small bugs and or small things to readjust it won't kill the game. The alternative are pservers and players do hate to play on them so much that they're willing to pay over a 100$ per year, just to play a 15 year old game on official servers. 
---
You make that gold on day one. I teamed up with a mate for the magic wand marked. We made a lot more than you would think. Plenty of casters willing to spend what little they have to kill stuff at a decent speed. We made around 120gold and owed like 10gold for greens to friends 
---
Norwegian here, we are about 50 norwegians and 1 swede planning to play together, I know a lot of them lurk around here. We are still debating lf we are going to be an international guild or just stick with having 1 exotic swede.
---
This quote should be posted to every change thread
---
It’s not the most efficient, but it is doable. Depending on how often you raid versus what your respec costs are will dictate whether or not it makes sense for you. 
---
Priest was my first character at launch and I was deep holy because I assumed you needed to be in order to heal dungeons, hah. 
---
Feralas is a gorgeous zone that seems to define the wild, untamed side of Kalimdor. It's also frequented by people in the mid-level 40s, when most classes are starting to access some cool talents &amp; spells that really start to make the game fun.
---
Summons aren't required for world buffs and at no point did anyone suggest blizzard not impliment the dragon slayer buff cd. 
---
Oh I didn't know Smite and wanding were so useful in raids.
---
24 teaching a 5th grade class right now. 
---
I was around 8-10 years old when I played another MMO. (The 4th Coming) and got into Vanilla WoW a bit later, though I had to play it at a friends place and had to wait until it was my turn. X.x
---
Man you were lucky. Our only pc was in my mom's bedroom :(

**CHECKING FOR LATE NIGHT INTEREST** **EU**
---
Hello everyone.
---
I have been a wow player since late vanilla both truly hardcore(8th world) and semi hardcore after cata due to working the normal raid hours. I will waste my life on classic and i am trying to figure out if there is actually an audience that want to play late night like me. I am willing to start a guild if there is enough interest. Atm we are like 5 irl friends. We wanna go hard both pve and pvp wise. Raid hours would be prolly around 23.30ST but nothing is decided yet. Also we would prefer to play Aliance but this can be discussed and we can vote with more people.
---
I guess some people would maybe wanna play classic after they finish raiding at retail?
---
Anyway throwing this out there so if you are interested add me on discord: KingMavros#2601
---
If someone rejected me because of the race I had chosen, I would be happy not to play with them ;)
---
Since u havn't fully decided how u will make it work 100% exactly this is what i would do one of these if i was u.
---
One being the amount of time it took u from ur last purchase to spend x amount of arrows. So let's say first time u bought 1200 arrows and it took u 2 hours to use all. But next time u bought 1600 arrows and it estimates 2 hours 40 mins (this shouldn't be the timer, but u could let people know the estimated amount of time arrows will hold while u are buying the arrows)
---
The timer however should be 2 diffrent types.
---
(One of them can show when u mouse over)
---
I would put this one as standard. Having just the amount of arrows used / min devided with total. This however will not be very accurate the first few mins but after you started shooting out some it will start going to an accurate amount. 
---
The second one (the one when u hover) should be a "How long it will last if u keep the phase up u had the last 5 mins"
---
This is good if u were questing for a long time (therefore u didn't spam arrows) but now u changed to farming. If u go from quest to farming u might start spending 2x more arrrows and therefore the 2 timers will be way diffrent.
---
So the timer might be like "1 hour 20 mins left"
---
But if u hover over it will say "If u keep current phase up it will be 40 mins until no arrows is left"
---
Oh I see, thank you. 
---
I like this feature. Even if it's open for abuse by concerting players, they should let the GM ban whoever did wrong (either the guy reported or the false reports).
---
But I can live without it, as long as my ban list is infinite (I think it was something like 10 or 20 in Vanilla, it was filling very fast).
---
Dude, Staysafe did the exact fucking same.
---
haha sorry I couldn't resist &gt;&lt;
---
There is always a demand for dungeon tanks at 60. Most people (in my experience) burn out leveling around warrior in the high 40s, and out of those that don’t, the majority of them only want to dps when they hit 60.  
---
Great, good luck Mooxi3!
---
I played a disc priest in vanilla, power infusion was great but there is a cooldown.  It takes a bit to farm stuff and you gotta drink often.  The ways I worked around this.
---
1) Always have a partner to farm with.  It's more fun and they will almost always be happy to help because you can just heal them.  Its also fun to have two people in case someone wants to try and gank you.
---
2) I ran dungeons always.  I used to farm for orbs and I never had problem finding a group as a healer.
---
3) Farm things that don't require a whole lot of fighting.  Try fishing for stonescale eels or picking flowers or something.
---
Probably has to do with the population, as all scandinavian countries combined has less people in it, than just texas.
---
It's not a "zone" but Thunderbluff
---
easily top 3 in most chill relaxing place 
---
I highly doubt there will be a thing as too many tanks. It takes a lot of commitment to get the gear, farm the consumables, and if you want to kill anything you’ll have to respec. Raids will live and die by your successes or mistakes and you will have to know all boss encounters well. And don’t forget that you’ll have the highest repair bills of anyone. 
---
It’s a very stressful and thankless choice. Some will burn out and others will just say fuck it and go DPS. So if you want to be a tank there will always be a spot for you. 
---
Think how much you're saving vs real therapy!
---
"Nelf Warrior", @Swifty
---
The fun minmaxtryhard police indeed. Played a lot of shockadin in TBC. Was way more fun than just healing in PvP.
---
Told my wife that she needs to prepare herself, because what is coming may shake the foundations of our marriage. 
---
I want it as it was in Vanilla. I don't run on private servers. 
---
Consumes/attendance/mechanics.
---
Hey, how is he healing more than 6 targets with VE?
---
The only tip that I can give you is to wait for the new 1.13 client. It's based on a modern Legion client and should be able to give you any resolution.
---
Classic WoW isn't going to use the 1.12 client. You'll be okay.
---
It sounds like a useful add on, but arguably rather useless. At no point am I considering “ I should have enough ammo for this instance”- it’s always just get a full quiver and be on my way. 
---
Maybe other hunters would find it useful, but it seems rather pointless in how easy it is to refill on a whim from vendors. 
---
Back in the day my guild roster was roughly 50% Norwegians, 30% Swedes, 15% Danes, and then a few other nationalities. I have a lot of fond memories from that community.
---
It might just have been a co-inc-i-dinc that everyone just clicked, but with 50-60 active players, I'd say that's highly unlikely.
---
No high horse. I just want the gameplay and all it's quirks to be as I remember since Vanilla is my fav version of WoW. Don't care for changes and if I did I'd have that game in retail. Let the classic folks have classic.
---
If played well, a sPriest dps can reach the warlock dps at least for all BWL content, after I don't know. Btw a sPriest is a mana potions black hole.
---
Shadow Priest can still bubble people and dispel from shadowform.
---
That day/night cycle! Wish it was still like that and Classic will have it to some extent..
---
VIRAL, ah shit, another blast from the past.
---
The best addons are addons the users EASILY can make some configurations.
---
Let the player choose when they want a warning. Like, they type in 200 in some box, if he go under 200 arrows  / bullets in bags he'll get a warning every 10 arrow he shoots or something.
---
Everyone likes it different, make it customizable.
---
Yes.
---
Just continue kiting, while whispering your buddy to bring you more knives.
---
can only speak for the windows client,      
---
i run mine vanilla client in 4K     
---
the only possible way to set the resolution (+ WindowMode, in my case)
---
was directly editing the [config.wtf](https://config.wtf)
---
SET gxResolution "1920x1080"      
---
hope it works the same way on mac.
---
Ah, you could be right!
---
I was glad Season 1-3 in BG9 so maybe it is just me noticing things. But hindsight is 20-20.
---
True. But then again EU has roughly the same amount of citizens as NA, yet there are way more NA guilds looking for members than EU.
---
Hear hear
---
Develop one to buy ammo at the vendor. They used to have one that restocked reageants and ammo when you opened the window. Could also buy certain amount of food that you could set the amount for. 
---
It is taking over 10 years to get a regurgitated product from Blizz. They have a tiny team and aren't really rebuilding things but trying to copy paste off old stuff. I'd be happy to be proven wrong but it won't happen.
---
Get this casual outta here.  /s
---
It’s more than just this game; video games are an easy out from real life which makes it hard for a lot of people to participate IRL. 
---
There are a few crappy runs, like that first run from TB to Org (or vice versa) which most characters will have to do in their early to mid teen levels for the RFC quest (especially bad for people leveling in Silverpine since they don't have Xroads), and the run to get to Kargath for the first time (basically a corpse run on overpopulated servers).  Other than those 2 cases, yes, Horde has much better "public transit".  The real game changer is that UC and Org are basically connected via zeps, whereas the inter-continental transit for Alliance is between non-capital cities.
---
I'll do what I want, mom!
---
So, Protection warriors have no place in PvP at all? That's a very good point to think about the major stresses of being the main tank . I Think will consider off tank then lol,
---
Getting ganked by a rogue only to relog my main and never find the little critter.
---
Same here, 30 years old and no wife/kids as of yet, so I'll be able to semi-no-life the heck out of Classic.
---
Still have work and other hobbies, though, so probably only like 20-40 hours per week, which is rather modest compared to my past gaming hours :P
---
Though for the first week or two it'll be 100 hours per week, full-on-grinding.... if I manage to get those weeks off work.
---
Tanks are always in demand for dungeons but raid tanks are almost never needed.
---
[don't tell me what to do](https://youtu.be/AwNJ8TMa0fA)
---
Tauren Shaman, need that War Stomp for CC.
---
They can hold on to flags, sit at Farm/Stables, and tank the AV boss. But that’s about it. 
---
That's exactly what he's saying. It only gets harder and harder to participate IRL.
---
I won't, I'll screw it up to raid naxx
---
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to clarify. I am running Windows 10 in UEFI mode (no bios emulation). I wanted to avoid running in Windowed Mode + Fullscreen.  Even if I do employ windowed mode the resolution still won't go above 1600x1200 but I will give your method a try. Thanks for the headsup :)
---
Yeah the burn out must hit a lot of people hard, in the few levels I did on PS. Are tanks often fought over between guilds or are they expected to have strong loyalties? 
---
Where in Darn would that be? Tyrande's location? If not it looks really similar to Gnomer. So hard to tell.
---
The middle guy is in Warsong Gultch and the far right is in Ashenvale.
---
But if I wanted to make gold for example, I could sell my ability to tank dungeons, for gold? 
---
Amen! Plus I hear if you get 5 flips in a row, you get a prize!
---
I was wondering how he got a 1.12 client because the only people that run that are private servers. And blizzard will run off the legion client.
---
Interesting seeing how Darkshire originally looked. The final version feels much more claustrophobic, being hemmed in on all sides by trees and hills. 
---
Is there any Dutch guild :)? Or is someone planning to make one? \[EU\], any server type, raiding, wpvp.
---
Just go 31/20 you lil bitches.  You don't need to change your PvE spec to PvP you only need to change your gear.  Lil Bitches
---
My favorite times was sharing a new high score in gchat mid fight...or better yet mid wipe :p
---
Rogue ganks one person a couple times then changes characters for 15 minutes to farm on their alt.
---
"I'm an asshole!"
---
Lots of ~~wrong~~ alternative playstyles ITT. At 60, I wouldn't recommending going anything other than 30/0/21. 
---
For leveling here is the "best" spec: [level 20](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZx0bZL), [level 28 pick up corpsemaker](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbzZx0o), [level 39 should look something like this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVrzzZx0ez). Keep in mind that the natures guidance talent gives one % hit to both spells and melee. This is big, reduces kill time, rest time, and comes with totem mastery which is great for healing instances while leveling. 
---
At 40 if you can pick up the full "Turtle Scale" set crafted by leatherworkers and coldrage dagger, [spec like this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hi0uVcGqo). With full elemental and the turtle scale set, you'll do very well in world pvp. The 31 point talent is basically a free kill on cooldown. The armor is some of the only items that have Stam, Int, AND spirit with lots of armor. Super strong. Also, you'll only need the one set of gear[no swapping gear to heal a dungeon].
---
Lightening shield + searing totem, pull with LB/CL, shock(most recent trained is usually best damage/mana), melee -&gt; loot. If you can stand still for two or more kills use mana spring totem. 
---
Shaman talents scale pretty well with gear. The problem with going enhance is you're not going to have much crit chance to proc flurry because there simply isn't much gear to provide it. Past the natures guidance/totemic mastery talents, resto provides nothing aside from slightly better healing at the cost of leveling speed.
---
40 here, but the rest is exactly the same.  
---
I imagine then, most warriors at endgame will end up being a Combo of Arms/Fury, as the restrictions Prot has?
---
I would never pay a member of my normal dungeon group. Thats only acceptable if your in T3 or something like that
---
Fun fact the clown suit leveling gear in tbc are all recolors of vanilla armor they didn't GE. A chance to use during endgame.
---
I would say the arrow notification or display is definitely a value add. You may need more features to get the downloads as a successful add on though. Food for your pet is also really important, and people forget that as well. 
---
If you had an add-on with a hunter shot timer, arrow refill notification, pet locations for various abilities (claw ranks, bite ranks, prowl, dash) food refill, this would be the ultimate hunter add on :)
---
THE HORDE IS MY FAMILY.
---
 No, but.. I hit the jackpot. I'll be playing Vanilla WoW with my girlfriend (whom got me into playing WoW again, that nerd!) while my son plays PS4 and her daughter learns how to walk, for the Horde!
---
Easy stuff, ofc family and job is more important. But, it's also important to spend your life with what you love doing.
---
I remember raiding with people who were married and had kids back when I was a teen. If they could do it back then, we can do it now
---
more than 1 SPriest in the raid of course ;) 
---
If you’re PVPing you go Arms. Even Arms warriors respec to go Fury for raids. 
---
If they were well geared I meant, my bad. Guessing lower levels 45-59s wouldn't pay for a Higher tank then? 
---
Drinking isn't a huge issue if you cast your spells together and let your mana regen kick in. With proper gear(spirit stacking) and utilization of mana spring totem you can get away with drinking maybe once every 10 kills or after a double pull. 
---
I don't need to be realm first to screw up my life. I don't even need this game to screw up my life.
---
If its something they need than I would say yes.
---
loved my SPriest. Gonna be playing one as my main again Soon*
---
I've got some thinking to do now then lol, thanks!
---
Don't fury wars/rogues generally stack as much hit as possible anyway since whites are important for dps/rage gen/poisons/etc?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;― Ion Hazzikostas, Blizzcon 2018
---
I'm 27 and recently married. It's a shame really, classic might prevent us making it to the year mark 
---
That's what I said lol
---
Absolutely. Holy Paladins still need as much healy cloth as other healers. Much of the BiS gear for pallies is cloth.
---
I started playing when I was 7
---
A lot of times all tank loot gets funneled to one guy that’s the guild’s main tank. Then of course with so much loot invested in one person that person is expected to show up at every raid because spreading tank loot around really limits your guild’s progression. If someone were to jump ship well then that really pisses off the other 39 people that geared you and even the new guild would be wary of someone that screwed over their former mates. 
---
Haha it's such an amazing game. 2nd highest rated game on Steam of all time. Only behind Portal 2. 
---
I don't remember subscribing to your blog. 
---
When you are a level 60 mage and see a level 60 priest. You give him the intelect buff, he sees the animation above his head.
---
He gives you the stamina buff back in return. Little does he know you gave him a Rank 1 intelect buff just to bait the Stamina buff.
---
There goes alot of tought into being a dick.
---
&gt; It's mental to me that you can't grasp that OTHER people might enjoy OTHER things...
---
And it's mental to me that you're trying to justify making the game worse for other people by saying "it makes the game more enjoyable for me".
---
What are your thoughts on murder?
---
The pre wrath patch absolutely ruined holy paladin damage, I could barely do my dailies after it was released.  
---
Before that shockadin was so much fun, you could 1v1 anyone, either winning or just never dying.
---
For sure. 
---
Thanks for the feedback! I was wondering what people thought of the filter. Maybe next video I'll take it out.
---

---
I will play a warrior tank too.  During Vanilla I played as a keyboard turning, ability clicking warrior.  I had people begging (at their own perril) me to tank dungeons for them.  They insisted that they could prop me up no matter how much I sucked.  I remember a BRD run and a few UD strat runs well, and they indeed were just awful.  
---
All throughout my time playing WoW, tanks have always been in high demand, and I don't think that will change in classic.  Also, can you imagine if there were too many tanks?  I'd happily change my objective of being a tank and switch to damage instead.  
---
And even less likely to barge into the adult's room in the basement of their house. 
---
Can someone please explain why people prefer the bottom armor set? It honestly seems like masochism to me.
---
It is definitely the dude withour socks's house!
---
In my experience never ever. You are so broke in classic, and you can just wait 15min for another tank to show up
---
Everyone can get a relationship. Close to no one gets server first 60. Dont compare average to awesomeness.
---
Make an alt for farming
---
Yeah that ring is pretty powerful. Basically any ring with armor is powerful for a druid tank because of the armor bonus dire bear form gives.
---
Mom?
---
23 and I'll be freshly graduated from college and single. Ready to be a degenerate one last time.
---
And everyone loves Zandalar plate. 
---
High Quality Shitpost here lads, tiptop
---
I was kind of serious but whatever.
---
There's your problem: you are gaming on a mac.
---
I'm not sure it'd be all that useful to have a "time until running out of ammo" timer, mostly because that'd be pretty hard to accurately calculate (unless you're just sitting there autoshotting perfectly and not doing anything else) and most hunters kinda already have an idea of how much ammo they use in a certain timeframe. Would be much better to just have an addon pop up messages if you go below a specified amount of ammo or something.
---
I'm certain most of you have already seen tons of WoW Alpha images on this subreddit these past months, but I recently discovered some images I had never seen before so I decided to make an album out of them and share it here.
---
Have they confirmed it though? I know they said they might be using some kind of alternate gear system to avoid ninja looting and I could easily see cloth for say pallies falling under that umbrella.
---
Dont feel guilty! In my opinion, it’s your life and you can live it however you want. As long as you are taking care of your basic needs and responsibilities, you should not feel bad about doing what makes you happy!
---
Yes! day/night cycle really contributes to the atmosphere of the game,  I'd love to see it added to classic.
---
The 4:3 is strong with this one.
---
I have my main trinket on CTRL-F and if I have a second useable, ist on CTRL-R.
---
That said, when playing pvp my insignia is my main/only useable trinket and therefore is on CTRL-F. I posted a screenshot once about my bugged Arena addon to a friend and he was like "the fuck is wrong with you dude? Do you use both Hands to use your insignia? How the hell are you reaching CTRL-P?"
---
For his defense, F and P are not so different and if the window is small it can really get mistaken.
---
Not in premade WSG or AB they don't there's just too few slots and too many good pvp specs. Problem is in WSG the MS debuff is so important for taking down flag carriers on teams who are properly supporting them. Then in AB the playstyle tends more towards offensive than defense, and you're not even that good on defense thanks to lack of stalling abilities.
---
Proc can actually be really fun in pvp. Shield slam dispelling, shield bash silencing, tossing out the occasional CB stun. So it's not like you need to respec every time you step into a BG, it's just that other specs are so much better.
---
No, it’s called being overly politically correct, and is results in lower amounts of trust.
---
Rouges can't kill druids within a stunlock. Once druid breaks out of stun, pops an instant cast heal and goes into bear form = GG. Druid can pop faire fire, stun, run away, root, heal and hot up, whatever.
---
At 60-70% damage reduction, with huge hp pool, heals and HoT-like poison removal rouges can't really do anything.
---
Yeah no kidding. I feel like I'm going to be a old bastard in Classic. 
---
Thats the thing, a dead dps is worthless but a ret cant die.
---
You jusy want us to be casual so you grab the realm first 60... I see what you are doing. Now I have to break up with my gf to compete with you for realm first. 
---
Look what you made me do!
---
Obvious troll is obvious. 
---
The game isn't worse. You can either group with the player or you don't. If you are struggling to find a group due to lack of Dwarf Priests... Make the game easier for yourself and play Dwarf Priest, if you DONT want to, then that's the same feeling as everyone else being pigeon holes into a spec. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMFs1rQxY\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMFs1rQxY_8)
---
Thats for sure to say, usually 5 is a small cooldown ability (HoJ for Pally for example)
---
Yeah the buildings also looks a lot different, too bad most of them are closed off.
---
What Tanks will sometimes do is reserve certain items that sell gold. Example: reserving the first righteous orb or two in a Stratholme live run and making the rest of them round robin. This means you’re pretty much guaranteed 15 - 30 gold depending on the price each strat run.
---
Im strafing with right click pressed :P?
---
But it's running Windows10 :)
---
I used to play as one, some 2 handed version (Holy shock, Seal of Command). It was pretty fun, especially after reckoning, which gets boring real fast (I was in pre-raid gear only, some dungeon set 2).  
---
There are some videos around, mainly I recall a paladin called  [Dernos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFZSHqgkpw).  
---
While in vanilla it was not super powerful (in TBC better it got more burst than ever), I can still recommend it if you like the class fantasy. Never tried in PVE, it's too mana heavy, but since you go deep holy for it, you can switch to heal pretty easily (and you can keep your talents!). 
---
I was 19 when vanilla came out. It makes sense looking back why I thought I was so hot at PvP, all my opponents didn't even know how to read. 
---
15 minutes lol
---
[21/30/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsu0oZbxtsc0ax) is the healing spec I'm toying with for Classic for while I'm gearing up for PVP, not too different from a raiding spec so unless you're in a min/maxing guild you'll probably get away with not having to respec.
---
I didn't get into WoW until I was in college because I lived out in the middle of nowhere growing up and our internet couldn't support online games.  But I started in 2006 when I was 18 with my roommates and our dorm room all throughout college looked something like this, too.  Just replace the soda cans with beer bottles.
---
I understand. I just hate we don’t have that info because there’s some old and new addons I’d love to know I can have downloaded for launch. 
---
More of these is always better
---
Counterpoint: undead on raptors are cooler.
---
Where does this idea come from?
---
Are we talking simulations and private servers?
---
...and I loved every minute of it. I hope they just go through the expansions again in real time.
---
Yeah the massive time investment, and suddenly leaving after people funneling that effort and time. How are off-tanks geared in terms of priority? Whatever the main tank doesn't need, or does he fit in more with DPS?
---
Overall though, wouldn't shaving off half a second for cast time be beneficial in raid scenarios? Over the course of a fight, the improved casting time could lead to landing 3 to 4 extra attacks that you otherwise may not have been able to land.
---
I’m 30, wife/kids/homeowner.
---
Going to make my own guild and raid!
---
Depends on your guild’s loot system really. Sometimes there’s even a bear off-tank!
---
You will have to hit 2/3 of zones in your leveling range to level up regardless. The amount of exp gained from killing mobs is offset by being able to finish the quests faster and kill more mobs in a shorter span of time.
---
Pretty damn condescending telling people how to live their lives and participate in their hobbies, you got got intentions but keep them to yourself. Video games are my hobby, I'll participate in my hobby as much as I want to just as If I was watching TV, colouring Warhammer or whatever.
---
No? Catering to Esports elements and listening to min-maxers is exactly what gave us retail. How can you not know this?
---
That sounds like a good idea, how long did Strath take in Live with a decent party? 
---
Most guides I've read tell the opposite: spam low rank (4-5) healing touch.
---
Currently I'm using 3 ranks of HT with around 250 healing power (shitty green pre-raid gear):
---
Rank 4 is the spammable low cost one for small bruises.
---
Rank 6 is when you need actual healing. If tank takes heavy 
---
 but manageable damage, I precast this one non-stop.
---
Max rank when using Nature's swiftness or when shit hits the fan (at that point I'm also using regrowth and popping ever potion and consumable in existence). So pretty rarely.
---
Sad but true. I do know a ton of people who got married young and are still happily married, but I've seen a few who got divorced after marrying young - some after having a couple of kids. So nobody should feel bad for getting married at a more average age - at least you're in a better place in life to do so and won't screw it up!
---
My hope is that they just move through the expacs in real time. 
---
Yeah mate I ran a raiding guild and was an avid pvper back in original wow got to rank 14 and lead a guild to clear through to BWL. Going to be running the guild again probs call it bring back the biff like the old one. anyways add me on NiceNFresh#1901 on bnet and ill hit you up @ release
---
"Why limit yourself"
---
When you don't limit yourself you tend to get personality issues, like sociopathy.
---
I suppose it ultimately comes down to what you find more fun! But from what you and other people have said it seems Prot is gonna be gimping PvP and especially 1v1's. 
---
I'm guessing footing a repair bill for a tank isn't a cheap expense either
---
It's all about having to spend those 5 points being better spent elsewhere. If you had 5 points in improved slam you'd lose deep wounds and impale for instance, or dual wield spec, or flurry. All of which will provide a bigger DPS boost than half a second of slam casting.
---
This is amazing
---
You. Monster. I love you. 
---
&gt;I'll be combat rogue. 
---
NERF combat rogue. 
---
I have no clue what is happening in pic #58 but it looks like a damn good time.
---
implying you know absolutely without fail what your future self will want to do with its life.
---
good luck with that.

My older brother went off to college in 2004 and my younger brother and parents didn't care to use the PC other than checking a few things now and again. I essentially made my family computer my WoW rig for a while until I was able to convince my parents to buy me an early graduation gift in 2006. 
---
I commuted to College so they were happy enough with the amount of money I was saving them on room &amp; board that they splurged a little.
---
Let's move forward **after* Classic
---
If they do that shaman, druids and paladins are screwed since alot of their pre raid bis is cloth
---
Well yeah, we can look back to these videos over a decade ago and notice tons of mistakes, even down to the things he was good at like his mechanics, that's just how it was, I was glad every season in BC too so you'll probably agree that the standard even then wasn't high, skip forward to late wrath and beyond and people were on a whole new level, most gladiators back then would be part of this though and just follow the pack upwards. 
---
Grim wasn't really an exception, I distinctly remember him being high rated and achieving gladiator, he was considered the best on the server along with rogues like Xom (who he also played with), Xom if you remember was actually a pro player and won some big tournaments early in wrath as RMP when shadowdance was fotm.
---
There are players like you mentioned though, that were more gear than skill and had selective clips that made them look better than they were, they couldn't handle the competitive environment o when it was finally released with arena in BC. 
---
34, no kids or gf. I devote most of my time to my career and enjoy working long hours. I very casually play a couple games now, CK2, BFA, etc. But I'm going to go hardcore into Classic and have never waited on a release this impatiently. I check this sub and a couple other places multiple times every day for any sliver of news. So excited.
---
It would have definitely been great to see demons receive the kind of treatment undead got with all their dungeons.
---
The only thing they were toying with was loot trading, that's it. That's now been confirmed as only applying to raids.
---
Restricting loot to armor classes completely changes the game, it ain't happening.
---
as much as possible isn't quite right. you stack as much as possible to a point, but it will hit something of a soft cap between 8 and 9%. from there, it has value, but it isn't so good that you forego other stats just for it. generally, your best gear combination will be whichever one combines enough hit% to push up your crit cap just past whatever your crit%. 
---
Yeah, I wouldn't think they would do it since it would be awful I was just kind of worried about it.
---
Prove yourself as a good tank during leveling and you'll get plenty of invite to tank at lvl 60
---
If its not screwin your life up then why did you take offense?
---
there is only 1 universal truth to this:
---
its your life
---
It cost rage, rage is for whirlwind or mortal strike hell even rend for that Lucky overpower
---
Finally a thread I can relate to
---
What is the wall of no?
---
Private servers and dps spreadsheets.  If you hear correctly warriors are #1 preaq40.  World buffs are huge, they give insane amounts of crit and stats.  This critting builds more rage and allows them to deal exponentially more damage.
---
They have confirmed they will not use anything like that outside raiding. You Will be able to ninja loot in deadmines :) 
---
Back in Vanilla / TBC I used a gear spreadsheet which helped me min-max my hit/crit.  I was a rogue.  I bet one exists for fury wars!
---
LF Late night US guild
---
Hey all,
---
I'm looking for a guild that plans to raid late night hours due to my work schedule. Somewhere in the 2am est to 6am est range. I'm fine with either horde or alliance. 
---
I'd consider myself semi-hardcore, and plan to take the first week off to level and then play ~40 hours a week following that. Planning on playing druid, and also highly interested in pvp. (WSG premade would be ideal)
---
Also interested in finding other like minded people who plan to play the same hours to chill with.
---
Feel free to message with any questions. 
---
-Zek
---
1 hour wasn't even long enough to get a dungeon group together. 
---
That's true! I play retail and people are still always looking for tanks of any ability either leveling or endgame, wish I'd thought about that before hand, I guess with classic we assume it's going to a different game, but it will probably fit the same mold for DPS/healer/tank balance.
---
Well, if you already have 5 healadin, I'd take a furry warrior ko questions asked over a ret. It is relative. 
---
I am that little 22 year old kid now waiting for Classic lol
---
very naisu.
---
Getting that blade right at 45 would make the last 15 levels oh so sweet
---
&gt; Honestly I work at a desk so my wrists and fingers can start to hurt
---
Get a better desk setup and home and work to mitigate that, and learn some exercises and stretches to prevent inflammation and pain. Also take breaks. :) 
---
Here I'll save you the pain I had to go through (and subequent visits with the Occupational Hand Therapist) and tell you to search for tendon gliding exercises and nerve glides (there's several of the latter). Practice those when you feel pain coming or think you've done too much at a computer and you'll be able to game as long as you want. Plus, stronger hands/wrists helps as well so do what you can to strengthen those when you're not in pain.
---
Here's the dirty secret that they will never tell you -
---
This certainly won't apply to everyone, but I can promise you that more than one of them are jealous of your position. I'm in my 30's, child free, and single. I can't tell you how many married men (with and without kids) have told me in private that if they could go back and do it all over again they would have either never gotten married at all, or at minimum waited several years to do it. 
---
I was in my 30s.
---
Yes
---
I remember getting to un’goro being a really big deal in my mind, second only to maybe stranglethorn vale. It was a place everyone seemed to go once they were high enough, but that didn’t make it any less intimidating. 
---
I’m pretty sure devilsaur mafia is just a private server creation, though. Blizzard wouldn’t have tolerated that kind of extortion and cross-faction cooperation in vanilla and I doubt they would now. Classic should be free of that. 
---
Hey, give it a shot, you can always respec fury or arms later on :) Tanking is fun, and if people annoys you, you can just be a diva and do whatever you want because group NEEDS you :)
---
&gt;  I know they said they might be using some kind of alternate gear system to avoid ninja looting
---
They have never said that and will not do that.
---
Looool.
---
Does Warcraft have a point down emote? 
---
Why fuck transmogs? Sometimes for a player to have a pleasant experience in the game and be immersed in the world, they need their character to at least look like a warrior, and not some clown. Hell, if you want to be a particular character in the world (like a pirate), then your immersion relies upon your armor sets. I played city of heroes for the longest time (rip) and i can tell you how much the costume creator was key to a lot of peoples enjoyment of the game.
---
I thought it would be neat for there to be speed leveling league type servers that open eventually. They would reward each bracket with monetary rewards like pets in game. No impact but visual prestige. Each league would reset after the first player of each class hits 60. 
---
This would create longevity for the game and would be fun! Plus Easter eggs something something profit. 
---
Speak for yourself man. You sleep i grind suck my arms.
---
Its all relative, too. I'm in THE MIDDLE OF BUILDING MY FIRST (and only, god willing) HOUSE and its likely to be done in August/September. So this year has a weird homecoming feel to it. On the one hand I'll get to play early WoW again (so community, guilds, actual interactions with ppl in game, yay) but I'll also get to do so in the place i'll likely live out my children's "birth to moving out" years. 
---
So I get if you already have a daughter and a house..... those things may be old hat (lol your daughter is old).
---
Jokes aside, I think all anyone is ever excited about is progress (though...... classicWoW is more regress?)
---
Ah, now I realize where all these comments on "fabled" Shockadin specs are coming from. Didnt remember it being a big deal in BC
---
Pro tip in dungeon : let a dps aggro a mob on purpose, feral charge it, shift out, innervate the healer, shift back just as the mobs reach you.
---
Saved a few wipes like that.
---
 **&lt;Relapse&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild, specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Our Official Raid Times are as follows:
---
**Tuesday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
**Thursday:** 8:30PM EST - 12PM EST
---
There is a chance we do cleanup on the weekends and possibly 20 mans, but that is up in the air and dependent on if people want to/are available.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
DK here.. only scandie-guild I’ve seen required you to be able to communicate in Swedish/Norwidish, so almost there😆 
---
Ok hopefully i will not regret this but have some faith in Blizzard. They seem to be litsening to the classic community atleast. Keep calm and wait for more blue posts. All changes they have done and want to do this far they have thoroughly explained in blue posts.
---
No worries, I understand the feeling and was not quite sure of my memories of vanilla not having those "features"
---
 Not only classic,  but talent trees! I stopped playing before they were removed, and when I found out what they had done to the talent system I felt angry.  
---
I had so much fun playing about with different specs. None were optimal but there was some fun to be had! (For pvp)
---
Yup, I didnt get married until 28, kid at 30. I'm 34 now, no regrets :) 
---
[No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F8bs_THKiY)
---
Yeah, I was actually playing the game at vanilla release. Everyone already tried all if this, and failed epically.
---
I never thought I would relive the days of vanilla wow when the tier 0 DPS warrior was the laughing stock of every server.
---
All I can say to anyone who wants to try this is good luck, you are really going to need it... Lol
---
I dunno. It’s painful that way. Made the mistake of solo queueing AB on a priest. Got sheeted, viper stung, and focused into oblivion with no peels. All I can say is:  if you want to solo queue, roll a rogue.
---
How did you find or get these?
---
Too bad it's also likely that they'll still have World Bosses leash to their spawn point. Doubt you're gonna ever see Kazzak trained into Stormwind.
---
Uh... I guess it's a little late to tell you this, but you could've done all that other stuff while still playing WoW.
---
Why wouldn't they be able to roll on cloth gear they need? 
---
There’s never to many tanks and we will be spread across all the servers. A good tank will add competent players to friends list and generally can have a group for anything in a reasonable time. Now raiding scene there will be competition for MT spots but If you are honest you can start getting experience as an OT then maybe MT for another guild later. 
---
The vast majority of vanilla fans and players are not elitists. We're happy to see people get into the game and help them out. If you need someone to group up with when it comes out, hit me up.
---
For me it was World PvP, which is why I'm excited about Classic coming back, as TBC's flying mounts killed WPvP stone dead.
---
Competition over questing zones sometimes turning into massive brawls involving raid-sized groups on each side, raids on Crossroads, the SS/TM and Ast/STP wars of attrition, that dangerous dash from the doors of Blackrock Mountain to your instance portal, hoping there's not a gank squad or raid group hanging around inside, or being in a gank squad turning some questing hub into a warzone as the other faction tries to hunt you down, STVietnam, the list is endless.
---
A persistant world with a community that knows who you are and you know who they are. Recognising the guild and player names. Knowing that there's a gank squad of X guild going around so you might as well move to another zone, or lol those idiots just gather up whoever's about because even random pugs steamroll those guys. Rivalries between players on opposite factions, or even respect for another player.
---
Retail will never produce another Angwe because WPvP has been gutted and the server community aspect simply doesn't exist any more.
---
In the briefest possible summary: I want more Angwe moments.
---
i bought ultra wide few months ago and im happy with that decision
---
&gt;  I know they're trying to do stuff against ninjas
---
What have made you belive this? It's false.
---
sounds like your friends arent going to hit 60
---
whos the real winner
---
Its not an alternate gear system. Its a loot trading system that will be usable in raids, but not 5 man dungeons. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BCMxeMAF8BKD0NAA
---
Improved slam, deep wounds, impale, 5/5 flurry. The only thing you really lose if you're 2H fury spec is improved execute, improved cleave, and 3 points in 2H weapon spec. Slam can be used during 100% of the fight, execute only during the last 20%. 
---
Ah, this is an interesting idea. I like it, much appreciated!
---
Dwarf the best pries
---
Yes, listen to this guy. Don't ruin your life with WoW! 
---
&gt;!less competition for pvp rank 14 for me!&lt;
---
[A] LF late night West coast guild  with raids that start 9pm-10pm PST
---
Prefer semi-casual to semi-hardcore.
---
Rend does not trigger overpower in vanilla. Whirlwind and Bloodthirst have cooldowns -- slam is for when those abilities are on cooldown.
---
Different strokes for different folks. I'd throw someone out of my house if they didn't want me playing. And if your boy/girlfriend doesn't want you playing tell them to fuck off. You don't need them.
---
These guy are all really cool, funny, know the game, and have lives. It’s perfect for casuals who can also put their game faces on when it’s go-time, and walk away to their lives when time’s up. Looking forward to Classic with this guild!
---
I wouldn't say harder but definitely more varied which indirectly upped their difficulty since you know, most people can't even follow the simple "don't step in the fire" direction lol.
---
So what?
---
My intention is to get all fucked up on Classic. Full no life addict.  
---
Posting obvious greentext bait from someone named "Private Server Veteran"
---
My pinky is always on ctrl, I couldn't fathom  hitting it with my thumb by going under my hand.
---
Some friends of mind think hitting ctrl with their pinky is weird. I suppose I'm used to it from 2k+ hours of counter strike.
---
Yeah like a few others have said. Classic will run off the legion client and will support higher resolutions. 
---
Actually I believe during blizzcon I remember hearing them talk about resolution specifiically and saying that theyd support higher resolutions. Could be mistaken though. 
---
200 iq mom move... had her battlestation set up so she could log in to her late night raid after she put you guys to bed!
---
If you squint hard enough you can actually see them whispering ”1g plz” and ”boost dm plz”. 
---
We were not prepared. 
---
What a stupid pointless thread.
---
I think every expansion made PvE mechanicly harder.
---
That sure is a wall of text just to be told that you're testing in the wrong client.
---
The best way to do something like this is to find a warlock a healer and another dps and sell items fromDM:E jump runs. Take mining to collect thorium at the end. You can also do the same with tribute runs but you’d need to split the gold evenly with the people so it’s not just pure profit for yourself. 
---
Mage, Hunter, or Warlock. They're all quick to level, have tons of utility, etc.
---
What is option 1 2 and 3
---
"Should"...
---
Yeah, I dont understand. Some of my buddies married girls that hated them playing video games. Always complained about it. I told them thats not cool, they should respect your hobbies, especially ones that keep you in touch with friends (some of which you served in the military with) 
---
Dude, think about what you just said. We're all a result of billions of variables coming together and outputting us. Forget the why and really think on that..... truth is always much stranger than fiction.
---
The laws of physics and the happenstance of carbon, along with countless other factors we may never know have come together in a manner where you:
---
1. Are a life-form that can even comprehend an idea of a video game, and play it
---
2. We even have life forms that've come together to make the tools that create the game possible. Not just programming, but electricity, and the social structures that enable us to even learn (which in itself is enabled by our physiology, and evolution, under just the right conditions for over 50,000 years)
---
3. Are a life form where you even possess the emotional conditioning to feel yearning and excitement for anything, never mind WoW.
---
4. Possess the intellect to appreciate the nuance of the countless factors that make up vanilla wow vs retail.
---
5. Possess the capability to be introspective enough to make the comment you just made.
---
The list goes on! Its almost ironic that we're excited so much about a work of fiction when you consider how it pales in comparison to how insanely wondrous the real world is in comparison. No writer will ever come up with something so fantastically complex, unpredictable, and moving.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
Shadow priests were awesome on loatheb...... 
---
I believe in retail wow currently you can only roll on armor appropriate for your class e.g. shamans could only roll need on mail gear 
---
Best thing is I've got my job, wife, family all aware of my intentions and everything setup to handle my impending lack of life for a few weeks. Look into some planning!
---
"but well played, knowledgable shadow priests"
---
?
---
there are literally only two rotations for shadow priest and one of them destroys your mana pool extra fast so its hardly even real. you dont need to be knowledgeable about anything to use the same abilities you use while leveling the exact same manner and happen to passively buff your warlocks
---
you can train a five year old to play shadowpriest within 90% of the output of someone stopcasting
---
So you want to play one of the worst raid specs to take gear away from warriors to use as the worst pvp spec? Did I understand that correct?
---
I mean I guess anything is possible...
---
This. Just compare the Kel'Thuzard tactics to Mythic Argus, it's obscene. But this is due to players getting better and better over time.
---
My favorite part was waiting for them to almost finish an escort quest and proceed to gank at the end followed by a good old fashioned corpse camp until they spirit rez and hearth. I had a collection of angry tell screenshots but I think it's been lost.
---
A thousand dollars?
---

---
Isn´t the idea that it resets your swingtimer? 
---
Aww cmon man you like living, right? Your parents had to have kids to have you! If they didn't, you'd never get to play WoW! 
---
Woah, I had no idea. Can’t even let players use anything but their specific armour type 😑. Eww
---
You can OT as full fury and 15pts in prot.  It is great for farming and great for fights you arent truly needed
---
How is it good to be oom after 2 mobs?

This is from a 100% Blizzlike server currently on late AQ40.  This is over the entire instance.  Fights in MC/BWL are over so fast it is hard to get many casts in on bosses when the melee pool rage and dump it right off the bat.
---
2004*
---
The subreddit sidebar has a list of what has been confirmed by blizzard so far. 
---
The only change to loot that we know of is how loot trading is going to be implemented to raids. 
---
Counter-counterpoint: Tauren can ride the raptor that drops off of Mandokir.
---
Main attack on 2 ftw
---
&gt; My point is another. Relationships and, even more, families are much more important than a bloody 2005 videogames.  
---
This subreddit is no place for you. GET GONE!
---
Don't worry, if current servers are any proof.. people are lazy. Hahaha
---
Good for you ! Don’t let the lemmings tempt you.
---
Imagine taking 2 days to get to level 20 lmfao.
---
The short version: you have alternative options to spend rage - without reducing the amount of rage you produce - and for dual wield even heroic strikes are more sensible than the use of slam
---
\-
---
You get rage from beating things with your auto attack and from getting hit. Slam forces a a swing timer reset this means it delays your next auto attack and therefore cuts into the major source of your rage generation.
---
Meanwhile you have other abilities as options to turn said rage into dmg output without impeding on the rage generation system. (MS/bloodthirst, WW, execute)
---
With that said there are only a handful of niche scenarios whereby slam could be actually useful (regardless whether its talented or not). This would be a scenario when you generate so much rage that you are even burning it with heroic strikes is not enough and you still cap on rage. In that case a delayed swing + a slam would net you more dmg than just the regular swing (as a heroic strike) 
---
Option1: you run dual wield fury and you produce that amount of rage by yourself (Either with hilariously OP gear (aq40/naxx)  or on private servers running with the 2.0.1 rage normalization) But then you won't use slam as slam kills your white dps on dual wield specs even more
---
the last two options are you taking so much damage to produce the rage that way and relying on heal support
---
or raid encounter related buffs (essence of the red)
---
For this very reason the concept behind slam was shuffled around for BC. It simply never made any sense to use it in classic post the attack speed normalization.
---
He's bandaging the sixth person.
---
Aren't Druids useless.  I can just make an alt to MoTW buff everyone outside the raid.
---
The people's championship right here
---
The recent post about "fizzing" to sink hours has made me feel we are all very similar. Let's see
---
Dude, you have to decide if they won't get any more mana or if the difference is minuscule.
---
What's the server name?
---
I find your disappointment weird, why should someone in low-tier gear expect to be able to 1v2 people who have worked much harder to get the best gear they can? 
---
Unless it´s Terminator
---
There is indeed rested bonus in vanilla. Happy leveling!
---
As someone who's probably gonna roll a Druid, I can foresee issues with me rolling against priests for pre-raid BIS healing gear while tanning 5/10 mans...
---
After rereading it I can see how it comes off that way, and it was never meant to talk down about someone's preferences. I will talk down about bad specs though, because I don't think it's healthy for the longevity of classic for less experienced/new players to read things like "ret can be middle of the pack", roll one, realize no good guild will want them, and end up quitting because of it.
---
If you know what you're getting yourself into and still want to go through with it however, go right ahead.
---
I'm 22 and I feel the same way except it's unjustified.
---
So you lost the discussion (because priests in fact DO gain more from being innervated than other classes) and now are throwing the elitist argument around.
---
Nice
---
resto shaman is a waste in pvp because elemental shamans have the exact same healing output in pvp and still have the same access to totems, purge, and all other abilities
---
if you play ele, you get to do the same amount of healing in moments where you need to, except you also now get to immediately send things to the grave with lb -&gt; cl -&gt; shock sequences
---
not to mention elemental shamans have the option to become immune to cast pushback and take 10% less spell damage
---
Dude, you have to decide if you want to let something die or if you want io be proven right.
---
Noob
---
Because it's condescending.
---
I’m Swedish and I going to play classic. Have joined a Scandinavian guild called Kronan. 
---
Fantastic read, all your points I couldn't agree with more; I'm all grown up now (he says) but I really do hope I can hop back into classic and enjoy those moments which made me so many friends. Bizarrely I even made friends on the opposite faction through PvP!!! Vanilla WoW summed up in its brilliance :P (there are probably things im going to hate but have forgotten!!)
---
Thanks for the kind words my guy! I really appreciate them :D

You can metagame/theorycraft all day about this stuff, but at the end of the day, 
---
the \[person with their preraid BiS &amp; farmed consumables with a "bad" race/class combo\] is gonna do better than \[the guy who didn't prepare at all but has a good race/class combo\]. 
---
It's also about skill - if you're a human or nelf priest, but people know you as a godlike healer, you're gonna get accepted in raids regardless. Guild leader bro will be happy just to have a priest, period.
---
Nah just gotta factor that into what you pursue. Some jobs will dry up, others will simply change, and certain jobs require a human element. You should be grateful you even have the awareness to know about automation. Some socioeconomic movement have struck silently and people were screwed without realizing it until the last second.
---
Case in point: You start working for a company in say...... 1985. You didn't go to college, you move up the ranks in the company, do pretty well for yourself, etc. Flash foward 24 years and, due to the economic downturn that followed the housing bubble burst in 2008, you get laid off because you make too much money and the company made cutbacks! Now you have to re-enter the working world with no college degree (that everyone is asking for because the applicant pool is huge), can't get a job, and didn't even do anything to get yourself in that shitty position. It was merely the product of your situation.
---
Don't get me wrong, that didn't happen to me, but it happened to a lot of bosses of mine and my friends. Its not a very remarkable or sexy story. It isn't scandalous, its pretty mundane. 
---
My point is, if you can spot the trap, you should smile. Its far more likely the trap you don't see is the more dangerous one. You can work around the one you've spotted.
---
A trifle amount, that nobody is actually going to care about but you and your elitist buddies. :V Yes.
---
You really didnt watch the video did you?
---
what happens if you meet someone in game which eventually leads to meeting them irl and hitting it off
---
large think
---
I didnt want to include talents since I'm trying to go for items everyone/a good majority can obtain 
---
I was a good tank, and every time I logged on, I would get whisper spams from people I knew, people on my friends' list, and people that just knew my rep on the server. I miss that about classic and look forward to server reputation being a thing again.
---
Western Plaquelands! 
---
Might I recommend the r/classicwow Discord server?
---
https://discord.gg/classicwow
---
I would personally go with something like (this)[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbyzzZVMgzcd]
---
This gives improved mana burn, silence, and inspiration. Also, more reduction for resists helps with silence and similar binary attacks.
---
Oh, the full name.  I'm not familiar with that being used, but it's always really cool to me when people use full, proper names like that!
---
Honestly, even back then I never understood what supposedly made it *that* hard.  Yes, I know everything that happens, but it just all seemed like such basic stuff to me, stuff that you should have learned at least a little about in Molten Core.  With infinite rage, energy, and mana, I just couldn't understand how people could be that bad.  And I'm not even counting using a threat meter addon.  That's a whole other rant I think I shouldn't bother with here.
---
Bruh think about it. If we assume that the timeline is fixed and there is a certain future and you WILL have kids (if we assume that)...... they may be future fans of a game that has yet to exist. How are they supposed to become fans and play if they don't exist.
---
Now get out there and fix that!
---
Yea this is cool. I think a real cash reward would make it more fun to watch, and wouldnt impact the main game much
---
I'm definitely going to focus like 90% of my effort on my main, but I do plan on having ~3 alts that I rotate between to keep them all on rested XP.
---
Thanks for the build and showing me a way to get value out of one of the skills I mentioned man. Looking at the build and reading y'alls debate, couldnt you go both seal of fate and relentless strikes if you took out 3 points from the + chance of poison resolving talent? Are slow poisons kind of crucial?
---
34 no kids and just got a huge promotion which will require a lot of work and certifications. I hope I have time to play vanilla. 
---
The question is specific to 2h fury -- you're in a dual wield mindset so what you're saying doesn't really apply here. I'm fully aware slam is terrible for dual wield since mainhand weapons pale in comparison to 2H weapons in terms of top-end damage. The whole idea of resetting the swing timer is actually beneficial when you think of it from a 2H perspective.
---
Remember that heroic strike replaces a white swing with a yellow hit - so even if it costs 15 rage to use it's ALSO preventing your ability to generate rage on the hit. It's like a hidden "rage tax." You're not taking damage as a DPS warrior so you aren't gaining passive rage that way. 
---
Slam, on the other hand, has a cast time and resets your swing timer. If my swing timer is 3.6, 3.4, 3.8 like most 2handers in Vanilla, timing a slam immediately after a white hit while the instant cast abilities are on cooldown effectively gives me a 1 second attack with bonus damage comparable to heroic strike instead of a 3.X second auto attack, or even worse a 3.X second heroic strike that consumes rage and does not generate it. Slam can trigger chance on hits such as Hand of Justice and windfury, and theoretically could actually produce rage in those scenarios.
---
&gt; Also, Viper Sting costs more mana for the Hunter to cast than it does for you to dispel.
---
Yes, but you are not taking in account that you'll be shifting forms as well, while the hunter can only viper/concussive/scare beast if his plan is to also outlast you. Meanshile the pet is attacking and if you want to root/hybernate him (you will get viper'd during this) then it's even more mana down the drain.
---
I'm pretty sure the matchup is in favor of the hunter. Maybe it's not that one sided, but the hunter does have a slight advantage if he knows what he's doing (like now wasting mana aiming shot a bear)
---
Yep, want at t least an alchy and a tailor/enchi as alts. Main on engy :)
---
I started at 19, learning the politics of a large raiding guild was still something new to me.
---
And developing the team building skills to handle (and give) constructive criticism in the face of repeated failures as a group (either due to widespread mess ups, or a single person being the point of failure) was a valuable life skill I learned in WoW.
---
This thread is highlighting reddits downward spiral pretty well. 
---
Oh yes, TBC was even better when you got access to shock+sanctity aura. Good times!
---
Are you going paladin in Classic or not?
---
My top pick for class fantasy is and always will be paladin, but the lack of possibilities for a pure holywarrior-esque Retribution paladin doesn't cut it for me.
---
I used improved slam with success in Vanilla. I was doing so much damage with it that I was taking aggro of the MT (it was maybe 2 months after the release, I didn't have KTM back then, don't know if it wasn't available or if I wasn't aware of it).
---
Theory-crafting without an actual Classic client to test it will lead only to conjectures.
---
We will have to test it once Classic will be live.
---
Don't let theory dictate what you should do, test everything, even stupid ideas and keep what's working.
---
I'm with this guy. WoW supplements my already rich life. I fucking love that we're getting this back and that i get to enjoy it again (this time in 4k) but now I can play it with my wife and my dog (if I can get him to stop playing retail) and with all the crazy people here who are soooo appreciative of the community aspects.
---
I almost feel sad for a lot of the commenters here who think there's a juxtaposition between having a life and playing WoW. It reeks of bitterness.
---
You might but I won’t go because I have to teach a class now 
---
Yeah I think maybe we will be able to find one. One or two nights a week to raid isn't out of the question for us it would just have to be at night after work and when our kids are asleep. If we are behind the curve on gearing or are in a not as hardcore guild I think we will have a better time. Thanks for the advice and information. What class will you be?
---
Neat idea 
---
Isn't the most important thing in life is doing what we want to ? Espacially if we enjoy it.
---
Some people like traveling, reading... I like playing videogame a lot. When i do, my level of entertainement is nearly to the maximum. 
---
That's why i'm bored when i have to do something else (even party with friends).It won't hurt my life as much as drugs or passive entertainement (TV...).
---
So i'm gonna enjoy Classic as much as is can.
---
Having trouble remembering my vanilla experience. Would it be helpful to have a feature that allows the player to select and equip different types of ammo? Like the window may display icons for different ammo types in your inventory, and when you want to maximize your DPS, you can select the more powerful but more expensive ammo type. I don't remember if that situation ever really existed though.
---
Do you think the dogs will be able to handle it? This won't be like retail. They can't just push 4 buttons and expect to crush raid tiers anymore.
---
They added something at some point, I forget what it was called, where if it's not your correct armor type, you can't roll need.
---
The default loot system is group loot (need and greed), where a priest can need on plate.
---
What they said they aren't doing for non raids is loot trading, where someone in your group gets a bop item and can trade with someone else who was eligible for the loot also.
---
The day BC came out we had two snow days which are so rare here. Oh man I’m pretty sure I played 40 hours of wow in those two days. 
---
&gt; You're playing against bad Druids. There are a lot of them.
---
Pretty sure the same thing could be said about hunters. Maybe you are beating the bad ones?
---
I didn't feel it was. I thought it was good advice.
---
Slows are yeah but so is getting instant poison procs in raids. So thats good for both PVE and PVP. But you can get that if thats what you want though, I was just arguing with that guy cause he responded like an a-hole. How you spend your 31 points in assasination is up to you. This is just how me and some others prefer
---
That and schmatics or profession plans are probably super valuble later on.
---
My parents always gave me the previous family PC to play games on. This meant I was always behind. I was running Windows 98 until 2006. Then I finally upgraded to a decent PC 2006 with my own money and could play WoW. Was a great time. 
---
You’re never going to want to be using less expensive ammo types
---
\*nervous laughter\* oh you!
---
Too many tanks for raids, not enough for dungeons.
---
From a distance, in terms of a 2H spec (ignoring weird choices like deflection) I'd wager the 5 you've put into imp. slam would still be better off in imp. cleave, imp. execute and the extra point in 2h spec. I've never personally crunched the numbers, I'm just going off standardized builds, other more knowledgeable warrior will probably be able to break it down better than I.
---
Don't forget fishing in AV :D
---
We definitely weren't prepared for rando greens being on par with T2, and getting exponentially better
---
31. Pregnant with number two. Still and will always be a wow head.
---
Some of the dudes I know that married women like that now spend 45 min + on the toilet playing mobile games trying to scratch thst itch while their wives think they have some sort of bowel disorder.
---
An healthy? AN HAPPY!?!?
---
While casting mindflay? Nah, you won't get me.
---
Not bait when most of it is true lol. Keep seething North.
---
Some other meme
---
Only issue is priest pulls even more threat than lock good luck finding a tank that's gonna hold those mind blast crits.
---
To be fair, i stole it from osrs deadmanmode
---
Norwegian here, probably planning on rolling a shaman!  
---
A lot depends on my local friend group though, we'll have to play the same server and stuff. 
---
I'll make them hunters and just use a one button macro for them.
---
If a pally gets to roll on cloth in the **raid** before the priests have it...  
---
/gquit 
---
And computers/servers being able to handle more. Vanilla Thaddius was hard due to graphics and computation power. A lot of low end computers were basically like watching a wow power point slide in raids.
---
On that server it wasn't high. Maybe 30%
---
45 minutes to an hour for a decent enough pug run not including time to fly/build a group
---
Sounds like a cry for help.
---
It exists, IIRC you don't want to leave more than 10 IRL days before you go and blow the rest XP, then park the character again when bored.
---
Vikings unite.
---
Only in Warcraft 2 that I remember - Gnomish flying machine.
---
Ahh the fresh, innocent faces of the people, relentlessly corpse camped by yours truely. Father forgive me 
---
Didn't give him enough Intelligence to make good decisions.  
---
Is it me or does the kid on the right have the superior battlestation?
---
Yeah I’m still so undecided on what I wanna main that I’ll probably end up starting a few at once. Plus I wanna have several professions going.

**Horde | ⚔ NA-PvP ⚔ | Semi-Hardcore**  
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.  
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.  
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.  
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
TBC is where the game peaked for me, the game still had some flavour because factions and classes wasnt as streamlined as later expansions while still improving on mainly the hybrid specs from vanilla. 
---
The raids were hard in a ”good” way and I loved so many of the encounters. BT might be my all time favorite. 
---
Compared to vanilla I would say that the encounters were undoubtedly harder because of several things, in vanilla a lot of the challange isnt the encounter itself; it’s being 40 ppl some of which are just dead-weight, getting good pre-raid gear wasnt as easy as later expansions, etc.
---
you humor is wasted here, brother)
---
Tauren's stun seems quite good for a hunter in PVP.
---
In fact I wonder if it's not as good as orc's hardiness.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Okay, cool. That was a feature idea I was thinking about but not 100% sold on. 
---
&gt; The game isn't worse. 
---
Why do you want to play? Serious question.
---
&gt; Make the game easier for yourself and play Dwarf Priest,
---
I'll play whatever, it doesn't change the game at all,
---
&gt; if you DONT want to
---
Why wouldn't I want to?
---
There's a co-efficient for hit to crit caps it's ba9se 19+hit if i remember correctly for your crit cap
---
#BOO THAT MAN!!!
---
Troll confirmed.
---
iirc, hit cap for main hand is something like 9%. windfury procs off your main hand only. so the hit cap isn't that high for it compared to other main hand attacks or 2 hand attacks.
---
Tech has certainly allowed for more. The 7th boss in Tomb of Sargeras (maiden) had a Thaddius like mechanic (light/fel instead of pos/neg). It then also threw in frontal cone attack to soak, casts on ground on avoid, a boss teleport and orbs to soak/dodge depending on color, and a timed jump into abyss to dodge a mechanic.   
---
The side-case to older content being harder would be tighter numerical tuning. But raw mechanics are just insane by comparison.
---
Same, but two weeks!
---
Are you trolling or are you that stupid?

---
* A transparent loot council system based on raider preference and guild needs, with item priorities published ahead of raids in a viewable spreadsheet
---
* Experienced Vanilla leadership and raiding strategies
---
* ThunderCats theme song before raids
---
* A community for vanilla wow beyond raiding
---
**Join us on discord**

---
Why don't you want to answer my questions?
---
Isn't that just yellow hit cap so you don't miss any special attacks? 
---
White hit and yellow hit cap for 2h are the same at 8(?) or 9(?)%. 
---
White hit cap for dual wield is 27% with yellow still at 8/9%.
---
You should aim for yellow hit cap on any physical dps so as not to sacrifice other stats.
---

---
World first guild to kill KT naxx 40.   
---
1 Undead warrior, 2 Tauren warrior, 1 troll warrior. 
---
1.13 could be a huge thing here. Imagine we're not headed towards an expac but 1.13 removed the 16 debuff limit but buffs the bosses considerably while boosting their loot tables slightly to compensate.
---
They could also play with the classes a bit so that there's less cookie cutter builds and more classes challenging in raids. The one complaint I think I will have is that the internet and knowledge is common now, everyone will roll the same classes
---
EX Dwarf priest, Tanks will all roll warriors, All mages will be frost, 1 Shadow priest per raid, No Rets and Boomkins allowed etc
---
If 1.13 could fix that slightly were these classes don't become godly but that they wouldn't be liabilities in raids would be welcome to me at least.
---
To me the things I want the most is also, knowing the people on the server, the community and social aspects to be like Vanilla, one thing that might mess with the dynamics however is that many people will roll together and already be in guilds at launch which might reduce the random chances of meeting people, inviting them, grouping for hours, invite to guild and form friendships.
---
In classic, our guild met while leveling and we went on to do extremely well before the eventual drama, back stabbing and movement to other elite guilds, that by itself was a story modern video games could never recreate.
---
I was lucky in that all but 2 boys in my class were nerding wow hard. I was even one of the later ones to join cause I didn't have a desktop to run it.
---
8/9% is ability yellow dmg hit cap.
---
This is just some kid that hates hybrids.  Even in an extreme case like the World's first guild to clear Naxx will have a Feral Druid for example.
---
Like, you don't get to Naxx first by throwing away loot drops and reclearing content because only Warriors can tank.  Lol
---
There's more issues but honestly just play what's fun.  Even the very best guild will take a Nelf Priest if they're putting in a hundred hours a week and play perfectly.  It's much more to do with the player and their goals than what fucking race they are.
---
My rant is a bit off-topic:
---
As MMOs evolved, more and more mechanics were added to bosses in raids. This is true to MMOs as well. The more recent the MMO, the more ridiculous mechanics have been added to bosses.
---
While I get why this was done, I do not like it. I prefer simplistic boss fights with one or two tactics.
---
A year ago I tried my luck with Guild Wars 2. The first raid boss, a toad, had an insane amount of mechanics: 
---
 - People with bombs had to go away to detonate it. Bomb generates growing circle of fire where you can't go.
---
 - People had to rotate eating a mushroom to turn into a worm that eats other mushrooms that make way for the raid. Bad mushrooms generate circles of fire where you can't go.
---
 - Toad targets someone, that guy has the threat and has to lead the boss around
---
 - Toad has 2-3 avoidable aoe attacks that you have to time your dodges with
---
 - He has adds that regularly spawn as well
---
 - At 50% he does another type of (raid-wiping) aoe attack
---
Now, you could ask the question, why was this needed for a first boss? Because GW2 PVE  raiding sucks without holy trinity. A tank and spank fight is silly without tanks and healers. In other games the standard holy trinity fights are just so boring and cliche that gamers want something new.
---
taurens are even worst for pvp because their hitbox is larger making it easier for people to deadzone  them
---
Whirlwind has 10 second cooldown and mortal strike has 5 second you wont have rage for slam if you use both of those on cooldown
---
Yes. 
---
Lol no, not the cloth ones (not for me, haha). I remember getting them, thinking they looked like shit, then I did the math on how much damage they actually reduced I felt betrayed. Why must my shoulders be ugly AND useless!?
---
yup!  
---
What you just said doesn’t even make sense.
---
Because they said they're doing it, with the trading thing or what ever.
---
I just remember crushing a 45 minute Baron run for the Tier 0.5 for a Druid friend of mine.
---
He was Feral tanking and I was Shadow Priest and  that run was so damn fast.
---
Obviously most visitors to this particular sub would encourage you to at least give it a try  =p
---
If you've never played it before, it's a piece of video game history you can finally try out.  You'll know within a month whether it's a game for you or not.
---
Finland isn't part of Scandinavia, but they are Nordic.
---
It clearly struck a nerve for him lol 
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
When I was 11, I ran around all day with my lvl 19 gnome rogue twink. Kickin everyones ass! ;)
---
You are talking about a very specific setting where a geared rogue is waiting for the druid inside a base, that doesnt represent the entire matchup. Druids definitely counter rogues 1v1 in duels or open world pvp. Your only way to even reach a druid is a 5 minute cooldown (sprint) if it isnt up there is absolutely no way to catch a druid as a rogue. He got trinket for your stun, instant heals and bearform for your burst, abolish poison for your blind and fearie fire for your vanish. He just straight up cripples you from the start. 
---
People transmog old tier sets.
---
yes it is!
---
"Should I play game?" on a game's subreddit is likely to get a resounding "yes".
---
My only rebuttal is that around wrath time we started getting matching themes/sets of gear that looked decent even though they weren't epic. After transmog came out I picked a few themes from Legion that made my pally look like a gladiator, almost like he was wearing leather. They've done items that weren't remarkable, but looked decent.
---
In vanilla the only gear like that were the ones you buy from the vendors, which were worthless.
---
You are confusing mortal strike with 2H fury. You will have rage for slam in raid scenarios when Bloodthirst and whirlwind are on cooldown. Have you ever played or raided in vanilla? 
---
There will be a lot of us, im 38 now lol
---
Not to sound negative or anything, but typically if you're interested in a game you try it out. It's like you're asking us for permission lol.
---
In short: Yes. If you disliked newer expansions but enjoyed the older ones, you will most likely enjoy classic.
---
He's talking about armor value. That's the only real difference between armor classifications and healers in raids don't need it at all.
---
Thanks, I will look forward to playing it or watching it 
---
Well no not really, everyone's life is their to do with what they will, if your hobby is golf and you want to spend all your spare time down the range then great, spend it in front of the TV fine, playing some games awesome.
---
People are excited to get back into their hobby of playing WoW, they want to use their spare time killing dragons then that's their choice.
---
Eh, even those things can be done better by other specs
---
Yeah, I’m agreeing with you and adding 1 more detail to what you said.
---
How long did it took you to make that 120g?
---
I would say try it, all you need to buy is a subscription so its not much of a waste if you don't like it. But if you have always wanted to try it then I see no better way to have your first WoW experience being vanilla.
---
I've answered all your questions. Argued EVERY point. - If you think you can play ANY class/race/spec/faction combo and the game doesn't change for you by doing so, there is no reasoning with you. 
---
That statement, as well as so many others you have made is just fundamentally wrong. 
---
Why do I want to play? I want to be engrossed in a world again, explore, WPvP and pass my time between deployments! BFA doesn't cut it, Retail hasn't for a long time. I'll see all the content at my own pace, plod along etc 
---
I will play resto druid. I will roll on cloth at the beginning. Fight me (I will run)
---
Ah I remember that, played Alliance in Ronin and Ad Infinitum! 
---
As of the previous expansion, Hakkar was also added to Hearthstone, and he infects your opponent’s deck with cards that deal damage when drawn!
---
Oh fuk 
---
So Classic will not use, nor even grant the option of, the updated character models, for example?
---
Not likely on a fresh realm though. A more solid strategy would be to buy something and flip it a month later for 3x the Gold, but then what will OP buy a lvl 40 mount with. 
---
Shadow and discipline threat's talents are mandatory
---
 but windfury is yellow
---
&gt; Main attack on 2 ftw
---
Not as arms, Mortal strike on 1 then!
---
Why would you ever do 2h fury in pve?
---
Life will be there after classic wow. Classic wow launch however is a once in a lifetime event. Priorities first your missing out ;)
---
10-14 lul
---
Absolutely, look at this way: The game taht got so many people into WoW making it the gigantic succsess was Vanilla, here we are waiting for a recreation of that experience. Sure, by todays standards the graphics and mechanics aren't as bright and flashy, but that's not really the point. The gameplay and the community you'll be playing with is.
---
I feel bad for the ones who have Legion or BfA as their first impression of WoW, because it is somewthing completely different from what Vanilla was. If you have never played WoW prior to this, you are lucky as hell, as you get to have classic be your first impression, just like all of those people back in the day whom liked it so much that the game became such a major success in the first place.
---
Wait for classic, and what you will experience will be the beginning of a new life filled with epic adventure, wonderful sights, awesome people and unforgettable memories. That is what Vanilla delivered, it is what BfA fails to deliver, and it is what Classic will deliver.
---
Try it out, and hey, if you end up not liking it then so be it, to each their own!
---
(By the way, WoW has \*expansions\* not \*DLC's\* ;) )
---
sure you ‚remember‘ that. Wasn‘t T0.5 introduced during AQ? So maybe you just outgeared the content pretty hard anyway.
---
I didn’t say anything about armor value.  My point is priests can only wear cloth while paladins can wear all types.  You’d be taking away the only upgrades a priest can get while the paladin has at least 3x more options.
---
It's at the top of the logs.  I mentioned it in another post and it got deleted for mentioning it.  It starts with a N.
---
Check out legacy players. It is an incredible site where you can upload your damage/healing parses for instances to do speedruns, speedkills, and overall damage.
---
I'm on board with everything you said until arena. Although lots of people enjoy arenas, and arena pvp is a neat addition to the game, it killed classic class design. 
---
There are distinct pre and post arena class design philosophies. Once arenas are systemized in the game rather than simply existing in the world, you have to design around 1v1 or small team pvp which was one of the factors contributing to class homogenization in modern wow.
---
they will have to. the content drought is inevitable.
---
Similar thing happened in BfA where a hunter got mind controlled and during that time infested ad infested his pet. Ghuun infestation then stayed on his pet outside of the instance. That however wasn't virulent as Hakaar debuff ;)
---
Windfury totem hits are white, they can be proc'ed of both white and yellow hits. 
---
That was a very good exception.
---
That gives me an idea. Hear me out....
---
You make your dogs have wolves as pets and name the wolves after the dogs. The three of you join a guild and over the entirety of the game you slowly gaslight the guild into believing that the two hunters are, in fact, dogs IRL. Type for them in chat with various spelling errors and dog-like comments (that you enjoy chasing things, when cats are brought up be unreasonably hostile towards the topic, tell stories from their perspective, etc.) and when you finally get to raiding at 60, just put headphones on the dogs and let them bark occasionally. If they question the dogs, only deny being a dog in chat.
---
Theres real potential here.
---
Only orcs can be undead in Vanilla :F
---
what is your suggestion when everything in classic is cleared and people are begging for more content? either tbc or they add things to vanilla wow.
---
On every toon I've ever played:
---
Q = Silence/Interrupt
---
E = Snare/Slow
---
C - Movement (Charge, Blink, etc)
---
V = Stun (when applicable)
---
I think I have all the following keys bound. Took me years to realize I was apparently the only freak that didn't use Shift!
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 - Q, E, T, G, H, C, V, X, B, N, Y 
---
CTRL + 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Q, E, T, G, H, C, V, X, B, N, Y
---
F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, M1, M2. M3 - 
---
Oh I saw it before our masters deleted it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1KeOUtvUhA
---
Watch this video and you'll see why. It's from a private server, but you get the idea.
---
Most people go warrior to bring big dick dps so there will be plenty of opportunity to tank.
---
1-5, shift 1,5. Shift: q, e, r, t, a, s, d, f, g, z, x, c, v
---
Regular R, t, s, f, g, z, x, c
---
All mouse buttons with a shift variant.
---
R is for charge / death grip (i only play warrior and DK), shift-a is instant self heals like healthstones or potions. Shift-f is always burst macros. G for mount. S for execute and soul reaper. My warrior stances are shift 1, 2, and 3. These keybinds exist on my bottom left action bar so they change depending on my stance, and i have the other stances still there. 
---
With proper gear and herb- farming Mara for ghost mushrooms and doing solo princess runs can make quite the decent penny even as resto- no respec required. Can faily easily pick up some spellpower/spell crit gear and kite moonfire/starfire her down as any spec as 60, even with bad gear. The better gear you have the more efficient it becomes
---
Agreed. We were just so antsy to play that we couldn't wait longer than an hour lol
---
Yo but the mouse the kid on the left is using is the most classic Microsoft mouse there is! 
---
Still applies to PvP. Moonkin didn't get the name "Boomkin" until pre-TBC with reworked talents. The form itself and the Balance tree as a whole got vastly improved.
---
Balance/Resto can be competitive in vanilla PvP though but you need Nature's Swiftness for that, so no Moonkin Form. The bonuses of the form are sadly not strong enough to outweight such a powerful and versataile talent as Nature's Swiftness.
---
I watch this every time it's in my recommended.
---
spirit of redemption sucks
---
I just want to know what a "Hard core RP guild" is because that is the very least hardcore thing you can ever do. I was in a guild where weekly guild meetings took place in game on Fey island south of ratchet, you had to slow/rp walk into the room and wear robes the guild tailor made everyone. The guild leader would stand at the podium with all officers kneeling beside her and would in an orderly fashion take questions.          
---
          
---
I don't RP but I like watching others do it and I looked forward to the weekly meetings but now I'm insanely curious what hard core RP looks like!
---
&gt; I could sell my ability to tank dungeons, for gold
---
It's a fine line between offering a tank service and just being a greedy asshole.
---
It wasn’t really that bad. It was mostly when handing in quests at Nesingwary’s.
---
This is trolling of epic proportions. I can get them to howl/arooo on command so I already have that going.
---
One of my favorite parts about this was how much less access to in-game events we had from the outside. There was one blog that I can remember reading that tried to keep up with the happenings of WoW but you really had to go out of your way to find resources like that.
---
Today I imagine a serious amount of players would have read about this bug on reddit or something well before logging in and getting massacred. I still remember I had been out of Org questing, no one in my guild had even bothered mentioning it, and I landed at the flight master and died almost immediately.
---
You are correct and that attitude is reasonable.... but is today's media reasonable? I agree with you on this point but I feel the first unfortunate incident will make headlines and r14 is definitely one of the more grindy mechanics in vanilla that can/will have detrimental effects on some people.  
---
I hope that this doesn't happen but you'll never be able to convince me that blizzard isn't at the very least, thinking about these things. 
---
Great analogy man. 
---
I'm surprised at the amount of 20-29 year olds. I expected mostly 30-39 and older. I mean were some of you really 5-15 years old when you played this?!
---
I don't know much about drain tanking in pvp. But in pve, warlock tanking is very much a thing.
---
&gt;sell mats on AH.
---
&gt;AH all mats.
---
&gt;sell bags on AH.
---
To whom with what money? That's the problem with fresh, nobody else has gold to buy your stuff on the AH. The prices you'll get on the AH will be minimal.
---
My goal is to be broke AF for the first month or so, just farming gray vendor items and spending all my gold sniping cheap things on the AH to be resold later. So yes, post your things on the AH for pennies :D
---
You quit during TBC, because people were in Shattrath instead of Ironforge?
---
I'm not going to read the rest. The Burning Crusade was a great expansion
---
For this reason, I vote no. 
---
Server names are shared between us and eu servers, so it is not entirely out of the question.
---
Shamans cant use swords ;)
---
That's a good point actually and I really agree. Although arena has something special. Like for me it is a place where I can compete against others with by best buddy and really excel our teamplay. 
---
That's something that's lacking in Classic except for some world pvp scenarios. And if I'm understanding you right, your concern is more about what happened *after* tbc. In that case a tbc server is not affected.
---
I leveled a Tank recently on Pserver and I had 25 friends after reaching 60 just because of dungeons.
---
Always people asking me to Tank.
---
There is always a need of a GOOD tank for dungeons.
---
Do not forget, You do not need 1 talent point in protection to tank dungeons.
---
So before raids, you can stay in Arms or Fury and tanking every dungeons.
---
Doesn't make a bit of difference if the paladin is still going to benefit from the item. Why should a paladin healer not get to roll/bid on his BiS robe just because it's cloth? At launch **literally none** of the BiS pally armor is plate. Not to mention that Priests specifically will be aiming for their tier set anyway and generally won't care.
---
This is not retail where every piece of gear is hyper-optimised for its respective class. If you gquit when paladins get cloth items at the same rate as priests you're going to be leaving a lot of guilds.
---
Any rational person would look at OP and see a guy who made choices he regrets, and is offering advice to people who might be in a similar position and a moment to critically evaluate their own position. 
---
If it didn't apply to you then what is so hard about just continuing on your day?
---
Instead you had an emotional response to this and chose to be offended lol.
---
Scandinavian reporting for duty.
---
Cheers, right there with ya.
---
&gt; I've answered all your questions. 
---
Yea, except when I asked your stance on murder, or those in the comment you replied to simply by calling me a troll.
---
&gt; That statement, as well as so many others you have made is just fundamentally wrong.
---
You're right, I'm sorry, it changes the small icons that represent my spells that I'll have to look at to check my cooldowns.
---
&gt; Why do I want to play? [...]
---
And what prevents certain specs from allowing you to do that?
---
Want to like this 100x- such an annoyance. Even worse when you tell them to tap religiously and they still don't
---
Just remember this sub is literally the 1% so there may be mor eplayers from your country after full launch. 
---
“Yeah it’s not classic”
---
*posts it in r/classicwow*
---
You're talking about a different expansion. TBC was level 70 and no LFG-tool
---
34, will probably be 35 by the time classic comes out, I also cannot wait to do the exact same thing! 
---
Cheers buddy
---
 Yes if you want to feel the “launch experience “
---
No if otherwise 
---
Yes in openworld scenarios a Druid can always grind down the opponent because of his superiour sustain. But BGs are different, there is objective pressure on both sides so running away is not always an option. This "very specific scenario" is super common for both AB and WSG. 
---
Alternatively it is Alliance NE Hunters who do the same, defending out of stealth. Even though they aren't the best against Druids in terms of killing them, a skilled hunter can significantly slow down a Druid and has more than enough tools to survive their attacks.
---
It is a huge difference for the attacking Druid wether the defender(s) are visible or not. That alone makes attacking a challenge and puts a ton of pressure on the attacker to reactively handle the situation.
---
I built my pc a few years ago but I’m still gonna see what classic looks like at 4K. 
---
I wouldn't worry too much dude, we didn't use the dragonslayer buff because of the cooldown.
---
It could never really be planned around.
---
They did, that's why all the wotlk gear was the same set, so it wasn't clown gear.
---
That’s an amazing achievement for a canine.
---
So you sold 1,200 wands?
---
Cause that early, most players have like 10s max.
---
Can you play feral end game pve without farming manual crowd pummelers?
---
IIRC windfury is considered a special attack and goes off the special attack hit table. Something to note: if your white hit misses/dodge/parried it can't proc windfury so technically more hit = more procs however if you're fishing for procs you're better off spamming abilities to force it (like hamstring).
---
Are you sure you chose the right comment to respond?
---
Same here! I was the younger sibling and my brother and I shared an account... Needless to say he claimed priority and I always had to wait. I remember sleeping on the couch and asking my brother to wake me up when he logged out.
---
Even the best PvP Druids sometimes die vs. a single Rogue when trying to snatch a flag, or only live by a very slim margin. There is tons of video evidence of that if you don't have the experience yourself.
---
A properly geared and specced PvP Rogue who is patient and strikes at the right moment is incredibly hard to deal with.
---
The answer is simply: Yes.
---
Alright, which one of these is the Cartman of the group
---
Get off of here and go get a job. I know how to manage my time thanks. 
---
Thankful every day  :D

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
Nostalgia is a raiding guild with a casual schedule, but a hardcore raiding atmosphere. We are built on a core of former top NA raiders that no longer have the time to commit to a rigours schedule, but still want to experience all that WoW Classic has to offer. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, while competing with the best guilds in the world is unlikely, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible.
---
Looking For: 
---
High Need
---
    Damage:
---
     -  Warlock
---
Medium Need
---
     -  Hunter
---
    Healer:
---
     -  Druid
---
     -  Paladin
---
     -  Priest
---
Low Need
---
     -  Warrior
---
     -  Mage
---
     -  Rogue
---
    Tanks:
---
We are actively recruiting all players, of any class, that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at the level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. 
---
While we would certainly prefer that everyone play an optimal class/spec, we care much more about about the person behind the character. We expect, that regardless of class/spec, that all members show a willingness to learn and become exceptional at their role.
---
Looting Policies: 
---
We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. All items of epic quality will be distributed using loot council. Items of legendary quality will be distributed to a preselected player. The person assigned to received legendary items will be selected based on the effectiveness of the item for the class, member contributions to the guild, and future guild considerations. 
---
Raid Schedule: 
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
Friday will be our main raid night, and Sunday will be a spare night intended for extra progression during new content stages.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and the MC/Onyxia raid attunement requirements have been met.

---
I havent dabbled in the natures grace spec- the idea is to spam only r4 regrowth? So 50% with talents - do you still want to stack more crit on top of that?
---
The answer is: Never enough.
---
Not like the playerbase only consists of veterans. Many people including me didn't play vanilla at launch
---
Classic will be a very social game. It's far more rewarding to be brought to a raid because the other members need and want you there. Instead of "Everything is on farm and we are a few people short, let's just carry some of our random Socials".
---
Isn't it useful for premades though?
---
This looks pretty solid. Since the priest's role is mostly support (mana burning, defensive dispelling, silence) you probably won't be using too much mana on damage unless you're sniping kills with Mind Blast.
---
You could probably take the 2 points in Shadow Weaving and take 2 from Shadow Focus to have 4/5 spirit tap. Useless in PvP but it will help you during off hours when you're farming, etc
---
Yeah I do two and do the rested bonus thing to. It's great and helps a lot to funnel greens and cloth/other mats to my alt. 
---
no you are better off getting talents in areas of need, 2 or 3 extra heals isn’t going to change any outcomes for any situations
---
Your dog plays retail?
---
That's pretty amazing.
---
I was thinking about that the other day, and I hate to say it, but I'm sure you are right.
---
MOM! More Hotpockets!
---
Forum from vanilla (some early TBC content).
---
The mindset was so different to today. People talking about outplaying rogues in PVP and topping DPS metres. For a lot of those guys, the stigma wasn't there once their talents were revamped.
---
Anyways, some of the info goes against the current meta but there's a lot of helpful reads there. 
---
Eh, you’re not wrong.  I think armor type should have class priority, but my perspective could be skewed since I haven’t raided vanilla since it was current.
---
It’s not I enjoyed it 
---
Disenchant greens at your own risk. No ones going to have money to buy dust. Also you won’t be able to afford your mount. Pickup mining / skinning. Vendor all skins save or sell ore. Get a bank alt to 5 send cloth there for bags. 
---
I Joined wow a few days before the Black Temple patch came, I'm 24 now, do the math for me. But I had many friends much younger than me who played wow with me back then
---
Would 3/3 Improved PW:S be better than 1/3 Inspiration?
---
I know right? My parents would never give me their card for this, online games were too new.
---
Same, but 1 year.
---
Compare with [this](https://nm.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b984g6/how_old_are_you_poll/).
---
I wrote "1v1" not battlegrounds though, in AB a druid is stealthguarding a capped flag not capturing new ones lol how is the rogue going to even get opener on him? As soon as he goes for the flag he will be hit with a fearie fire from 30 yards away and after that it's game over. Anyway, 1v1 usually refers to duels or open world pvp. BGs are GROUP pvp. 
---
Agreed totally. Easier than modern Mythic raids, I'm sure Heroic raids too. But especially if you haven't done them before, Vanilla raids are going to take time to figure out even for competent players, some fights are pretty complex and unforgiving. 
---
The bar for competence isn't "top 5% of raiders." If the large majority of raiding guilds on Pservers are struggling with BWL, when Pservers already have an abnormally hardcore population, it's simply not accurate to call it easy. People just like to give themselves a sense of superiority.
---
Are you from Australia?

Hey, op, same aaand same. And no shame either

---
You own your body and life. You can do whatever the hell you want with it as long as you're not harming other people.
---
A bit ignorant of OP to "warn" us not to destroy our lives with a game in its dedicated subreddit. It's not gonna happen. 
---
We definitely weren't prepared for rando microchips being on par with vacuum tube super computers, and getting exponentially better
---
Bro we’re not okay. 
---
I plan to play my alts as soon as I get a little weary of my main, just to make sure I don't burn out.
---
Will it work? Only the Earthmother can say.
---
You are absolutely right. I have strong memories of playing Peggle at some point during vanilla, but that's actually impossible! It seems I quit WoW before Peggle was launched, so I have no idea where that memory came from. I did play on a private server briefly at one point... maybe it existed there? Damn I feel older after today.
---
I misread that at 38 kids here. I lol’d so hard
---
Players are a big part of it, but so are game mechanics. Vanilla mechanics were tossed in considering a wider variety of content or just plain theme. Modern WoW has vastly expanded the kinds of skills available to players. More instance casts, more mobility, more defensive cool downs on shorter timers. Then combine that with the logistic issues of only organizing 25 people instead of 40, and it's hard to make direct comparisons.
---
Dorthnale got it.
---
one more excited norwegian here. Waiting for the magic to begin.
---
Why is it lul? A lot of us were that age when vanilla came out lul
---
In dungeons on my shaman I kinda make decisions like this on the fly depending on group composition. No druids and a leather INT item drops? Definitely going for it. A cloth chest drops and we got a mage, lock, and a priest and I'm an elemental shaman ? Yeah an argument can be make for me needing on it but honestly I'll let the clothies have it. I prefer the sturdier armor types for PVP interactions anyway.
---
Kid on the right has his hands in the right place and everything with that look “mom stop taking a fucking photo there could be a rogue right here”. 
---
they are small, but im honestly really surprised how clear they look compared to some old ass classic screenshots with 50 layers of jpg artifacting
---
Earth root was called snakeroot and had the same icon before release.  Very mild but interesting 
---
You'll do you, I'll do me.
---
Lok'tar ogar.
---
Yep, people who obsess over mechanical difficulty in vanilla are missing the point. Vanilla raids are far more about logistic difficulties than mechanical ones. Keeping 40 people engaged, geared, and doing all the prep-work is the challenge. The raid is the payoff.
---
**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** // **NA-PvP** // **Loot Council**
---
Raid times: 9p-1a CST, Wednesdays and Thursdays
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for all roles - even some nontraditional specs if you're an active, dedicated player. Having experience with the content isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary. With that said, there are some key positions we're looking to lock down before Classic launches - if you're interested in **leadership** positions and your overall goals align with ours, contact us.
---
**Contact**: If you want to have fun, clear content and be a top guild on the server, here's how to contact us:

But spirit of redemption is really bad.
---
Improved Inner Fire is typically skipped over, but it actually makes your bubbles (on yourself) last longer. 30% increased armor will reduce the physical damage you take, and that reduction is then applied to the bubble. It functions the exact same way as armor from your gear. Bubble does NOT treat you as if you're naked, having no armor.
---
Something to think about.
---

Not Scandinavian but Finland reporting in. I alone have like 10+ friends returning to play Classic.
---
Don't compare yourself with others. Live your life the way you enjoy it, not others. 
---
See we want to play classic WoW to go back to 2004 where stuff like this wasn’t a concern. 
---
And an Ele shaman!
---
Mechanically speaking yes they were significantly harder. Vanilla raiding is quite easy anyway. 
---
34, homeowner, GF lives with me, we have 3 dogs and a cat. I play in a band and work as a systems admin 45+ hours a week. I won't have the time to dedicate that I want, but i fully intend in investing 10-15 hours a week consuming essentially all of my free time.
---
I've warned her repeatedly... She stands by the "as long as i get sexy time, I'll be fine" train of thought. I'm still trying to figure out how to convince her to okay with me.
---
Oh gawd... Come on Blizzard, 4chan literally tricking multi billion $ companies now...
---
Same. Except I told her she won't be home anymore until I decide to call her back. 
---
Can't have her see me with the beard, flies around my head, and cheeto crumbs on my hair.

Expect database sites like http://classic.wowhead.com to display all relevant information like that as soon as the classic beta starts.

Casual guild. Looking for competent members for PVE content and bigoted, disparaging interpersonal relationships. PM for invite
---
Yeah because perpetually single people tend to be so damn happy. Reproduction is the primary hardwired imperative of all animals, which is what humans are. 
---
The trick is to be careful about who you marry and have kids with, which most people aren’t, so of course they end up in shitty situations, but that doesn’t mean that an institution that formed the basis of literally every successful society in history is wrong or outmoded.
---
half an hour
---
I started playing in 2004 when I was 10, so I’m equally surprised in the opposite way. I remember meeting and interacting with a lot of other kids. I remember being in vent with a guy who said he was 20 years old and thinking “he’s so old why is he playing a video game” haha. Weird to think now that’s going to be me
---
1.12 talents yeah
---
There is a certain humour to someone using a video game to qualify how “grown up” they are.
---
I always put the ammo stack on the actionbar - it shows the amount you have left.
---
I am. And I said all my free hours. I didn't say I'm going to neglect my daughter because of some game. I don't see the time with my daughter as 'free' time. A bit of misinterpretation  from your side I guess.
---
you falsely used „an“ 2 times in one sentence. i think you have other issues to take care of first, before caring about what people on reddit do.
---
Why unsmelted?
---
Same. 
---
I'll be building my new system in June, assuming a July launch.  
---
According to parts pricing right now (PC Part Picker), I'll be spending roughly $6500 all in.  A chunk of that is on a 34" Alienware ultrawide and the new Rift S VR system, but the rest are on parts that are way overkill for Classic.  And I don't care.
---
When I played classic I played it on a piece of shit, because I didn't have money to spend on anything decent for the time.  Now that I do, I'm going to splurge and enjoy.  
---
Stuttering in our 40 man raids trying to heal people will not be a problem I'll have this go-around.  
---
The only way to implement a "class priority" is via loot council in which the guild leader decides where the loot goes to benefit the raid the most. As said before the most use will be pally because the pally will stick longer to it. The priests goal is to get Tier Set asap.
---
Yes but what does current retail have to do with classic? 
---
Hi, /u/BlueCalango
---
I remember being able use mind control on a mob as a pull, then the tank can grab the Aggro once the other hostile mobs kill the one you mind controlled, then you  are free to Dps and group heal with VE. 
---
Granted it was in 5mans but it was really fun.
---
Such a great event.
---
Genuinely thought this would be another thread shitting on them. Will have a look.
---
Hook line and sinker
---
what a time to be alive though, I'm just happy the classic team seems to be committed to being as classic as possible
---
Would be cool for the addon to track your current average attacks per second that expend ammo during a session and calculate from there. Obviously just doing a quick arrows over attack speed division would give you a gross underestimation of how much time you have left on your ammo reserves since you have travel and down time.
---
Wait a minute... Worgen are NOT in Classic!
---
People will tell us we were unhealthy children. But back in late 90s- early 2000s, we played as much on the computer as we did outside. 
---
Outside from 9 am to 5 pm, on computer from 5pm to 9-10pm. On weekends stretched to 5pm to 1am.  
---
Whos 10-14 now though?
---
Dunno mate look at one of the other 12 posts a day you've copy pasted
---
&gt; That, or the mere concept of throwing countless, irreplaceable hours down the drain, staring into pixels and code rather than continuing the very cycle of life that led to our existance, is the antithesis of everything it is to be human.
---
I reject your reality substitute my own!
---
They already have that
---
The talent revamps helped, there were still major gearing issues though that weren't addressed until BC.
---
level-70 talent trees. 25-man raids instead of 40. The choices you made during a fight were more consequential. In a 40-man group, there is room for a few people doing subpar dps or healing, not so much when there are 25 people.
---
Video game addiction is real 
---
This was a huge help in most heroic raids in TBC. I would MC the mobs that gave buffs or did crazy damage and would let the rest of the pull kill it while doing as much damage with it as I could. Helps speed up pulls a lot
---
I’m not all that experienced with pvp, but this video from Ohhgee did a great job breaking down each class in pvp.  Definitely worth a watch for the classes you are interested in (priest, druid, shaman)

When I played the demo at blizzcon, I honestly didn't notice if the new graphics were used. I was distracted by the nostalgia. Not sure, but sounds easy enough to patch the graphics. 
---
Mind controlling a mob that could use CC like throw a bet or something was fun if you managed to do it before dying haha.
---
Loved seeing what different mobs could cast 
---
Arcane brilliance, right here!
---
A-fucking-men to that, fellow Boomer.
---
I'm just about to pop open a cold one, I'll take a sip of Monster Ultra for ya. See you in Azeroth!
---
Meh, I wouldn't care if it came as a toggle option later on and didn't delay launch.
---
Personally I don't see the big deal, it's not like WoW's current graphics are particularly mind-blowing either. I actually prefer a lot of the Vanilla models.
---
Personally what I'd love to see is expansions come out, but redesigned to keep to core classic principles. I don't think there's a way to do that and keep everyone happy, and it's way more effort than it'd be worth, but the child in me really wants that idea.
---
BC, WotLK, etc., but with no flying, less portals, no transmog, no lfg, leveling being part of the experience, not balancing classes much around pvp, no daily tasks/quests, and maybe figure a way for expansions to not trivialize older content.
---
Here's a rough concept for that last point: separate the leveling content of expansions and make older gear weaker in new content rather than becoming exponentially stronger.  So you are level 60, but when you go to Outlands your level changes from an orange 60 to a green 1, and "old content" gear is cut to 10% strength. Blame fel energy or something.  You are basically the strength of a starting character but with all your spells, and BC is balanced around that. BC gear has the same stats as classic gear so that end game raid gear is balanced side by side, but your BC gear can be used in BC and Classic, but Classic gear gets that 90% debuff in BC content.  There is still progression, but older content always feels relevant dangerous.
---
I suppose I am one of the few who after Warlords dropped, I went to vanilla private servers. And since then I followed the classic scene ever since. 17 btw
---
Not too bad of an idea to keep the Classic servers classic without dying out.
---
literally never seen it used that way, and never knew until now - good job on spreading it blizz
---
It's amazing how much more WoW changed from it's early stages in 2001 and the final product in 2004. A much bigger change than from 2004 to current WoW.
---
“Toxic” is a stupid meaningless buzzword. It basically just means “behavior I don’t like and want banned.” People need to stop freaking out so much about what others are doing and just mind their own business.
---
\*Laughs in PvE realm\*
---
How is this WoW related????
---
Getting a sub for 1 month is cheaper than any retail game.

If you don't like it you can just cancel and move on.

I don't see a big risk here.

No one here will be able to tell you if you like the game. Depends on what you are looking for in games. 
---
When I introduced mass effect to my cousin who only likes shooters, she hated it, because there was too much dialogue. 
---
For me it's one of my favorite games of all time. 
---
Different people like different things. 
---
Exactly you don't know so keep it quiet.
---
Its built on the new engine, doesn't that mean it has the new graphics included?
---
Google "max graphics WoW Classic"...
---
Nothing prevents me from doing that... If something doesn't fit, it doesn't fit. If I want to play with 39 Ret paladins, then that is my choice 
---
Yes, avoiding standing in fire was a skill that people needed to master. Also, things like killing your "personal demon" in SSC, or dealing with all the mechanics on the Illidan fight...
---
uhhh....

&gt; how to progress Classic after phase 6

The amount of skeletons that littered the capital cities was absolutely biblical.  I was at max level and could just eat the damage, but to the poor immunodeficient lowbies it was too much to take.

I remember my buddy bringing his whole PC over to my house to stay the weekend in my time y as room. It would get so hot in there from two PC running the whole time. Smelt like ass from two teenagers gaming for days, never forget that.

That doesn't sound like world PvP to me, just griefing

Glamour from Stormscale will once again reign supreme.

I'll rush my main and after that level like 6 chars and keep them at diffrent level ranges so Im able to 0lay with friends.
---
Sure, but that just brings me back to what I said earlier, you're only doing it specifically to play something bad, which is a dumb af reason.
---
No changes! ! ! Ffs people get it together 
---
Assuming you're not kidding, this is how easily this kinda BS gets perpetuated. It's kinda scary how easy it is to make people believe literally anything.
---
My personal favorite raid BWL video from Vanilla
---
They have a slider that allows you to user the retro, or modernized textured.  
---
You will be seeing the old animations and models (thank god).
---
I'll prbably be cranking up the graphics to max for that sweet actual grassy barrens, but keeping that OG water texture. The new one looks  too glassy and bad.
---
Got the polls for classes professions and races ?
---
No, they have never said that.
---
5year thanks.  
---
You know what I hate? 
---
When I’m a 60 rogue and I gank some noobs after third 4th death they don’t seem to come back to their body.
---
They have the audacity to log on to their characters and gank me???
---
Some people just don’t have and common curtesy

SMFH

It is a thing, and you go for it my dude. I wish I had the time to.

Friendly advice, don’t make posts like this. It comes across as very “I’m not like those other girls.” Just play what you enjoy, and enjoy what you play. Your age doesn’t matter, that’s part of the fun of WoW.

**&lt;Credendum&gt;** **EU \[PvP\] | Alliance** *(PvP or RP-PVP if they will be available)*
---
*Are  you from Norway? 25 or older? Busy life? Family? Children?  Career? Then Credendum will be the perfect choice for you. A serious guild without any obligations.*
---
**Guild Information:**  Credendum will be a place for veterans and vanilla virgins who’ve  matured and found themselves with other pressing responsibilities.  Drawbacks like you having to go ninja-AFK, failing to attend raids,  going offline for a few weeks, having your baby crying in your  microphone or other adult chores are all traits we expect, and accept.  Welcome to a guild that works WoW around your life, and not the other  way around. It doesn’t matter if you play for 6 or 60 hours a week,  there's always a place for you here. There's no requirement to be  hardcore in any way, we just want to build a solid community of mature  individuals who all share a love for classic World of Warcraft. We  probably won't push for server first kills, but instead aim to be the  kind of guild that will clear everything in a slower, but steady pace  that turns out to work best considering the schedule of our members.  Guild chat and discord language will be norwegian by default.
---
**What we expect from our members:**  In Credendum, you are free to play whatever you want, the way you want  it. We do however reserve the right to give the players with a more  "hardcore" attitude towards raiding (the ones that always show up fully  prepared with buffs and tons of consumables despite not being expected  to do so) will be given priority for raid slots. This applies even if  you're playing one of the specs that are considered unoptimal, like  Retribution Paladins, Balance or Feral Druids and so on.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Will be decided as soon as we have a sufficient raiding roster available at max level.

So I should have kids now in case I want them in the future? That makes no sense. 
---
So what you're saying is, the Classic Team should remove all chat filters and moderation from Barrens chat as nearly everyone who is interested / playing Classic will be over 18?
---
People who were born from 2005-2009.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Re balancing the game can't happen. It'd piss off way too many classic enthusiasts. The only things that need changing are how the mail box functioned and they are doing it anyway. I'd love to have bigger draw distance but that's not vanilla so i don't want it 
---
Crit.

8086K/RTX 2080Ti here.

Using Classic graphics setting by the way.
---
There’s both nice people and jerks on both sides. 
---
Rofl I did both.  I was very active playing sports, etc. with neighborhood kids and friends.  Some of my fondest memories are still laning on the weekends with a couple of good buddies back when I was in middle school and high school. To each there own.  
---
Plus your assuming from one picture these kids didn’t play outside ever.  For all you know this is the middle of the winter and 0 degrees outside.
---
You're expecting a rational argument to an emotional issue. Why do you love your girlfriend in particular? Because you do. 
---
I liked it better. Enjoyed it more. You can't make a real argument why retail or classic is better, any more than you could make a real argument whether chocolate or vanilla ice cream tastes better. Attempting to define a subjective experience through rational language is completely futile.
---
He’s got you there lol
---
That sounds alot like our guild back in vanilla, most of whom will play with us again in classic. I also know there was alot of scandinavian guilds in vanilla, so I know there will probably be a decent ammount in classic to.
---
Mom !! Bathroom 🚽 
---
I'm fairly certain this is on Sargeras. I raided with Monerin in Tyr Invictus.
---
I always played horde, looking forward to resurrecting a rouge or warlock. Is it possible to play with a ps or other type controller instead of a keyboard/mouse?
---
Yea. Ok. . we got a butt hurt warrior tank here
---
Take it easy bro.
---
So you were 13-14 when WoW originally released, so it didn't cost you your job or a serious relationship first time around and you have neither to lose right now, I don't really see the point of this thread. 
---
Laughed my ass off to the "annoying quests" video. Robot chicken alex jones is spot on.
---
ClassiCast with Esfand, Tips and Staysafe is the obvious choice (unless you find any of them insufferable like some do), they tend to retread a lot of ground often (as does this sub) but they've had some incredible guests on. 12 and 13 are absolutely essential.

---
Countdown to classic is a good podcaster. Kevin Jordan is a classic WoW dev that streams on twitch and talks about his game design and such. Can recommend both.
---
I do think about it often. People can use your points to argue either point, that all that is too coincidental and there must be a creator and a reason for our being. Or that the universe is unknowably infinite and we are a cosmic happenstance and all the strangeness in our life has no meaning. 
---
I don’t really think anyone can say for sure which is right. And I don’t think either answer is inherently sad or happy. I think the former can give people a sense of purpose that we desperately crave, but when you don’t feel like your living up to the societal norms it creates (aka be fruitful and multiply, or being financially successful etc) it leads to depression and deep melancholy about your entire existence.
---
The latter explanation sounds really pessimistic to people who think like the former. But really it just shows how lucky we are to be alive and think and feel and experience, when the rest of the visible universe can’t.

My wife and I raided extensively in vanilla in a hardcore progression guild.  She intends to main a holy/disc priest, I am still undecided between a hunter and a resto druid.
---
We're looking for a guild that will hold its members to high standards in performance, preparation, and most importantly sportsmanship.
---
We also both have extensive experience in office/leadership roles in MMO guilds from 1999 through 2009 and either of us could fill officer or advisory rolls if necessary.

Thanks, you for the long response. I will be looking forward to classic Wow now. 
---
note to self: get a cat so I can tell someone I won't be on this plane of existence for a few weeks at launch.
---
Yeah, I know but still, it's very weird. For me, vanilla WoW was never about clunky class mechanics, low draw distance or massively imbalance PvE. And yet here we are :)
---
If you dedicate the time that it takes to get used to it, there is a way:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypfZaTxwXQw&amp;t=145s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypfZaTxwXQw&amp;t=145s)

I mean, I was 4 when Vanilla came out. My parents didn’t tell us the password so they had control over how long we played, but I still loved playing and watching my dad play
---
no
---
you can aoe lashers in dm, plenty of guides on youtube.
---
Yes, of course. There's jerks everywhere.   
---
The jerks on the Alliance just seemed a bit more vocal
---
This has been removed as Rule #1 (posts must relate to Classic Wow). Please try r/Overwatch for Overwatch-related posts.
---
I think they'd be crazy not to give it at least some sort of stress test. 
---
I'm still sticking to my guns on release date this month, betas in May and June, release July. Or move all of those things up one month.
---
Haha roll a character on Mal’Ganis and you might change your mind. 
---
Exactly this. It's not difficult at all, but it's a grind. Just like getting to level 60, just like leveling professions, just like getting getting pre-raid bis. None of them are particularly difficult in any sense other than that they take time and persistence, which is what makes them gruelling, and, in my opinion, what makes it feel so rewarding once they are completed.
---
Nope, you're talking about a different game.
---
You can raid in any spec with the right guild and enough devotion.
---
Im 29 now.  A lot of us werent able to play Classic, or even TBC because we were too young (couldnt afford it, didnt have a nice enough PC, parents wouldnt let us play videogames for 12 hours every saturday, etc).
---
I actually didnt start until early or mid Wrath, just after i graduated college.
---
Would “passive aggresive, offensive, sometimes even verbally abusive” suffice?

If you scroll down on this site, they explain the theory behind it

---
Thank you! I'm gonna watch right now.
---
I'd like them to add the ability to switch specs. Just for the convienece. It makes everything more accessible with out really changing game play. 
---
Hi, /u/Dirty_Turtle_
---
This looks familiar...
---
Also same
---
While I get this point, the reckoning  change I was writing about was introduced to the game in patch  2.0.1.
---
But yeah, you're propably right, after one change more would follow and slowly but surely it would be a completely different game.
---
Sweden here. Looking forward to it
---
I’ll only allow that if it’s like 1000 gold because that would be an insane amount that wouldn’t change anything
---
First things first. You can actually make an objective argument for why retail is better. And its a mechanical one. The basic adds in dungeons now have more abilities than the bosses of classic. And the bosses have a bunch of fun mechanics to play around now. I dont know if you still play Retail but Tol Dagor (on mythic) is a really neat dungeon with some very interesting bosses. 
---
Now for the subjective part. You can actually make a decent objective argument for loving ones girlfriend. You have a personal emotional connection that gives you a certain view towards that individual. And its fine to like classic wow, but the r/classicwow circle jerk is "Retail is shit and he people who like it are shit" And while I agree the "rose tinted glasses" is kind of a silly statement I think it has much more to do with the emotional connection to the classic game than it does with classic wow actually being an objectively better game like people here like to say it is.
---
Wasn't it only for the water?
---
Does your wife play too? If not, how do you find the time? Asking for a friend... (me)
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
But it would affect the game play. Charging players for switching spec was an important gold sink and it helped maintain a healthy server-wide economy
---
&gt;no point did anyone suggest blizzard not impliment the dragon slayer buff cd.
---
Okay I will now then:
---
Yes both dragonslayer and WCB had a cooldown, I believe it was 6 or 8 hours. One need to remember that this is ONE, 2 if horde, out of the multiple worldbuffs you can get. You can still get tribute, hakkar, DMF and songflower to make the raids easy as hell.
---
What do you do by putting a cooldown on onyxia? It just means that those who wants to worldbuff has to wait longer. WCB was on a 6 hour cooldown for the longest time on pservers, but what did people do ? Skip WCB? Nope, if you were a melee dps, you had people write down when the last WCB was popped, and as soon as the cooldown was ready, people would start scouting for people turning it in. It solved nothing but make getting worldbuffs more tedious. 
---
I think the method of removing world buffs on first X weeks of new raids so that they cannot be abused to progress raids faster, removes a lot of issues and still means people can use world buffs to farm content faster(and imo in a more fun manner). 
---
&gt; They have a slider that allows you to user the retro, or modernized textured
---
Eh? wasn't it only for the water? Do you have a source on this?

Speak for yourself
---
Yep. It's a big reason why feral DPS has become viable on pservers with enough effort. 
---
Well, there is only Horde there. The alliance jerks have all migrated and are ruining Horde's Rep haha
---
I had one for years! Somehow the seal just broke on its own though...
---
Do not base classic off of the demo!!!
---
Speaking as someone playing on private servers, there is like a million Swedish people always, so I'm sure there are others from your area
---
This would definitely be a good compromise.
---
Proud of you
---
My friends and I used to use the winter time snowballs in Alterac valley to knock out teammates back into the red BG portal at the start of the game. It was really fucked up, but so hilarious as well. Good times
---
Do you mean Perfect Stealth? 
---
But private servers didn't get everything right.
---
Whoops, your right
---
Thraex for the quick dungeon guides and other content as well!
---
What?

You linked to a playlist.

Thanks, I haven't heard of any of these guys!

Thanks, I'll make sure to check it out!

A nice long list. Thank you. :)
---
I plan on leveling a Rogue (for solo play, ganking in cities, and farming) while I plan to level my actual main Shaman when other people in my group are online.
---
Fortunately, you don't really need gear to do pickpocket runs or make money via World of Warconomics, so all my cash will be pumped into my Shaman.

Oh wow that's a lot of content. Thanks a bunch.

Swede here, rolling either hunter or druid looking forward to it :) I know Scandinavian guilds on private servers have had great success, clearing all the content without much of a problem so i'm sure it will be the same in classic and I really hope I get a spot in one.
---
This.  Why are people continuously asking for changes????
---
Oh thank you massa for allowin it
---
Im actually really starting to wonder if ive gotten worse at raiding over the last 4-5 years, or if the game has just gone beyond me and gotten to an annoying point where i dont enjoy it.
---
Im fine doing almost all of the mechanics that ive encountered (ill admit, that isnt many.  Im back in one of the first raiding guilds i was ever in...and its....uh...not great....), but i have SUCH a hard time remembering the encounters from week to week.  Im beginning to wonder how much of that is my memory being absolute shit compared to 5 years ago (its always been bad), and how much of it is that every boss fight seems to have a million things going on now.  Remembering it from week to week is a real struggle for me.
---
I think you’re pretty spot on
---
I'm sorry, you must have misunderstood. That was my point actually, old and young alike can enjoy this, and other things as well. If I came of as a snowflake I must have worded myself poorly is all :)
---
I would prefer something like this rather than what OP is thinking of 
---
I've been playing a shadow priest on a P. Server, I think I'm going to main one. Might not wind up in some super uber raid guild but to be fair those kinds of guilds arnt my type anyways.
---
I've played on both factions and I can defiantly say that horde is a lot more helpful when it comes to WPvP
---
We need a late night West Coast raiding guild for all of us with kids who want to go semi hardcore when classic launches!  I'd start one but I have to whisper on mic at night because my daughter is a light sleeper, lol.
---
Slam resetting your swing timer means that you will have to wait an entire [3.x]s for your next swing after you finish casting Slam. It's practically as bad as Heroic Strike. You're better off using your excess rage on Hamstrings to get HoJ/WF procs on horde side. Alliance doesn't really use 2h fury as much because of the lack of Windfury.
---
YoU aReNT mY sUpRiVsOr
---
Frostadamus makes some very high quality videos. I’ve been enjoying them quite alot. 
---
Good amount of information in each video, and they are in my opinion the perfect length. Varying from 10-20 mins, depending on the subject. 
---
Fuck I love Goldshire chilling. My friends are making me go horde when classic releases :/
---
Sure, but they're going on whatever data we have publicly available. So any answer you receive on this sub is going to also be based on whatever that data is, or it's going to be based on someone's memory of a very specific 15 year old mechanic which was unlikely to be used at the time (how many people back then were really weighing up the advantages of a level 40 helm at level 60?). 
---
Interestingly the WoWWiki article on Powershifting actually has a blank space where the number of the nerf patch should be.

Did you level on a PvP server? I feel like that is the real key here for most. Seeing the opposite faction during chosen PvP matches is worlds-different than trying to complete quests or simply travel from city to city while getting mercilessly crushed repeatedly by stronger players.

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Exact raid times and loot system to be decided. Likely between 6:30/7 - 11/11:30. Raid days are currently being polled, with two planned raid days and current popular options looking to be either Monday, Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
**Interested?**
---

I 1.9 blizzard changed a lot of items. I believe it was the patch after Karazhan that nerfed this and some other useful items, such as the luffa.
---
What do you mean by that? I could swear that there's lots of Worgen running around in Duskwood and Silverpine Forest. Now I admit that they're not playable, but they're definitely present.
---
Or one step further, worlds buffs enabled when the next raid tier is released.  Example: MC world buffs OK when BWL is open.  I prefer one month though.
---
&gt; I have been reading a lot of posts about how to progress Classic after phase 6 has been out for a bit.
---
Clearly you haven't read enough if you felt the need to make yet another one of these posts
---
&gt; Also, it could be used to buff/tweak off-spec viability.
---
We don't do that around here
---
Pretty much.
---
Stack as much int, spell crit and SP as a paladin as possible, and use Holy Shock in conjunction with a SP trinket and Shard of the Fallen star to play more like a Shaman, but on much longer cooldowns for your actual offensive spells and bubble.
---
Spriest is fine in a casual guild. Any semi hardcore or more guild will have you do enough points into shadow to get weaving and then holy or disc for the rest. You'll be able to heal mostly fine and you just spam r1 mindflay to keep the stack up.
---
Play spriest if you want but realize there is only room for one and you'll be dead last for most gear.
---
Everyone is subject to gear dependency when it comes to raiding. Feral druids even more so but it isn’t impossible. It will be difficult to get a good weapon though so do what you can to get the best one available to you.
---
Blizzard will bring changes in desperation when the game is dead 1 or 2 years in and the only people left will be the hardcore crowd who don't care about major systems of the game being absolutely broken.
---
So true, I played a nelf priest and dominated meters in vanilla.  Always kept consumes and the right gear and was never turned away for raids.  Every once in a while someone would say, “it would be nice to have that fear ward” but it wasn’t ever enough for them to up and replace me.
---
WoW classic is the only thing that matters and you can’t change my mind
---
Troll warrior is top horde DPS race in naxx fyi

30y, girlfriend since 5 years, but don‘t have any plans for kids, want to travel and boost my career and play WoW
---
I don't think it necessarily needs a beta but I'd sure like one
---
Stress tests are a thing of the past when it comes to modern games, it's easy to replicate heavy load on realms with certain programs or whatever rather than bringing in thousands of players just to stress test for a day.
---
Also, having an open beta would ruin a lot of things if you ask me. Sodapoppin explained it pretty well on his end as a top WoW streamer, if they ever had a beta pre-official launch of classic it could lead to new players not wanting to play and/or watch classic WoW when it actually offically launches. New players just wanting to try it out for example might kill their hype completely on an open beta that might be limited in different ways. Not to mention that us veteran players would also kill a certain amount of hype on the beta, which might make the official launch a less fun experience overall since we literally lived through a classic launch last month if the beta comes out in May and classic launches in June (as an example).
---
I personally feel like it's better to just wait with everything until the official launch both for the sake of the community and Blizzard and it seems like Blizzard has the same idea considering like you said.. we're soon in mid-April and haven't heard anything about any beta's or simple 1-20 testservers like the demo. They haven't even expressed interests in beta's as for as I know.
---
The big deal is that people spent years with those old visuals, struggled with their characters and guildies through thick and thin. Humans get attached to things.
---
I personally find them more endearing and have a quirkiness that just isn't there with the new graphics.
---
&gt; while the paladin has at least 3x more options
---
Not when there's a handful of non-cloth healing items per tier at best and that half of them are mediocre, on top of pally tier being garbage for healing while priest tier is decent. Priest has more options simply because their tier sets are actually viable for healing.
---
You aren't gonna get a debuff slot for swp, if there are available slots they go to corruption to keep ISB debuffs up
---
I absolutely love Platinum WoW, he doesn't upload very often but every video is hilarious, informative, and very well edited. I can't recommend the guy enough, he deserves way more subs than he has.
---
I want to play warrior tank as one of my character in Classic, is it as daunting as it seems? I went on an instant 60 pserver to try it out and after putting about 35 abilites on my action bars between the 3 stances I just kinda sighed and gave up, I know that leveling and tanking will give me plenty of play time and experience to learn but do I really need that many abilities and stance dancing to do well?
---
Kargath is usually where the Horde gathers, and it is ganked to no avail.  Especially during MC / BWL raids.  We used to fly into FC, and travel in groups no less than 20 so we could at least get inside.  Sadly, in AQ, there were no alternative routes.  :)
---
There are also plenty of comments on different sites of people who used Wolfshead Helm as Cat DPS even well into TBC and Wraith.
---
Oh so his suggestion is not good enough because it would affect the game play, but yours is totally fine? 
---
You really think rebalancing classes is not going to affect the game play?
---
They need a *server* test for sure. A stress test. Unless they can find some in-house way to pull off thousands of computers logging in around the world, it might have to be an invitational "beta" sort of thing. 
---
I honestly hope that's all they do, and I hope that it's only in the starting zones (where they plan to shard). I know that it would be best to test everything as much as possible, but I really hope they can pull that off in-house and just drop the game on us on release day. I feel like that would allow for the hype to stay strong, whereas a beta that's being streamed by dozens of people on Twitch... I feel that will kill a lot of that hype.
---
Exactly the same minus the age. 31. Lol
---
You don't understand.
---
Your lack of preparation requires someone else to waste their time farming shards to make sure *you* get to the dungeon on time.
---
You're making it the responsibility of someone else to do your work for you.
---
Most guilds get tired of attitudes like this, and basically tell folks, if you want to raid / do dungeons, etc., do NOT expect a summon unless it's an emergency and you went back to get xxx for xxx.
---
You're making yourself more important than the rest of the group, and that shows that you're not a team player.
---
I was 11~ when I began to play. You "can't even relate to playing online video games at such a young age, i don't think i would've liked it".
---
Really? Try to think about what walking into Dun Morogh and seeing mountains and yetis to battle for the first time must have felt like for a kid whose imagination is still incredibly ripe and full. The WORLD of Warcraft seemed never ending and gigantic to me. It was actually an entirely new world, I think it took me months just to get from Dun Morogh to the Wetlands and I remember being blown away when I first crossed the bridge into arathi highlands, it was surreal. Really dont think its hard to imagine why kids of those ages loved it, and I think its silly to say you dont think you would have.
---
Yeah, I'm with you, I mean I don't get the big deal in having to look at old graphics. I've no time for people that won't play old game just because they don't look like new games, it's bananas.
---
I’m always amazed at how young some of you were in vanilla. I was already college age in 2005.
---
I'm very anal about ammo but I'd still at least give it a try. If you added in a pet food tracker, I'd be even more willing.
---
I don't know how it was back then but currently the amount of edgelords are the highest on the horde side, pserver experience.
---
Not agree - Shadow priests are great. :)
---
&gt; First things first. You can actually make an objective argument for why retail is better. And its a mechanical one. The basic adds in dungeons now have more abilities than the bosses of classic.
---
You are presenting a fact, what is, and making statements on that basis about what ought to be. You've not linked the two.
---
Humor aside, you can't tell me what I think is "better". I don't agree that the amount of abilities a boss has makes is better. If you do, well, there's subjectivity for you.
---
&gt; You can actually make a decent objective argument for loving ones girlfriend. You have a personal emotional connection that gives you a certain view towards that individual.
---
That is not an argument, you are describing a subjective experience. 
---
&gt; . And its fine to like classic wow, but the r/classicwow circle jerk is "Retail is shit and he people who like it are shit" 
---
Yeah I agree with that.
---
&gt; And while I agree the "rose tinted glasses" is kind of a silly statement I think it has much more to do with the emotional connection to the classic game than it does with classic wow actually being an objectively better game like people here like to say it is.
---
I played on Nostalrius, got to 60 and thought it was fine. Anyone claiming any objective reason why one game is better than another is, as I've said, misunderstanding the word *objectivity*.
---
I get what you want though, I just don't like when people use words like "objectivity" or "logic" (another pet peeve of mine) incorrectly, as the word grants a certain "indisputable"-ness to ones argument that I think is unhealthy for an individuals understanding of their own view-points, not to mention the damage arbitrary dogmatism has on society. So with that said:
---
 * Server transfers, cross-realm, name changes and the like has moved your character from a participant in a closed community, too an anonymous character. When I was level 60, some people on my server were famous. I'd see one of the guys from the top guild on my server, inspect them, maybe even have a chat in /s. This part of the game is largely gone.
---
* The lessened investment in time required to find groups, travel the world, replace leavers, finish dungeons, and crowd controlling mobs, in turn lessens the amount of social interaction necessary, and thus in practice available. You join a group, leave if it wipes, communicate very little, whereas before you were forced to communicate.
---
* While the map is larger now, it is also more convenient and you have earlier, faster and less imposing means of travel. Which, for all the extra content, decreases the exploratory elements hoisted on the player.
---
Wow has never had great gameplay imo. I can jump into the new assassins creed games and have much more fun gameplay than pressing E, waiting for global, then casting with 1 and drinking for mana after. Once the social aspects of the game disappeared, so in large part did my own, as well as that of many others, investment into the game. Unless you raid or play PvP, WoW plays mostly as a solo-player game, the aspects of which I personally experience a whole host of other games to outperform it in.
---
If you disagree with any any/all of the points I've made, that's fair. But you're not doing so out of some *objective* analysis, instead you, as I, orient yourself using a personal set of values which lends more or less credence to certain elements than the equivalent sets of others. Arbitrarily defining what's "good" as what corresponds to your personal enjoyment and in the next instance using this definition as a measuring pole against which to judge the quality of something is the very definition of subjective.
---
One of us! Gooble gobble!
---
Was going to make this exact comment until I saw yours. I thought I was on the young side playing this at 17~ in '04.
---
17:00 to 20:00 would be perfect. I don't need more than an hour to prepare for work.
---
We always laughed as we entered levels 35-45 as Tauren -- here come the clowns.  It was extra hysterical when you realized that not only did you look like a clown, but there were doors that you could NOT fit through as a Tauren -- dressed like a clown. :)
---
True
---
Removing one pretty major gold sink from the game would have much more impact than making one pretty sucky spec suck a little less.
---
Oh this is true. I started in BC myself.
---
Q = strafe right, A = strafe left. Abilities are E,R,T,D,F,G,X,C,V,3,4,5 plus shift, ctrl, and alt modifiers on all of them.
---
You're 100% right about the luffa.  Was it the Moroes encounter that caused it?
---
You can be carried in any spec as spot 39 or 40. Just don't expect any loot, your only purpose there is to fill the gap and help the 25-30 people carrying you to get their items. If you are okay raiding with the knowledge that you are literally worthless to the raid and do it for basically no reward then godspeed.
---
No amount of "devotion" will make a retribution paladin anything but a shit warrior.
---
Nope. Maybe later, but they’re just trying to release the original game at the moment.
---
There has not been too much interest from the community in the updated graphics. It would also take a bit of work to do, because some vanilla-only stuff may have never gotten remade in cata or whenever the reworks were done.
---
So we're only balancing on sucky spec? 
---
Screw the rest of them, just buff the one I like?
---
As of now, it's at 668 points, out of 64,327 sub members.  
---
It means that **now** it's 1.04% of the people on this sub approving this thread.  
---
I'm not talking about up- vs. down- votes, I'm talking about how many on the sub gave a shit about it.
---
Played on a certain server the other day and a BALANCE Druid was on top of the AB leading Killing Blows. It can be done.
---
&gt; Im taking my hunter to maraudon as fast as possible.
---
Well, youre probably going to be waiting a few months, then.
---
Quality post. Great finds. I've never seen these before!
---
I think it’s calculated at the time it finishes casting.  But then again if he were to somehow move away from you at the same speed as the arrow would it never hit him?
---
In PvP? I guess no. Priest and Pally outperform Druid by miles healing wise. Shamans are better too.
---
Uhh, I'm not sure how it works with spell batching and travel times, I know it didn't used to (Lava Burst into Flame Shock being an example from a few expansions ago), so it might not; I don't know if they changed that between.
---
I've been out of the loop since WotLK -- what are you talking about? To my knowledge, WoW has always had a day/night cycle that corresponds with your server's clock.
---
No your playing it specifically because you enjoy the feel of that character. The fact it is bad in one aspect of the game is irrelevant...
---
what an odd thing to say
---
We are a bit from both, we are gonna have a vote on what faction to go a little while before launch.
---
Growing up with my best friend and his brother as the raid leaders and their dad as our main tank for our vanilla group was awesome. Me and another buddy used to take our PCs over to their house on raid nights and we'd order pizza and hang out together for hours. 
---
The time spent in game was just as fun as the time spent out of game. 
---
Sadly, they've since grown out of gaming and I have a bit in my own right as well, but the nostalgia for those times will remain a happy memory of my early adult years.
---
I assume people use it to help powerlevel mining?
---
I used to check this website every day since the moment the it came online. I spent so much time looking at screenshots and how they translated it from the Warcraft 3 universe. I remember being always amazed at the way darnassus looked. Every time I opened up the web browser I hoped that there would be a new feature or class or spells released.
---
It would be interesting if they took the best from TBC, like quality of life changes and class balance, but actually made new content more in the spirit of pre-TBC.
---
US/RP/Alliance group looking for either a guild to call home OR a few more people so that we can justify making out own guild. We are happy to join any midcore PVE guild as long as they're on a RP server.
---
Ideally we'd like to raid 3 nights a week for 4 hours each. We will also have designated RP nights that will of course be optional. 
---
Everyone in my group has extensive classic WoW experience and I also have tons of raid/guild leading experience. We are looking for more players who are serious and consistent but aren't interested in being super hardcore. Or if you just want a group of people to level or RP with, we'd love to have you too!
---
It's so weird but I love the alpha models, great pictures!
---
Been playing SP since release, and this warms my soul. 
---
So many good memories raiding vanilla as shadow, spending my dkp and fighting locks and mages for non-set cloth dps gear.
---
Why does this even matter? It's a quality meme.
---
Haha you try WoW in VR for crazy immersion, shame its not officially supported.
---
So you pressed frostbolt ?
---
Man your internet must have been strong as hell
---
That orb of deceiption though.
---
Well, others have already brought up the errors in this meme, so I will not even touch the subject of "quality" on this.
---
Wish i had friends this dope. Me and my old brother shared an account cause our parents couldnt afford 2 subs. Frequently almost had an irl duel lol
---
Night was darker before Cata, but I think in alpha WoW the nights were so dark you actually needed to use a torch to be able to see where you were going.
---
But was it effective at conveying its message? Yes. Don't we all have better things to do than take a dump on each other for the small details we get wrong?
---
I'll concede that Hamstring definitely has the benefit of being instant cast, but Slam does so much more damage. Is it better to dump 10 rage on an attack that does double digit damage at best and hope for a proc, or 15 on an attack that is like a fast-cast heroic strike with the same chance at a proc? 
---
Let's say my weapon is 3.4 speed (TUB or BRE in this case).  Both Bloodthirst and WW are on cooldown and the boss is not in execute range.  What outputs more damage per second? Let's assume no crits and no procs for this scenario below.
---
&lt;=========== 3.4 seconds ========&gt;
---
Auto attack =&gt; hamstring =&gt; auto attack
---
500ish ------------60ish------------500ish
---
&lt;=========== 4.4 seconds ========&gt;
---
Auto attack =&gt; Slam =&gt; auto attack
---
500ish ---------  600+ ---- 500ish
---
Slam does weapon damage +87 according to classicdb.
---
You slow down the time of the next auto attack, but the slam hits for way more than what hamstring can produce. You're effectively adding 1 second to your time between auto attacks, but it's a yellow hit with bonus damage that can crit and cause the same procs that hamstring could.
---
To me its the constant crapton of graphical effects on screen, plus the lore-breaking aspect of it all.
---
So you are telling me I've killed a gazillion of these things before, but this one can instantly kill me if I don't jump or turn around when he yells? Why doesn't he just shut his mouth so everybody dies?
---
27, married, got a baby boy, house, 2 cars, good job,all I think at night while staring at the ceiling is “Undead Rogue or Priest...”

---
Yes, look at all those dead private servers with 10k pops
---
Dude on the far right living large with that flat screen monitor
---
That ultrawide will help with raid frames
---
That's a crappy list and Tips does a terrible job at interpreting it.
---
3000 seconds in combat is 50 minutes. That's not boss fights, that's overall data. Nobody cares about overall data, all that's there for is to show which guilds have Naxx on farm and steamroll through the place with world buffs and never wiping. Trash in general favors warriors and rogues due to their instant attacks and ability to cleave. Mages are skewed because only one mage gets everyone else's ignite damage until it falls off.
---
Not saying ret paladins do or don't beat hunters, but using this list as proof either way is retarded. It's just as dumb as people that use top dps ever instead of 95th percentile dps from retail logs to decide which dps class is currently the highest.
---
If only there were more of your kind! See you in Azeroth!
---
Odd. I had just finished high school when WoW became popular. No one in school talked about it until that South Park Episode came out.
---
AoC was amazing for the first 20 levels. Such great care was taken in the starting zones and the plot/story was fairly good.
---
But by lvl 58, I was getting tired of smashing the same three buttons and there was very little to do in the game other than some super buggy "dungeons".
---
Your kit is more limited - rejuv is the only instant you have off cooldown, so its easier for the other healers to heal.
---
That aside, you have obviously the most mobility of any healer. If the opponents are dumb enough to chase you, you can take 2 or more folks out of the fight just by cheetahing all over the place, essentially just like a flag carrier.
---
When most people say "Resto druids can't heal", what they probably mean is that a deep resto spec doesn't offer a ton compared to a hybrid druid spec and\or other healers. You aren't bad, there are just other options that many view as better.
---
brings back memories
---
You are trying to make this fit when it obviously can’t. Warriors already rage dump, the cost of HS isn’t an issue. 
---
It does work for 2H fury on horde side, but only due to WF, and has only been confirmed on private servers as far as I know (WF proc rates are pretty much confirmed but you never know). It also scales horribly and you’d be better off going dual wield as soon as you get your first tier 1 weapon.
---
I'm going to hazard a guess and say you're having that problem again before Classic, yeah?
---
Meant as playable race. ;) That was added in Cata.
---
No, she does not. But she has her tv series in the evening and will join you guys in Azeroth :)
---
Considering I have less responsibility now (work) than in 2004-2005 (work + school), I have an even bigger excuse to no-life my way to the top of my realm.

Originally planned a Tauren Druid. Currently landed on a Night Elf Priest. 
---
Send help.
---
I'm just sick of people who actually believe throwing a literal tantrum will somehow earn them dev brownie points instead of actually responding.
---
You seem to have your mind made up pretty well.
---
Meteor trinket doesnt scale with spellpower. Not sure why everyone is so hyped over it. It's just 400 fire damage increased by whatever debuffs increase damage/magic damage taken.
---
It also splits damage between every enemy hit.
---
No premade will intentionally gimp themselves by taking druid as healer. As a pvp druid your sole purpose is to run the flag which is no easy job by the way.
---
Considering Classic's pace, I'd say by level 15 you have an idea if you're addicted or not. No one should go "Just wait till level 40 man, that's when it REALLY gets fun!"
---
I didn't need to leave Dun Morogh to know I loved the game.

There was a lot of good pride in the game: faction/guild/class pride.
---
I remember world PvP when there was a genuine hate for the opposing faction. When someone in general got ganked it felt like an attack on your family.
---
There were real class masters. Min/max information wasn't quite as prevalent back then and when you saw someone at max level just destroying people or keeping entire groups alive with their heals there was a cool mystique around them. 
---
You had real rivalries. I remember a world PvP feud between an Alliance member and myself that went on for a year. You had people you dueled for months... It was just a crazy world back then in terms of the community (in a great way).
---
I'm just waiting on a release date announcement, but then definitely will be taking some time off.  Guessing seems like a bold move!
---
Thank you very much! I'll check it out and see if I can find a way to contact anyone in that guild who is signed up
---
It's not orb of deception. It's Crystal of Zin-Malor.  [https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=13347](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=13347) 
---
It deals constant damage while equipped so you use it as a tank to break Cyclone on Ossirian so you can solotank it, and to break the Blind of phase 1 of the ZG tiger boss.
---
There are plenty of other gold sinks. Hell you could charge me to do it from my character, just let me do it instantly with out going back to a trainer evey time. Its a minor convienece to make the game a little better.
---
I mean you can goof around with friends. but any mildly competeitive premade pretty much will never have restor druids as a healer. (unless they couldnt find any other person to fill the spot).
---
as solo or small group of friends you can still play one if you want ofc, its just that other healers are just better in pvp in comparison and offer more for pvp. and its not very close honestly. compare it to paladins and priest. shamans are abit worse but got totems. what druids give? they don't have 1.5 cast heal, so its ahrd to heal in pvp period. hots are pretty trash.
---
so ya you can say they are pushed to be flag carriers. you can sometimes see them heal in ab or av. but usually thats cos fc druid need to be doing something. or as i said you need to fill up group spots.
---
Most likely it’s an effect of spell batching and might not always work?
---
Blood Elves joining the Horde did make sense for lore reasons as far as joining either faction goes. In WC3 the Alliance (humans at least) screwed them over, sent them on suicide missions and tried to execute Kael'thas. Of course they'd join the Horde over the Alliance. Similar to Forsaken - they need a faction to survive and distance themselves from the Scourge. Maybe they would make more sense in the Alliance as they're all undead humans but the Alliance would never accept them. The Horde is a faction of outcasts and oppressed races banding together. 
---
Blood Elves and Forsaken make perfect sense for the Horde
---
Tfw 31 year old with no kids
---
Core Leather Gloves, and Distracting Dagger would add up to +9 Daggers. You can get more later on. Then again, that's when Maladath comes in. It's just been said that because there are so many raid items with +dagger skill that daggers are Fury BiS during end game raiding.
---
I was alliance on Stormscale in Souls of eternity and later horde in Cutthroats. I knew some nam people, what was your nickname?
---
Yes it does. People used Wolfshead Helm well into TBC.
---
Both of my parents told me very early on that I should wait until around age 30 (minimum) to get married. And enjoy the marriage for a few years before you have kids. That's what they did.
---
Of course, they each separately had a marriage in their very early 20's that didn't work out. They later found and met each other, and are still happily together to this day.
---
So, to your point, I think these folks are on to something.
---
If by level multiple characters you mean have a main and a severe case of altitis then yes, that is not my plan but will be what I end up doing.
---
I’ll main a warrior, but I know I will have a mage with tailoring that I’ll think ‘oh, I should just level the mage enough to get mats and craft some bigger bags to send to the main’. Followed by ‘Need more pots on the warrior. I could buy... oorrrrr.. a few more levels on the priest, make some pots and sent them over.’ ‘Need more mats for blacksmithing on the warrior. Let’s grab my miner/engi hunter and just send the ore to the warrior.’ Etc etc.
---
I laugh when people wonder ‘what happens when you hit 60 and have done everything?!’ Umm.. it’ll be months or a year to get my first 60 and the alts.. ahh.. my sweet retail child.
---
The arrow and it's trajectory isn't simulated in this game. You either shot someone or you didn't. If you did, an animation plays out where the arrow travels to the target.
---
This also means that the moment you finished casting is when the enemy gets damaged.
---
haha my bad I'm only 27 just can't help myself
---
It blows that you need to put in PTO so far in advance.  Guessing is certainly risky business.  There wasn't any blue posts last week (given April fools, not surprising), but maybe they held back an update because they have good news coming our way.
---
Vanilla raiding is VASTLY over-rated difficulty wise. The game has gotten harder raiding wise with every expansion.
---
Even Heroic Raid mechanics nowadays blow Vanilla raiding out of the water in execution. Heroic Kil'Jaeden on launch.. Shutter.
---
Some debuff dependent bonuses for mage are calculated on spell completion, NOT spell batch clear.
---
The example I have in mind is if you finish a frostbolt while frost nova is up, it benefits from the increased critical chance (provided you have shatter) even if the nova isn’t present when the actual ability hits.
---
That being said I’m not 100% sure hunter or any other class / mechanics also works this way- it could be that different debuffs work differently as well- maybe attack power from hunters mark is calculated on spell completion but resists from curse of elements is calculated on spell batch clear. Maybe if you scorch for more fire damage as a mage and it lands before the fireball the damage calculation is done on batch- but I have a hunch that they would be processed like the frostbite- on spell completion.
---
Why do people want everything to be as expensive as it was before? There is so much farming to do already, at least let me be able to pvp and pve effectively.
---
You can’t release a game without bug testing. There has to be a beta.
---
WTB copy/paste of the post here... at werk yo.
---
Guild and character name? I played a rogue called unkk on both horde and alliance.
---
39, 3 and every few hours.

So, to your point, I think these people are on to something.
---
Since we broke down the [six phases](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346/1) of content that we’ll be rolling out for Classic, we’ve heard the increase in requests for PvP details so we wanted to get you up to speed on our plans there.
---
As was the case when World of Warcraft originally launched in 2004, there won’t be a formal PvP system in WoW Classic at the outset. You’ll still be able to PvP, of course, and there will be no Dishonorable Kills, so you’ll be free to repeatedly hunt down every player and NPC in, say, Stranglethorn Vale to your stealthy heart’s content.
---
That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards. The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12. Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on, but we’re certain Hillsbrad Foothills will still see its fair share of action!
---
In the third phase, we’ll introduce the first Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley ([version 1.12](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908)) and Warsong Gulch, alongside with their associated vendors. One thing to note is that there were a couple of updates to these vendors over the course of the original patch releases, so some items won’t be available right away. For example, the Spell Penetration trinkets available from the Warsong Gulch vendor weren’t introduced until Patch 1.9, so we’re currently thinking that we’ll add these in phase 5.
---
The Arathi Basin Battleground will follow in phase 4, along with its specific vendor. It’ll be interesting to see how many people stay behind to guard the flag. 📷
---
Finally, in phase 6, we’ll have the world PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands, which will come out at the same time as Naxxramas.
---
Here’s what the PvP content looks like mapped to the phases we [recently posted about](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346/1):
---
**Phase 1 (WoW Classic Launch)**
---
* You can PvP one another in the world, but there is no tracking, and no formal rewards for doing so.
---
**Phase 2**
---
* Honor System (including Dishonorable Kills)
---
* PvP Rank Rewards
---
**Phase 3**
---
* Alterac Valley ([version 1.12](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908))
---
* Warsong Gulch
---
**Phase 4**
---
* Arathi Basin
---
**Phase 6**
---
* World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands
---
As we mentioned before, we haven’t yet determined exactly when each of the [content phases](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346/1) will occur but we’ll keep you updated as they draw closer.

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.

Alterac Valley (version 1.12)
---
Warsong Gulch
---
Phase 4
---
Arathi Basin
---
Phase 6
---
World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands
---
As we mentioned before, we haven’t yet determined exactly when each of the content phases will occur but we’ll keep you updated as they draw closer.
---
I played horde exclusively in vanilla so I don't know what Frostmane Alliance was like. Horde players were cool, though. Everybody was helpful and nice.
---
I didn't play Alliance until mid-late TBC, rerolled on an RP server as well and as most people know the communities on RP servers are often a little different from non-RP servers. Everybody was helpful and nice.
---
Will be 40 in June with a toddler and a newborn in August. I’m still gone be playing classic as a filthy casual!
---
Show me which ones maintained 10k+ over multiple years.
---
They can’t change anything or it will open the floodgates and then everyone’s gonna ask for “small” changes to their class. It’s a slippery slope you don’t want to mess with.
---
That's exactly what this guy is doing. He is using a Ps4 Controller on PC and an Addon called Console Port. You can do the same with the Xbox Controller.
---
Check out r/klassiskwow for a Danish classic wow subreddit
---
Are those empty coke cans or full?
---
Phase 2 will be interesting! Seems the only way to rank up then is world PvP.
---
Because it wasn’t an option available but when it was available at first it costed 1k gold.
---
This is a great idea. I'd like to be able to be to confirm the purchase though.
---
They made night brighter in Cata? Lame! It was plenty bright enough in vanilla!! 
---
That would have been a wild mechanic had they kept night time truly dark like in alpha. I actually heard in an interview with one of the devs that the original idea for Duskwood was to require a torch to be able to see, just like what you were saying.
---
Come on you can’t do that. Either link the post or explain wtf fizzing is.
---
I had a weird experience with Hakkar after TBC was released. I was in a guild who didn't level past 60 and we carried on raiding endgame content (although it was EZ mode with PVP gear access and tbc talents).
---
When Hakkar does his soulflay it drained me to 1hp while it killed others. I had a renew on me which ticked to heal me and I was drained back down to 1hp. When it ended I was burst healed back up and survived it. Very strange!
---
thanks buddy
---
I'm so glad Alterac isn't there at launch. Everyone would be farming there to get good pre raid gear. It would be a complete shit show.
---
Hi, /u/vox182
---
Just messing around. :)
---
Why is this thread already unstickied ;_; For I have so many questions.
---
For example, what item is he using at this timestamp shortly after his Hammer of Justice runs out? It slows the hunter and is displayed as a debuff with a Frostbolt icon. https://youtu.be/qodXtYwTZuo?t=1662
---
This is what I'd rather see. Or open TBC servers.
---
28, 2nd kid on the way and married. Cant wait to play when the kids sleep!
---
You are welcome.
---
Have a good day!
---
Haha no way, I see Eckstra in that spreadsheet! Played in SOE together and had some lan parties as we lived very close to each other. Think I have him on Facebook.
---
Another fix for the addicts :)
---
Looks great, can't wait for this game to come out!
---
Gonna be fun; folks are gonna get their PVP fix via the World, yeee.
---
Hmm, I want to know the timeline for each phase.  I dont want to wait 6 months after launch to get in to battlegrounds.
---
Good bot.
---
I imagine it must be really hard. I think that's just not the kind of thing I wanna be doing.
---
Yeah, I agree... as proven by other posters below, even suggesting one change brings now a avalanche of poop and other smelly things...;/
---
Why not buff feral, enh, ele, etc? Once you start changing things you're giving everyone else leverage to demand their changes.  It sounds like you don't really want to play vanilla wow and that's fine but don't try and make us play a different game.
---
I go to Ikea with a smile when she asks. I cook most meals and watch Netflix or movie a couple nights a week. This kind of thing.
---
The message it conveyed is that OP made the meme without even knowing what they were doing, and that's [from OP's own words](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bal15j/your_gear_while_leveling_retail_vs_vanilla/ekcf6kg/):  
---
&gt; In regards to gear, I litteraly picked the first and best looking set I could find without too much consideration to when it was added. I have no first hand experience of WoW beyond TBC, most of my information about the game is from friends who's still playing.  
---
But I know, the circle-jerk on this sub is that you cannot like Vanilla unless you shit on retail, which is a very dumb thing to be honest.  
---
You can like and love both, for different reasons, no need to shit on one just to feel superior.
---
Looking for a late night West Coast guild.  Plan to main holy paladin.  Have a daughter so can't start raids before 8:30pm PST.  Used to be extremely hard core but quit in MoP.  Want something well organized, thoughtful, fair - more of a community than a job, but at the same time want to clear all content and want to group with folks who can carry their own weight.
---
Looks about right. It's hard to know without a time line for when each phase will arrive though.
---
Those who are still leveling up on a PvP server during phase 2 are gonna have a bad time.
---
The grind is going to be the same, I love it. I'm looking forward to when newcomers find out you can't simply queue for BGs and get Rank 14... or even 10.  
---
"Keep in mind though, just as it did originally, it will require a substantial time investment to rank up through the Honor System. For those interested in the Rank Rewards, earning epic gear will require consistent dedication over a long period of time as a top contributor on your realm. We don’t expect to see many people running around with these items early on[.]"
---
Phase 2 will be mayhem.
---
I fear I will still be in the 50s when that rolls around and will be ganked constantly!
---
In the third phase, we’ll introduce the first Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley (version 1.12 16) and Warsong Gulch, alongside with their associated vendors. One thing to note is that there were a couple of updates to these vendors over the course of the original patch releases, so some items won’t be available right away. For example, the Spell Penetration trinkets available from the Warsong Gulch vendor weren’t introduced until Patch 1.9, so we’re currently thinking that we’ll add these in phase 5.
---

Love this. World PVP will thrive.

TL:DR "We made it vanilla. Yes this include Dishonorable kills. #NoChanges"
---

---
IQ in Classic has a hard cap of 60 as well. Must be an alt account.
---
During vanilla, I had my own personal raid innervate from a druid.  We both had macros to eachother.  God, i loved that drood.
---
&gt; Phase 6
---
&gt; World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands
---
While world objectives came out late in vanilla, I would rather see them out in phase 1 or 2 as then they would be more appealing. Very few people will do them in phase 6 but in phase 1/2 there might be at least some activity?
---
In my scenario you're already waiting at the dungeon for a group member to join. Healer/tank. When they do join maybe they're at away at a city. Summon becomes very useful for both parties.
---
1.11 updated pvp gear out the gate in p2 is big and means PvP will be very important if you want to stay relevant in gear.
---
like bg's not being there at start but hate that we wont get them until phase 3

---
Oh yeah, and if you stoke the flames right you can convince some, but not all of your guild. This is key because it'll create a rift within the guild in which the credibility of everyone's ideas will flip over if the truth ever gets out.
---
Camp A. People who think the two hunters are dogs. These people seem discredited because its a ridiculous proposition. Bonus points if they develop a smug/underhanded sense of superiority, like they're "in" and "know more than the others". They reveal their suspicious to others slowly, and only in private. Over time, everyone will know that some people are suspicious but ideally the guild will never have an open conversation about it. Then, upon raiding and voice-chat these people will begin to take their own suspicion seriously, likely to their own disbelief. Like when Trump went from "he might get elected" to "he.... actually might be our president?!"
---
Camp B. Are the people who would never accept them being dogs as a possibility. They laugh at the notion of it, but never even give it enough credibility to dismiss it. Most of these people won't even think about it. Bonus points here: Get them to say things like "yeah if X is a dog i'll give everyone in the guild 10 gold" or "There's no way a dog can out-DPS me, he's just a shy player". Come raid/ventrilo time you need to shake these people's confidence (and rally camp a), then snuff out the chance that they are dogs (say you know them IRL or something). This will give camp B a "whew, that would've been weeeeirrrdddd" moment.
---
Then, some how........ some way....... right around Hakkar...... you begin to slip. Get them to run at mobs and bark loudly in voice chat. Make them pass on loot and randomly roll on bones and anything dog related. When you finally kill Hakkar, make them howl like wolves over voice and the next day...... you tweet dozens of youtube videos of your prior guild raids and the dogs holdin up DPS. You let the guild know that for months, BegginStrips and Hoosagoodboi, twin tauren hunters (who are only on at the exact same times as each other)...... were, in fact, dogs....... the entire time.
---
This could be your magnum opus. Your sis-teen chapel. Your citizen kane. Don't thank me for the idea, I just want to see the show.
---
See you in classic.
---
Is this good news? I don't know what to think
---
phase2 pvp server will lose its entire 48-59 population, pve server will all be about honor trading with the opposite faction... how to not do things...
---
This is interesting news. I’m glad to hear PVP will be rolled out similar to the way it arrived in Vanilla. Blizz seems to be sticking to their commitment to being as authentic to Vanilla as possible with Classic. 
---
Hope that they'll keep a close eye on anyone aiming for HWL/GM to make sure they aren't account sharing to get it. It was already a thing back in original vanilla and has only gotten more common on private servers.
---
Aka like 70% of people
---
Don't sweat it. WoW is easy to get into, although if you're only used to modern games with their overdose of QoL features, then you'll have to adapt towards that. But it's in no way "too difficult" - This isn't Dark Souls. Also, people are generally quite friendly, they have to be if they want success on their own server, since reputation means everything.
---
When you kill them with two casts, not bad.
---
Wow. Don't you know 6 is stun?
---
Yep, that's how it was in retail Vanilla. I don't recall many people getting super high ranks back then, as the period between the launch of the PVP Rank system and the first BGs wasn't very long, first of all, and second of all, it was hard to coordinate honor gains, so it was more of a free-for-all.
---
Considering battleground are Phase 3, I think 6 months is a pretty conservative estimate for BGs. I would peg it around to 8-12 month mark.
---
Good post for inspiring rets, boomkins etc that love the class and spec but feel they will be left out of the raiding scene.
---
People will mostly ignore pvp during phase 1 outside of RP reasons or just to fuck with people.
---
This means the faster you level the more you can focus on alts, making gold, farming consumes, etc in phase 1.
---
Once phase 2 rolls around those who haven't hit 60 better prepare their buttholes at Dire Maul and at flight paths due to no ability to enter battle grounds.
---
Phase 3 will go back to normal ranking with most pvpers chillin in BGs grinding rep and honor.
---
Level fast my dudes or your about to get gankbanged when you hit level 48 and you're worth honor.
---
Honor system with no BGs 🤔
---
If you are a main raid rank you are expected to have loyalty as the guild will invest a lot of gear into you so they can do the content faster.
---
Getting murdered in stv while not knowing what quests were because I decided to come to the zone at level 26.
---
No AB until phase 4? Wtf. Stuck with crappy wsg that sucks.
---
This update is at least helping me decide if I want to zerg to 60. I think for my main I will have to zerg 60 now. I can stop and smell the roses on one of my many alts.
---
so flight masters will be camped
---
&lt;3 Adam Savage
---
Probably more than that my dude. Like a year.
---
We really have nothing to base it off.  Phase 3 might be pretty quick.  There is no raid content in phase 2.
---
For the people who know the actual in game lore, yes this is well known.
---
For all the people who don't and just want to be a pretty elf, human, or Tolkien dwarf -- they don't care and are blissfully ignorant of their factions malicious intent.
---
Zug Zug, friendo.
---
Can’t argue with that, though I think those two items add +11. I’m sure we will see many more fury warriors than we did before - wasn’t until a bit later in progression they started to become a thing, but Classic will be slightly different.
---
Needs more bepis.
---
Another important question is: Will you have to queue up at the battlegound entrances or will there be Battle Masters. If not, will Battlemasters be introduced later on?
---
People can be moved. Dev teams are not static and grow and shrink based on need. If Classic WoW is a roaring success and their is clamouring for more original content based on the philosophy of Classic WoW they will move people over.
---
If you like vanilla then its good, if you don't then its not.
---
Based on that, isn't Alliance alot stronger in PvP? I mean, I love Resto shaman but compared to Paladin he is not competitive defensive wise. You have to kill a Paladin 3 times, they have great armor, the crits refunds mana and the cast times are really low. What more can you need?  
---
For what I've read online, Shamans only work well with 31-0-20, forcing them to DPS and Purge duty instead of healing duty.
---
Love Wintersprings, especially as Alliance. It's quite the trip getting there.
---
Mine was grinding Furbolg rep so I could go through the tunnels :)
---
[A][PvP][NA] Warlock looking for a late night raiding guild (work remotely from home until 9PM CST). Prefer to raid weeknights but flexible.
---
Isn't it a problem in the slightest?
---
Also, honestly this isn't a thread targeted at the addicted. It is for those who have something to lose.
---
Fortunately, I have no kids (30y old) but a wonderful girlfriend who really likes me the way I am, even though she knows I'll be real busy this summer xD
---
So, you think it will be a year before any raid content besides MC and Onyxia?
---
1. Running across Wetlands at level 6 as a Night Elf to link up with my human homies.
---
2. Playing an AV all day, went to bed, and woke up and hopped into the same AV game.
---
Man I’m excited for WoW Classic!
---
Why?
---
Platinum is super funny and his content is original
---
The other guys, albeit entertaining, just all talk about the same stuff as the others
---
True, its 100% speculation. I doubt Blizzard even knows. They want to see where people are at in terms of progression and how strongly people are clamoring for more content. Its possible we hit 3 super quickly and sit there for a while.
---
10/10 idea although I don't think I am coordinated enough to do this.
---
Sorry man.  I don’t know any of those guys Bc I have a penis and therefor was a horde player. Zug Zug
---
Summer, schools out for the day, I wake up for a day of farming for raids, forget that the server is down because it's Tuesday, I play DotA All-stars for 12 hours straight.
---
This ^^^
---
Best one out there
---
I was around for this, but never got what the big deal was. Probably because I was Level 20-something at the time and was questing around the world.
---
I read a blue post somewhere that the lighter nights were tied to a CRZ bug, and not necessarily intentional. No clue why they never fixed it, though.
---
PvP realms are going to be World War 3 in Phase 2
---
English isn't my first language. I beg your pardon.
---
Also, yes, I'm in hospital near the bed of my dying Grandma so yes, I have bigger issues at the moment.
---
However, as I said, some things I'm reading are quite frightening to read and I thought to throw down a warning nonetheless. Trying to steam off a bit.
---
&gt;The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12
---
How strong are those 1.12 rewards compared to the avaiable gear from the raids in Phase 2?
---
Amen. The only reason alts ever existed for me is to become self sufficient profession-wise.
---
&gt; There are also other things I had in mind (bears not knowing how to pawrry is another example) but I think Im risking my head with that one change is enough :)
---
So yeah, read first comment later.
---
\#nochanges winning a little bit more each bluepost
---
Well as someone that was interested in coming back solely for the PVP this has sapped my interest in classic. Oh well.
---
I always watch esfand and tips out for update videos mostly
---
Be weary of the guys who never played classic, they only learned from pservers.
---
They are trying to survive on putting out content but won’t admit that pservers are just “close” to where we will be
---
This is exactly how it was in Vanilla; PVP system came out for a patch before BGs.
---
I don't think it would be unreasonable for phase 1 and 2 to last a year, especially since a lot of people will take their time leveling.
---
I move with ESDF O&gt;O  
---
Q - Gap Closer  
---
W - Slow/Snare/Low CD Stun  
---
R - Most used damaging spell  
---
T - Second most used damaging spell/dot  
---
A - Infrequently used, yet useful button  
---
\` - Is usually reserved for trinket (UK layout, \` is to the left of 1.)  
---
G - AoE Slow/Snare
---
There are lots more but I don't want to bore you guys with the intricate spells/buttons.
---
 \- FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
Oops..
---
Depends on the server I guess
---
There are aholes on each side
---
There are uber helpful people on both sides
---
Not really. Aimed Shot is not instant, there is a travel time. But the damage is calculated when the cast animation is completed, so throwing up Hunter's Mark during its travel time shouldn't increase its damage.
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
Unfortunately no Information yet if there will be battlemasters in the main cities with the release of battlegrounds or not. Would be interesing to know.
---
A new API for addons is going to change how many healers you need for a raid? Really?
---
No fucking shit
---
Unexpected Message to Harry Manback.
---
Always tense up when I hear it but don't see it. Often you only hear one mgurgle yet many are attacking.
---
My coward of a friend who refuses to play on a pvp server is already talking about honor trading in phase 2...
---
Hardcore Raiders tend to lean towards entitlement in my experience, regardless of which side you go. Could be worse. Could be an RP Guild. Never again.
---
I was really good at communicating with people, I was quick on the keyboard with typing, so I had a high "presence" and was attentive/responsive. This is probably one of the most important skills to have for Vanilla, since communication/social interaction is so important.
---
I would often lead PUG dungeon runs etc. Which made sense as I was the warrior, so would tank a lot of the time.
---
Got my blue fix at last.
---
Its my understanding that AV will now open with BWL? Werent the AV exalted rewards subpar to the MC drops?
---
Hi, /u/Fiveby21
---
In he sense of the answers I'm getting? 
---
Because, as often happens, I feel like everyone that's mocking me is not the husband/father I was talking to. Quite amusing.
---
Warrior HWL/GM gear+weapons are about equal to AQ40 gear in terms of power.
---
A big thanks from the people at work.
---
Oh, I know. I also find it humorous that Gnomes and Trolls in Vanilla were added as after thoughts. Look at the oldest promotional material and you won't find those 2 races.
---
Stepping into SFK for the first time and second time and third and fourth...  And truly understanding what teamwork is and what is required of you.
---
Back then at the beginning no one had any idea of how to operate a group properly,running dungeons was messy.  But it was amazing when you defeat the final boss.
---
Damn. Needing to wait till BWL release for WSG and AV is rough as someone who has zero interest in world PvP but likes PvP. AB is my favorite BG, needing to wait until ZG release for it to be available sucks.
---
**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, if you do something **stupid,** you will get **flamed.** But, leave our mothers out of it. Or not. Oh yeah, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the Molten Core mechanics. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Update:** I have teamed up with a former guild leader from the server, Aegwynn. He is recruiting, alongside me. We still need many more players.
---
We are currently playing on vanilla servers. DM me if you would like to get your vanilla fix, and hang out, before Classic drops! **Come join us!**
---
That would be great!
---
This is exactly what i dont want. I want vanilla to be as i remember it. And even though these items existed back then. People barely knew about or used anything but mabey grenades.
---
Vanilla wasnt well balanced. And these items give you a chance vs classes you otherwise Wouldnt have. But, vanilla was rock, paper, scissors and imo thats the way it should be.
---
And dont want a silly clown game. Engineering can be fun at times but you should never need to have engineering to play pvp viably.
---
All I'm asking for is the new textures in the old game and Sylvanas's model to not be that shambolic excuse of a placeholder. They can leave the rest in.
---
&gt; Do you guys share the same things across multiple classes? 
---
Being a bit of an altoholic (in retail), I make sure that keybinds for some important actions are the same across all characters (as much as possible):
---
Oh-Shit for Myself 
---
Oh-Shit for a target/Group
---
Interrupt
---
Stun 
---
Main Cooldown / Cooldown Macro
---
Extra Movement
---
Slow
---
I have no idea what I'm going to do with all that real estate space...probably more addons I'm guessing!
---
I just ran through there last night. It was not an easy traverse.
---
Haha ya I know
---
Norwegian reporting for duty! 
---
Used to play as Alliance on Tarren Mill (migrated from Deathwing). 
---
Also had a Horde-toon on Grim Batol
---
I hope there will be an "unofficial" Scandinavian server in Classic :)
---
I'm still hoping the folks at Blizz will eventually give us an honor system that doesn't implicitly encourage unhealthy and unethical behaviors. Or at least remove dishonorable kills so city raids can be a thing again.
---
That said, this is pretty well what I expected, and I fully intend to enjoy the hell out of the first two phases regardless.
---
No there doesnt /sigh
---
This has been debated over
---
Classic will release when it releases
---
Stress tests are done virtually, and the beta is being done internally
---
Fuck, I am so ready to let this game just absorb my life.
---
I'm content with this pvp plan.
---
Or maybe you should look at the hundreds of other posts like this where people explain time and time again why tweaking class balance is a terrible idea.
---
Cheers!
---
Give release date or riot
---
1. Nothing comes too easily.
---
2. PvP around every corner! (STV anyone?)
---
3. Even the smallest upgrades feel huge!
---
4. Gold management is important if you want your mount skills and mounts in a timely manner.
---
5. Social aspects are forced which can present some interesting and fun/negative experiences.
---
6. Takes long to get anywhere which makes the world feel bigger.
---
Could go on forever. This is just a few.
---
That place was surprisingly claustrophobic as a fresh 20-something.
---
Uhm, are you a father/husband? Because my thread was meant for those.
---
You shouldn’t need to have a specific profession to be able to play well.
---
Grim played well without it.
---
I was really hoping they'd mention the pre-1.4 epic mounts, since they were talking about the honor system and the epic mount changes were an important part of 1.4.
---
I hope phase 2 brings large scale city raids. Or does Dishonorable kills make them not worth it?
---
Great time you mean.  People who level on pve are going to be missing 50% of the game.
---
I'm going to run a pretty similar [21/30/0](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVMusV0oZbxtbcbVx) build before I start raiding. The holy nova and extra smite damage should help with farming.
---
There will most definitely be casual guilds that accept "awful" specs. If it's what YOU find fun to play in Classic, I think you should still do it.
---
Unless you are worried about being optimal, which is FINE, but there will be groups/guilds that will accept you. Just not one pushing with only optimal builds. Much like original WoW, there will be guilds full of non-optimal builds/specs that can still clear raids
---
I mean, what memory stands out to you the most? Downing Hakkar for the first time? Leading your first Guild raid? THE memory that stands out the most in your time playing.
---
Who would even wanna run city raids when someone randomly one-shot an npc and kill weeks of ranking progress?
---
Not sure if / when that will be available though
---
So phase 2 will be South Shore battleground phase.
---
Relationships are made of compromises.
---
Enjoy having ranker standing at every FP just waiting to kill you when you land during Phase two. You won't be able to get anywhere without a ranker hunting you down.
---
You are trying to set this up as if Fear Ward is only useful on 8 bosses and that the human/night elf racials are more useful elsewhere. However, you ignore the trash that also fears in the game, like Berserkers in ZG. You also ignore that it is the best PvP racial for alliance priests. You also fail to break down exactly when the other racials are actually useful. If Fear Ward is only good on 8 bosses, when is starshards EVER useful? A Dis/Holy DPS spec is a joke and you know it. The real value of shadow is buffing all the shadow damage in the raid. Being able to use in interrupt is a dam meme. You mention some niche use in PvP for the Night Elf but don't highlight at all that fear ward is OP in PvP.   
---
What about that extra 22 spirit or whatever you get as human? Is that EVER really relevant?
---
You're delusional if you think there is a significant gap in the state of p servers and that of classic on release.

---
Yes, this is the phase where world pvp raids came into play.  Aka moving from town to town killing everybody in sight, except the civilians.
---
Druids will often anchor a flag in AB. I think they have their use in every battleground
---
Like, isn't this reportable?
---
I don't even know how to reply to that, what's wrong with emotions all of a sudden? I don't think I'll continue this conversation, also "lol" isn't punctuation.
---
I mean, there are only 13 Tuesdays that are officially in "summer". 
---
I wouldn't think they'd say summer if they meant September. I also think that if it was going to be June, we would've gotten something official by now. So that would narrow it down to 9 Tuesdays. July 16th plus or minus a week sure seems reasonable to me. Obviously no one knows for sure until there's something official, but do we really have any better guess right now?
---
Have they mentioned the time between phases?
---
Indeed. PvE = carebear
---
I can’t friggin wait
---
So far so good.
---
Thanks dude. It's nice to see that at least someone isn't butthurt as hell.
---
...Because im an idiot and havent had enough caffeine today.  Derp, cant read.
---
I see everyone talking about Dire Maul farming and my brain somehow mixed the two up.
---
I'm actually the wife/mother
---
At blizzcon didn't announce the 3 phase idea with proposed 6 month time frame?  It would be nice to have the the same content out with that much time.  A phase a month.  Seems pretty quick though for Wow standards.  Like you though, I don't want wait that long (6 months) for classic WSG.
---
&gt;Implying fascism and racism are wrong. Inferior Horde swine. For the Alliance!
---
I agree but I'm glad the people who are clamoring for that wPvP will get their fix.
---
yea I'm saving this and forwarding it to all my friends, thanks mate
---
I don't disagree, but how the hell else are you supposed to manage r14? The Vanilla system implicitly incentivizes unhealthy and unethical behavior on the part of the players. Sure, it's against the ToS, but when the rules say one thing and the mechanics say exactly the opposite, most players are going to side with the mechanics every time.
---
Personally, I'm hoping we eventually get a more reasonable honor system that isn't so horribly conceptualized. One not including dishonorable kills, at least on PvP servers, so world PvP and especially city raids can be a thing again.
---
&lt;Redux&gt; [A][NA][PvP]

Raid Time: Tuesday/Thursday 8EST but still up for debate
---
Loot System: EPGP / Zero sum DKP 
---
Redux is looking for all like-minded Classic players with a primary focus on pre-made PvP and Raiding. We are an experienced group of Vanilla veterans who've been preparing for Classic and would love for you to consider joining our ranks.
---
We have both raided and completed everything from MC to Naxx as well as getting Warlord and Conqueror before it was cool.
---
WHAT IS EXPECTED? - As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself. We aren't however min/maxers. If you have a race/class/spec you like and can perform with it, bring it along. - As a PvPer: Show up and do your best! - As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat and make friends!
---
Honestly we are just 2 friends trying to relive our vanilla PvP days. We are pretty laid back and hope to find some other people that want to achieve similar goals and enjoy the ride
---
Well we are not 100% sure that weakauras will work on classic, nor if [wago](https://wago.io) or other weakaura places will support classic (I assume if weakauras work they will support it).  While the classic client is based on the same Legion client and APIs, it \*should\* work, but they also said they might remove some of the parts of the API that did work during legion to make it more vanilla-esq since DBM / weak auras / angry assignments weren't around back then and they might not want them around now. 
---
But yes, if weakauras \*DO\* work in classic, they are quite powerful and can do quite a bit of tracking and such, and support custom lua code as well as the toggle / buff watching etc stuff.
---
That's what Southshore vs Tarren Mill is for.
---
May I ask why? This makes me more excited for PVP. Because WPvP
---
Ah so they did say summer 2019? It's not just random speculation. I can get behind that. Thank you
---
Sounds reasonable and true to the spirit of Vanilla!
---
IIRC + spell dmg doesn't interact with proc effects like firery war axe or dwarven hand cannon
---
Was mostly to introduce DKs so people would stop farming NPCs
---
And there it is.
---
This is how I wanted it to be. Mirrors the vanilla release exactly (except for versions of BGs.)
---
Pre-RIP for all the people not 60 by the time phase 2 hits. 
---
Interesting that they didn't touch on if the BGs would cross-server or not...after all, the pvp content plan would be a great time to share it. Probably still discussing it?
---
Yeah, if the quest hubs are active then it seems like a waste not to include the pvp objectives, especially in EPL.
---
No, actually the thread it's not based on personal experience.
---
However I daily read about dads and husbands asking how to no-life like 13 years ago.
---
I feel like once in a while a warning thread may be healthy.
---
Wolfshead helm was *not* some cheeky private server tech, like Manual Crowd Pummeler etc. I used it from MC to Naxx, not because I was a feral druid savant, but because it was very well discussed on the official druid forums. 
---
It's not arcane knowledge.
---
What was the estimated amount of time between phase 1-2?
---
Dark voodoo magic
---
Fel demon blood (2x)
---
Murdered milk farmers and built on a mountain (citation needed)
---
Undead humans (ex alliance racists)
---
Both sides are dicks.
---
I said they were close 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Please seek treatment if you care that much about the faction your cousin plays.
---
I honestly wish they kept skills such as “Magic” or “Auras”. (You see in some pictures “Your skill in Holy Magic has increased to XX”...
---
I upvoted this

By the time you hit 60 you will be able to do bg’s :)

---
Kitting teremus the devourer to sw keep THROUGH sw cathedral. Pure gold.
---
I hope people are ready to be camped at every major flight path/boat for the duration of phase 2
---
Release date when tho
---
people didnt know how the system worked, people didnt know about the rewards
---
why not bring back all bugs and exploits? they were in too

Blackrock mountain is gonna be a slaughter house.

---
My favorite video of the incident. Warning: weird music and a Bill Hicks bit.
---
Dunno how I feel about 1.12 level PVP weapons being available in phase 2, but everything else is great.
---
I wanted to align it but didn't want it to be super wide haha. Maybe I'll work on making it look like my comment!
---
I actually leveled my warrior sort of late in Vanilla and I fondly remember how much power the PvP vendor items gave me. You could get nice rings, trinkets, cloaks, boots and wrists every 10 levels, so 19, 29,  39, 49. I always had enough honor farmed to buy those when I reached the level.
---
I also remember getting to 51, immediately picking up the quest to win 1 AV and receiving the Ice Barbed Spear. That was literal BiS for an arms warrior up to 60. I used it until I bought The Unstoppable Force shortly after (I had Exalted with Frostwolf before reaching 60...).
---
TO be honest one of the only changes that I'd be okay with is if they included BGs and vendors right from the start. Those items really do help a  lot and you can start getting through the ranks as you level.
---
Luls :)
---
#The Complete Classic Plan [PvE &amp; PvP Phases]  
---
AV rep is mostly for the epic ring melee ring.
---
Bro if the dogs can handle it, as a human being you need to step up. I'd do it myself but my dogs are useless (shi-tzus), haha
---
Nothing specifically
---
The nice thing about Classic is there will be a ton of people in a similar position. I am willing to bet there will be a large number of casual, adult guilds with relaxed raid times exactly for that reason.
---
I can assure you they probably won’t.
---
Uh, sorry for gender-assuming. 
---
And I will respect ur wish of not getting patronized so I won't give extra advise.
---
#NoChanges
---
&gt; As we mentioned before, we haven’t yet determined exactly when each of the content phases will occur but we’ll keep you updated as they draw closer.
---
They're crushing it.
---
no kids here, but I logged 380 days time played into my main, and made it clear with my wife that this would be my last shot to give an mmorpg a shot like this, based on the industry and what people get into, and how quickly new mmorpg die / or good mmorpg get changed enogh to become bad.. this is really it
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
This is great news to me. I love world pvp, and fondly remember the early months of retail vanilla with all the wpvp, so i'm very glad they're adding the honor system one phase before WSG/AV.
---
&gt; But back then there is no way i would have played with a 10 year old.
---
As an 11 year old who was a (terrible) healer for a guild doing Black Temple and Mount Hyjal, how dare you.
---
Yeah I’m with you. You make a lot of good friends PVPing with the people that you level with.
---
That's how it was in 2005 as well. You would park yourself at TM/SS for hours trying to get as much of a 100-0% kill on people as possible so that you got the most honor possible. It would decay 50% with each kill on the same player, so you really wanted to make the first few count.
---
I'm still hoping we eventually get an honor system that doesn't implicitly incentivize unhealthy and unethical behavior. Also one without dishonorable kills, at least on PvP realms, so world PvP and city raids can continue to thrive and be fun even after BGs draw away the serious rankers.
---
That said, this is fully in keeping with their stated intention of faithfully recreating an authentic Vanilla experience, and it's about what I expected.
---
At the very least, I fully intend to enjoy the hell out of the first two phases.
---
Yeah, everyone is thinking it will be fun WPvP time, when in reality you will have groups of people camping every major flight path and gank squads will be running around picking off every solo player that gives honor.
---
As soon as you land you will be sheeped/CCd until honorless target buff wears of then instantly nuked by 4-5 people.
---
&gt; Or at least remove dishonorable kills
---
wont be any - 3rd sentence in the post
---
Lots of gold are generated every day in vanilla through quests and vendoring. People are much more inclined to use the AH for gear upgrade, mostly weapons, than most realise. The very notion that u need to amass gold for level 40 mount and the daily inflation caused by gold generation makes people sell stuff at the AH for a low price. Two-handed, helms and accessories are easy to flip for 3x the buyout value.
---
Another blue post always makes me happy.
---
BfA team should learn from the Classic team how the actual feedback looks like.
---
Welcome to World PVP bro.
---
I hope everyone on a pvp server is 60 by then if not. Iam sorry for you.
---
Funny to see the hand-me-down chain. Oldest brother has the nicest monitor, and it diminishes downward.
---
Any idea how long each phase is?
---
Sure, but I wish they could have separate servers with different approaches. World PvP vs BGs is a big thing and it would be cool if there were servers where BGs would NEVER be released to help world PvP focused people find likeminded players, while every other server would get BGs at launch with only reward vendors being gated to appropriate progression points.
---
By consistent 14h or more a day for months. It’s a bit overkill but whatever I’m not going to complain because I know I don’t have the time to do that.
---
Blizzard wasn't kidding when they said that their only backup was of exactly 1.12.1, because even a monkey wouldn't do this, given the choice. For raiders this will mean that the optimal way to prepare for BWL will be to farm PvP gear. I'm glad that that will make PvP more competitive, but I'm not glad that it devalues PvE gear.
---
This is just another problem with gating parts of the game but not others. Playing the Naxx patch with the gates to Naxx closed... its messy.
---
Honestly depends on how many people play.
---
It's definitely interesting, but it also means that unless you start on launch day, and play a TON, you will miss out on experiences.
---
Also wonder if they'll ever reset the phases.
---
It'll be like that episode of Family Guy where the rules of death no longer apply.
---
A lot of it is optimal vs able.   A dwarf warrior is more than capable of being a high DPS fury warrior.  But the extra hit granted by a human warrior adds extra damage and if you are trying to speed run Molten Core in an hour so you can run it twice that night to farm bindings and such with the guild, or get more legendries for progression then yes every bit counts.
---
That being said, while vanilla is not the most balanced game out there, plenty of people had night elf warriors main tank their raids, or gnomes even and they were able to progression in vanilla just fine.  
---
Another thing is people are saying how difficult feral is to master correctly.  But with legion level addons, if they don't mess with the API too much, there will be addons that "perfect" the playstyle to tell you when you click what, weak auras to tell you when to power shift, etc.  Things that they don't have on pservers that will trivialize some of that. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't see weak auras that will help you to downrank heals and such.  But plenty of top guilds back in the day ran sub-optimal classes and that didn't stop them from being able to complete raids just fine.  
---
They may turn your 50 minute MC speed run into a 55 minute MC speed run.. but your end goal of completing it is still the same.. And if you don't stack 25 fury warriors in full tier 3, then yeah could probably speed run MC in an hour and a half with shadow priests and ret paladins in tier 3.. it'll still die.. (actual numbers may vary)
---
My rogue hands are sweating
---
I mean, I want to level, not be corpse camped, y'know?
---
Yeah but honestly BGs were the most fun in the lower brackets. Using PVP to level up was insanely fun. If we have to wait six months just to get WSG..
---
Arathi Basin phase 4 what in the actual fuck?
---
Content Creators are already thinking of ways to stretch this into a ten minute video.
---
Gnome warrior here I come
---
This isn't good. It's going to cause people going for Rank 14 to farm flight paths and quest hubs. It's going to cause harm to the servers activity and playerbase in general. Leveling while getting spawn camped 24/7 for honor is just a really shitty feeling.
---
lol yea, because getting ganked repeatedly is certainly something people who roll on PvE servers are sorely going to miss.
---
At the risk of sounding like someone who played on too many pservers, this sounds really bad. 
---
No honor to start is gonna be annoying as you won't get rank 3 discount for your mount or pvp trinket for leveling. This basically just buffed rogues. 
---
At the same time i fear that no honor means less incentive for the massive raid vs raid fights in STV and Hillsbrad.
---
That combined with no BGs will make leveling more dull as you can't take a pvp break. If you enjoy low level pvp on  a fresh server you're also out of luck since by the time BGs come out they will likely be filled with twinks. AB delayed more is even worse as it's ny far the most enjoyable BG for pug vs pug.
---
And yes I know this is how vanilla came out and yes there still pvp. But having played on fresh servers with honor and BGs on launch I can't help but feel this is a downgrade.
---
dishonorable kills make any ranker avoid city raids, theyll rather happen in p1 than later on
---
Ok, so you admit you are wrong, and the most effective target to Innervate are priests.
---
Thanks, I'm at work so I only briefly scrolled through.
---
Vanilla WSG was amazing bruh
---
That happened to an extent on private servers with 10k+ concurrent players, I doubt it will be that bad on classic with blizzlike server caps.
---
Rip to all the people who wont be 60 during phase 2, i'll c u guys at Un'goro lol
---
Inject that blue post right into my veins....
---
mmm yeah that's the good stuff.
---
Two phases of pure WPVP. This is like a wet dream.
---
You: "I hope blizzard will eventually give us an honor system that doesn't encourage unhealthy and unethical behaviors."  
---
Also You: "At least remove DHK's"  
---
You understand that if you remove DHK's people will camp the SHIT out of quest givers which is more unhealthy and unethical than anything their system does imply? Id be okay with removing DHKs in major cities, but from all the random 1-off quest givers in random places its really really annoying to have them camped.
---
What I heard is that the scaling depended on the item we're taking about.
---
For example Julie's Dagger wouldn't scale but Neretzek would.
---
A lot of people got murloc tattoos back in the day, there seemed to be 1 or 2 posted on the forums daily. I wonder if they get sick of explaining wtf it is to people haha.
---
They plan to introduce dishonorable kills in phase 2 unfortunately.
---
Dude I have something like 4000 games of League of Legends in 5 years and I played on something like 5 wow pservers in-between. I even played a little bit of retail Legion.
---
You don't need to explain me how videogames are easy out from real life.
---
However if you ditch the persons you chose to be part of your life (the person you married in a relationship that is supposed to last forever or the children you had because you thought you were ready to be a parent)... That's not cool. That's all I'm saying. Than again, everyone is totally free to be a bad parent.
---
Awesome, my favorite time to pvp was before battlegrounds were introduced, world pvp was great.
---
Why do people like you push this fucking strawman? Nobody EVER said you are not allowed to play whatever you want. 
---
What "min-maxeres" (read: people who don't intentionally want to sabotage their group) tell people who want to roll trash specs is what to expect when they play that character.
---
If you play something like Ret Paladin you won't be invited to groups unless you know 4 people who will willingly waste their time to cater to you. If you aren't in a premade most people will just respond with "lol" and ignore you.
---
 You might get into raids if people are really desperate to fill spots 38 39 40, but won't get any loot unless nobody else needs it because its worthless on you. 
---
This is on top of absolute shit gameplay that nobody in Vanilla enjoyed.
---
Use phase 1 to level and phase 2 for fun world pvp, it’s ideal really
---
To be fair, it's also great for people who won't be raiding by that point in time because of stuff like Unstoppable Force and some of the caster items, and even the Revered items are good for suiting up for MC. In the conversation of the best/good items they aren't worth mentioning by BWL, but that's the beauty of Vanilla is that there are a bunch of progression options for people who aren't doing the latest PvE content.
---
Without starting a PvE vs PvP shitshow, what does this mean for PvE servers? If you can flag whenever, will wPvP even be a thing (SS vs Tarren Mill?) or would people just bail and turn off flag at the first sign of their faction losing thus killing it entirely? 
---
(Yes, I realize PvP servers are usually seen as the "definitive" way to play Vanilla - my friends and I decided on PvE though as we have significantly less time to play than we did in 2005.)
---
That's amazing I didn't know that. It is basically used like Skull of Impending Doom then?
---
Wow this is a fucking bottom feeding post huh
---
Feel bad for everyone close to level 60 during phase 2. No mercy
---
You could book say every Thursday and Friday off for a few weeks. Doesn't have to be weeks straight.
---
&gt; Once phase 2 rolls around those who haven't hit 60
---
*and rolled on a PvE server :D
---
I'd like you to elaborate.
---
It’s too long. There should be honor right from the start. With battlegrounds coming in phase 2, Arathi Basin included. 
---
You should be able to PVP to help yourself in PVE. With this plan it’ll be quite the opposite.
---
Of you don't like the honor system or battlegrounds then you'll like WoW PvP at launch. 
---
If you like the honor system and big raids over battlegrounds then until they come along WPvP will exist but it'll be less planned. Like instead of "we're raiding all Horde territories on day X at XX:XX" you'll have it but less often. 
---
If you hate world PvP and city raids then phase 3 is awesome for you but it sucks that you have to wait to long.
---
People want different servers for 100 different things at this point. If they do it for this, that just sets a precedent for future bitching about a high-pop server, no sharing serve, permanent vanilla server, new-content servers.
---
Well, if they check somewhere for the addon, they can check how much ammo they have.
---
I.e. people that would use the addons are people that would not have this problem anyways.
---
&gt;And for the love of god don’t put the rank14 system in place.
---
obviously they arent going to remove the core pvp reward system. thats such a bad suggestion.
---
The thing is you don't always have the choice. When you have 40 spot to fill you can't be picky unless you are the best guild of the server.
---
Nice,no bgs until phase 3. God I can already imagine the huge fights in STV once phase 2 starts,I cannot wait.
---
Also when are they going to release phase 2? Like 3-4 months after the first phase? What are you thoughts?
---
Empty! We always saved our cans when we had LAN-parties. They were almost like trohpies haha! Instead of saving an ear from an enemy we saved a can...
---
It is apart from the people who can put less than 20 hours a week will get relentlessly ganked while they are levelling ~40-60
---
and caster/healer offhands
---
I guess I just wanted to have my cake and eat it too. Level and PvP at the same time while preparing for low level bracket battlegrounds.
---
I suspect that Phase 1 will last about 6 months, though
---
I hope they won't breeze through phases. I really want to take my time and enjoy the game.
---
I am 37 and I am very excited because being single, never married and no kids is about to pay off in a big way. I am going to NO LIFE this so hard. I am going to disappoint my parents just like I did back in 2004. I can’t wait.
---
For your imp, yes
---
Even optimal specs weren't putting out THAT much dps. I think the more geared classes were doing 700-800 for the most part on patchwerk in naxx40. Tier one players were doing around 300-400 on bosses in MC. I feel like as long as your players are competent, even a subpar ret/shadowpriest/lazer turkey isn't going to hurt the damage all that much.
---
The orcs are no longer under the control of the burning legion, they are free and shamanistic. Only caring for the safety of their new horde. The undead made mistakes in life. And in death were forced to fight. Once freeing themselves, they tried to open channels to their old allies only to be reviled and judged on how they look, thus washing away their old sins. I don’t see anything dickish about vanilla Horde.
---
&gt; I'm actually really excited for World PvP Ranking in Phase 2 of Classic Wow.
---
I woundn't be..
---
You will have gank squads farming honor running around every lvl 50+ zone ganking solo players.
---
Every major FP will be camped and as soon as you land you will get sheeped/CCd until the honorless buff wears of, then nuked by 4-5 people.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love WPvP, but what we're going to get during P2 is going to be hell on earth.
---
**&lt;CREW&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Mediumcore Raiding Guild - English**
---
**Introduction**
---
CREW is a fresh guild preparing for Classic release, which means new members will be able to help shape the guild moving forward. At this point in time we boast a whopping 28 people. It will be a casual/mediumcore raiding guild on a PvP server with a relaxing and friendly atmosphere. The guild is built around a core of friends with varying experience with WoW and vanilla.
---
**Goals**
---
* Our overarching goal is that we want to create a relaxed environment where we can have fun and challenge ourselves. WoW is about having fun, and we want Classic to be as fun as possible.
---
* We want to see all of what Classic has to offer at our own pace. 
---
* We want time to experience the leveling process (1-3 months). 
---
* We want to be a part of the server community and experience World PvP, and hope to bond and form rivalries with other guilds on the server. 
---
* We want to strike a middle ground between the casual and semi-hardcore raiding. We want to clear raids in our own decent pace.
---
**Member Expectations**
---
* A friendly attitude and willingness to learn and improve.
---
* We expect raiders to have some cheap consumables (food and pots), and NOT 13+ expensive ones. We will make do with what we have.
---
* We expect raiders to do their best while in the actual raid, so we can overcome the challenges together.
---
We are also recruiting socials if raiding is not your cup of tea! 
---
**Core values**
---
* Bring the player, not the class/spec mentality. We allow less viable specs and encourage everyone to play what they like.
---
* Common sense and patience. 
---
* Being flexible and understanding that real life takes priority.
---
* Honest and transparent leadership.
---
* A team mentality about raiding, with fair loot rules.  
---
**Raid Schedule** (*Preliminary*)
---
2 raid days: Thursday and Sunday 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET).
---
If you are interested or have any questions please send me a message or join our discord:

Means it will be like vanilla. However it’s also going to be a fucking headache in P2 to fly into somewhere that’s highly contested your going to have a bad time.
---
That’s exactly what a fascist would say.

I’m trying not to buy a 34” ultrawide just for classic when I already have a 32” 16:9.... but I know I’ll end up with one
---
Using the alliance guide to find my druid form... in darkshore
---
Reuploading with it all nicely aligned! Deleting this post
---
It happens on servers with 5k pops as well.
---
Phase 2 is gonna be a nightmare. World pvp to rank might sound like fun, until all the ranker decide do camp every flightpath and run group to hunt any leveller questing that is lvl 48+
---
And no the ranker won't kill each other all day. Once you kill someone a few times they stop giving you honor so don't count on rankers of your faction to help you unless it's the morning and they still didn't kill each other yet.
---
Enjoy getting ganked to sleep in STV because some streamer and his followers find great humor in it.
---
That’s why the Alliance don’t even have their own continent. Superior I think not!
---
Sand lol.
---
me too my dude. Was a SP day 1 launch until I quit just before WOTLK dropped. Such a fun class to play. Cannot wait to do this again &lt;3
---
You are 100% correct
---
Hah seriously.
---
Absolutely correct, we played lots outside aswell. You can definitely have both! I have fond memories from playing outside, but there's something special about these lan-times!
---
Lmfao!
---
awesome
---
That Rank 14 Grind.  
---
Better order a new Razer Poop-sock.
---
On one hand, having such massive world PvP and constant war for Honor in Phase 2 sounds amazing. On the other hand, waiting 6+ months (minimum!) for any BGs sounds fucking miserable! 
---
On the plus side, if they stick with this plan my class choice that I have been going back and forth on for months between Druid and Mage just became a lot easier. Druid is unkillable in the open world.
---
**Phase 1** - No DKs
---
&gt;You’ll still be able to PvP, of course, and there will be no Dishonorable Kills, so you’ll be free to repeatedly hunt down every player and NPC in, say, Stranglethorn Vale to your stealthy heart’s content.
---
**Phase 2** - DKs added
---
&gt;That’ll change once phase 2 rolls around and we add the Honor System, which will introduce Honorable Kills, Dishonorable Kills, and PvP Rank Rewards.
---
When someone gets ganked in STV for the 10th time, the graveyard spirit's text should just say "You think you do, but you don't"
---
I know this place is super "#muhblizzliike" but can you PLEASE make so the entire raid doesn't receive dishonorable kills for one bafoon's treachery? 
---
Just make whoever attacks that mob receive the DK. 
---
PLZ PLZ PLZ!
---
you rock, saving this and forwarding it to everyone.
---
thanks mate
---
Since classic will use the legion client, pretty sure that the consoleport maker will do a version for it.
---
I played for a while because I was starting to get carpal tunnel, even healed some mythic+ and rated arenas, but it's not 100% effective, specially targeting (because tab sux when you need to select specific targets) and aoe or other skills that require ground targeting.
---
&gt;PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12
---
I guess they weren't joking when they said that their only backup is of exactly 1.12.1, because this is an absurdly adverse decision. The PvP rewards are incredibly strong in that patch, they were made that way to keep pace with how incredibly strong Naxxramas gear was. It's on par/better than AQ40 gear. For the first time in WoW's history, the PvP gear will better than PvE gear until Naxxramas is released.
---
I'm assuming it'll be true to Vanilla which is a bit of a shame, but maybe after all of the content in the game gets released they can revisit some of these bad old systems.
---
The main one I'm thinking of (aside from DKs) was the fact that you'd split the honor from each kill with your party/raid...which is fine, but then they made it so that enemy's honor value decayed 50% with every kill, until you get 0% after the 4th.
---
So basically you were throwing away massive amounts of honor by PvPing in a group because you were splitting everything while also burning through the decay against all of these people.
---
If you were in a 10 man group and killed the same 10 enemies 4x, you'd get 140 honor. Meantime if you played solo, you could get 160 honor from just killing 2 enemies by yourself...and every kill after that was still giving you tons because there were lots of fresh and non-decayed ones left.
---
It was a super unhealthy system. Despite being one of the top players on the server's top PvP team, I had to queue with them and then drop from my own group...let them win the BG for the bonus honor, and I'd just try to get solo kills for the extra honor.
---
In fact I kind of hate the entire honor system. It actually makes the game's PvP system into essentially being vs your own faction.
---
Big stretch of the imagination there but, sure, whatever floats thy boat.
---
They just need to make so DK's are ONLY given to whoever attacks the mob.
---
Any small groups recruiting? Looking for some people to maybe level with and talk to. Do not want to play solo all the time.
---
I'm expecting pretty close to the original timeline!
---
Problem is there won't be a lot of people that high level that early to take advantage
---
Like, you can play responsably, you know. And still partecipate in the subreddit.
---
So hit 60 before phase 2? Gotcha
---
Dwarf master race
---
Similar, but you dont have to use it. It will deal damage while it's equipped and until you remove it from the trinket slot.
---
effectively it means for pve server:
---
in general everybody is unflagged
---
if you flag or attack a flagged target you can be attacked, which usually means the opponent get first hit
---
unflagging takes 5min
---
but in the end the top ranker on pve server will get their honor by trading kills with horde
---
Rank 14 system is still going to be horrible but I don't really mind as I am not really going to interact with it either way
---
Pretty sure flight masters have a long respawn rate and I don’t thing it’s actually possible to make so much honour, r14 is like millions of XP farmed?
---
The game is quite rich on leveling zones, if you are ganked just switch. People have always done it.
---
Source: your ass
---
rogue gear doesnt matter much. if you get dotted and deathcoiled vs good warlock you die even with full gear.
---
There's just not near enough button combinations you can bind to abilities on a controller to not be awful while using it.
---
Well that's how it worked back in retail vanilla, and blizzard have said their focus is on authenticity.
---
Just apply early to a guild that fits your desires and it should not be too hard.
---
 I think they want to try and encourage the old world pvp even with dead flight masters and quest givers. I don’t think we can accurately say it’s to long since they haven’t even released time frame for phases they even say that in the post. But Phase 2 is going to be rough.
---
95% of WPvP is level 60 Rogues ganking low levels. 
---
I'm not missing anything.
---
Anyone who is shocked about world pvp being the only way to get HP clearly didn't play in vanilla, nothing wrong with that, just funny that all the experts "forgot" about the most important details of the game back then.
---
Must've gotten summoned there! Fancy indeed!
---
Yeah this dude must be intentionally dense or just trolling.  There's no way to do wholesale balance changes like this and keep vanilla vanilla.
---
No way.  By that logic, BWL would be out 1 year after launch...
---
It has nothing to do with respawn rate, people are going to fly in from whatever zone to the flight master and land where he is, and then you just poly them until the 20 second timer is up so that they're worth honor after landing and kill them.
---
No problem!
---
If you play an undead rogue everybody will already hate you before meeting you. You can use that prejudice to fuel a hatred of your own which amplifies your dedication and prowess at killing. 
---
Home your skills on the corpses of your enimies. Join us. Oh and as always, for the horde.
---
It does. This helm was BiS for feral druids even in TBC. Crazy uh?
---
There will be people guarding the entrance to all the high level zones farming honor.
---
Yeah but remember It takes a minimum of 3 months for the first rank 14 though to go from 1-14. Most people wont get there untill phase 3 (assuming each phase is 3-5 months)
---
They specifically stated in this blue post that they don't know yet.
---
do you not understand sarcasm?
---
This was essentially how it was rolled out back in the day:
---
1.4 Introduced Honor System around 5 months after release
---
1.5 Introduced Dishonorable kills and BGs 2 months after release of 1.4
---
And I remember seeing mobs of players in TM and SS turtleing back and forward as the main way to get honor back in the day before BGs.  Gray level players won't give honor iirc, so you don't have to worry about a 60 ganking your level 50ish character for honor points.
---
I don't think you understand how awful and grindy the old honor system was and how much it encouraged stuff that violates the ToS. It's clearly what he's talking about.
---
Yeah but it's not as bad. And classic will (presumably, since blizzard is so focused on authenticity) only have a 2.5-3k pop cap, so it will be even less noticeable
---
Damn I hesitate between alch and tailoring with herbalism. I plan on rolling a mage 
---
Those doggos don't help me choosing 
---
Any advice?
---
Right? there are tons of them that had 10k pop and died, because all 10k of the hardcore pserver players went to the new one. If you think something like 50k players is enough for Blizzard to not consider it dead....To me personally, I want them to make balance changes down the line because that is part of the experience there's balance changes and tweaks every few months. Vanilla was never about having a static set of abilities and talents that never changed.
---
It happens on those servers because of the long queues and the rankers are doing it between their queues. Even if there's lower pop, now the rankers are just going to be roaming the leveling zones 24/7 instead of spending most of their time inside the BG/traveling to the leveling zone.
---
That was generally my approach when I raised on the rogue. I think I usually say somewhere between 11 and 13 % since, for dual wield classes offhand damage was alot higher than you would think.
---
I’m not sure about those items but it’s very common knowledge that skullflame shield scaled 1:1 with spelldamage on the life steal proc and I think the aoe proc. The old thotbot comments on classic wowhead confirm that it scales with spell damage leading to huge 500+ heals on spell damage paladins in aoe pulls.
---
Fair point. I should have added the conditional "on PvP servers."
---
'Course, even then dHKs don't really do what they're supposed to (discourage griefing), as, in my experience, most griefers aren't motivated by mechanical rewards. They're simply in it to ruin someone else's day, and the system giving them a bunch of red numbers in their honor ranking doesn't really prevent them from doing that so it doesn't matter.
---
Simply put, if someone is determined to be an asshole for the sake of being an asshole there's often precious little can be done about it, at least where [anonymity plays a role] (https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19).
---
That said, I'm all for dHKs being a thing on PvE/RP realms, if only to make folks feel better about it. On PvP (and, hopefully, RPvP) servers, though; that's what you sign up for when you roll there.
---
Can we please stop with this attitude? Not everyone play the game for  PvP. In contrary, the PvE aspect has always been the primary focus of the game in the form of PvE centered quests, dungeons and raids. 
---
I don't want to downplay people PvPing. Just play whatever you like but saying players will miss x% of the game just because they don't want to (world)PvP is just asinine. The same goes for the attitude of 
---
&gt; Indeed. PvE = carebear
---
of u/mawmawmawmaw
---
and others, especially from private servers, who say that you are a bad player if you don't PvP.
---
PvP and PvE are completely different parts of the game and cater to different kinds of people.
---
If anything, make sure you find a guild prior to launch that you've vetted to ensure that they'll actually get to 60 before falling apart. You should consider trying to get some experience prior to classic, as, if you need to learn how to tank in classic, you and everyone else in your group/raid will have a bad time, and that's when you lose your spot.  
---
12h/w is plenty for classic raiding if you're in a half serious guild, but know that depending on their consumable requirements, you're looking at putting equally 6-12h into farming your consumables for the raid. (Tanks arguably are the most expensive to raid as).  
---
If you're not willing to take the chance, roll a healer. They'll always be in high demand, and you'll never have to worry about consumables. Just make sure to roll dwarf if you're going alliance.
---
This is definitely accurate. I played Shockadin/Holy main during that period. Shockadin existed in what felt like a brief period before TBC through the early arena seasons and was my inspiration to finally finish leveling my Pally.
---
How does honor trading work for pve servers? I though "communications" between factions is prohibited, like for the devilsaur mafia thing. Is it just "let's all meet at crossroads and fight to death"? Or is it more elaborated?
---
Nope. It's calculated when the bolt (or arrow/bullet) leaves your hand.
---
So in the reverse situation (hunter's mark s about to expire in 0.1 seconds) you'll get the mark's bonus even if it fades during the arrow's travel time.
---
&gt;what we're going to get during P2 is going to be hell on earth.
---
I agree its going to be complete chaos and it'll be 14+ hour days for those who want high ranks early.
---
Ranking usually involves a hefty miss-match when you have premades steamrolling worse prems or pugs, and I get that most people probably prefer if that is kept to an instanced zone (BG) where it doesn't spill over.
---
But I think having that farming in the world is more fun because there's more of a possibility for people to band together against it.
---
Either way I'd prefer ganking out in BRM or Un'goro to capping bunkers in 8 minute AV's all the way to 14.
---
I agree play whatever you want, but you forgot the pvp side of this argument. Even that PVE is already figured out, you want to have the edge if you plan on doing pvp. Sure you can manage it without the best option but choosing poorly there and doing pvp would haunt me for a long time.
---
Being 14 when wow came out was the fucking perfect age. Not too little kid not adult yet. Gooooooood times
---
Dishonorable Kills... NooOoOooOooooo!!!1!!1!!
---
Wait what? If you're interesting in coming back solely for PvP, this is amazing news...
---

PvE (Alliance) Tank Warrior or DPS (if preferred)
---
Looking for a casual raiding environment to raid on weeknights. I raided in vanilla through WoTLK as a tank and am looking to go back to my roots.
---
Back in my vanilla days, I was a 15 year old kid with no obligations outside of school and varsity sports. Times change, I’m now an adult with a wife and career as a mobile/video game developer. 
---
Given my needs outside of wow, I expect to have anywhere from 4-6 hours per week of non raid time to play, with a budget of 2 nights a week at 3-5 hours a raid night. I’m a dedicated player willing to put in the time for a guild that’s willing to work with me. I also have 2 RL friends that will be playing with me who will most likely be interested in the same guild (Mage &amp; Priest).
---
If those requirements work for you, I’d love to hear from you.
---
Fucking yikes dude
---
Can you tank as anything but a warrior?
---
Or risk the scorched earth that will rain upon the level 48's and above
---
That's a legit point. Still, with classic probably having 4+ times lower pop caps than the big private servers, i'd expect it to be less of an issue, will prob be worse on some servers than others, since private servers are typically filled with very hardcore pvp'ers while that might not be the case on most classic servers
---
Even on PVE servers people will seriously be slaughtering each other in phase 2, I'll love it &lt;3 It wont be ganking but it will still be fun for us wimps.
---
I'm still bummed out about AV though. Everything else is just perfect.
---
Started at release at age 14 good times
---
I like the P2 and P3, but Ive never understood the need to seperate AB from the other 2, I know it came out later originally, but AB isnt really a gate for any specific items and the content is honestly just for another BG to play if WSG isnt going well.
---
Happy they at least recognize the contention of 1.12 AV enough to mention it specifically, but disappointed theyres no plans at all to do with it. Going to be really sad looking when everyone and their mum is running around with an epic hammer less than a week after P3 hits.
---
As for EPL and Silithus, it was such a failure of a concept, I see no reason to delay its release. I mean, they both failed for different reasons, but their impact on the game was... well nil. Linked AHs in capital cities had a far greater impact on the game (not that big of an impact, but thats my point) and theyre going to presumably be included at launch, so why wait so long with EPL and Silithus PvP. This is actually an issue I dont care about at all, it just seems like misplaced focus on the part of the dev team.
---
Yepp and its fun as fuck and apart of the game. Go to your pve server, your input isnt needed here
---
&gt; You have to kill a Paladin 3 times, they have great armor, the crits refunds mana and the cast times are really low. What more can you need?
---
That's why you cc the paladin and kill the rest
---
Alterac Valley (version 1.2)....
---
Is that the same AV Version where it can last for 7 days non-stop?
---
Keep telling yourself that lol.
---
1.12 rewards are good. However, phase 2 and 3 need to happen VERY quick, like WITHIN (&lt;) 2 months. Max of 2 weeks at phase 2, and then release phase 3 within 2 months of classic release. Phase 2 should release within 1 month of launch, MAX.
---
Yall might think "wooo world pvp, hellloooo tauren mill!!", it's not going to be how you think it is. Like you will go do it for a day or w/e, then realize your honor farm is complete shit there and end up taking your future premade to a high tier flightpath and just camp it all day. This isn't fun for anyone leveling/questing or wanting to rank.
---
TLDR: It's DECENT news, but not the best. The phases need to be released fairly quickly &lt;2-3 months after release.
---
BWL was released I think 8 months after mc/ony, it makes no sense to suddenly increase the time with 4 months. 6-8 months is more than reasonable. Screw the slow levelers, vanilla isn't here to please the casuals.
---
Using 1.12 R14 gear stats from the get go isn't such a bad thing, since if they did it progressively, by the time people actually get their hands on R14 gear, it'd be time to update the stats anyway.
---
This.  Rank 10 mage and lock head/shoulders combo is ridiculously OP for MC.  Getting the mantle off razorgore and headpiece off nef is barely an upgrade, let alone those bosses not being available in the next phase. Any mage or lock who wants to be competitive is required to get r10 now during phase two.
---
That's still AQ 40 quality weapons before/at the release of BWL
---
Which is good cause the Vanilla API let you get a FUCK TON of information you really shouldn't.
---
The modern API is the most fair, imo.
---
And so is that!...wait ..
---
I'd assume it will happen like it did originally, with you having to queue at the entrances and later on having the option to queue at Battlemasters, considering the only big difference to how it was orignally are the PvP items that existed with the introduction of PvP rewards now having 1.12 itemization.
---
Probably more tbh.
---
I can't fucking wait to fight in that jungle again
---
In the third phase, we’ll introduce the first Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley ([version 1.12 207](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908)) and Warsong Gulch, alongside with their associated vendors. One thing to note is that there were a couple of updates to these vendors over the course of the original patch releases, so some items won’t be available right away. For example, the Spell Penetration trinkets available from the Warsong Gulch vendor weren’t introduced until Patch 1.9, so we’re currently thinking that we’ll add these in phase 5.
---
* Alterac Valley ([version 1.12 207](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alterac-valley-in-classic/128908))
---
This isn't the blue post we wanted, but it was one that we needed. 
---
GIVE US A RELEASE DATE! I NEED TO PUT IN LEAVE!!!!
---
Two minutes for each phase? Easy.
---
It's funny how all the casuals on this subreddit is praising it, I can't wait for their sweaty hands to cry when they get corpsecamped come phase2.
---
Honestly having different servers for major issues like that would be a dream come true but I get that it's more effort for Blizzard.
---
This will certainly drive off what remaining 'tourists' there are, but sadly alot of the remaining players too I imagine. Hopefully they just reroll on PvE or something and keep playing. Hopefully phase 2 will be quick? If it's 6 months of that it'll completely kill the game lol
---
The problem is that the Honor System would need drastic changes and that is not in line with the Classic philosophy. They would need to cap honor gains per day and incentivise premade vs premade BGs, instead of inscentivising queue dodgeing and win-trading. Also WSG would need to have a different ruleset so it will always end after a reasonable amount of time when two premades are fighting eachother.
---
The thing is Vanilla is too old for us to have good videos of it :(
---
Why is that a problem? World pvp objects are just for fun
---
I think they mentioned this in a previous post a while ago and said that since there was battle masters in cities in 1.12 that they'll be available as soon as the bgs come out
---
2 moments stand out to me.  My first run through SFK, and my first time questing in Tanaris after having just got my mount.
---
Is it really necessary to postpone the release of Arathi Basin?
---
oh cool, they just announced this

---
That's the beauty of vanilla, the players who organize and fight as groups will thrive, while the mindless solo questers/grinders will get farmed. I'am personally looking forward to this phase.
---
Spending half a Saturday guiding four noobs through the entirety of BRD. Building the group through trade chat, taking them to each of the quest givers, going from boss to boss explaining what to do, and downing the emperor. It was essentially a 5 man raid.
---
I guess maybe I should’ve clarified, battlegrounds. I don’t get the separate phase Arathi.
---
yeah, not sure why they dont release it with wsg and av
---
Was really hoping to hear some commentary on cross realm battlegrounds, as they have avoided talking about them since Classic’s announcement. It will be interesting to  have an honor system without bg’s. Diremaul will surely be a pvp fest. One potential problem  is people can acquire rank 14 gear before BwL is released, although that was technically possible in vanilla.
---
Another Swede here from Stormscale. BC/Wrath Stormscale was the fucking bomb, so many great PvPers. Some of my favourite memories is just standing outside of Orgrimmar with crowds of people watching the duels.
---
TUF also...it's basically an AQ20 weapon.
---
When classic was announced I'd planned on saving up all my vacation days for it. But since then I became an independent IT consultant, so I don't get PTO: If I don't work, I don't get paid. :(
---
Interesting, so no BGs until phase 3?
---
Esfand, tips out &amp; staysafe 20+ minute rambling vids incoming
---
5mans and 10mans require 25% to be tanks, 20mans and 40mans require half as much (with exceptions)
---
I hope they will do it as a 1st April event
---
I think it is fantastic. This is one of the reasons I'am looking forward to Classic. It incentivises grouping and social interaction instead of everyone minding their own buisness. MMORPG style open world drama!
---
It will be way worse because in private servers people did this just between queue pops, now it's the only way to get honor.
---
what's with all the complaining about pvp on pvp servers?  i thought pvpcels loved getting camped and it was part of the game???  ill personally enjoy not having to worry about being flight path camped on a pve server but enjoy the epic world pvp i guess
---
A ten minute video for each phase.
---
Oh I understand now. Yeah true. I built an arcade machine at the house and still have my consoles going back to the Atari VCS haha! Good times.
---
That would be better, but I'm still not a fan. It's still possible to tag a civilian with an AoE ability despite not directly targeting them, and amounts to the same end result of effectively being punished for engaging in world PvP.
---
I'm looking forward to when you find out that you can't simply grind BGs and get Rank 14 without account sharing. Because other people will do it. A lot. As seen in vanilla and it got worse on pservers. And because they're doing it, you have to do it too to keep up. Gonna be a mess and if you're R14 you'll either get called a no lifer or account sharer. Doesn't sound very honorable after farming all that honor, huh.
---
That's how it was. I would be fine if it was out earlier, but you've gotta stick to a principle. If you're gonna delay Dire Maul because it wasn't out at launch, it makes sense to delay AB because it didn't come out with WSG &amp; AV.
---
Thats Right if you need alot buttons like in raids or pvp. For just chilled leveling its enough
---
you couldnt prohibit cross faction communication 2005, you certainly wont 2019
---
people will test how far they can go with it, some will go too far, some not
---
those who dont do it will be weeks behind in ranking
---
1 of the biggest aspects of being a raid tank is having near perfect attendance.  So if you're willing to commit to that you'll likely be able to find a spot.
---
I actually like that orc model better, their arms don't look nearly as bulgy in that picture than they do in the actual game.
---
&gt; the period between the launch of the PVP Rank system and the first BGs wasn't very long
---
It was precisely 49 days: honour arrived on 19th of April 2005, and AV and WSG on 7th of June 2005.

I was on a pretty high end guild, and we managed to get the 2nd alliance nefarion kill on Monday night before the reset. Our guild leader had not been helping lead the raid at that time and our MT and most of the officers were done with him and his loot whoring ways. They all gquit and reformed into a new guild. We sped through BWL Tuesday night and downed nef again, getting technically the third alliance nef kill.

---
Yep :) I combined the 2 announcements for this image.  
---
They were towers you could capture, gave your faction a buff, it even applied within Naxxaramas IIRC, so some guilds would try to take them before Naxx.
---
Yeah, I remember the old flagging system before the updated it in Legion, but were there no large scale wpvp battles on PvE servers? Just the occasionally ganking of random flagged people?
---
depends how long the delay is, if its a month it doesnt matter so much
---
I think for leveling solo the Controller is Great! For raids and pvp u better use a keyboard and mouse
---
All stats that I've seen show that majority of classic player are 30 or older.
---
And all the responses in this thread prove it.
---
That's a guarantee of good community I think.
---
Carebear was a term used during vanilla for PvE-server players. I don't identify as a private server player.
---
The game is literally divided into two opposing factions, and that is obviously a big part of the game.
---
how many people do you believe you swayed?
---
Part of having fun, for many, is not giving a shit and using wow as a time to relax.
---
I think it is better this way. It gives dedicated PvPers a gearing edge over raiders in Battlegrounds until AQ comes out, which is how it should be.
---
I mean I lived through it? So I'm sure I understand it as well as you, who also lived through it. Unless somehow you are an ultra-memory god who can perfectly remember every moment from everyones perspectives of vanilla. Then maybe you have a better assertion than I do...

Woah, chill dude.. I was just trying to be funny lol wtf

We see this kind of posts every day where people tell others that they can play whatever they want and shouldn't listen to min-maxers etc etc, and I'm just sitting here, thinking to myself; do people actually care? Like are people really afraid of what others think of them because of what they are playing? People should be capable to choose for themselves how to play the game without the need of this kind of post to be made every single day.
---
12 hours can be enough is the short answer. It depends really, costs arent as consistent week to week as you might think. Youll use more/less consumes based on your gear if your on farm runs, the better gear you get, the less consumes youll need, the more gear you get though, the more youll enchant, the more money it costs. Progression weeks are obviously the worst, repair bills and popping consumes constantly is extremely draining.
---
That being said, again, 12 hours can be enough, if you save up enough initially, if youre guild clears all the content (lets say, the BWL-AQ40 gap, which should be a fair amount of time) and youre just building up, you should have plenty of consumes by the time the next content patch hits.
---
But then again, you might fall behind in terms of gold, but at that point youre guild is probably already committed to you and you can probably ply them for gold...
---
As for finding a guild, it does tend to be quite hard, you usually have to get in at the ground level or get lucky a guild tank quits.
---
&gt; But so many people say that tank spots are competitive
---
They are, especially if you want to be in half decent guild.
---
2-3 tanks is all you really need for a 40 man raid.
---
Unlike other roles, if you don't have enough tanks, you're not raiding, so being reliable is extremely important for guilds.
---
As a tank you're also a DPS bottleneck, if you can't pull enough threat, you'll be holding back the rest of the group.
---
That's why stacking consumables as a tank is even more important than dps and they will take quite a bit of time to farm.
---
I don't want to make it sound like it's completely impossible to get a tank spot with your schedule, but it's not going to be easy even without time constraints.
---
If you dont hate the idea of playing fury though, there's always demand for them so long as you know what you're doing.
---
You might have easier time getting into guild as DPS and volunteering to be the extra tank whenever needs.
---
It's not uncommon for tanks leave guild for various reasons and guilds will usually try to find replacement internally, which could be your time to shine.
---
yeah it felt good to get my trinket on a recent fresh first honor reset at lvl 30, entering stv with that trinket made a worlds different in fights. 
---
it'll still be a great time tho
---
It would be fine for leveling, or even raiding for many DPS classes. Obviously you won't be high end PvPing or such, but it'll get the job done for some casual couch leveling.
---
Understand it perfectly, but I don't think you do
---
&gt;I'm assuming it'll be true to Vanilla which is a bit of a shame, but maybe after all of the content in the game gets released they can revisit some of these bad old systems.
---
Exactly. I never expected to get a change to the honor system or a removal of DHKs right out the gate, but as both of those were eventually updated or removed in later expansions it's clear the folks at Blizzard understood they didn't work as intended.
---
Which isn't to say I want things to move in the direction of retail, of course - gods no - just something less open to abuse and weird mechanical hoop jumping like you described.
---
I don't remember seeing this. Do you have a source?
---
Damn that would suck. To be fair I had something similar. There was only 1 PC in my house but it was in my mom's room so I could only access it when she allowed me to. Fortunately my step-dad was a chemical engineer at a paper plant which meant 72 hours on shift, home for a day and back out, while my mom worked overnights.
---
This meant I could play a lot between 9pm when my brother went to bed and 2am or so. Best times to play for me too since I would get like 20fps in even mostly dead areas. Cities were only functioning for me at like 1am lol.
---
"dont do drugs" 
---
how dare you!1!!+1!#! -Manshacked
---
Ranking on a PvE server will be harder but will also have more participation in the Southshore/Tarren Mill battle.
---
Who does leveling PvP for honor? I just do it for fun and to contest my grinding spots. Not everything has to insentivised with direct rewards. I think it is fine this way.
---
&gt; The items you earn from the PvP Rank Rewards will be the versions from patch 1.12.
---
I guess this will cause some hating, since those items are really strong (they were worse in 1.8 or 1.7 I don't remember)
---
!! *[stealth sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cFj6T9lOtM)* !!
---
The only change it'd need is to stop grading it on a curve, really. R14 could still require a massive prolonged grind with your progress sharply decaying away if your dad falls off the ladder and you need to step away from the computer for a couple of hours to take him to the hospital... the amount of grind just wouldn't depend on other players on your faction anymore.
---
To be honest, I don't think the experience is any different from any other phase. Especially from the first phase. STV will always be STV and Hillsbrad will always be Hillsbrad. And people will kill opposing faction, be there honor or not. And if I remember correctly you don't get honor from lowbies so incentive for lvl 60 players is just "gank only" instead of gaining honor.
---
there probably was, but with the intention of having fun, not getting honor
---
tm/ss zerging is bad for honor
---
and the largest portion of "wpvp happening" comes from forcing people into it, especially around herb/mining/dungeon zones
---
Noooooooo, dishonorable kills, yucky
---
As is tradition.
---
&gt; It happens on those servers because of the long queues
---
There wont be any queues if there's no BGs, that's why everyone camps FPs
---
between queue pops was most of the time for the private servers world pvp gankers. They'd have queue for 30min+ where they would for example HS to kargath if they are horde (by entering ragefire chasm in org and leaving grp, they get infinite heartstones), and run for 2 min to searing gorge /BRM and start ganking. Each BG would last 6-10 min on average. so every 40 min played they'd spend ~30min ganking in the world. With probably 4+ times lower pop and an overall less hardcore playerbase in classic, i doubt it will be as bad at all.
---
I always had my own PC and my dad would play city of heroes with me, but he never got into wow. Did you share with siblings who also played?
---
I guess we can also assume that other items that were upgraded later will already come out as their 1.12 version.
---
PvP is going to be hard for anyone because even more-so than PvP, PvP is all about time invested. Those who can poopsock will have what feels like a near insurmountable advantage in PvP due to the ranks/gear
---
Well, I feel like many that answered were not the husbands/dads or wifes/moms I was hoping to reach.
---
So yeah, not much success. And this is even worse than what I thought. I mean, being burnt on the stake for suggesting to play responsably... Wtf...
---
"If you would believe this subreddit, a raid that has a nightelf or human priest in it will potentially never clear BWL because only casuals have them in their raids."
---
 Where are people saying that? Literally noone is saying this. You are setting up this false premise .  We are saying that fear ward is objectively the best choice and makes a big difference. Your little diagram is intentionally misleading in that it implies that the difference between races is minimal at best, and at worst seems to imply Star Shards or bonus spirit is somehow useful.  
---
We are saying dwarf is the best race and if you want the best race, pick dwarf. We arent saying you have to be dwarf to be in a competitive raid.
---
I am perfectly chill, sorry if the message came off as hostile. 
---
&gt;People should be capable to choose for themselves how to play the game without the need of this kind of post to be made every single day.
---
They should but the decision should be informed, and not based on these delusional posts of "you can play anything and do great". It sucks spending 15 /days leveling to 60 and then finding out you aren't allowed to do some things.
---
Ehh, I can understand it going both ways... But if someone spends $60, and then pays $15 to be an asshole for 16 hours a day to random people online... Then fuck it, if thats what makes this game feel complete for them sure. its not like there is NO counter-play to assholes. Just organize a counter resistance, stick in larger groups, etc etc. Yeah you will still get griefed, you cant stop a UD rog from ruining at least 1 persons day.... But you can make it so they can ONLY ruin like 1-2 peoples days instead of like dozens of low-level players. Idk, DHKs are really only useful for deterring a large population from camping quest givers. Of course they do nothing to the individual but I know players who will grief low levels for hours while ranking, and wont touch quest givers on pservers because they dont want a DHK while leveling. Even though they do actively grief other players.  
---
Its a deterrent from the maximum amount of griefing. Which would be really annoying if there were no DHK on like outpost, cause a passing by 60 can just kill everyone in the town and continue on their way. Whereas with DHK they may go, nah i dont want to lose r8 or w/e w/e.
---
Yeah, it was also great for getting insta-gibbed in BWL when the dragons went shadow vulnerable and you'd get a VE Crit heal. Already riding the dangerous threat wave as it is and then the VE Crit heal would push me over and fade did jack shit.
---
&gt; That combined with no BGs will make leveling more dull as you can't take a pvp break.
---
Imagine needing fake PvP points in order to enjoy PvP.
---
I read this and my first reaction was “okay, cool this will align with what I was hoping/expecting.” And then I read the comments, saw everyone losing it, and realized phase2 has no battlegrounds.
---
I. Can’t. Wait. It’s going to be mayhem and I friggin love it. This may change my class choices, because I definitely do not want to be a squishy priest trying to level while everyone piles onto my hapless body.
---
I hope phase 2 is relatively short, like 4-6 months for phase 1 and maybe 1-2 months of phase 2.  I think that gets everyone started with the PvP rankings but BWL gets released before anyone really hits the high rankings and those people that want to PVP to get gear for PVE have to choose to either PvP or raid BWL.
---
Also, as much as I’m excited for a crazy world pvp scene, I’m a little afraid a super long phase 2 will kill of a lot of the tourists in the process of becoming stayers.
---
When you get ganked but it is only week 2 so you don’t have a level 60 to get revenge with, so instead you get ganked repeatedly until you go somewhere else or log out for the night.
---
Its a Corgi and English cocker they aren't smart enough to play either of these.
---
Yup. Similar situation here. 
---
I’m just going to look for a decent casual guild on a PvE realm. I imagine it’s going to take me months to hit 60, so I’m going to just take it slow and enjoy the ride as a means of relaxing.
---
I mean, I’ve already done all of the content so I don’t think I’d even both getting back into hardcore raiding if I had the free time to do so. Best case scenario some of my current guild ones/friends stick to raiding and I get a few carries for fun once they have it all on farm.
---
You realize it is called a 'Normal' server for a reason, correct? It's the normal way to play the game. I played on a Normal server in vanilla, I had lots of xroads raids, southshore/tarren mill, city raids, and fun other world PvP experiences just like everyone else. What I didn't have was being farmed by higher level players, ganked while I'm trying to casually gather some ores, etc.  
---
I enjoy PvP servers but people with your attitude make me wanna roll PvE out of spite to just to prove you wrong.
---
Stop being a fucking retard dude. 2g wasn’t /shit at sixty, you’ve been proven wrong.
---
Nothing is stopping you from PvPing during phase 1.
---
DHKs are needed. They were added for a reason.
---
If they're doing 1.12 PVP gear from the outset I'm just rolling a rogue. Part of my class choice was to play a hybrid that would get me easier PVE groups so that I could gear up for PVP, but if as early as P2/3 I can get near enough god-tier blue PVP gear that will keep me semi-relevant til phase 4 who cares about PVE. I'll happily grind to R10 with dungeon blues. 
---
I'm a vanilla player who loved PVP but hated the honour system. I was hoping they'd change it at least a little bit, but can see why they've done it.
---
Oh gotcha. Yeah, the delay the AB seems unneeded.
---
Corn dog. I get it!
---
&gt; I always had enough honor farmed to buy those when I reached the level.
---
Honor wasn't a currency in vanilla. You bought these 19,29 etc items with gold
---
Not gonna lie if there's something that I'm NOT looking forward are dishonorable kills...man I hated that shit, it completly fucked city raiding and world PvP in general :/
---
naw it's all around level 50, there are no low level mobs there
---
No, on Crogges server after the database steal they made a new one called N'ghth'ven on which there were no BGs in the beginning and it still wasn't too bad with 5k pop.
---
Top quality post here
---
I don't expect there will be much wPvP on a PvE server. Even on PvP servers less than half or even a third of the people do any PvP and a fraction of that are dedicated to PvP. I expect there will be some kind of community event thing depending on the server culture, but that will be rare.
---
Also I think you are right about:
---
&gt; bail and turn off flag at the first sign of their faction losing thus killing it entirely?
---
People who enjoy PvP challenges are usually choosing a PvP server.
---
If you really don't want to join a PvP server, then I highly recommend you use the realm forums to organize an event with a few big guilds on both sides, else it will be just people minding their own buisness, even for phase 2.
---
It would be nice to have one that pops up a warning in big letters across my screen as soon as I join a group that says " GO BUY AMMO YOU FUCKING IDIOT"
---
If you don't want to get ganked you can play on a PvE server
---
There are a lot of people in this thread and in the pserver crowd who are really down on resto druids for some reason. It has a much higher skill cap than paladin or priest, but if you learn to use your mobility to it's maximum potential you'll definitely be effective in BGs.
---
Well not sure what you mean by information but ye vanilla API allowed you to make the game pretty much play itself for you - which is kinda bad, indeed. But having played on a pserver there will be a lot of addons and macros that I will miss in classic wow as they will not function as they do with the vanilla api - even if they are ported you can't make them as "smart" with the modern api.
---
In the end, the modern API will probably be for the best but I wouldn't mind having the old one if Blizzard should ever change their mind :p
---
I’m going to be a ranker
---
Then it will die with phase 2. Dishonorable kills sucked.
---
I stared in high school, Leeroy Jenkins was the first thing a lot of people tried to show me going 'isnt this funny?!' When all I can think of is "Looks like a typical UBRS pug to me"
---
You're not alone, you're in good company.
---
[Here's a similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/at2a7n/classic_dads/) from a few weeks ago..
---
I agree with you on Felwood, such a great zone. Plus the unique world buffs are cool
---
So you're set
---
Organize with your guildies. Classic is a social game.
---
And don't leave cities without a raid group =P
---
As a healer, do i have to tag another player with damage to get credit for a kill in a group fight, or is just healing a injured player enough? How does it work in vanilla?
---
&gt; I guess they weren't joking when they said that their only backup is of exactly 1.12.1
---
They never said that.
---
Its good, But I really hope they decide to roll back from 1.12 pvp gear in phase 2. Its simply to good prior to AQ, It makes a lot more sense to have it update around the AQ patch.
---
Fuck DHKs up the arse, they were a piss poor way of band-aid fixing a non issue to begin with. Just make quest givers invincible and non combat, problem solved.
---
They do nothing but make world PvP less fun.
---
They're very strong. 3 weapons in the game are better for rogues, and they come from Naxx, 1 from AQ40 Cthun. Not sure about Warriors. 
---
Also since we're getting 1.12 items, then that also means the healing weps will be in the game aswell, which are REALLY good for healers. So beforehand, healers had no reason to go rank14, but now, they might have a reason. For a healing druid, there are only 3 weapons in the game better than the rank14 healing mace, and they come from Naxx or Cthun.
---
I'm not very happy about the release of the ranking system before BGs. That's going to lead to a lot of ganking and griefing in 51+ leveling zones. Entry points and quest hubs will be camped 24/7, flymasters will be killed 24/7... If you're not lvl 60 before phase 2 launches you can basically uninstall the game because you're never going to make it to the next level.
---
That was fine and all back in vanilla days but nowadays a lot more people will go super tryhard ranking starting from phase 2 to get as close as possible to R14 1.12 weapons when BWL launches. In my opinion these players would have a lot more fun ranking in competitive premade vs premade BGs than ganking low levels in squads.
---
You've seen this kind of post before, you've seen it a million times on here, and still you decided to post.
---
Either you're incredibly dense or it's a bait.
---
Paladin preraid BiS healing gear is almost all non-plate. It wouldn't make sense for them to not be able to roll on it.
---
Also, Hunters and warriors will be rolling on lots of leather. It's just how things go.
---
Good thing there will be PVE servers for people like you then.
---
The Bnet integration will make this a lot more difficult
---
If I remember right, white hit cap is 18-19% but nobody stacks it that high
---
That's not what zerg means.
---
DHKs pretty well spelled the death of city raids (and large-scale world PvP in general, albeit to a lesser extent). It's the primary reason I'm hoping they'll eventually be removed, at least on PvP servers.
---
It would be nice to also get an honor system that doesn't implicitly incentivize unhealthy and unethical behaviors, but I'd be content with the former.
---
Player position in instances is what I was thinking about, really trivialized EM when people wrote addons around it. It was removed after EM in Legion.
---
Like I said, the new one is more fair as it doesn't let you automate anything, the player is what really matters at the end of the day.
---
Progression raiders will also do the grind to get those weapons because of how big of a gap there is between pre-BWL and AQ40, which is more of the issue.
---
Has to be a PvP realm haha its not vanilla if your not death walking or griefing
---
Level 48 was the lowest you could still get honor if you were 60.
---
&gt;We found a folder on the backup called "Final 1.12.0 data" - a backup of a backup on a backup.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=288407.3/blizzcon-2018-restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel
---
Streamers wont play on a pvp server. They would get streamsniped to hell.
---
That farming has to be done PRIOR to arriving.
---
Again, wasting time.
---
And why can't you actually run to the dungeon?
---
Are you really THAT LAZY in a video game?
---
Summon isn't a taxi service.
---
Why is the group waiting on you?
---
What do you do when you join a group?  Sit in the city and ask for a summon?  Too hard for you to walk to the FP?  Too hard to take a ship?  How do you think the other got to the dungeon?
---
I hope in Classic you get a reality check.  A hard one like many others received when they would whine for a summon.  They either were told to run, or lose their spot.  My time is just as important as your time, and there's gonna be plenty of dps that do want to play versus those who want to be carried.
---
Good guilds don't like folks who don't have a work ethic.  Coat-tailing won't last long.
---
thanks I'm gonna give it a read
---
I think the most interesting part is the pvp aspect. The honor system won't be there on launch and when it does release with DM there still won't be warsong gulch, arathi basin, or av. Wonder if this will lead to a decrease in ganking when classic wow first drops and then a ganking spike when phase 2 drops because that's gonna be the only way pvp rankers can farm honor
---
how long does phase 1 last?
---
&gt;*goes to* /r/food  
---
&gt;*"Hey guys, should I eat food?"*
---
/thread
---
You can see that the quality of the monitor directly correlates to the height of the player.
---
Somewhat disappointed with 1.12.1 AV and no changes to Dishonorable kills but overall this is good news.
---
I was a parent the first time (pregnant with my first daughter when I started playing around patch 1.9 or 1.10) and I had my second daughter 6 months ago. I’m hoping to find a casual pve server raiding guild with like-minded people so I don’t put too much pressure on myself.
---
Every civilian just needs to be immune to damage.
---
Is normal.
---
RIP flight paths in phase 2
---
This is a change I could accept.
---
There are better solutions to the problem it was designed to solve. Don't let civilians chase, make them immune, make them respawn extremely fast, etc.
---
It ended up as disincentive to grouping up and playing with others and a major nail in the coffin of world PvP.
---
&gt;blizzlike server caps
---
Source for blizzlike server cap number? Literally everyone just parrots this "2500" meme without any actual firsthand knowledge.
---
First of all, the 2500 probably comes from [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20050207030840/http://www.warcraftrealms.com/activity.php) which is simply a census addon survey. Something that was notoriously unreliable back in the day anyway.
---
But lets look closer at that source. What we're *actually* looking at when we see a "max" of 1626 Alliance and 899 Horde is the **average** peak across all realms.
---
And people use that average as a source for the *cap* on player numbers. See the problem? Even back in Vanilla there were plenty of small realms and large realms (especially since new servers were frequently opened). Averaging across all realms isn't going to show you anything close to the maximum number of people that could log on at the same time. Especially when you're relying on 3rd party data.
---
I have never seen Blizzard give a definitive answer on either the original Vanilla server caps *or* what the caps on WoW Classic will be. So saying "on classic with blizzlike server caps" is pretty shaky speculation. We're pretty likely to get servers with high pop caps much like current private servers.
---
I had to book early. So I did last week of July, last week of August, 2nd week of September, 1st week of November
---
I've played on that server and it was bad, people were quitting in droves
---
Thanks! I'm excited for an update haha
---
Hi, /u/Agamemanon
---
I thought Zergs were known for rushing?
---
Chording is a thing same as on a keyboard. You don't bind 1 button to 1 skill, you bind a few buttons as modifiers and skills are bound to combinations of modifiers and other buttons
---
Elaborate.
---
Which you'll find out why in P1 :)
---
Get friends or a guild to help. I know very few people who got that Axe before lvl 35.
---
HELP
---
The game also has it in lore that the alliance and horde are not in open war but rather small skirmishes to defend their current territories and to fight over resources - essentially self-preservation of their factions and not as solely aggressive acts. Heck, until Cata, most of the in lore faction skirmishes happened solely based on misunderstandings like the Wrathgate dilemma and not based on agression alone. Horde and Alliance weren't in official, open war until Mists of Pandaria/bombing of Theramore. Until then even in lore the focus was primarily on the big threats the alliance and horde were facing on their home world(classic, Wrath and Cata) or a world connected to them(outlands/draenor) and actually working together. It's an uneasy peace.
---
I remember that it was originally planned to have one faction in the game. The TFT scenario Founding of Durotar acts as part of the justification in lore why Horde and Alliance were fighting skirmishes from time to time. Remember Ahn'Qiraj? Horde and Alliance working together officially and actcively for the first time outside of the Warcraft 3 campaign.
---
PvE has always been the biggest and most important part of the game, that's a literal fact. PvE has a completely different playstyle compared to PvP, especially in Vanilla and especially for casters, most prominently warlocks and sPriests.
---
&gt; I don't identify as a private server player. 
---
I did not say that. I mentioned your post and then 
---
&gt; and others, especially from private servers, who say that you are a bad player if you don't PvP.
---
not including you in that demographic, sorry if it appears as such.
---
Again, my point was just to say that we should stay above such shitty attitudes of "hurr durr PvP/PvE is better and you are missing part of the fun and are a pussy for not doing PvP/PvE", which is an attitude I've particularly seen on private servers, especially on that toxic subreddit.
---
I could see this addon addressing everyone who needs certain mats. Like e.g. Shamans need Ankh or any other class that needs an &lt;Item&gt; for their &lt;Spell&gt;.
---
World PvP is gunna be insane!! The major change is PvP gear 1.12 versions. PvP gear will be stronger than raid gear in some cases. Giving people a lot more incentive to PvP; which is great!
---
The easiest way is to play through the encounters after launch.  Most of your time will consist of spamming sunder armor, shield block, and making sure the boss is sitting in the right position.
---
There will also be times where, with bosses who inflict fear, you will want to stance dance.  Learning that is fun on it's own.
---
Honestly sad not to see world pvp objectives added until so late in the game. This was a good idea that never really had a chance to shine in original vanilla since by the time they were added so many players had simply out grown the content. Looks like they'll be repeating the same mistake again, oh well =/
---
I'm hoping both are pretty quick. Potential to drive away lots of people with those phases. Could be the intent though, get the tourists out quick for lower costs. I don't think the Classic team would intentionally want to drive people away though, they've been doing great work so far
---
it won't be possible to achieve r14 before BWL releases, blizz even talked about exactly this as something they'd need to avoid, in one of the earlier blue posts. And on retail vanilla they upgraded the r14 weapons in patch 1.6 (bwl) so it seems it will be pretty blizzlike as far as being able to obtain the upgraded r14 weapons at approximately the same time it was possible back in the day
---
He has two kids, he's already used his fizz sadly.
---
Flight paths will be camped for sure.
---
Let's hope that South Shore v Tarren Mill will be the better source of honor.
---
I don't see how anyone would cry over this. The worst that happens is you land at a flight path, you get ganked, then you walk back to your corpse and continue on your way. Losing 5 minutes in a game that takes most people over 5 days /played to complete isn't a big deal.
---
\*"Paint it Black" by Rolling Stones begins to play
---
I'm 34 married have 2 boys that are about to go to school. I remember myself being a student when I got into wow back in 2005. I know old times will never come back and this time it will be different, but I will come back in hopes to see old friends I once played with.  Life will go on for me, and you. 
---
Damn, I really wish there was a way to connect to those people I lost contact with, some sort of "meeting stone", a messaging system or anything to find out those I played with back then, to at least say hello...
---
42 and I couldn't care less about the "grown up stuff" some of my friends are experiencing. All I care about is when Blizzard is going to release Classic, so I can arrange a two weeks vacation off work to spend some quality time in original Azeroth.
---
If I'm not 60 I'll grind away in felwood hiding.
---
ah yes the neutral FP camping, mainly in 48+ zones
---
The only real problem with DKs is that one person killing a Civilian affects everyone in your raid. Change it so you have to be within 50 yards, or have to do damage, to get credit for a DK and the system is perfect.
---
"Then its time your MT learns to stance dance!" 
---
The fact that you say this shows you are ignorant of the benefits of fear ward. Nefarian is a fcking bitch without fear ward and pretending otherwise is an insult to tanks. Ypu dont even realise that Berserker Rage CD cannot match nefarians fear CD.  
---
If you value the aestetics of a race, pick that race. But dont try to sell people that fear ward isnt as gpod as it is, or that its just a crutch for your tank. Stop spreading misinformation to justify your choice which has more to do with the look of the race than anything else.
---
Why is that if you don't mind me asking? Won't dishonorable kills kill PvP raids? Am I remembering things wrong or what? Didn't Tauren Mill Vs Southshore epic battles almost complete stopped when dishonorable kills were introduced or am I remembering wrong?
---
This is photoshopped fake news. Everyone knows Druids can't tank raids!
---
Tbh, I kinda like that people talk about specs and races like they do, because it raises a question that some might not have ask before picking their class and race
---
The opinions are a bit extreme sometimes, but it’s better to know before, than after you’ve spend a month on your character. If they wanna play the less powerful specs, then go right ahead, but at least now they will know their choice is gonna impact them
---
Do you remember when they started to make WoW into “bring the player, not the class” changes? Vanilla is before that, and players should know that
---
As much as I love WoW and the community, it's a bunch of 30 year olds yearning for the good old days where we had less responsibilities. Thinking about responsibilities triggers a lot of defensiveness.
---
Hi, /u/Madmushroom
---
Imagine conflating BGs with fake pvp points. 
---
Imagine playing a game where fake pvp points will come out anyways in a few months.
---
I dont want to shift goal posts but even on the other 12k+ pservers the dominant premades just farmed their win in AB and WSG in 4-6mins and were back on track ganking. I cant imagine 4mins away from an FP every 25-40minutes will do much in terms of alleviating the ganking.
---
But without PvP elitists is it really even classic Wow? These guys just contribute to the A U T H E N T I C I T Y.
---
Get a couple nature protection potions for the elite.
---
Well to an extent. Battlegrounds were out for an entire month before BWL even launched. This time around given everyone doesn’t have to learn a dungeon from the start I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a few Ashkandis by the time AB rolls out.
---
That's for art assets.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=406
---
&gt;"Fortunately, we still had [the database for] patch 1.12 and slightly before"
---
They were upgraded in 1.9 to be AQ 40 level, not 1.6. And that's what will be available starting from phase 2, since the weapons will be in their 1.12 itemization.
---
Its 3 months between P2 launch and R14, and I don't see P3 rolling out any sooner than 3 months, so BWL still comes out around the time of AQ40 PVP weapons.
---
One of my favourite videos back in the day that pumped me up for blackwing lair
---
It's mostly good. Them not changing DHKS is so dumb though, but I guess they don't want to trigger the lowlifes who parrot what twitch streamers say.
---
You can watch the classicast episode with mark kern and john staats. They don't give an exact figure, but mark kern said (paraphrasing)it was "around 2.5-3k, and can be dynamically changed depending on stress/demand etc".
---
Can someone summarize please? Work computer blocks gaming content!
---
Yes, I was surprised by this.  It would have been cool to have them drop at least one phase early.
---
I guess we'll see. In my experience it's hard enough to get a group together to take back Nesingwary. I imagine it would be harder without that honor incentive.
---
Uh how do I learn before classic?
---
That’s honestly really good advice for people who need to put in for there pto way in advance.
---
They haven't said
---
Then you'll just have a character for DHKs so that people can rotate through and just decimate everything in sight. DHKs need to be in the game and they need to be shared in a raid.
---
How do you store art assets in a database, exactly?
---
Yeah that final elite is level 40. If you want any chance of killing it you’re going to need friends.
---
Lol do you know how many people are just foaming at the mouth to gank like the olden days? I'm sure there are people out there who try to farm DHKs because they're strictly PvE in the streets but world pvp in the sheets, know what i'm sayin?
---
Playing together in the same room is one of the best feelings. Im sad I wont have that again.
---
Mage at launch wont be that good because you have no chance at aoe leveling in the beginning.
---
Tagging a mob with a long cast isnt good either.
---
So maybe rogue at start ?
---
Ewwwww have fun
---
The Honor System should be in place during phase 1.
---
It's not raids, it's honor farming gank squads.
---
They're don't care about PvP, they just want to farm honor as efficiently as possible
---
Well done. Phase 2 is going to be a hot mess on PvP Servers. lmao
---
I’ve played both alliance and horde and never knew where the quest chain started. 
---
I love instructional videos. There’s always someone who needs it!
---
I would go with either a mage or rouge. They both lvl quickly (mage is faster than rouge) and are great for gold farming (mages being better here too). Both are pretty OP in PvP but I'd give a slight edge to rouges here but it also depends on how you like to play PvP. Both, if played to max potential, should be top 3 in DPS for PvE only behind warriors. 
---
I played as a mage during Vanilla 13 years ago, and I'm debating playing a mage again or switching it up with a Rouge. From what I've read, you can't go wrong with either, just depends if you'd rather be upfront and personal in fights or launch spells and damage from a distance. Hope that helps a bit!
---
Me too.
---
I rather want it altered somewhat to something better. This system was abused and exploited in vanilla. And you couldn’t get it otherwise.
---
Yeah, it might be a clue to how they will handle the other items that get buffed around patch 1.10.   I’m guessing they will just be released in their final form at launch.
---
Yes but the term is generally used to mean doing something in large groups.
---
During Phase 2, trying to get any sort of leveling or open world farming done will be impossible. 
---
I've played on my fair share of servers and this time is always a giant PITA for most of those involved. Do try and get to 60 before phase 2.
---
Those would be core changes to the game and they aren't trying to change things like that. They are trying to rebuild a authentic vanilla experience. It needs to stay in.
---
nope, r14 weapons were upgraded in 1.6. They were the first pvp items that were upgraded.
---
Zerging is to overwhelm something with greater numbers. Can't any race in SC rush, to some extent?
---
Shaman or Paladin.
---
Many database engines can store binary data, if you really want them to. But what you quoted was not about databases, it was about a backup of their art assets. You would know this if you actually read the page you cited or watched the timestamp of the video I linked (and the ~two minutes that follow).
---
&gt; Uh, sorry for gender-assuming. 
---
*And then one day, for no reason at all. They just started ganking us.*
---
Shaman. Pop that windfury totem, chain heal the shit out of that raid. Die in a fire? Res urself
---
As long as you’re nearby in the same group you get points.
---
It wasn’t. It was a Zerg in the middle, of someone hiding the flag were you couldn’t reach. Making games last forever and ever.
---
AB was a lot of fun.
---
Could second this. Think of Ammo/Arrows as reagents, great idea!
---
In Vanilla I was a newlywed and fresh out of college. My significant other and I share(d) a passion for WoW together and we would go to work, come home, play WoW. We would easily put in 60 to 80 hours a week playing. We were in guild leadership roles for both Vanilla and TBC, helping to create and lead successful (top of the server) raid guilds. We stopped playing around 2009/2010 after the birth of our first kid. We came back a bit in 2014 shortly after the birth of our second kid and while we enjoyed the leveling and playing in our garrisons, it just wasn't the same. LFR was a cakewalk and it made finding a guild to raid with an absolute bear. It was hard to get 10 people to log in twice a week to challenge themselves in a real raid group when you could join lfr and get free loot.
---
So, we are excited for classic. We have a DPS bot (we tried healing, but our eldest doesn't like it) now, and several old friends/family that used to raid with us back in the day.  We want to do the raid scene again, but we can't allow it to consume us like it did so many moons ago. We will likely start a casual guild that is serious about progression raiding. We'll recruit with a strong raid mix (class and spec) in mind and then just expect people to show up on time, with their proper consumables (reagents mostly), fully repaired, and with the basic encounter(s) strategy fresh in their mind.  That is all it really took in vanilla, and it is all it will take this time around. 
---
All it really boils down to is having 42-45 people who are committed to logging in for raids. If people don't show up, you can't raid, and if you are constantly picking up strangers then you never learn to work as a cohesive unit. Strong raid leaders learn their raids strengths and weaknesses and modify strategies that cater to the group they have.
---
Probably raid two 3 hour sessions a week.
---
It's going to be glorious.
---
Lol, why is the hunter still allowed to hold the knife
---
Holding off on Dire Maul makes sense because it added things like head enchants and some catchup gear for classes that fell behind the curve in MC.
---
Did AB add any rewards that were considered strong?
---
My first main will be a Druid and I plan on bringing up a mage and a rogue. Also I would like to try a warlock at some point but those are my first three. I plan on doing the Druid since it’s a faster leveler and can funnel cloth and gold into my mage who I will level up when the servers die down a bit and I can aoe grind. I’ll also try to keep my rogue around the same level as my mage so I can play on either when the friends I have IRL will be on. Druid I will do when it’s just me logged on and I’ll work on the others when it’s a group of us.     
---
I was a rogue/hunter through wrath and I love rogues so much but I would rather have gold to fund him on his leveling since it’s much slower than the Druid or mage.
---
But that's the thing, there wont be any BGs for premades to farm until phase 3.
---
So if you want get an early start on your rank 14 adventure, you will farming honor by camping people at FPs all day long.
---
Sounds good!  Going to kiss AB but I otherwise like the content plan!
---
Just healing is enough. Humorously you did have to do damage on the initial release in 1.4, which lead to priests not healing and just spamming SW:P on everything. 1.5 fixed the situation to rewarding you with honor for heals, buffs, dispels, all that good stuff.
---
It will be a warzone, as it should be.
---
\&gt;  except the civilians. 
---
I assure you those died too.
---
Again, fair point. I suppose it does more than I thought even if it doesn't fully address the issue. Probably because nothing really can.
---
I just hated how DHKs effectively penalized involvement in large-scale world PvP, particularly city raids, both of which became far more rare following the introduction of the honor system.
---
With Blizz implementing both just as they were originally done in Vanilla there's basically a countdown on how long I'll get to enjoy my favorite part of the game. And considering DHKs were removed in TBC and the honor system was later changed in... Wrath? I think? I'd stopped playing by then, but I digress. Point being, the fact both were ultimately scrapped shows the folks at Blizzard also realized they weren't working quite as intended.
---
As I've said elsewhere, rolling these things out precisely as they happened in Vanilla is more or less exactly what I expected here, so I'm not really disappointed. I just hope to eventually see something else done that, again, doesn't feel like I'm being punished for wanting to participate in large-scale world PvP.
---
Why is that tree speaking orcish?
---
I’d like to know where the classic servers will be hosted also. There is a server here in Phx that I’d want to make sure I’m playing on.
---
Because no one bothered with them hah.
---
I would really like them to keep the HK/DK honor system forever tbh. Removing that was such garbage.
---
ban reckful day 1
---
I hope they don't have a length for each phase set in stone. I'd rather they monitor the game (population numbers, number of people at 60, number of people who have completed raids) and make the decision for each phase individually.
---
Farm the trolls in STV first, they're easier.
---
The elementals are barely doable at 30-31. You'll want to cherry pick lower level ones, hamstring kite, probably use some pots occasionally, etc. Still a good chance you get unlucky and die a few times.
---
Otherwise group up with some other people in the area, or buy the motes from the AH since they're tradeable.
---
For the elite you definitely need a high level friend or a group of friends around your level. If you're unable to do that, sit around and ask a group of other strangers that come by if they can help out with yours. I've even seen Alliance help Horde and vice versa on this fight since sometimes Warrior comradery trumps faction comradery.
---
Gotta wait til patch 1.5! Damn they're doin this RIGHT!
---
The weaklings are there to justify the strong
---
Works for me. I really don't care how they go about trying to discourage griefing as long as they don't do it in a way that effectively penalizes engaging in large-scale world PvP.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Arathi_Basin_old_rewards  
---
Exalted rewards were pretty good.
---
It would be a missed opportunity to not let these kind of things like kiting Kazzak exist in the game (even *ensure* they exist) and then fix it if it becomes a problem, in true vanilla fashion. But I agree with your doubt, seems unlikely.
---
Yeah but can you possibly get rank 14 with only world pvp, and only in 4 months? Even if that’s possible then sure why not give a big boost to the couple of players who were willing to devote 4 months of 18 hour a day grinding.
---
make a lvl 35 alt for alchemy, tailoring has BiS craftables while alchemy does not (IIRC, idk)
---
Hah. I don’t have time for all the corpse runs anymore. Not playing more than an hour or 2 a day means I’ll be surrounded by people who can easily gank me at will. I’ll get my PvP fill in the BGs.
---
Oh hellllll ya
---
&gt; You understand that if you remove DHK's people will camp the SHIT out of quest givers
---
We could do that already though - once our grind was done we didn't care about DKs. That whole system was a sham though, a shell of the original intent. It was supposed to protect players in the 1-59 range from being repeatedly ganked by bored 60's in epics by penalizing them. But instead they made it only about NPCs. So it just served to erradicate any interest in World PvP by those dedicated to PvP grinding rank. And those bored people who were done with their honor grinding? *smacks lips*  - well they have a whole world of lowlevels to gank now and those NPCs? I eat their corpses after I burn them to a crisp and laugh at how many DKs I'm getting because it doesn't matter. Some people would collect DKs because it was such a joke.
---
The only thing they did was make 10~ kills max out on the amount of honor you could gain form killing each player in a day. And honestly the best aspect of that was to cause those WSG GY slaughter fests not last as long since you eventually maxed out.
---
The "DK System" is one easy example of them listening to the playerbase complaining, and then implimenting something that only barely touched the problem of people being griefed by bored 60's. What it 100% did was make anyone ranking up in BGs hesitate whenever being invited into a World PvP group, usually deciding it wasn't worth it for them - but they'd make those fucking questgivers pay eventually... oh they would pay...
---
no, its the rush towers then bosses crap
---
So, here is my logic.  They pushed DM and world bosses to phase to so the phase 1 raids are trivialized.  So, with the average raid guild starting to raod at 6-8 weeks in I'm going to guess they let that go for 3-4 months before phase 2 hits, so phase 2 at 6 months after launch.
---
I bought the charms and farmed the trolls at level 30. Then got a 60 hanging around AV entrance to kill the elite.
---
Not being able to sleep on weekday night, so I got up at 3 am, started crafting, and missed school completely.
---
That's what I am hoping to know, I actually don't see a reason to rush. I wouldn't mind 4-6 months between phases. Gives ample time for even casuals to level and experience different elements of the game before other systems are brought in. I will be curious how they handle that.
---
Shaman. You will be greatly loved for your totems and have no problem finding a raid slot.
---
I agree with this 100% but if you spend just ten minutes working through the Classic recruitment thread and look at all the posts you'll see some trends. I.e. "No S Priest unless Blizz allows for 16 debuff slot, if they do will only take one", kinda thing. So Again I agree with you OP but sadly much of the community does not.
---
I'm ready for the old honor system, and I hope it sticks around til the end this time. I HATED it when they removed it
---
Yeah, a level 50 item countering a raid boss at 70 kind of made blizzard angry. They had to change like 15 vanilla items, gnomish mind control cap got nerfed too I believe.
---
It depends on what you define "great" as.. If you compare this set, with "spec-specified" items from the 5man dungeons, the set will feel very disappointing.   
---
Generally the t0 sets are never used by any class in PvE, because their stats sucks compared to what items you can get some the same 5man content, that isn't a set.
---
Yeah, which is why I think that removing DHKs from capital cities would be a fine thing to do. Or have weekends that are like "Crusade of Crossroads" and all civilians are removed from Crossroads and guards and shit give small amount of honor to encourage city raids. And then after the weekend they are replaced etc. Albeit I never think blizzard would do this, I just think it would be an alright solution to this problem.
---
Is gurubashi arena going to be in from the start?
---
Poor alliance, they got slapped with gnomes last second.
---
I do not foresee progression raiders doing the 18-20 hour grind fest for 4 months for 1-2 weapons. It’s much more efficient to run multiple raids on multiple characters, so every main has highest level gear. If it was possible then yeah they would, but if you’re committing everything to pvp then you can’t raid.
---
HAHAHAHAHA!!! I remember this
---
Hmm, you're right. They were changed in 1.6. So what was changed in 1.9? I seem to recall there being PVP item changes then.
---
As soon as we get a release date I'm taking PTO for a week.
---
"Beauty"
---
See: recent launch of Atlas for how this will play out in 2019.
---
I kinda hope phase 2 will be short. Like other people said, back then it took 49 days for bg's to get out. So it wasn't a whole lot of time with big "World pvp action" So my hope is Phase 1 is long (so people get to 60) Phase 2 is short (so it's not 6 months of world pvp, would kinda suck in my opnion, even though i roll rogue and would love it, don't want it to last forever) 
---
That's just my hopes for now atleast :p
---
I doubt they care about the casual leveler. I am one btw. Anyone starting a sub or not leveled by phase 2 is going to have a bad bad time. So either way, people are in for a rough ride on a pvp server pre BGS
---
60 won't save You from ganking in Blackrock.
---
The old honor system was objectively poor but it was certainly better than anything they've done since lol
---
I hate Jason leameauix. He gon' die.
---
They're even keeping the massive grind needed to get rank 14. Blizzard are handling classic WoW way better than I personally thought they would do. Hyped!
---
Okay okay... Whatever you like go for it, is my mantra!
---
I'm tempted to roll NE Rogue but ganking horde cities is so much less fun than ganking ally cities as horde
---
&gt;The game is literally divided into two opposing factions
---
Which wasn't even originally planned.
---
For the number of buffs probably paladin, you also have your heals and divine intervention to save raid from wipes.
---
Shaman is the choice for you if you go horde
---
I'm leveling my Warrior first.
---
I don't plan on raiding or anything, but I do plan on simply playing a lot more than the average person.  Being one of the first Warriors to 60 will make gearing up in 5/10 man dungeons a breeze.
---
If it's 3-4 months, I bet I can hit 60 by then.  I hope you're right.
---
The level of butthurt here is hilarious. Let the people who want to race race. If they wanna pay for a guide what's stopping them? Why does it bother you?
---
"First" main?
---
You mean just main?
---
You won't have time to "main" 4 60's unless you plan on being on welfare and playing 14+ hours a day.
---
I mean it's not \*objectively\* poor it's \*subjectively\* poor. I thought it was awesome, and other did too...so it's not objective. Things like that aren't objective. I hate it when people misuse that word.
---
Did all the rank rewards get upgraded through vanilla or only the rank 14 rewards?
---
I like this idea personally, but I think the most we can realistically hope for is a list of servers before launch.
---
lots of stuff changed at different times regarding PvP gear. Like 1.11 added new blue set and new caster r14 weapons. I'm not sure what was added on 1.9, maybe you're thinking of private servers that usually upgraded the blue set on that patch, or maybe that patch upgraded the r12/13 epic sets (i dont recall when those were upgraded)
---
2-4 months is my guess, depending on phase in question.
---
Apparently it was trinkets and rings in 1.9
---
It depends on the level of the mob you’re fighting.  Bosses (considered lvl 63) cap at 27% dual wield.
---
Well, it is better than having PvP rewards in phase 1 like a lot of private servers have done. And in the end there's always PvE servers.
---
World of Warcraft is at its CORE a PvP game about faction rivalry. How can people still think otherwise lmao :D
---
Dont get so hung up on what something is called.
---
Not gonna go looking for a source. I just think I remember seeing it
---
I'd imagine it'll track an average number of arrows used per second/minute/5 minutes, and estimate out how long that'll last based off your current amount of arrows. Is this so /u/The_Lurker_ ?
---
You don't dispel Viper Sting if you plan to shift. It doesn't tick while in form. Shifting is the more expensive option for avoiding Viper Sting, but if the Druid is properly geared then he will have a much larger mana pool than the Hunter, plus Innervate. Hunters don't have any way to regen mana. Druids should win the long game.
---
Yeah but there's absolutely no reason a Shaman/Druid/Pally would want to roll on cloth in Retail. The stats on gear changes with your spec.
---
I missed these time of WoW Classic without battlegrounds. Thats when SV was called Vietnam. Cant fucking wait to experience these moments.
---
I specifically remember this "time frame" in classic when they didn't have battlegrounds. I was a 30 something druid, and there was this rogue who was 60 and pvping constantly at xr, and I would follow him around and heal bot it. This was before heals granted you honor shares. So I got like no honor back then. Thank God I'll be 60 long before phase 2
---
Ah, cool
---
They never give DK's tho.
---
Wait, are we getting honor system but no BG's, and also dishonorable kills?
---
What moron at Blizzard thought that was a good idea?
---
Tipsout is streaming the news (lol go figure), but he has some of the most knowledgeable/top pvpers (tribe, stormx, perplexity, etc) in voice chat talking about the news. Really good insights, if you care.
---
You are not wrong that a small subset of the population it had no effect on. But a larger subset of the population, people that are on the "Oh i'll rank eventually" train, or the "im still leveling i'll rank at max" etc etc, now no longer would go kill a civilian. I know it deterred a fair amount of griefers who didn't want to derank but wanted to grief while ranking.  
---
Which its not a perfect system, hell i wouldnt call it a good system. But it does work as a deterrent for a large % of the population.
---
It is hugely about the faction rivalry, yet it almost launched without PvP at all.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I love PvP, but I hate people gatekeeping how people want to enjoy the game about it.
---
start a guild named kalmar unionen
---
He even has the fancy new "slim monitor"!
---
I'm sure tips can make half an hour out of it, easily.
---
That's exactly my point. It happens on pservers because of the higher pop and long queues. It will happen in Classic because there won't be any BGs.
---
I wonder what the chances are of getting dishonorable kills removed at some point
---
[Phase 2 footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H4yKF0EDcQ)
---
Good lord... the honor system will be in, but there wont be battlegrounds for the rankers to consolidate into.... I didn't even think about that.
---
Well, TIL thank you
---
On my server, it was just the phase where we all murdered each other in Hillsbrad almost exclusively. If we all agreed to be in the same space, it'd increased how many kills we'd get per hour. Raids on other towns happened less frequently.
---
That was the dream setup back in 2005 lol
---
I played on my mom's work computer when she wasn't using it for work, which wasn't that often. So I'd go bike to my buddies house and watch him and his brother play, or log on from their computers and play.
---
And it doesn't even need to be Kazzak. The various servants you need to kill for "The Stones That Bind Us" were also useful kiting targets. They can't be killed unless they were near the stone next to them and the stone destroyed. So kite 'em to Stormwind and you have a level 53 to 57 mod in Stormwind. Sometimes they would last a day or two before a GM killed 'em. But they now leash back to their spawn point when you pull 'em about 40 yards or so.
---
28 myself. Started playing around 16-17yr. What a adventure it’s been. Now moved out with a special person that will be trying out classic with me! Can’t wait to call a realm ‘home’ again.
---
This title is 100% misleading.
---
People can add you to friends list easily. Imagine getting a notification “asshole who trolled x streamer” has come online. Endless harassment potential imo
---
If every flight path is camped, how did people get around and quest to 60?
---
I agree, I think most people will quit if phase 1 is too long. That's not much content and having your pvp efforts not count is a huge negative.
---
People can play whatever they want. The question is if they can find a guild to raid with...
---
You're an honorable target.. what am I supposed to do.. not kill you?  If they stick to a similar timeline to 'recent private server name goes here' I will almost assuredly be that honorable target right there next to you.  Where are we going to level at!?
---
Yep. It's an attitude that shows more than they realize. My old friend loved PVP. I just did PVE. I was interested in the story, the writing. He just wanted to attack other people and he would go on about "oh man, you KNOW he's pissed, I smoked him". He just wanted to feel like to dominated someone. 
---
I knew his personal life too. So I always feel like those players that go out of their way to attack others to TRY and ruin their day are attacking others because they can't attack what's really wrong in their life. My old friend did, he said it felt good to have control over SOMETHING. 
---
So I get it, if they are like that, but the worst thing they can do is lie to themselves on WHY they are doing it. 
---
Oh course, some people, like some elephants, are just....jerks. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z834x4Qk_pM
---
Hopefully pvp phase 2 happens within 1-2 months of release, and phase 2 happens max 2 weeks after that.
---
It was not well balance and required extensive out of game coordination (along with individual third parties not being a dick) to grind it out.
---
It actively rewarded poor behavior too (account sharing, botting, etc) and even worse those behaviors would negatively effect everyone else by increasing requirement to literally day job level commitments.
---
Those are objective points.
---
The general idea behind the system was solid but it needed a lot of work.
---
Maybe, but that doesn't change the fact that Druids have an answer for everything that a Hunter can do. Game's 15 years old. It's not like there's an ability I've never seen before that a Hunter could possibly use.
---
Yeah phase 1 should be 'relatively' short.
---
Yeah but if I hear one *”Golbon uden lo”* from any npc, they’re getting rammed
---
Know what's awesome about being a "utility" player? Your skills are pretty constant and don't scale so well with gear, however their effect scales with OTHER players gear. As somebody slowing coming to grips with being unable to play the game as hardcore as before, the notion of playing a class where I get better there other people play is gaining a certain appeal.
---
OMG, have my babies!!!
---
&gt; Great time you mean. People who level on pve are going to be missing 50% of the game.
---
Ive never understood PvP server players infatuation with how other completely unrelated people enjoy playing the game. Its like those old neighbors on the block who are incapable of just minding their own business.
---
Every casual will not go 100% on a PvE server. Blizzard shot themself in the foot today.
---
Three months at least for phase one though IMO.  Give a month to level to max, then that’s 8 or 9 raid lockouts without even taking into account max level dungeons to get a bit for MC and Ony

This is gonna read like you triggered me timbers, but I am just going to be blunt here. So you are intelligent enough to give people advice on taking care of another human being, but lack the basic foresight to know that posting a bland and insincere post would get you negative attention. The people planning to no-life top the point of damaging their real lives and the lives of their children were just one fortune cookie pearl of wisdom away from turning it all around.

"remember people, fire isn't a toy, peace, for the hurd"

---
I think for me the reason I was annoyed by your post was because these types of facebook-prayers are always so impersonal while trying to present themselves as profound. It didn't help your case with the dishonest title to manipulate attention your way, mentioning it doesn't make it less manipulative, it just softens the blow because you admit it outfront.
---
If I was going to make a post like this in any reddit I would try and show some sincerity and humanize the issue with some personal stories that might build some trust, it just came off as preachy.
---
Oh, the world PvP raids will be great.
---
I'm married, run a building with 60 people under me, getting ready to start a family, and I'm about to do the same thing. It's ok as long as you dont let it ruin important portions of your life such as relationships or job. Am also 29 soon to be 30.
---
made what? Thats not a positive outcome for anyone.
---
*You guys are stupid. They're going to be looking for army guys..*
---
roaming pvp nights and pvp at raid entrances was so much better than bgs. i won't say that premade vs premade isn't fun but i much preferred outdoor pvp.
---
coming from shadowbane/daoc/lineage i kind of feel that bgs ruined wow pvp. wow had such amazing potential with pvp due to its fps like control and snappiness. too bad they completely messed it up with releasing bgs. 
---
if only they borrowed some ideas from shadowbane/daoc and implemented them in wow to create a decent pvp system with focus on alliance vs horde and added some focus on guilds it would be the best PvE and PvP game no doubt. imagine being able to build your own keep in a zone and take control of it or capturable towns.
---
Wait so if I'm a pve casual who wants to rock a few bgs in my offtime on the weekend now I'll get wrecked by tryhard rankers with overpowered 1.12 AQ/naxx level loot well before it should be in the game? What the hell? This is actually really bad. I don't want to have to pvp to be top dps in raids. Wtf blizzard.
---
&gt;make them immune, make them respawn extremely fast, or any number of other options.
---
Nooooooo.
---
I had a rogue alt specifically for killing and stomping on new players experiences! God dammit!
---
At least you managed to get yourselves dressed before you started playing.
---
What's the issue?
---
I completely agree with you! I think it's a great perk. I'm someone who has always been kind of "semi-competitive" with games. Like I like to do the challenging kind of content, but I'm just not someone who is really able or willing to go through the motions of getting like the perfect keybinds and macros and muscle memory and number crunching and everything else often required. Instead I just like to be the guy who can throw up summoning portals or whatever.
---
If someone is willing and able to do a full R14 grind just to get a bit more DPS in BWL, I say more power to them.
---
Raiding in Classic is gonna be easy enough so you can raid with "meme specs" perfectly fine!
---
I would hope so yes
---
I'm hoping they will balance classes so every class is at least viable.
---
I'll be the guy standing over my corpse with a 2 minute rez timer.
---
Healing offhand, caster offhands and melee ring are very good for a long time. Not uncommon to use those long into Ahn'Qiraj.
---
The blue rewards are also excellent catchup gear for new players, and Unstoppable Force is what the majority of non raiders will be using.
---
“World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands”
---
Rofl I forgot they existed
---
Pretty much a dead sub
---
Honestly this is my point.
---
With how impossible it was too get PvP ranked over account sharers or people who had literally all day to play it allowed others to just not care about DKs.
---
Those people got to grief all the people actually trying to PvP.
---
We're not likely to get high population caps like private servers because the game wasn't designed for 7k concurrent players. Or even 5k concurrent.
---
What we're likely to get is what we had in Vanilla, which isn't that.
---
As long as it’s green which is something like level 47ish
---
Hope they change their mind on AV. 
---
Other than that, great! hope to hear a release date soon
---
Hey, i'm the guild leader going Holy Paladin and am looking for a dedicated warlock friend to go hard the first week or two together duo leveling. PM me or check out the Discord if you're interested!
---
Also, here's the guild.
---
**&lt;Lakeshire Guard&gt; (NA, PvP, Alliance)** **(Maybe RP-PVP, Guild Vote)**
---
What is Lakeshire Guard?
---
Lakeshire Guard is a moderate to hardcore raiding guild with strong PVP ties to Lakeshire and the Redridge Mountains! Though we aren't RPPVP we do immerse ourselves to do what it takes to defend Lakeshire, and maintain a fairly serious attitude about raiding and our strategies as a guild.
---
We will have a 3 part looting system that includes loot council, "wishlist" item for the current raid, and luck. We would like to offer the best in preparedness, but also want to be open to a total of 80+ unique players who want to play the race and class they desire! We will have priority raid group, and secondary raid groups. and sometimes these groups will inter-mix to gear certain players from the main raid.
---
We don't want to exclude any players from progressing so these raid swaps and off groups will only be for progression weeks, months. We want to be as fair and fun to everyone within our Guard! If someone else gets the loot, remember they are a Guard, and what they get benefits Lakeshire and all of our members.
---
Thank you for reading this, and I hope to see you at the Inn.

That was one of my biggest regrets that I eventually did correct. my first character was a warrior that I managed to get to 60 on a PVE server because I was new to the game. If you have an interest in what pvp adds to the experience I can tell you that I think PVP servers are far superior, it can be equal parts fun and frustrating. If  time constraints like you mentioned are an issue than I can definitely understand.
---
Running around flagging myself for pvp often on pve server didn't result in much, usually the only times I would get attacked were just outright guarantees of ganking, the thing with giving other players the option to engage is that they will always wait for the most optimal time. On a pvp server you don't always have that luxury. Of course if you are content with battlegrounds then that will be a perfect pvp fix.
---
My guess is that Phase 2 will begin on the release date Anniversary, Nov 23rd.
---
Yes they all got upgraded but the weapons are the big ones they become on par with AQ/naxx level loot this is really early in the timeline to be putting such powerful items in the game likely any top guild will require you grind out R14 if you want to raid with them this change is horrible.
---
PvE player spreading non-factual bullshit
---
Sure, but it trivializes BWL rewards and isn't tied to RNG like BWL drops. "Guaranteed" rewards tend to be mandatory if they're good, which is a community problem that springs up from bad design.
---
The boots are outstanding.
---
If you're not into perfect macros and keybinds, go paladin and avoid shaman. Shaman power is based on access to a straight up massive toolkit of totems, then combine with various support skills and multiple ranks of heals.
---
I went War Mode while leveling during BFA, and found out the bad way that I forgot about players who have nothing better to do with their time than make people miserable for their own amusement. Hate them all.
---
I'd rather the version of vanilla that had no DKs then. They took much more away than they gave us.
---
Hah I tried to say the same thing and got a bunch of downvotes. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
This is exactly the kind of info on shamans i needed, thanks alot man
---
Suck my arms
---
This. The gear is way too powerful to have in its 1.12 state as early as phase 2. Don't force me to rank blizzard.
---
&gt; What moron at Blizzard thought that was a good idea?
---
The moron that wanted to uphold the integrity of the Classic WoW expierience. This is it how it was back in the day.
---
I could get behind that. Though I'd still prefer DHKs be removed altogether on PvP realms, as the unpredictability of world PvP is a large part of the appeal.
---
"Why is there a giant, guilds-vs-guilds brawl in the Shimmering Flats, of all places? There's not even anything faction-related there!"
---
"Who cares why? There's a great big fight going on and, by the gods, I won't see the Horde lose it!"
---
I dont think this is correct. Even in the post he wrote they dont know exactly when the pvp phases will be released so I dont think its a good idea to combine them into the pve ones. There might be a few week difference in there who knows
---
Shaman-totems   
---

Warrior-?
---
It depends on what you’re doing, but every class has something to offer (some more than others of course)
---
That happened every like 6th wsg or so for me at worst.
---
This needs to be higher up. All the talk about dishonorable kills and the lawlessness in phase 2 is nothing compared to the fact that the upgraded Rank 10 set will be in game before BWL. Seriously not a good move.
---
There won’t be gms in classic. They’re rolling on an automated system now.
---
I think the way it operates is that anyone on the threat table will receive a DHk. So any little heal or buff that gets applied to the person who pulled it will also give you the dhk. 
---
It’d be nice if you could toggle off civilian battle, like the reputations option to check or uncheck [at war].
---
Because they were a joke. People tried them for like a week and then shrugged and went back to BGs.
---
The Silithus "PvP" was notoriously known as "lolsand"
---
Can’t wait!!!! Release date soon??
---
Google
---
it seems blizzard is just steering clear of stat changes to items entirely, perhaps they aren't confident they can do it to a high enough standard. changing the stats of pvp gear, like weapons first and then the set, would solve a lot of the issues early on.

The 60s grinding out the Felcloth they need will be all over Felwood ready to gank you on the way to the Demon spawns!
---
What. You realize that there are only 6 phases in total right? By your timeline we would be done naxx like a year after launch. Do you want Classic to be over and done with a year and a half after it launches? They need to stretch it out so that everyone gets to experience each phase (without stretching so far that people get bored and quit).

Then you misunderstood, I think his post. DHKs are inconveniences compared to a system that promotes what the Honor System does.
---
They're arguing that with the recently posted PvP content phases, that people wanting to begin ranking in phase 2 (without bgs) will make it absolute hell for anyone level 48-60 in the world. 
---
TM/SS will get farmed for a little bit, until everyone is worth zero honor there, then the hardcore ranking premades will go to the high traffic flightpaths and literally farm those and the zone for 12 hours a day. If one zone dries up, then they will move to another zone to continue farming level 48s.
---
Anyone level 48+ will get camped until they are worth 0 honor. They think this will cause a ton of people to quit, especially if this time frame lasts more than 2 weeks.

---
I think they should do 1.4 (launch) and 1.10 (biggest number of changes happened here)
---
In reality vanilla had items that changed multiple times (Bonereavers is the glaring example).
---
There aren't going to be as many people as this guy thinks, because we won't be playing on servers with 11,000 people.  YES, there will be ganking, but I think private servers might be skewing these guys perceptions of what it will be like.
---
I mean, I don't really care if someone wants to dominate someone in a game, especially if that person dominated is not me. What I care for is the shitty attitude. 
---
Am I allowed to call it toxic?
---
It's just sad considering how classic fans(not every fan) claim to miss the community aspect and have claimed over the years how "it was so much better" back then in that regard, yet the most toxic people I've met in WoW were either those in midcore guilds that think they are hot shit while they are just shit. Those who run heroic content on live and only manage 3/9 bosses on mythic, the highest difficulty and regularly rage quit out of a +7 dungeon(mythic keystone system) and ofc players on private servers, no mattter the expansion.
---
Mostly yeah.. I do think that having the 1.12 pvp rewards available will be an issue for raiding by the time BWL comes out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that the people putting all that time into pvping will be rewarded with the very best item and this will put pure pvpers above raiders unlike vanilla which will also be an interesting experiment.. it's just not quite vanilla which I thought was the point.
---
Im glad the pvp gear is coming out with the buffed version, it will be OP but people VASTLY underestimate how easy it is to get rank 12+, i think if you are putting that many hours into pvp you should be rewarded accordingly.
---
Yea this is absolutely horrible news. I am so disappointed in blizzard. Sell outs.
---
Wrong. DEATH RAY BOIIIIIIIIIII
---
hilarious comment that needs to be in every comment thread of every classic update
---
like i said in my post, this was on official vanilla servers. can't remember the exact patch but it was probably around the time before BWL was released.
---
the BRD can absolutely be aoed by a single frost mage. the packs in the rock tunnel to the right that makes a U turn with a single pathway in the middle was my usual route that i can remember vividly. another path was through the steel gate to the left and aoeing a few of those dwarven packs (i believe it was a healer in that pack so it had to be sheeped but my memory could be wrong).

I am starting with a human priest. I like the class alot. Priests are very consistent levellers with very little downtime. The only thing u have to take into account is that u upgrade your wand in time.
---
I don't remember how the world objectives worked back in the day so correct me if I'm missing something, but wouldn't it make more sense to release the Silithis one in phase 5 with the AQ raids?
---
Oh I must have misread. I’d have to say PvPing in STV and in the Western Plaguelands at places like Andorhal and the farms like Dalson’s Tears.
---
they're living in your head rent free bro, let them do their thing they arent hurting anyone, if its not your cup of tea then dont fucking watch it but you're clearly effected by them and thats kinda weird
---
Problem there is it's still possible to tag a civilian with an AoE without directly targeting them. IIRC, they also ran into fights just like every other NPC did. Maybe if they were programmed to run away as soon as a fight starts anywhere near them, to a basement or somewhere you'd have to deliberately track them down.
---
I'm thinking something like, as soon as the guards in the Valley of Heroes are attacked, every civilian in the Trade District of Stormwind flees to safety. If the fight moves into the Trade District proper, the civilians in the adjacent districts go to ground. Something where it would be basically impossible to accidentally tag one of them.
---
World bosses paired with the honor system is gonna be a blast.
---
31-8-12
---
Wow, I totally forgot about dishonorable kills!
---
I mean me and the OP went back in forth in another part of this thread and he agreed with me? So I dont think I misunderstood what he said... I think you have the misunderstanding here.
---
Interesting that the game was basically complete but they still decided to majorly overhaul and redo a bunch of art. Humans and orcs are obviously completely different, but I don't recognize some of those item models and pretty much all the "human" alliance buildings.
---
True. It's definitely going to depend a lot on the server population caps.
---
I felt that was covered when I said "button combinations."
---
Community: Make classic WoW
---
Blizzard: Ok
---
Community: Wew awesome &lt;3
---
Blizzard: 1.12 AV
---
Community: *pikachu face*
---
Oh boy here we go again.
---
Did he stream/make videos at all?
---
This is honestly a bad move on Blizzards part. I’m as much for “No Changes” as the next guy but this doesn’t bode well for a lot of PvP Servers. 
---
All of the hardcore rankers are going to be forced to gank/camp everyone they come across in the world for 16-18 hours a day to compete for bracket 1 spots. The majority of the servers population will not be 60 yet, and even if you are 60, it’s going to make doing anything in any level 50+ zone nearly impossible. There’s going to be gank squads running around in said zones all day everyday for 3 months until they’re Rank 14.  
---
I really think Blizzard needs to just have WSG in for Phase 2, leave AV for Phase 3 since the rep rewards are significantly better. This will help limit the hardcore rankers only being out in the world ganking in between queues (probably still a long time if there’s no x-realm BGs, which there probably need to be but that’s another story)
---
I'll play on an RP server and not sweat any of that
---
You forgot to mention that many gamers back then had terrible pcs and internet  connections still.
---
How about not fucking worrying about the top guilds then?  Worked out just fine in vanilla.
---
They're extremely powerful, entirely too powerful. Any top guild will require you to rank to raid with them. This is a horrible change forcing players to pvp.
---
I bet the reaction from the crowd was worth it.
---
But this doesn’t play out in raid damage/combat logs. Instant casts hit and register before missile attacks.
---
Thank you. This answers all aspects of the question :)
---
No more posts about "after Naxx". Thank the f***ing Flying Spaghetti Monster
---
Umm no... I specifically mentioned pvp phase 2/3 and made a comment about when they need to be released. Has nothing to do with the pve content phases. The pve content phases they released are actually pretty solid.
---
do you lack any semblance of critical thinking skills or independent thought?
---
why dont you just read it and figure out how it makes you feel?
---
I'll be noticing a rise in temperature and a cough coming on at least two or three days before I take a week off of work too lol
---
When leveling I would go 2 points corruption then 3 points suppression and then 2 points Imp drain soul and then go 2 points health stone 3 points demonic embrace and finally 3 points in Imp Voidwalker.
---
This way by level 24 you have tons of mana regen for no down time, a tough void walker with an improved sacrifice bubble if you need it. You have good health stones, you have more stamina for a larger health pool, and nothing is resisting your corruption. After this put the rest of the points into affliction to Shadow Master like the guides out there show. I like Botmaster5’s guide.
---
https://legacy-wow.com/warlock-leveling-guide-1-60/
---
Ok let me play in a casual guild and wipe in MC for 4 hours. I did that on Nost and it was HORRIBLE. I'd rather poop sock through easy content with 10 million consumables but no way in hell am I gonna grind out the pvp honor system. They literally just ruined everything.
---
I mean you get Fire Blast at level 6 so it's not too long until you can tag with an instant.
---
Then you must use your faction to fight them back!
---
I’m on your same exact page!!
---
Hope phase 2 kicks in right after people get 60.
---
Slogging through an entire Saturday of Troll, dragon, AND Dark Iron culling for a recent recruit and then spending my hard earned repair gold and on drinks for everyone in the Pig and Whistle.
---
I despised ST and BRD. But I cannot wait to spend hours doing them again.
---
Why are so many people upset about 1.12 AV?
---
Fantastic, I was gonna ask this question myself.
---
Optional tbc transfers.       Naxx farming endlessly. Server merges as population dwindles or moves to fresh realms
---
&gt;store binary data, if you really want them to
---
Yeah and I think it's safe to assume they didn't do that
---
&gt;But what you quoted was not about databases
---
Are you sure?
---
&gt;with imported 1.12.0 Art and **Database** Data.
---
The PvP phases and PvE phases are tied together.
---
https://i.redd.it/10m9gxedv2r21.png
---
Last I checked there weren't any rolls in retail. All the loot was individual.
---
That was originally the plan when WoW classic was being developed.
---
And take a chance at having to roll alliance, tauren, orc, or troll?  Fuck that
---
It happens on lower pop servers too
---
&gt;The fact that it resets your swing timer is insanely bad. I still dont know if thats just a private server bug or if it actually was supposed to do that. I do remember from classic times that slam spec and slamming inbetween your AAs was a thing but i cant say for sure...  
---
&gt;The Rage generation with slamming instead of dumping additional rage into HS or hamstring isnt much better TBH you are basically stealing away 50% of your AAs in rage gen aswell as their damage.  
---
&gt;For the whole question you need to take into account what kind of content you are raiding at the moment ... are you horde or alliance (WF or no WF) what buffs are you running etc.  
---
SO if you DO have rage problems which you shouldnt if you play 2h fury then you need to stack more crit or think about rolling horde for WF. In engame content reaching crit "cap" is alot easier than in mc raiding or anywhere else.   
---
&gt;However if Slam resets your AA timers i cant imagine a szenario where it would be worth going for it at all.  
---
&gt;Did any1 test slam spec on classic wow demo and does it really reset the timer?
---
Read the FUCKING cliffnotes you linked or watch the video. The cliffnotes make sense when you read them in order (they clearly change the subject from the database to art assets ) and the video makes everything perfectly obvious.
---
lol fuck off, that requires core changes to the actual games mechanics and thats not going to happen
---
I understand people love PVP, I enjoy BGs occasionally myself but I fucking hate not being able to turn it the fuck off. I might miss 50% of the game but I'm also missing 50% of the headache, I can /pvp when ever i'm feeling froggy I dont want to worry about being ganked all day every day, thats not fun for me.
---
Yup, I noticed.
---
Any top guild will require atleast rank 10. That's dumb. Don't force pve players to rank.
---
Yes, and they have stated they don't know when the things are actually going to be released. That's like a temp outline. Hopefully the pvp content gets released quicker in shorter timeframes. It will be much healthier for the game.
---
Can someone explain / point to info about how does dishonorable kill system work?
---
YIKES XD XD XD XD XD
---
Spirit Healer: "Why havn't you logged into an alt yet?"
---
Tailoring does have those outstanding Robe of the Archmage - it's BOP. I recently heard someone's plan was to level Tailoring just for that robe and then respec themselvs to Engineering (they're a crazy min/maxer)... but that's just one idea.
---
You could instead have Herbalism, which is super useful and can make loads of gold later on. Just find an alchemist friend or like below you could have an alt up to 35 for your own xmutes. Would help when you get your epic mount to have it on your Herbalist for faster farming too.
---
Let me give credit to Countdown. He'll bring on some guests who are super excited about it (probably Defcamp &amp; Melderon) and they can talk at length about anything.
---
It's kinda fun listened to them nerd out over the smallest stuffs. It reminds me of a happier time before real life and crippling depression ruined my joy :|
---
That's what bother me: the hardcore players level in a mostly PvP free world and when they are 60 and have some of BIS then they can go destroy every new 51-60 players and if anyone complain then they just say it's what PvP servers are about when in fact they never faced the same opposition.
---
I like world PvP and fighting against people roughly my level but I don't want to be the honor supply of people who rushed their level 60 to be ahead of the curve now looking to get an early start ot their rank 14 when I haven't even step in BRD.
---
Also I've repeated many times but honor system was stupid 15 years ago and it's even more stupid nowadays so WoW classic will be a purely PvE game for me. (end of the rant)
---
I don't doubt there will be camping.  Where I disagree is that there will be premade honor groups of 60s in every zone 24/7.  The servers just won't be big enough for it to ever be that severe.
---
I'm not saying it won't happen sometimes.  I'm just saying this clip comes across as exaggerated, in my opinion.
---
Should be forced to take a public speaking class before posting videos. That was painful to listen to, never again.
---
JESUS CHRIST ITS JASON BOU- er- LEAMEAUIX
---
It's odd, but Pallies take a lot of caster off-set pieces for their MC BiS. Azuresong mageblade and robes of volatile power are the best in those slots for pally healers in MC iirc. It's not their fault that plate healing gear basically doesn't exist until naxx.
---
People already do this insane grind on pservers where the rewards are in their weaker state. This is absurd. Any guild worth their salt will require their members atleast R10 to raid with them. Don't force pve players into pvp. Did they forget what happened when they made players pvp for the legendary cloak in MoP?
---
This sounds pretty logical really. I think either they will do something like this or have an stress test open beta week. They have to do something to work out how many players are interested before launch.
---
This is a failure! Go ahead "no changes" downvote all you want but releasing classic without the BGs is just stupid. Fine don't release the PvP rank system til whenever, don't release the rep vendors to whenever. But why for the love of God would you release it without the ability to play the game arguably the most and repeatable content in the game! Old schools BGs with vanilla classes and full toolkits is all I care about with this game! I have to wait til Phase 4 to play the best single best piece of the content that this game has ever had, level 60 Arathi Basin! I hate this so much just let us play random games of BGs from launch, no rewards, no rep, no ranks that's all fine I just want to BG!
---
I believe neatherweave is TBC
---
Good times - I remember getting hit with this at the AH in Ironforge. I'd just logged in and my entire guild started shouting at me to hearth somewhere else. Didn't make it &gt;D
---
Hopefully they do community voting for content like they did with runescape when they made their old-school servers. Literally no content gets added to runescape unless the community that plays old-school runescape votes it in. With that system I could see us going up to wotlk
---
Insert useless speculation.
---
Exactly. Phase 1 needs to last 2months MAX, then release phase 2 pvp content, and 2 weeks after that release phase 3 pvp content. Everyone needs to remember it takes 3 months MINIMUM to reach rank 14.
---
That would be the most ideal thing, and would probably be the healthiest thing for the server.
---
Early game is linen and wool bags. 6 and 8 slot relatively cheap.
---
Well this was a colossal issue on every private server and caused massive outcry. So I don't see why Classic will be any different. A ranking system without BGs is a recipe for disaster. 
---
He is right, it's not 2004 anymore. There's not going to be any epic battles in Hillsbrad because it's not an optimal way to rank up. Like Tribe said the most optimal way to rank up is to form a premade and farm lowbies at flightpaths for 12 hours a day and this is exactly how Classic is gonna play out.
---
I think something like this would be the ideal way to gauge population for launch. Pre-registering would guarantee a priority slot for launch day, and those who are interested in playing but not pre-registering would have to join a queue, but they're less likely to be bothered by this, and more likely to play casually.
---
The only issue is probably that there would have to be sufficient time before launch for them to implement the results, in which time there may be more interest from people missing the pre-registration.
---
Why does this not relate to WoW Classic? The introduction of Esports is kind of a big deal...
---
They are finally revealing that there is only 1.12 items they know people will be mad that's why they've only been dropping hints at it. Once they come out and say it there will be a massive wave of angry pserver players. These are the guys that got this whole movement started in the first place and it's pretty insulting they would take the lazy route.
---
I think you need to reread their post about the honor system implementation. They explicitly said that the PvP phases will be released with the associated pve content. A lot of it has to do with the gear that’s available due to the honor system. This is the timeline.
---
There were 14 ranks with varying rewards. Once you attained that rank you were entitled to buy the rewards from a vendor for gold. 
---
The specific battlegrounds also had reputation based rewards as well.
---
Every week your honor points are converted into Ranking Points ( RP ) and added to your total RP. For Rank 13 You need 55000 Ranking Points. Absolute maximum a player can earn per week is 13000 RP. For that you need to earn more honor than 99.7% of ranking players for your faction in a given week (to earn 12000 RP you need to be better than 98.9% of ranking players).
---
Every week Your total RP will naturally decay by 20%. This means that, even theoretically, you can't achieve Rank 13 if you earn less than 11000 RP per week because at some point Decay will be greater than RP you earned.
---
Okay but there are enough buttons to map nearly every available action bar slot with combinations.
---
Do they say anywhere how long these phases will last? Like, I hope we get a long time to be able to do battlegrounds and stuff instead of just half the duration of Classic.
---
I may have a code of honor in the other 95% of Azeroth, but in STVietnam, it's war. Red is dead, and the enemy will be shown no mercy. Alliance be warned, there are plenty of other zones to raise your young. The Horde will reclaim the Troll home land!
---
After BGs are released maybe. This content release schedule is trying to promote WPvP
---
What's the point of this comment? You went straight for the personal jab and completely skipped opinion presented in the video.
---
Sell outs?
---
Calm down mate.
---
At some point does a shitpost transcend being a shit post because of how accurate it is?
---
That's not a bad idea for anyone wanting a 39 twink - alchemy would be really good as an otherwise wasted second profession.
---
I swear Gnome Warrior has the best racial for Warriors - makes a Mage shit their pants when their almighty Nova melts off the Gnome's hot lil feet - half the Mage's health disappears and they're forced to Blink into an Intercept. Gnome Rogues are even more terrifying
---
Perhaps you should post a better video then. :)
---
Maybe not too many posts, but there are invites to some active discord and fb groups
---
I don't know what much of this means because I started in wotlk but damn I'm excited

Don't forget Mining

&gt; "Here’s what the PvP content looks like mapped to the phases we recently posted about:"
---
and then
---
They literally just mapped it to the pve content plan so people can get an idea as to what they're looking at.
---
I think Blizz will release fresh servers every 6-12 months and promote their release.
---
I haven't seen this before, it was AWESOME! Glad it was posted.
---
24/7? Maybe not.
---
During prime times? Absolutely!
---
And it wont be EVERY zone, just all the popular flight paths. And if you're alliance, then Menethill harbor will be a death trap.
---
Curious to know - why is that? Is it that whole "marauding horde bloodthirst" being more fun than "For the Alliance!" ? or something else with the towns/players?
---
 **I pity Esfand**. I'm not jealous of him at all. The sad thing is if he hadn't sold out, he actually has a good enough personality on screen that he wold have gotten MORE money and support in the long run, just being critical of Blizzard and calling Classic out as the fraud it is. He never needed to ally himself with Blizzard influencers.
---
Gnome warrior is BIS and I'm going for that too. Screw wep spec, give me that escape artist. I'd rather get pvp racials than pve ones.
---
probably around 4 months if I had to guess
---
I would hope people will learn to use search function by then...
---
You think you are gonna be able to continue? They are gonna grind away on your until you are not worth honor, and then you do whatever you had to do at that flightpath, go to next zone and rinse repeat.
---
very good
---
Well an opinion is an opinion, just that. As someone that doesn’t normally pay attention to the opinions of streamers and e-personalities I was curious since the topic is highly intriguing to me. 
---
But there’s a different between eloquence and rambling, and this was more of the latter. Like and subscribe.
---
It is useless speculation but probably more right than wrong they’ve already decided on loot trading  to limit the need for GMs to manage the game. Not a far stretch to think they won’t closely monitor the pvp ranked leaderboards.
---
The average player will not reach 60 within a month. 2-3 seems more likely for the majority of the playerbase, if not longer.
---
They can easily go through web archives and get the old item stats or atleast get pretty close to how they were but they won't put the time effort and resources into it because they're lazy and want to collect as much money with as little put into it as possible that's been clear from day one this game will be like Diablo 3 they're prepping the game to be put into a stasis where they can move all their devs off except one guy to keep the servers running if they did progressive itemization then they'd need to keep more devs on staff to fix bugs when things break from patching etc etc. this is all to cut corners and save a buck at the expense of the consumer.
---
So if a player came standing one on their faction for every one of the seven consecutive weeks during that window they would be Rank 12 + 27.3% progress to Rank 13. It would take them two more weeks of standing one to hit rank 13 and three more weeks after that to hit Rank 14.  
---
Probably not very many people were Rank 12 when BGs came out. Rank 10 would be pretty impressive honestly.
---
Dane checking in 👋🏼
---
Yeah they tied it to the PvE content thats what I'm saying. Phase 2 PvE content and PvP content will release together.
---
Alright, then buddy.
---
Phase 5?
---
This idea is great
---
At least no need for any adaptive sync technology. Turn on V sync and you will be capped at screen refresh rate regardless on what's going on the screen.
---
Just need to know now when Phase 1 _begins_ ....
---
32 here and child free. Best decision I ever made not having kids. But each to their own.
---
I guess the argument would be it wasn't the vanilla experience. People pvping over those would mean less in hillsbrad or something
---
You are very correct, thanks.
---
All your flight masters are belong to us.
---
Awesome.
---
&gt; Good post for inspiring rets, boomkins
---
The biggest turn off for Boomkin, is literally playing as Boomkin. I tried to level my Druid as Boomkin, made it to maybe level 25ish before I finally grew too frustrated.           
---
             
---
Always out of mana and crap DPS, I respeced a lot during Vanilla and I think I did Boomkin for a few weeks but only for PVP and dungeons, not raids.              
---
               
---
I agree everyone should play what they like but Boomkin was horrible until TBC and then they were just the 4 horseman of the Apocalypse in a chicken suit.
---
World PvP is another fantasized concept that gets jerked here constantly. While leveling 99% of your encounters will be either you dumpstering someone lower level than you or the other way around. 
---
At 60 there are simply better options.
---
&gt; Yeah they tied it to the PvE content thats what I'm saying. Phase 2 PvE content and Phase 2 PvP content will release together.
---
We don't know that. Blizz has said they don't know when things will be released and can/will change. They *mapped* it to the pve content phases so people can have an idea as to what they can expect.
---
We could still get pvp phase 2 in between pve content phase 1 and 2, for example.
---
You need to have a parents account, otherwise after you've been playing for 24 hours you'll get kicked and it will ask if you're a robot. But on a parent account, you and your kid are 'just taking 12 hour shifts' and you can stay online 24/7.
---
Well let’s just hope phase 2 is at least a couple months after launch.
---
Well since no one else has yet, here's some OG to charm yourself:

---
Much different than the other shows which are built on years of analysis - this one was made back when the idea of BGs were still being considered as something out of the ordinary
---
There are several early game mobs that have higher chances to drop 4 and 6 slot bags. Runecloth is the standard, 14 slots. Then you have the 60+ bags - Onyxia Hide Backpack, Panther Hide Sack, Mooncloth. 
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?items=1.0#0-8+1](https://classicdb.ch/?items=1.0#0-8+1)
---
UPDATE:  Looks like Runecloth bags (14 slots) should be readily available during end game correct?
---
I think your expectations (and worries) are heavily skewed by the information you are being given by people on the internet and a lot of it seems to miss the point that there aren't just two types of players, the casual forever-leveler who does not know what a raid is and the hardcore-nolifer who lives in raids 24/7.
---
I've played back in the day on a heavily populated server on EU. On the alliance side, there were 2 true hardcore guilds, who were looking for firsts, no compromises, but only one of them was actually being able to seriously compete, about 10 semi-serious guilds (I was guild leader in one of them, who was in a guild-alliance of 4 guilds and over 250 players in total - to go raiding in 2 separate raids together).
---
Then there were at least 10 more, who were raiding in a more casual setting (some in guild-alliances as well to be able to put 40 man together) and towards the end a small number of regular pug-groups for MC and BWL, as well as multiple ZG and AQ20 groups.
---
The two top guilds went to the end of Naxxramas, the middle of the pack in which I was in cleared Twin Emps and / or Cthun in AQ40 and about 50% of Naxxramas before TBC was released and the other guilds were somewhere towards the end of BWL, a bit of AQ, maybe Skeram and another boss here and there and at most Faerlina in Naxx. 
---
Hundreds of people raided on my server. If you don't have the time, I doubt you'll be main tanking Naxxramas with just a few hours of casual playtime each week, based on how vanilla wow was back th en, but you'll be able to find a guild for which you can tank in raids and it doesn't have to be a PUG MC group at all. But the MTs in the top guilds and in the semi-serious bracket were not casually playing the game a few hours a week. They were reliable, there were ALWAYS there, when it came to going for progress, they were always on point with their buffs, upgrades, etc. And the few shit tanks we had were tasked with shit tasks, but we still took them with us, when more tanks were necessary.
---
Funding secured.
---
I'm looking through this post and it's comments but can't find an answer to my question.  
---
I remember the honour system and the excruciating amount of time it took to level up while holding down a full time job, and having a family.
---
I also remember tokens. Where these tokens used to buy reputation gear with each pvp faction? Or could they be used for extra honour points to rank up?
---
We in blue know we're the real good guys... Now get back in the internment camp, Orc.
---
Hey!

I'm a healer looking for mates to start classic with, maybe team up beforehand, do some this and that.

I'm mostly looking for the social aspect of guilds.

---
Who are these people?  
---
I only know of mom and dad.
---
Maybe for PvPers. It prevented people from just stopping people leveling who can’t get to the quest givers because they are dead. They solved a bigger problem than someone just losing honor. The combination of BGs and DHKs made it so leveling was actually possible.
---
[See my answer here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bawsup/the_complete_classic_plan_pve_pvp_phases/ekep5qr)
---
I don't care if they don't add new systems. I was giving examples.
---
Battlemasters was added to the game because running to the portal was one of the biggest complaints. The que time for some brackets was hours because people could not bother to run their and afk
---
I can gurante you that battle master will be in the game
---
Only after the honor patch drips in. And most likely what ever side will have longer ques will be camping.
---
Pre honor, it will just be pure world pvp for fun.
---
Beware of the #nochanges group unless you intend to trigger them.
---
Do you guys think they if this is wildly successful they will eventually start rolling in BC and so on?
---
Yep.
---
summer
---
I get that. I had one PreBIS item from AV.
---
But since AV will come out when I have a better alternative, I'll have 0 incentive to PVP, which is good for PVPers cause I would have been sitting there just farming rep and being a shit contributor.
---
yes alliance  are generally stronger in pvp in just face to face group pvp with all cds. there are different strategies involved from horde to work around it and different setups. its all quite complicated.
---
but in the first fight in bgs alliance usually wins incase of roughly equal premades, paladins just bubble up and you really have no counterplay towards it (there is no mass dispel in vanilla ). also all alliance players got more hp cos of kings, and that its precentage based and scales with all other hp buffs. 
---
paladins are probably the best pvp healer (you are correct), horde dont have them so they end up running priests as their main healers. but ya priest and paladins are two core healeres in pvp. thing is you need a priest buff so you need at least one priest in your wsg setup.
---
After Naxx we make another 12 posts a day about what will happen after Naxx
---
This is for a private server. Please try r/wowservers.
---
Spoh? yeah spohtv on twitch, he havent streamed for months now though, said he wants to wait for classic. he got rank 13 on N\*orthdale.
---
"As we mentioned before, we haven’t yet determined exactly when each of the content phases will occur but we’ll keep you updated as they draw closer."
---
The when they're referring to is when each phase will launch relative to one another, not when each line item in each phase will launch. Also I doubt Blizzard wants to be putting out patches every month, a single patch for each phase makes the most sense from a game management perspective. Lastly the honor system will not launch before phase 2, the gear associated with it is too strong and will make phase 1 content pointless. Until they say otherwise, trust that this timeline is what they're doing.
---
That's not even close to true, even on toxic private servers
---
This is the exact period where the likes of Angwe became (in)famous
---
I know most here are #NoChanges but I wish they would get rid of honor decay. As a Rank 14 High Warlord I know how many hours it takes to get and it certainly isn't healthy. 
---
I wish the ranks were based on total honor received so eventually anyone could work towards the higher ranks over the years and not just those who can play 10-14 hours a day for a few months straight.
---
If you quit because PvP was introduced and you started getting ganked, you wouldn't have chosen to play on a PvP server in the first place. This guy's talking out of his ass.
---
My memory is shite then :)
---
Let me explain.
---
You CAN run a marathon after you first shoot yourself in the foot but most people prefer not to.
---
Hit 60 fast and collect tank gear.  A lot of guilds will have “tanks” but they won’t really be raid ready.  Make yourself raid ready and apply.
---
Haha yeah once everyone laughed I was very happy. Was definitely a joke costume :)
---
Then limit DKs to non-PvP servers. They were a major hammer smack to all world PvP.
---
I still argue there was more negative than positive from it.
---
In general, how much stronger are we as players playing on 1.12 going into something like MC?
---
OP might be making assumptions about how loot rolls will work based on retail, given his post
---
For endgame, you can grab 14 slot common bags rather cheap. Moving up there are uncommon 16 slot bags, and the largest bags which are 18 slot. Each of these sizes of bags can be obtained through tailoring or world drops, with the exception of 18 slots being an expensive tailoring craft and a drop from certain raid bosses.
---
After reading this I will not be bothering to play at launch and will likely have nothing to do with this game now if things are unchanged in PVP.  I want nothing to do with the old grind of the original PVP system, which was very unhealthy.  This as well promotes significant botting which I do not want to compete against.  I hoped Blizzard would have some common sense here but I guess not.
---
based on your factions standing each weak you gain ranking points
---
you lose 20% of your total ranking points each week, which means you get less and less RP as your total RP/rank goes up
---
DHK reduces the RP you gain that week
---
Yes, they will be plentiful.  Mooncloth exists as well but is tied to a tailoring CD so will he very pricy
---
Whatever it takes...
---
It's honestly shaping up to be much better than I thought.
---
I loved the way content was rolled during vanilla and "2005 phase 2" in particular. I never even thought once they would actually replicate that part of the vanilla experience
---
Nubbin?? Lol stop I’m trying to eat lunch here
---
No one is forcing you. If you decide to be in a guild that does, then that's on you.
---
Here's a couple links for context and for links to gear rewards:
---
* [wiki](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System)
---
* [wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-pvp-system-overview)
---
and here's a 6min video from [Staysafe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFbX5drsnAw) which explains it pretty well
---
Have two characters to level at the same time. When you're killed twice in 5 minutes, log onto the other one. Same there. It may be annoying, but it's efficient. Or just go into instances all day long.
---
I'm looking forward to that world PvP action and if I die, that's a part of it. If you get annoyed of a player, write his name on a KoS list and gank when you have the upper hand.
---
&gt; Any top guild will require you to rank to raid with them. This is a horrible change forcing players to pvp.
---
The game isn't the problem here.
---
It's hard to imagine even a twink using a Flask. Yes, the persist through death feature is extremely useful in a battle ground, but given that those flasks require a Black Lotus, they're gonna be extremely expensive.
---
Dishonorable kills were a terrible idea and I'm genuinely bummed to see them coming back.
---
Pro tip that I always did and encourage as a hunter; lay freezing traps for your healer to stand in, regularly. That way when the shit happens he can have that extra layer of protection already in place, and your trap CD will be up and ready.
---
This makes sense, thanks.
---
&gt;assure
---
&gt;probably
---
My guess is that Phase 2 will be on the original Release Anniversary - Nov. 23
---
lot of new/better items from 1.1-1.9
---
talent tree overhauls, which made most classes significantly better
---
knowledge, addons, more than 10fps for some
---
....a lot
---
I wouldn't let my dad falling off the ladder make me fall off the PVP ladder. He can get himself to hospital.
---
Hiding in the nooks &amp; crannys in IF and SW is so fun as a rogue, also camping the tram, and boats at menethil is another very fun and unique thing to horde pvp. Ganking in Org or UC just isn't as interesting, as the cities are generally more compact with less spots and areas to lose pursuing players.
---
Plus wands are a thing, and rank1 Frostbolt
---
Just cos dad fell off the ladder doesn't mean I have to fall off the PVP ladder. He can get himself to hospital.
---
I agree, I just think 3 months for phase one should be the floor.  Ideally I think 4-6 months is best.
---
I'm not saying that it's impossible to improve the game. What I'm saying is that if you add changes it's no longer Vanilla, it's something different, and I want to play Vanilla.
---
&gt;pserver
---
Well.theres your problem sport

#I'M THE SCATMAN!!!
---
I wish I wasn't too lazy to make gifs, otherwise I'd use the scene from Gone with the Wind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSEVyzKmlyU and say "My alt leveling during phase 2"
---
Literally the only thing I care about right now is having a solid release date. PLEASE!
---
How much easier will BWL be with 1.12 blue pvp gear?
---
Deep meaning anything with the 31 point talent in that tree. Wrath cast time vs. Nature's Grasp is a legitimate choice for deep Resto, although I would personally take Nature's Grasp.
---
Ahhh. Competition for the platinum name.
---
Phase 1 would need to be longer since everyone is leveling to 60. Phase 2 might last only 3 months.
---
Yeah I agree, 3-4 feels right to me, 2 is not enough time for the casual audience and 5 might be pushing it, but I'd rather have 5 than 2.
---
Yes, I can escape a group of players who are camping a single point on the map.
---
Also I hope people won't be so selfish that they don't help each other when a flight path is being camped.
---
WSG / AB / AV rewards were based on reputation, not on honor. WSG for example had rings/neck/cloak at Honored reputation, blue weapons at Revered and the epic level 60 armor pieces as well as the tabard at Exalted.
---
You probably leveled during BC pre-patch or when BC was already out.
---
Yeah the pve solution is way fairer for everyone but I think the most pvp players do not look for a fair fight.
---
I played on a Pvp server and had a lot of fun but some situations are just bad, worst is when you lvl a twink and always have to relog on the main.
---
People act like you can not do pvp on a pve server but all it does is that all people start with pvp off and can decide when to activate it.
---
I personally have not yet decide where to play but with the fact that I do not have that much time nowadays I tend to a pve server
---
Personally - having kids, and spending $10k+ on a wedding would feel like moving backwards :)
---
This is going to be as vanilla as it can, you wanted major changes i guess?
---
 **&lt;TBD&gt;   {Alliance PvP}   {West Coast Semi-Hardcore}   {LC}** 
---
**What are our goals?**  
---
We will be a fun but serious guild working to clear content in a fast and effective manner. We won't be chasing server firsts but we do intend to be among the top guilds on the server, and compete for world bosses and fastest raid clear times. We will be an active part of shaping the classic community on our server.   
---
Depending on the way classic pvp is released, we may have a ranking pvp group from the start. We will be active in pvp but members are not obligated to participate. World pvp and groups will be encouraged.   
---
**Why should you join us?**  
---
We have a strong core of knowledgeable and skilled officers to allow the guild and raids  to run smoothly. Our officers have experience with all vanilla content, and our raid leader has previously lead a guild to success in Naxx, downing Kel’Thuzad before TBC was released. Raid times are favorable for all NA timezones. They will be Saturday and Sunday from Noon PST - 4 pm PST.   
---
**Want to know more?**  
---
If you are interested in joining or would like more information please message me (Kicharan) directly.
---
Which is precisely why I'm hoping DHKs eventually get removed.
---
Yeah, yeah; "NO CHANGES REEEEEEE!" The PvP ranking system was crap when it first went live in '04, it'll be crap when it goes live again in '19.
---
That said, I'm willing to accept the fact I'll never come anywhere near rank 14 (or probably even rank 11). All I want is for DHKs to go away so large-scale world PvP can be a thing again, especially city raids, without effectively being penalized for engaging in my favorite part of the game.
---
I know I am in the minority and most here are #NoChanges but I wish they would get rid of honor decay. As a Rank 14 High Warlord I know how many hours it takes to get and it certainly isn't healthy.
---
So the pvp system had two kinds of rewards, rep gear, each BG had it's own faction and they had various rewards which were available to anyone you just needed enough rep and enough marks from each BG.  That's relatively comparable to how rep rewards work every where else.
---
Honor and honor gear on the other hand was completely different.  You didn't spend honor directly.  Every week honor reset and at the end of the week your honor was ranked against everyone elses on the server, based on your rank you moved up or down in rank.  Rank determined what honor gear you could buy and at higher ranks there was a very finite amount of people who could be at anyone given rank at a time, think like 1-2 people could be rank 14 each week.
---
The honor system was a huge time sink because it wasn't a personal time sink, you had to play more than others as well.
---
Prepare for server crashes
---
from 60 its 51 i think
---
Don't get why WSG is delayed to phase 3, seems so pointless.
---
Since you're wanting to make a Warrior with concerns about gear reliance - just make them as your alt to beginwith.
---
You can make your Mage or Rogue as your first character - they die less, depend on gear less, and generally kill faster with less downtime at the beginning. This character can have a helpful tradeskill like Alchemy or Tailoring or Enchanting to better help both your characters.
---
You make your Warrior, and instantly can have full bags plus being able to send potions/elixirs and gear you farm from lil dungeons and have saved BoEs when leveling from your first character. This way your Warrior is always basically rocking BiS and you can make them Mine/Engineering and keep that Engi leveled.
---
In this way you can bounce between your two characters rested XP, while making your Warrior's leveling much more fun since instead of struggling to kill stuff you'll be clobbering fools left and right.
---
Hi, /u/SmokeCocks
---
I always do tailoring with mining. Tailoring is a professional that doesn't need a secondary gathering profession so you can sell your mining mats. Herbalism would probably also work well for selling mats.
---
Good advice, thanks. I plan on taking 2 weeks off work and power leveling so hopefully I can make a name for myself early.
---
TBC yes, Wrath probably yes too. Don't think the demand will ever be there for expansions after those though, and the further we go the more complicated these projects become too.
---
Lol my dad and I had to build a second family comp with like 100 gb HDD and 2 gb of RAM so we didn't have to wait on our family to play 
---
Good times.
---
FF11 was 100x, 1+ years to 75 cap for the more casual play times  and was the greatest community game ever made, I never played wow but joining classic because its the closest next best thing and cant wait. This new log in and get what you want or pay for it is the death of MMOs.
---
Cringe.  It was fun while it lasted but I'm totally burned out on this.  Have fun guys.
---
I played horde back in the day. Shaman. I'm thinking of making a dwarf this time around if I decide I'm going to play Classic.

that's what the permanent server is for, u don't have to play the fresh server, u can play on the server that stays there forever, the fresh servers will merge into this server when it is caught up in content
---
Phase 2 is when server legends are going to be made
---
I am.... forsaken.
---
Which is funny because as one of those kids I imagined everyone else as full grown adults.
---
There's no pleasing that one.  Post history appears to be all bitter complaints lol.
---
TM SS War conformed. I’m so excited!
---
There's a huge difference between not min-maxing your race, and expecting to raid as a ret paladin though. The former might be a 1% difference in effectiveness, and the latter might be a 50%+ difference in effectiveness.
---
I think it's good to be realistic about "meme specs" because people should be aware of what they're getting themselves into. Playing that spec better be the #1 most important thing in the game to you, because it's going to severely limit your options throughout Classic. For some people, that's totally fine! But I think that's a rare breed.
---
It's weird then how the exact same circumstances didn't really lead to that outcome during actual vanilla
---
Dude it was so fun. I didn't know Jack shit about anything, but I played Warcraft III and Frozen Throne so I it was fun to putz around all these cool places I had seen.
---
I remember reading spells over and over again trying to understand how it all worked together.
---
This. The idea was nice, both for EPL &amp; Silithus but the lack of meaningful rewards or just rewards at all is the reason no one remembers them.
---
it worked exactly that way. hence why the rework for BC was such a big thing.
---
For reference: The BC warrior slam rework changed it to work like hunter's aimed shot used to work in classic. Aka attack weaving with slams and slam suppressing basic attacks during the cast (but no longer resetting the swing timer)
---
As for the OP. I stick to my statement as it goes for both dual W and 2 handed. 
---
&gt; With that said there are only a handful of niche scenarios whereby slam  could be actually useful (regardless whether its talented or not). This  would be a scenario when you generate so much rage that even burning it with heroic strikes is not enough and you still cap on rage.  In that case a delayed swing + a slam would net you more dmg than just  the regular swing (as a heroic strike)
---
It's incredibly valuable when people are trying desperately to get to iron mining.  It's a hard gap to bridge from tin to iron and silver helps immensely with the smelting skillups. The AH is usually empty on private servers... I was too stupid to remember if this was the case in real vanilla.
---
Sweet. I was to young to really enjoy playing when it first came out.  One of my biggest regrets is I never got to experience tbc and vanilla.   I am beyond hyped
---
I know how to tank in classic, I played a rogue back then but I have tanked a lot from BC on. I'm also going to do a lot of research to make sure I'm fully prepared. 
---
I'm a total no life, so putting in 24+ hours a week total is no problem. I just don't want to commit to more than 3 days a week, I want the rest of the hours to be on my time ya know?
---
Probably should have mentioned that I plan on rolling on a RP server. I don't need world firsts at all, as long as I clear Naxx while it's still current content I will be completely satisfied.
---
The ability of addons is very much in controll by blizzard by determining what information can be addressed in which ways. Over the time they’ve expanded the possibilities which translates into you experiencing more and more addons and features. 
---
So i think it’s entirely controllable by blizzard if they feel the need to.
---
Nineteen27 (Hunter from Death n taxes) mentioned in the Countdown to classic that he had to nolife 14-16 hours a day for months and he still was the second hunter to get the GM title :)
---
Classic team is killing it imo. Last piece of info to get seems like a release date :)
---
You're one of those people that is actively unhappy about people enjoying things you don't also enjoy, right? If you don't like it no one should?
---
Encourage some world PVP.
---
This video is okay
---
Blizz needs to make sure their servers are prepped. Phase 2 could be on of the greatest times in wow ever, or a complete powerpoint shit show.
---
Amen for every subreddit.
---
No, just intelligent changes, not ones catering to purists.  No reason to play, and pay, for a game on launch with features missing or an unhealthy system.
---
The people over at r/Denmark were talking about making a guild come Classic
---
What? Care to explain what's going through your mind?
---
Wouldn't it be faster and better for them to just battle each other for pvp ranking?
---
Absolutely, I never miss a raid unless there's a major RL emergency. I missed maybe 3 raids in 6 years with my last guild.
---
People not taking raid commitments seriously is a  major pet peeve of mine. Yeah it's a game but if I don't show up, 39 other people have their plans ruined.
---
Does that really need to be encouraged, though? I don't know how long these phases are going to last, but it seems like it's going to be a long time before having a battleground. I don't know how they think that's good.
---
I feel sorry for the ones high level enough to give a 60 honor, but too low level to fight back.

CAN WE MAKE SOME NOISE ABOUT AB BEING PHASE 4?
---
Arathi used to open at level 20, whereas AB is a clearly a high-level battleground that opens up at level 51. That makes more sense to release them in appropriate order, IMO. 
---
AB happens to be my favorite battleground aswell, it just hits that sweet spot. If there's someone sharing the same point of view, let's make 'em hear us!
---
name checks out
---
Lol grind that pvp honor system again?  Premade battleground groups just stomping everyone for 8 hours straight?  I didn't participate the first go around but again, nothanks.
---
The lack of uproar about patch 1.12 AV is really disapointing to me, I wish more people cared about this.

Yeah it's a copypasta at this point. TIPS BABBBBBBY!

Phase 1: Everyone get to Level 60 as quickly as possible

---
is there actually anyone who fear that their desired class/race combo shouldnt be played because of it being optimal? can you point to anyone?
---
I feel like this concept is just a projection of doubt, and it has created a philosophical enemy for people to circlejerk about. Please stop these posts, there's hundreds of videos on class/race combos, anyone who is interested in learning what is optimal or not will find the information and make their decision
---
Well don't get me wrong, I don't want to raid every night but I will have no problem being there when I say I will. I take raiding commitments VERY seriously, especially as a tank.
---
Fury does not appeal at all. I plan on gearing it and I don't mind doing it for the occasional fight but I absolutely do not want to main fury, or DPS at all really.
---
If I didn't mind fury, this choice would be a lot easier. Thanks for the advice though!

there is no point in playing this you dont go hardcore, min/max, level rush etc.

---
Lmao this is so accurate
---
I almost guarantee that if the initial launch is a huge success, they'll do new rounds of servers. Especially if numbers start to dwindle. The cost to spin up new servers will be negligible, and the money to be made is too great.
---
I would love to see people get a -1 for killing a lowbie that offers no honor gain.
---
Think they’ll have contest winners tabard again?
---
Remove dishonorable kills:/
---
Even pvp rewards are intoduced in phase 2 in their 1.12 form, it will be very difficult and time consuming to get rank 12,13,14 until phase 3 without having battlegrounds which are introduced in phase 3! So props to those courageous that accomplish that!
---
A good idea.. so blizzard will do none of it.
---
Look for a guild to join ASAP. Most of the time the main tank for the guild is in an officer role, as they are more trusted to be committed to the guild.
---
What would you have like to have happened?
---
That is way too soon to release pvp rewards.
---
Playing Dwarf Fortress and OSRS
---
I find it way more climatic and enriched w/ fantasy theme. Current site is so...washed and plain..
---
That's not defiant at all. It's what the OP said.
---
I can already taste the tears of the 'mu hurr durr we need bgs on launch day' PvP only people
---
Delicious
---
It's because they want to gank them. The more PVE players on PVP servers, the most people for no-life losers to gank and feel better about their EPeen.
---
Yes, I know mana won't be drained if you are on cat/bear form. But then Scare Beast becomes effective because you didn't dispell Viper, so you have to choose between taking the fear, going back to caster form and curing the poison or back to bear/cat form. The hunter can act accordinly and keep trying to scare you.
---
But you are theorycraft a whole scene where you are hibernating the pet, kiting in cheetah etc, and in these moments you would be drained by some ticks, or you will have to spend another global do remove the poison (so the hibernate, of the bear form change would be delayed).
---
The pet can also be dispelled from hibernate (RNG ok) via talented mend pet, and in general the hunter does more damage than the druid.
---
I still think that Hunter should win in 60% of the cases, assuming equal gear and skill from both.
---
Based on Pservers you need gathering profs and strict spendings. Based on Classic you need a rly good memory if you recollect that sort of information your asking about .
---
P2 better be small enough you can't get PvP armor before bwl.
---
If there is $ in it they are almost obligated to.  They put off classic for 7 years even though people begged... they would be foolish to make that mistake again.
---
&gt; they're prepping the game to be put into a stasis where they can move all their devs off except one guy to keep the servers running  
---
I’m surprised that there are people surprised by this. When they announced they would be using 1.12 as a base for Classic did most people just not assume they were trying to go for something fairly low maintenance?
---
It looks pretty self explanatory tbh
---
Depends on your class, but a lot of it has to do with not upgrading a lot of the new skills and spells you learn.
---
that would require full rework of the system, just removing decay would make r14 trivial to get
---
/u/tipsoutbaby
---
He thinks players will need a reason to assemble groups to raid lowbies.
---
Awww, how cute.
---
Play in a pserver
---
This is where I hop off the #nochanges bandwagon. Dishonorable kills were a terrible game mechanic that killed WPVP.
---
20%
---
I really wish they had taken this opportunity to fix some of the issues with the roll out of original. Maybe they're doing this intentionally as a slight "told you so"
---
Most private servers wizened up to the fact that people really love LATE GAME vanilla, and having say - ZG and AB of all things (Sili to a lesser extent) released 2/3rds through the game's life span is a less-than-stellar choice.
---
It'll be a blast, but be prepared to basically be content gates SUPER fast with everything being done a week after release.
---
Also cheers to the mad mad solo DM N farming, lmao.
---
You are moving forward, too. Don't let societal norms dictate what is and is not moving forward to *you*. You probably know that already :)
---
It's the 21st century, having a marriage and a kid is not the end all be all anymore.
---
im glad you actually explained this.  I never knew how it works but bassicly this explains why I’m going to never be high ranked high.
---
This. Lol
---
To comment briefly on honor trading being a bannable offense, I do believe the problem will be so widespread, too hard to track, and represent too much hassle to implicate offenders that it will still see widespread use.  With such an incentive, achieving hours of comparable wpvp honor grindings in tenths of the time only requiring a handful of conspirators with a few lvl 60's on each, people will be all to eager.
---
No, you are not going to have enough for your mount. I think you'd be lucky to have 30g at lvl 40 if you trained everything and didn't do any professions.  
---
On a recent 1x server I took skinning and skinned/vendored everything I killed, only trained essentials after lvl 32, sold 2 blue BoEs I found (about 5 g each) and still only got my mount at 42.
---
Would it be bad if I said I'm making a 39 twink because I like the bracket, but also because I want access to the other eng branch, as well as a third daily transmute?
---
I plan on having a 60 rogue for pick pocket farming, smelting/mining dark iron and getting 265 alchemy for trasmute, my main ele shaman will have goblin for sappers and transmute, and finally my 39 twink/banker for a third transmute.
---
Plenty to keep me occupied and stock up on arcanite / dark iron.
---
It will turn into farming lvl 48s of the opposite faction, since that will be the fastest honor/hour xD
---
July 16th
---
So?  It's a fifteen year old game.  Who cares if a guild clears a raid faster than you, or ranks up in PVP faster?
---
Thank you, saved
---
People in your raid could randomly one-shot an npc and kill weeks of ranking progress as a result in Vanilla. This being in Classic would be a result of No Changes.
---
Back in vanilla, the reason they changed AV was because a majority didn't like the design of AV and complained constantly. Which the creator of AV told people in an interview way back when hence the reason they decided to change it.
---
So I think that's one of the reasons players that played back then doesn't really care now.
---
Beautiful
---
I never even considered getting a flask on my twink.  Too much of a cost, even if I would be able to push over 4k HP.
---
Actually, don't flasks have a minimum use level of like 45 or 55?
---
I can't wait to experience this phase by phase, hopefully they take it slow
---
Tbh there will always be people saying shit like this in reddit comments. It's the closest thing they'll get to having a clever insult.
---
Zoomer logic lol  mmorpgs weren't created to speedrun silly kid.
---
Isn’t general rule of thumb to do that at least two weeks in advance? We still have time unless you work at some place that has fierce competition for time off during the summer.
---
I want to see an Ironman guild of no talent points spent, white gear wearing insaniacs clearing MC.
---
Yeah, that's my idea.
---
Lttrash has a lot of private server gameplays that are very funny if your looking for comedic videos
---
That’s how it was lol. Try not to piss off anyone so they’ll do this ?
---
Yeah, it’s called TBC’s Honor System.
---
YESS!!
---
I am mega stoked about phase 2, I have really wanted that.  It was easily the most fun I had World PvPing during vanilla, and would love at least a phase to relive that experience.  I am glad there was enough support for that phase, because it didn't seem like it was all to important to most interested in classic when I had brought it up.
---
It's almost as if people back then didn't know what they were doing!
---
I'd guess around 100g, give or take depending on some minor things like how much grinding you did, where, what bags you got, how often you stopped back in town, how much you mailed to alts and AH'd, etc. I was able to get around 100g at level 42 or so on my last character while leveling LW, which is a bit of a money sink compared to just skinning/vendoring, and leveling first aid.
---
At worst, find good grinding spots by level 37, empty your bags and just plow through the next 3 levels with straight mob grinding. If you do it in the right areas, you can get 20g+/hr very easily, and you'll still be getting decent XP.
---
To be fair, if you manage to no life Rank 14 in the expected few month with just hillsbrad, the more power to you.
---
What does having a rank provide you?
---
otoh, the epic battles that build up in random places are fun as all hell to participate regardless of level!
---
Not all enemy-faction NPCs are DK's.  You can kill guards and most vendors and stuff and they aren't DK's.  If you want DK's, you genuinely have to try to get them.
---
Yeah to be fair it's pretty unrealistic lol
---
you ask because of mount? there are enough farming guides for lvl 40 mount. 
---
and yes people must go grinding and save Gold.
---
Yes they will, and it will be glorious
---
Feint death + engeneering rezz tool
---
Fuck
---
Exploiting? How tf would you exploit honor when there's diminishing returns on honor gained from killing the same player. This is a complete non-issue. You could make a point with wintrading in BGs, but not of trading kills for honor points.
---
Get a clue about how the honor system works before putting on your tinfoil hat.
---
Really disagree, the pvp rollout is full of problems and very disappointing. The zergfest 1.12 AV, straight to upgraded pvp gear even though pve gear is not getting updated till a later phase, removing (yay!) and then bringing back dishonor kills (boo!), and no world pvp objectives until the very end where they can be irrelevant all over again.
---
I'm not sure how you think they will exploit it, could you clarify? Obviously they will push to rank fast, but that's not exploiting..
---
Heavily depends on the time frame we're talking. If the server is 1-2 years old you'll be able to make a solid amount via herbing or selling green/blue stuff for alts. Definitely 100g+ by lvl 40. But if your talking about a fresh server, well it's gonna be rough. Just from questing and vendoring stuff I found myself to have like 30-50g at lvl 40.
---
I'll be 60 within a few weeks, and play druid.
---
Which areas would u recommend?
---
Was going to say the same. Toolkit is the same minus swiftmend- mana is more due to hotw... Efficiency wise may be what they meant, for linger fights (and I'd agree) but even as such you have consumes and innervate so it isn't like you go oom and that is that
---

---
Community: surprised pikachuface
---
In Vanilla player servers there are gank crews (sometimes 20+ people) who will sit outside dungeons and mind control you away from the entrance so you can't even corpse run to the dungeon.  
---
BRS can be impossible to get into sometimes.
---
Cool, hope they have fun doing it.
---
I hope that this is at least on their radar and they're coming up with clever solutions. I especially hope they've got ideas on how to maintain faction balance.
---
Oh noe please let it be in 2019
---
Being 60 won't save you from being Mind Controlled, and force jumping off in to the giant pool of molten magma 100 feet below.
---
What part of #nochanges did you not understand?
---
Lol its fairly easy to track. Oh, you killed these 5 guys 5000 times? I really wonder what is happening here.
---
Also, anyone passing by can record it.
---
*Get to the da damn gyrocopter*
---
Seriously, even if you are number one, the sheer diminishing contribution / rank points would make it basically impossible, especially combined with the diminishing return on kills for the same 50-100 players.
---
The only way I can think that this would be possible is if you were on a lower pop server and you solo tagged each city leader while a raid killed them.  There was a post on it.
---
Basically that faction leader honor boosting is the only realistic way.  Shit even more reason now for my group to find a "low pop" server to get easy rank on.
---
Within the first day people have several gold to spend, not sure what game you are playing.
---
That was fast
---
I play it
---
All of the hardcore rankers are going to be forced to gank/camp everyone they come across in the world for 16-18 hours a day to compete for bracket 1 spots. The majority of the servers population will not bue 60 yet, and even if you are 60, it’s going to make doing anything in any level 50+ zone nearly impossible. There’s going to be gank squads running around in said zones all day everyday for 3 months until they’re Rank 14.  
---
Things are very different than they were in 2005 and ranking is much more calculated and the hardcore players will be relentless early on to farm the honor they need. Every flight path, zone entrance and other popular areas (Dire Maul, especially since it releases at the same time) are going to be hardcamped.
---
It took one day and half the night
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
If I tell you then people will try to steal my spots, it's pretty easy to find a couple decent ones though, just be thinking about it while you are leveling
---
The honor system has limited space at the top.  Rank 13 and 14 were achievable for the average player in vanilla without exploits with enough time and dedication.  So long as some players are hoarding the top slots using exploits, average players will be forced to use exploitative tactics to compete.  While top players are willing to risk their accounts to get these rewards, forcing an average player to assume that risk, let alone coordinate exploitative behavior, is to much to ask.
---
It’s because the phases are mimicking patches and AB came out later than AV and WSG.
---
This more than anything. Yes shamans and paladins bring their own flavour, but utility can be a lot of things. Mages bring food, water, teleports, CC, arguably way more useful than shamans totems or palas buffs.
---
It was before AQ, but still valid.
---
Seems very unlikely. It's basically impossible to get rank 12 let alone rank 14 before bgs are out. There literally isn't enough lvl 60s in the world to kill. The vast majority of lvl 60s will be in instances or idling in cities. Even if every lvl 60 in the world was lined up for you to kill over and over again I doubt you could get rank 12. You get sweet FA honor for killing lowbies. Best you can hope for pre bgs is rank 6 or 7 if you just pvp for 12 hours everyday - so pretty obviously a waste of time.
---
So yeah, the level of coordination and commitment to get to rank 12 before bgs are out would be immense and it would be absurdly easy to detect and stop for even 1 GM on a realm.
---
You mean the losers who play every day need to feel their lifeless gaming addiction is justified by farming people who care less than them about a fucking 15 year old video game experience.
---
For real. I'm about to buy a house. Guess I'll just never sleep.
---
Hmm maybe replied to wrong person? I didn't mention flasks or twinks - and yea that would be crazy to flask a twink lol
---
Built a fairly decent system for Overwatch when it came out- Rx480 16gb ram- forget my processor but it was menial at best. But it can run them private servers on max settings all day Oooo yeaaa
---
&gt;If you don't like something then that's fine. Don't stop other people from having it.
---
I couldn't agree more. It's the same argument us Vanilla fans had with the retail community for years: it doesn't take anything away from them to let others have something different. Now folks here want to act just like the retail folks. SMH.
---
Everyone has that iconic experience they really remember, and I had so many of them in Vanilla...but I also had many in TBC.

Not really since there is no reinforcement cap like there was later on.

\&gt;Also I've repeated many times but honor system was stupid 15 years ago and it's even more stupid nowadays 
---
Well listen here you little shi-

\&gt;so WoW classic will be a purely PvE game for me 
---
Oh. Okay. Proceed.

Don’t you get diminishing returns on honor gains from killing the same person over and over...
---
Teach me how to be leet lazor turkey pl0x!

Swede here. I reckon there's going to be quite a few of us.
---
"You think you do, but you don't"  don't prove them right
---
I only leveled one class to 60 back in actual vanilla and I played around a lot back then while leveling so I can't really base my answer on that (mostly because I don't remember). BUT on pservers without professions and item upgrades via AH I usually got to around 50g-70g at 40. The reason it fluctuated \~20g were simply because you could get a few good greens or blues while leveling that you could sell pretty easily.
---
People that doesn't think about making gold while leveling won't afford a mount at 40, which is the reason people no-lifing to 60 as fast as possible sometimes (depending on classes) gives gold to their friend because they themselves have ghost wolf or travel form.
---
I'm actually fearing this release because it's going to suck me in totally and I have too much going on to allow that to happen.
---
Also, if on a PvP server, having a friend around increases survivability and accordingly decreases downtime from dying and corpse runs.
---
Most people have a single gold to spend around level 15/20
---
Why buy a 13/17dps wand for 1G when you can get a vendor one for 33s/58s?
---
Pepperidge Farm Remembers
---
Saw a guide about grinding cats in Swamps of Sorrow. They drop teeth which vendor pretty well and if your a skinner you'll make a decent buck on top. Personally I'm not the big grinding fan. I'll rather quest to lvl 43-44 without a mount. But, yeah I always played a class which has free mount a speed skills. I'm definitely guilty for choosing a class that gets a free mount or has speed enhancing spells like Hunter, Druid or Shaman.
---
Even from 2004, there was no "wrong way" to play, if you were having fun.  Mmorpgs from their initial design, aren't about speed running the game, but the actual experience with players within the world.  People that have deviated from this, might as well leave the genre and play single player games.

Lmfao
---
I bet some PvE servers back then had better PvP than some PvP servers. Like my PvP server, for instance... ;\_; just depends on the community
---
Constantly swapping groups around. If you don't do this you aren't a true hardcore min-maxer.
---
I've been waiting for this post.
---
Trolls in north stv
---
Organized PServer Guild clear mc+ony in 1 day, later they do mc,bwl and onyx in one raid 19-23. Yo doubt you will have an issue finding a guild if you are somewhat geared early on. 
---
Good luck man!
---
Why not though? It's an extremely arbitrary and stupid bottleneck. 8 tanks is hilariously dumb design.
---
If you actually sell green drops on the AH then you will have plenty of gold. Don’t just vendor them. That’s actually it. The secret is revealed.
---
I'm so ready for classic to fuck my life. I do wonder if my two year old could heal for me
---
I'm not going to lie, that sounds like a good time to me. It will be nice for some people to be the bad guys, gives us all a challenge and a reason to improve.
---
I forget, what to DHK's even do? Anything?
---
Does this mean PvP title rewards are a thing in classic?
---
Holy shit, what year is it?
---
&gt;The weaklings are there to justify the strong
---
That's a great way to put it.
---
Your points on TBC make it sound like you out-leveled your 60 epics and got bitter.  A lot of your criticism I find very odd, especially:
---
* That TBC zones were only one color (so were most Vanilla zones)
---
* That people didn't hang around in cities (in my experience, they did)
---
* That you did a few dungeons and quit (TBC had the overall best end-game PvE experience this game has ever had)
---
The fact you want Classic WoW and then tell me I can't have Classic TBC makes you worse than anyone who says we should only have BFA (or whatever expansion is latest) and not Classic.  Because not only are you preventing others from playing what they want, but you're a hypocrite as well.
---
I'm 30 and married and going crazy in anticipation for WoW classic. It's okay OP, just because you are married does not mean you have to give up your passions and hobbies.
---
I never played mages, so I missed some things. Thanks!
---
Quest and/or grind off the old beaten path then.  There are spots in every level range where you’ll see VERY few other players.  If you’re terrified of being corpse camped to the point of not being able to enjoy yourself, then find those spots.  If you insist on leveling through all the hotspots like STV, EPL, Winterspring, etc. then expect to get ganked while doing so.
---
I think so too, no one knew back in the day, most people went with a recommended server, or the server their friends were on (which was a recommended server). It said 'Normal' so most people went with that. Lots of people on them were super into PvP or got super into PvP.
---
ughhh possibly.
---
Not ganna delete the comment, that's the coward's way out.
---
Considering the fact that everyone knows that there’s only a handful of R14 spots per week and it’ll take a few months to even get there to begin with, I doubt the guilds that will try to require you to hit R14 will either be or stay at “top guild” status.
---
It's not like it's weird to have 1 shadow priest per raid. Shadow weaving easily makes up for slightly less personal dps.
---
Yes. I believe the number is 25 kills and there is no more honor from that player inside I want to say 24 hour window. It decreases from 1 progressively
---
I can hear Mr. Krabs’ feet in this picture
---
And I'm here to deliver.
---
&gt;Oh, you killed these 5 guys 5000 times?   
---
You get 0 honor after 10 kills. I think it's 50% decay after every kill.
---
The Pally and Shaman ones are very popular for pvp'ers. The others are basically all somewhere between ok and terrible, but it's quite possible by AQ you're still using some pretty low level/crappy gear from MC or blues that 2.5 still will be an upgrade for.  
---
It's not like you just decide you don't want any 2.5. It drops and your options are sharding it or giving it to someone for a small upgrade.
---
Real talk.
---
Yeah, I know. I want him to elaborate on his position.
---
AB came out later than AV and WSG. This is fine.
---
You're an idiot.  Please stay far away from classic.
---
I am a Night Elf Tank on private servers. You can get similar TPS as human pre thunderfury if you go daggers since there is good gear woth + dagger skill. There are Night Elf tanks in the highest level of guilds. Most warriors and rogues are human but you can still do just fine. Now all the daggers and axes that drop are actually welcome loot. 
---
But dwarf priest makes a far bigger difference. You need 1 in your raid. Simple as that. It is completely fine to pick another race. But dont make a post that pretends the difference between races is minimal or human is somehow better because of measly spirit bump. 
---
Just be honest, you are picking race based on aestthetic/RP reasons. Dont try to justify it by pretending fear ward isnt as useful as it is.
---
Flight masters are level 55 elites, so low level players will have a hard time killing them. But the idea would be that if you see some horde killing your flight masters, you call your alliance buddies to help defend. Maxed out characters will still have stuff to do in low level zones, like quests and leveling gathering profs, rare spawns, rare niche items, helping their friends/guildies, etc.
---
If you are a 60 and chill out in Ashenvale defending the flight master, that will really help out your faction for example.
---
Haha!  Well, to be fair - druids have an easier time getting rag-viable before the bwl patch than warriors since their Ragnaros set is obtainable outside of MC (save for a couple of specific pieces).  Warriors don't have access to dark iron armor until like patch 1.6 or something insanely late, so their need to be defense capped and have a 200+ FR is super hard without some lucky dungeon drops/rolls.   
---
I was feral in my guilds on the big private servers, and was the tank for all rag kills.  Feral charge negates the knockbacks entirely (and not having to stance dance to do them and risk a 1-shot) and you can hit FR CAP without sacrificing too much armor and health, which makes most of the damage negligible.  In the off chance you do get knocked back, you can shift to cat form and take very little fall damage (another tank-killer in that fight).  All-in-all, they're a pretty convenient tool for early MC progression.  Once warriors actually get the drops they need, it very quickly shifts in their favor, but pre-buff MC loot is pretty terrible, and almost all of the FR pieces come in that second wave.
---
If you never wanted Dishonorable kills to be in Classic in the first place, then were you ever really on the #nochanges bandwagon to begin with?
---
I see. Which classes have a terrible set?
---
This sounds amazing.  The terror of the horde invasion...
---
I think a lot of guilds will be often running close to 8 warriors.  They do incredibly high dps, especially in Naxx gear, and I think will without a doubt be the most played class.  The benefit this time around is that guilds already know before the game launches that they need 8 tanks for 4H.  I think for most, it came as a surprise during retail and they had to scramble to poach/recruit/gear tanks for the fight.
---
Your post is exactly why blizz made naxx in Wotlk.
---
It’s already been done.
---
NoChanges is a mindset that wants classic to exist exactly as it did in vanilla.  The person you asked to elaborate has this mindset.  The person they responded to wants vanilla, but with changes.
---
For those not looking to actively rank, they are still going to kill NPC's left and right.
---
What about Battle Masters in the main cities though!?! This post was awesome, but that last detail is conspicuously missing!
---
Will they be there at the start? Or will you have to go to Ashenvale to queue up for WSG?
---
Bring the ilvl, not the player/class***
---
Considering how endgame the 4 Horsemen are, I don't think a nerf is necessary. There has to be rocks on the road and this bossfight is certainly of those big frigging rocks. 
---
Plus I remember when testing this with my guild on a private server testrealm, we used 3 fury offtanks in def gear and were able to down them.
---
How do you think the release date will be announced?  Do you think it is going to be a random blue post on the forums one day that the game releases on July 32nd?  Or do you think they will announce it some other way?
---
2.5 hour podcast*
---
Yes, you will miss one time events you are not able to attend.  
---
No word on realm refreshments.
---
&gt;Exactly, it's a game. Try yelling racial slurs in a soccer game or a cricket game and see what happens.
---
It happens all the time, recently at the Juventus game where the fans where yelling racial slurs at the striker. Open racism is happening around us all the time.
---
&gt;If you're muted you aren't my problem.
---
Exactly, there is ignore for that to mute my talk. No need for extra supervision. In the real world I just ignore people who yell stuff at me that isn't nice.
---
Then they'll be behind the phases, no different than someone who fell behind or joined late in vanilla.
---
but... nobody else has gold to buy those green drops.
---
Blizz: "You fuckers wanted Vanilla? That's what you get."
---
No way.  While it would be awesome to have a raid go from town to town it would create a really toxic environment.  Rogues cant be allowed to just go kill any Npc they want...
---
Wall-jumping isn’t possible anymore so that won’t happen.
---
No. They have silver... lots of it
---
As 1/2 of a Druid/Rogue duo, this won't really be that big of an issue for us, but man I feel for everyone else who are not paladins.
---

Step 3. Profit!
---
What a stupid comment. lil stupid
---
No, that was retadin protagonist. Kiljoy was the warrior in full valor gear who would leap into frame shouting “ARCANITE REAPER HOOO”.
---
In this iteration, people will be farming capital cities.
---
http://itemization.info/
---
mine will be 4 soon, and he's already shown interest...
---
no it wasn't.
---
I can't lie, I've been thinking a lot about this and am trying to decide if I'm even going to play classic wow. I enjoyed it back in the day but it really did take over my entire life growing up
---
Fresh and TBC likely
---
GMs need to start ganking high level players one week in then to simulate the experience.
---
IF you were going to try and fix this fight (huge if) the better solution would be to make sure that other non-warrior tanks were functional here. Survivability really isn't a problem, the direct damage to the tank from them is not huge, the problem is the tank swaps, and the need for taunt. If there was some way for paladins and shaman to grab agro with ES or Exorsicm reliably, you could just use existing raid members rather than being forced to stack.
---
Wowwiki has a theory that the marks are also a agro reducer, so it's possible if the fight is implemented correctly, then coming in and pulling off the existing marked tank with ES/Exorsim is doable. However it's hard to compete with the reliability of taunt. Making them taunt immune + making sure the marks reduce agro could open up the opportunity for other off-specs to be part of the tank rotation. 
---
Ultimately though I think the best approach to much of the raid content is wait-and-see, not to rush to make changes based on the private server experience.
---
&gt; it's quite possible by AQ you're still using some pretty low level/crappy gear from MC 
---
This is why you run ZG/AQ20 tho.
---
Burning Crusade.
---
Depends on the ratio you have of contributors to benefactors and the number of characters they have to contribute.  Assuming 5 player contributors, 5 characters per account and res times as short as 2 mins each, 1 player could receive 75 honorable kills in 6 mins.
---
This would have been so cool. Allow Draenei to be Rogue/Hunter/Shaman/Warlock/Mage. Maybe priest, kept warrior off because it seems out of place and would keep them parallel with Belfs. Could have kept the Paladin/Shaman dichotomy going between factions too! It was a nightmare to balance though to be sure, so I understand why they made that addition. 
---
Side note/unsolicited unpopular opinion: the way to add shaman/paladins to both factions should have been through Dwarves/Undead respectively.
---
Like many have said, doesn't matter your age or anything. Everyone plays this game.
---
I lol’d
---
It is. That guy's an idiot.
---
TBC was fucking sick. I wasn't around for vanilla, but I leveled 1-70 in the middle/end of tbc and totally loved it. I've heard class/spec balance is a LOT better than classic wow, I liked it since they made hybrid classes better, meaning they had more than one viable role
---
Hunters have a spell power set which is pretty bad unless they have a strange fascination with arcane shot.  I think all the healing classes sets are geared towards other specs, so aren’t desirable for healing.  The warrior set is geared more towards dps than tanks, although I do remember a lot of tanks wanting the shoulders for threat.  Warrior T3 is tanking oriented, so your dps warriors are going to be more interested in T2.5 or just random offset pieces.
---
They already are
---
Just tell them. My main tank for pre BIS was a Druid and we just rolled against each other. Just open and if people are douche bags about best to sort that out before anyway
---
It got pretty bad there for a while.   You just had to skip southshore while leveling.  It stayed that way from a month or two after launch until battlemasters.
---
You and I both brother.
---
I don’t think there’s a noticeable qualitative difference between communities for each faction. Definitely not one that’s consistent across all servers.
---
I don’t think horde has more mature players, or ally has more funny players, or any shit like this. Everyone who says they know only has their own biases and anecdotal evidence to go off of.
---
Now what if they were the Guild Leader?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bayra9/ret_paladin_but_theyre_also_the_guild_leader/
---
They should limit getting DKs to certain spots so that city raiding is fine but killing quest npcs is punished
---
lol 
---
"He was lying, throwing his hands, saying stuff like, 'I didn't do it, I didn't do it,' you know, how rogues do..."﻿
---
I'm really considering waiting a week or so after launch to weed out the bugs, server crashes, and hype before starting.
---
Server list! I need my RP-PvP realm!
---
pve server ———-&gt;
---
Zandalar cloth is pretty cool too. I like the feather shoulders.
---
Bringing DHKs back is the dumbest possible thing they could have done.
---
I’ve had very much the opposite experience, usually the edge kids spreading toxicity were on horde. But yeah, its definitely on both sides, and faction really doesnt have anything to do with it.
---
I agree with shaman or paladin but low key also druid or warlock
---
definitely not a good idea to incentivise them and reward it though lol
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMMlWvLJBtQ&amp;t=15794s
---
I assume there is a way to reset that
---
You will have plenty of danes to play with. I'm going to start classic with a bunch of friends (danes) - just make sure to check this subreddit before the actual launch :) I'm sure either I or them are gonna make sure to gather as many danish people on one server as possible
---
Lmao good riddance
---
Did I read it wrong?
---
Thought they said ranks wont work until phase 2 as well or not be counted?
---
Isn’t that how classic was?
---
Mages bring way more utility in total. If talking about combat only, it could be shaman or paladin, but mages bring food, water, teleports, CC etc, which really come together way more valuable than totems or buffs.
---
&gt; so WoW classic will be a purely PvE game for me
---
then play on a pve server where they can't attack you?
---
"content creators" lul
---
That’s an odd argument. I guess they scrapped many other bad ideas as well.
---
It really isn't. 
---
I love WPvP, but what happens on pservers between honor patch and BG patch is not WPvP.
---
These people will not touch anyone that doesnt give them honor, they'll just sit infront of a flight master waiting for the next guy to kill.
---
If people gather up to fight them, they'll just run away and go to a different zone.
---
WoW was growing well into Wrath. Anyone who played pre cata probably has a fairly similar likelihood of being interested in classic.
---
T2.5 for rogues has a lot of really good pieces. Warlocks have very good pieces as well. Druids hunters shamans and pallys dont really need them for pve content iirc because they are itemized for hybrid builds. Mages gear is meh I think 1 items is bis at that point. Warrior 2.5 I know shoulders are bis for dps warriors I think the rest is meh for fury but some tanks will want a good amount of 2.5 because at that point they might be fury tanking and  2.5 has excellent stats for fury tanks. No clue if priests need them I think 2.5 is shadow gear but I dont remember well.
---
Naw, do it right :)
---
https://youtu.be/JSUIQgEVDM4
---
True, I was thinking of it from a purely in-combat perspective, but from a broader view mages are definetly the utility class.
---
&lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at Crimsoneagle#3839 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly
---
That’s how it was in Vanilla
---
Yep this decision shows Blizzard is out of touch with the current Vanilla meta. They’re basically ignoring the existence of private server communities instead of learning from them how the game will be approached by many (e.g. rankers). Wonder if they’ll backpedal on this or just remain stubborn and force 50-60 levelers to have an excruciating time during phase 2.
---
I like PVP all the way!
---
Tarren mill vs Southshore here we come
---
Teen life:
---
Spending dozens of hours playing classic in your parents basement. 
---
Adult life:
---
Spending dozens of hours playing classic in your own basement.
---
I'm in a similar boat. I played on PvP server back in the day and loved it for the most part, but I do remember that at times it could be incredibly frustrating.
---
Now that I'm older and have significantly less time to play, I don't want to deal with repeated ganking but I don't want to miss out on world PvP either.
---
So no BGs till phase 3? I wasn't going to do any until I have pre-raid bis anyway so maybe I won't even notice.
---
What a coincidence, I told your gf the same!
---
Nat Pagle says fishin; is for sissies!
---
Aka blizzlike and not pirate server like. I feel like alot of people here were expecting Nostalrius 2.0 with classic release.
---
Leveling 50-60 during phase two will be an absolute nightmare. If not impossible.
---
This is against the rules and you can get perma banned.
---
I figured they would release server lists in conjunction with the release date. What it’s starting to look like imo
---
A Kobold will climb out of its tunnel and if it sees its shadow, it Classic releases in 6 weeks.
---
The ones that made Vanilla.
---
I really don’t think it’s going to go down like this. Nor is it a big deal on PvP servers. This will be one of the few times in WoW history where wpvp is a major factor and it should be embraced.
---
The delayed pvp stuff looks like it will be a problem. I can see many pvpers getting bored quickly. AB coming out with zg, I hope they love world pvp because that's gonna be it for awhile.
---
I think I was level 30, and I made it down to the AQ gate for the event. It was an incredible (although extremely laggy) experience.
---
I really like this approach, even though I admit I would've preferred to skip the first phase. I think some incentive for WPvP during leveling would have been good, but I'm okay with this.
---
I am still kind of bummed about 1.12 AV though.
---
Fantastic that they keep pumping out updates nonetheless!
---
Consistently around 60-80+ by the time I hit 40 regardless of tradeskills or class. It looks dire in the mid 30s, but I always seem to acquire a lot of gold in the late 30s. All that Scarlet Monastery money I guess.  Sometimes Ill go farm trash loot for an hour or two during level 39 and get all i need for mount. Never have I been so broke I couldn't get it right away.
---
I believe you can understand what OP is saying.
---
Oh hey it's Esfand.
---
People get the implication thats what i was implying.  I wasn't suggestion guilds would be grinding honor from eachother all day.  I'm suggesting guilds will have just a couple players they will have designated as honor sinks to recieve a couple hundred free honor kills each day in just a few minutes time to suppliment their honor grind.  All that requires is an opposing factions guild to log on all their level 60's just to die and resurrect to these honor sinks a couple times a day, minutes of investment.
---
Vendorstrike is my slave name
---
Yeah, I can live without it, but since we're using 1.12, some things are customized in their own unique way, so maybe that one could use an order change aswell.
---
So it will be essentially the same as now. (Just hopefully not with 15 years of wait)
---
1 batch of Classic realms, then several years for fresh launch?
---
First of all its a bannable offense. Second you only get honor for 10 kills/24h. The 9th kill only give 10%.
---
Hopefully players will default to the more populated zones so they become battleground-like and levelers won’t be constantly camped in every 50+ zone.
---
You’ll still get gear if you raid as a Ret lmao go home grumpy
---
No Dishonorable Kills means NPC's are fair game. The griefing is gonna be top notch. I'm excited.
---
This is wildly accurate 
---
Like wtf Blizz
---
I was doing good until the Classic announcement was made
---
This just in: People who engage in player versus player content are shitty people with terrible lives.
---
I'm fairly certain these are all in ashenvale except for mid, that does look like wsg. The left looks like the ruins the satyrs hang out around that are spread out around the zone.
---
Don’t really pay attention to other classes, but T2.5 shoulders are best in slot for warriors, both for fury dps and fury tank. 
---
Since it’s the best overall dps class and the best tank class it should usually be prioritized
---
When we get the non 1.12 version of AV.
---
Hey that's me!
---
You are a blessing to your friends
---
J Allen Brack is going to be reading the posts whining about phase 2 and smiling his ass off.
---
Rank 14 the ability to make others cower in fear of your gear and ability. *
---
That's probably what they are insinuation by saying:
---
&gt;so WoW classic will be a purely PvE game for me
---
Ret Prio EZ
---
Been looking for it. Want to go ahead and put my vacation request in rofl.
---
&gt;Why do people want everything to be as expensive as it was before?   
---
We’re literally asking for the game to be “as it was before” my dude
---
I’m disregarding all of your &gt;vanilla comments since they’re irrelevant.
---
Look at the trailer for WoW vanilla, and tell me PvP is not a big part of the game.
---
Anything over a 5 business days is 1 month + with supervisor approval.
---
For a new server, are you better off vendoring greens or worth disenchanting them for mats?
---
Dhk's are a thing so no. People will farm dire maul gates.
---
Neat
---
Yeah that’s not so bad I guess. If you get caught it’s prly bannable. Everyone has a capture card these days.
---
But it doesn’t mean we can’t hope!
---
If you're good, like REALLY good, no problem at all.  
---
There are a lot of tanks, but the problem is 80% of them don't know what they're doing.
---
I have no idea what long term plans they have for fresh realms, I would love to see them have a set of realms with rolling refreshes after a couple years staggered by a few months so there's a fresh one available readily.
---
Obviously that would require blizzard to be real clear about that rule set and what realms it applied to.
---
I did it during Vanilla: I think I got lvl48 (which was the minimal level to gain honor for lvl60 at that point) the day honor was put in place but I feel it's just a bad decision: it push people to rush level 60 before it's put in place to level (mostly) quietly and then take advantage of all the slower players.
---
DANMARK MASTER RACE
---
I made it to rank 9 and was moving up pretty quick... then the crossrealm bg's came and I couldn't keep up anymore :(
---
&gt; It happens all the time, recently at the Juventus game where the fans where yelling racial slurs at the striker.
---
I meant as a player. You will discover that the referee regulates your speech too when you are on the field. Oh no! Such oppressions! Not logical!
---
yikes you sound frustrated. I’m sure you’ll be on a pve server but if you weren’t i’d love to compound that frustration by tanking you.
---
Same, I'm just waiting for that release date to put vacation time in.
---
I’m cool with it!
---
Thanks dude, very useful!
---
Imo if your interested in warrior just bite the bullet and level it up. Remember it takes 200h to reach max so the 200h to level the warrior second is 200h you could be farming and gearing a warrior.
---
Yeah you can /pvp whenever you want. That doesn’t mean the other faction will...
---
Nope, Its the one where everyone runs past eachother becasue everything is nerfed.
---
Question, if you hit Rank 14, bought the weapons and then dropped back down to R13, can you still use them?
---
You have track humanoid in cat form. That plus stealth makes you the ultimate wpvp predator.
---
If you want to stealth raid a city in force, make a rogue friend or two. Bringing a healer along on a stealth mission can be very powerful.
---
Cheers! pinned for sure ;)
---
Can't...I'm going to be an undead rouge. I rolled alliance in vanilla.

Time to become the bane of my childhood's existence!

Looking for: a competitive PvE guild with mature, reliable people
---
Inspired by the legendary Pat PvP 2 video, I started playing WoW a year into Vanilla as a Tauren warrior named Macbain on Agamaggan. This go around, I'd like to see what it was like to be Alliance (I'm going to miss windfury so bad though!).
---
Since I began so late and played so much PvP, I only managed to clear MC, Ony, ZG, and AQ 20 on live as an off tank/dps warrior before TBC. I was in college then as well so I had little time to dedicate to the game. Despite my casual attitude then, I played far more than I should have, just like everyone else did at the beginning of the game. After earning my Tabbard of the Protector, I've played every expansion off and on with a range of classes but tend to enjoy the OG tanking master, warrior, the most. I long to rekindle those ancient days of the true glory of the warrior once again.
---
Throughout the course of WoW, I've become a highly experienced tank and would like to find and journey with adventurers of similar talents. I'm never absent or late, I don't stand in the fire, and I know the importance of min/maxing as a tank in Vanilla. But I also know that the real thing that sets apart competitive guilds in wow is guildmates' dedication to one another.
---
Lately, I've been playing a little on unnamed realms to get back that nostalgic feeling and to remember how to play during that bygone era.
---
I'd like to find a group of people that I can journey with throughout the course of Classic from questing on up as I miss the feeling of comeraderie that was inherent to Vanilla. Drama is something I work very hard to keep out of my life so I'd prefer to spend time with mature folks, especially if I'm going to sink real time into this game again. Ultimately, I'd like to clear Naxx someday with my time investment, a good bunch of people, and a whole lot of loyalty.
---
I live by routine, work full time, and have an exercise regimen that I take very seriously but other than that I have few real commitments.
---
If you think we could be friends, just send me a pm here on reddit.
---
Cheers, and I hope we meet someday soon in Azeroth!
---
No, they really won’t.
---
No, it'll be far, far more noticeable because unlike private servers PVP gankers will be ganking full time, not just in between BG queues (Since neither BGs nor queues will be in Official Classic at launch)
---
Why would you? Rets bring nothing unique to the raid and have garbage DPS. No guild will gear one before a warrior and you will be laughed out of PUGs.
---
Your "overly politically correct" is my "that racist dickhead can't be a racist dickhead without consequences and that is good". If you need the option to be a racist dick in order to feel comfortable and "trusted" I do not need or want you to feel either of those things.
---
And everyone saying anything without fear of getting banned leads to 8chan, not some kind of enlightened philosophy classroom.
---
Danskjävlar
---
I too make such fancy plans for my alts that never amount to anything.
---
What stat itemization is classic launching with?
---
Usually you don't have quite enough by 40, but usually have it by 45.
---
Makes most sense for most folks to go with Skinning until you get your mount, since so many mobs are skinnable.
---
Also I find that running every dungeon 1-3 times greatly helps with making a bit of gold plus drops plus a bit of xp too, along with meeting folks.
---
I'm laughing that you were the second post. Love what you do on Twitch.
---
They were back then so will be this time around I guess
---
My story sadly begins when I finally got a character to max lvl before a new expansion hit, which was good old MOP. At this time my friend was on ?Saurgars? and I was Ursin we crossed realmed and pvped on his server which was horde dominated at the time. We ventured to the Thunder Isle and just massacred any horde we came across. I was a 2 handed frost DK and he was a mist weaver monk and we had so much fun with so many rivals to we’re we ended up having 2v2 matches with the hordies. I only vividly remember this cause all the horde were getting so pissed and sending everyone they could muster to kills us and there was a lot of 2 v 5 situations that we would win. Once the WOD expansion came out we both quit due to the lack of World pvp especially on my dead pop server ursin. 
---
If any of you hordes remember me I was Darkscoobers and my friend was Sassymess 
---
Also, so god damn stoked for a classic release hurry up blizzzzzz
---
&gt;Thought they said ranks wont work until phase 2 as well or not be counted?
---
Exactly why it's going to be nuts. People won't be worried about DK's and just killing everything.
---
I don’t know about you, but I plan to PvP I. Phase 1 because it’s fun and I need the practice.
---
Not if you have a premade pillaging horde. Disciplined soldiers in formation is the key.
---
&gt;Blizz needs to make sure their servers are prepped. Phase 2 could be on of the greatest times in wow ever, or a complete powerpoint shit show.
---
I agree! I think Phase 2 is going to be absolutely nuts, was just talking about this on stream. I think that you're going to see big World PvP at different high traffic chokepoints on the map, namely Dire Maul and Blackrock Mountain
---
Hey esfand, go look at my guild application, kthx.
---
Maybe, I would really hope not. Because I do think it's probably better for the game if they update the PvP gear in Phase 5 as opposed to just drop it with the later version in Phase 2
---
Anyone else concerned about the ranked PvP gear? They said it would be 1.12 PvP rewards from the get go. This is worrisome as the 1.12 Rank 14 gear is much, much more powerful than the original PvP rewards. This would make rank 14 gear incredibly BIS from the release of Dire Maul until Naxx.  Imagine fighting a Naxx-geared player with Molten Core gear. 
---
Also, have they stated when raid/dungeon loot will be re-itemized? Because if we're working with the original itemization it's likely that many casters will opt to use 1.12 rank 10+ PvP gear in PvE because of the large spell damage increase in comparison to pretty much all the pre-itemized loot. Thoughts?
---
Ret pallies would like a word with you.
---
Polish
---
&lt;3
---
One classic spot for skinning farming at that level is the Shimmering Flats masses of Turtles/Scorpids/Basilisk with a nearby vendor
---
Also Tanaris coastline Turtles if already around/above 40 and want to make a bit of xp - with a nearby vendor at Steamweedle Port. Also Hinterlands turtles.
---
yes
---
so Esfand, tell us, your plan is full world pvp in phase 2?
---
Okay but you can just /ignore people who bother you.  Why should they get banned just for bothering you?
---
Are you really that sensitive?
---
ahh, so it is going back to true classic? I remember those hillsbrad days!
---
1.12 pvp gear is tuned for AQ40. It was updated around that time when the pvp folk complained they were roflstoped by AQ40 raiders.
---
T2.5 is pretty close to on part, purely number wise, to T2. It's mostly there to allow for alternate builds/playstyles from what I can tell.
---
We are both going human. I was thinking after lvl 20 or so for a couple of reasons. First being that those early on levels are usually somewhat easy and second being that solo might be faster during that segment which would be important to try to ahead of the pack asap.
---
I said:
---
&gt;  that sounds like a good time to me. 
---
You said:
---
&gt;It really isn't.
---
I understand that it might not be fun for you, but it really **does** sound like fun for me. And yes I have experienced world PvP like that, and yes it really is fun for me to have a nearly impossible challenge to fight. It makes the world feel alive and the game a lot more fun.
---
Then there is that one Murloc placed right next to the road in STV that blizzard just pilot there to fuck with people.
---
Because there’s a lot of gear that warriors don’t want that’s rets want, plus your tier sets. Sure you won’t get onslaught girdle but there’s still plenty of gear for rets
---
Phase 2 is very unlikely to happen in 2019 even if it comes out in July
---
I'm a 2x gladiator and the last thing I care about is going back to play old PvP like it's brand new again.
---
But hey, if no lifting a remaster is for you, enjoy that. Just remember that putting time into something most people don't care about doesn't make you any good.
---
I was in TB's guild in cata, was good times.
---
Can't believe he's gone though, he was one of my favourite youtubers.
---
PvP on a PvP server? Is that not exactly what you wanted? 
---
You can always join us over here on the PvE servers if its too much for you.
---
good luck
---
General rule of thumb is to buy 1000 at a time. They come in stacks of 200 I believe
---
350 dps intead of 400 in prebis, literally unplayable.
---
Also, retribution is not a class
---
DK's only count against a single week's honor-&gt;rank points calculation, right?
---
31/0/20 is the shit. i call it "warlock's best friend," due to shadow weaving + giving them power infusion for the shadowbolt spam. it's also a great example of build diversity even in classic. between 21/30/0, 31/20/0, 31/0/20, 26/25/0, and the 16/0/35~ (dependent on choice of talents ofc) specs, priest had so many different builds and i loved it.
---
Haha!  Love it!
---
I hope phase 2 lasts a good 6 months.
---
I prefer the real battle for Azeroth. Can´t wait.
---
Warlock - Curses, SS, HS, Fear, Blood Pact, Summons etc.
---
Honestly I don't want any of that and I don't think it's good. It's super easy for a group of friends or discord to pick a server on launch day, but I doubt blizzard wants a massive portion of the community all picking 1 server in advance, which will happen. Unless they plan on putting hard caps on servers (and preventing people with playing with friends, aka 0% chance of happening) then it's just going to lead to more and massive faction imbalance imo.
---
Fair point.
---
I don't know how this is possible actually, a year ago I leveled a character from 33 to 39 by only grinding (rested XP) these Hyenas with good loot in Desolace, selling all loot and skinning every single one, and I made myself like 70 Golds. I don't know how you can go further than that :o At this level range, 1à G/hr seems the absolute max you can get from personal experience, and that is if the spots aren't overpopulated.
---
20 G/hr by grinding at level 40 doesn't seem plausible tbh, that would mean that level 60s farming these mobs twice faster would make 40+ G/hr which simply doesn't happen. That's Mara farm amounts. I think a level 40 learning all his spells will hardly break the 40G bar if he plays the game normally.
---
Sorry, this post was removed because it is not specifically recognizable as Classic related beyond the post title (Rule #7).
---
yeah i haven’t played since vanilla. don’t care about new iterations of wow. happy to gank you in the game i played and is the subject of this forum though.
---
Looks liek you might need to *get down to business, to defeat the Horde*
---
Knees weak, mom's spaghetti
---
He's got spaghetti on his spaghetti already
---
Mom's spaghetti
---
Dishonorable kills tho. Rip ranking.
---
I agree. I mean, as someone who played in retail vanilla on a pvp server where the opposite faction far outnumbered us, yes, sometimes flight paths got camped. It was frustrating at time, but that was just part of the game and it resulted in your faction coming to help. I miss world pvp like that.
---
Good Lord when I read the PvP rollout I started imagining places like Ashenvale, Hillsbrad and especially STV...Good God STV. I'm already sending out my thoughts and prayers to all those who are slow levelers rolling on PvP servers. May the Lord be with you, lol
---
Stealth into a city. Climb somewhere high and difficult to access. Starfire flagged lowbies out of nowhere. Root people out of nowhere. If in stormwind, jump in the canal, aquatic form and escape. Rinse and repeat.
---
Similarly, sit on a boat in booty bay. Root people who try to get on just as the boat leaves. Jump into the water and swim away to escape aggro. Rinse and repeat.
---
Stealth fear other druids. 
---
Use moonfire+travel form to kite flight masters or quest mobs (may not work)
---
If you have engineering, stealth and the mind control helm can be fun. 
---
Be the Druid version of Angwe, but with the added escapability or tankiness. Make yourself a world boss for lowbies. With bear form and regular heals, you won't die quickly. 
---
You can still sneak into cities and kill people, by but can't really stunlock/2 shot people as a feral like you can a rogue. Likewise you can't sap spam (I used to love doing that to people) or vanish. You are very good at escaping though. 
---
We sound scary similar. Only reason I've got any ideas is because I've thought about this too.
---
Dishonorable kills shouldn't be a thing in capital cities. While I agree, quest hubs should be protected.
---
One can only dream
---
&gt; I’m a little afraid a super long phase 2 will kill of a lot of the tourists in the process of becoming stayers.
---
You don't want these tourists playing PvP anyways. 
---
This is why BfA gets so many weird PvP changes because nobody who plays current WoW knows what the fuck they want.
---
IDK, take a look at OSRS. Don’t think anyone thought it would grow how is has over the last 5 or so years.
---
Utroligt jeg ikke har set the great Danes nævnt nogen steder, det var en af de stabile og bedste danske guilds!
---
Dane checking in here too, definitely coming for classic and hoping to see quite a few others do so too, looking forward to doing the whole community building again :)
---
Dammit, another one of these and the hunter is still allowed to hold the knife, lol
---
Because 17.5 dps at lvl 13 is better than 13.4 at lvl 15. You are welcome.
---
That must have been great, he was a true force of nature.
---
This "[Addictd to \[EPIX\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNRWvabBRDc)" video was the first time I saw him and eventually began relying on his "WTF is..?" and reviews to find worthwhile games to play - he had such a great way of framing things even if you didn't completely agree it was entertaining and inspiring to hear him go on a tangent
---
There is a PvE server option, and back in vanilla a LOT of people played on PvE servers, myself included. You have the option of flagging up when you want a fight, and you can fight other people who are flagged up. The whole flagging system works really well, and I wish people appreciated it more.
---
Ah. Well worst case scenario you can take 5 business days off at launch then another vacation a month or two later?
---
Same &gt;&lt;. I literally have a pretty decent raise that I will be able to get after I claim my PTO that I put off last year for this release haha. 
---
(Oh god I'm a loser...) xD
---
.... Julember 33rd*
---
Play on a PvE realm then? World PvP will be prevalent no matter what phase we're in. If you don't like it, don't play on a PvP server.
---
Do you keep the R3 discount for life once you get it once or do you need to maintain R3 to keep the discount?
---
It's always the GM too
---
&gt; I’m disregarding all of your &gt;vanilla comments since they’re irrelevant.
---
So you are cherrypicking and disregarding legitimate arguments to fit your own agenda instead of having a decent discussion and give proper arguments. I also did not say PvP is not a big part of the game but that PvE is and will always be the bigger part.
---
Fine.
---
Still, give me proper counter arguments for this: why is it that pvp was essentially an afterthought? A proper pvp system didn't come into the game until 1.4 and BGs didnt join the game until 1.5. 
---
In terms of balance PvP had always taken the backburner, even in Vailla. PvE has always been the focus and, especially with announcement trailers the PvE parts were always more prominent. Most itemization changes were done in order to balance them for PvE, resulting in sometimes busted items in PvP(that applies to almost any expansion by the way).
---
Wow! Congrats on having a dog!
---
&gt;World PvP objectives in Silithus and Eastern Plaguelands  
---
Thanks I'm taking a 2 week vacation at launch to power level, hopefully I can secure a spot by then.
---
Oof she doesn’t know what’s coming.
---
If the server is new, there won't be anybody who'll be buying Enchanting mats at competitive prices anyway, especially as there will be many enchanters saturating the market with disenchanted green loots from leveling. Enchanting is a massive gold sink in general.  Better sell the greens, outside of maybe some cheap cloth pieces that won't sell for much.
---
&lt;/3
---
No, trust me. Blizzard has always listened to the casual player base much more than "the 1%". They don't need the hardcore players to speak for them. Please see, overwatch, hearthstone, Diablo 3, StarCraft 2, and progressively every single watered down WoW expansion.
---
By waiting a day, yes.
---
I hope this means the next blog-post is about release. PvP and PvE has been covered. Outside of events, I don't see much of a reason to make another blogpost unless they want to info-dump a lot of technical stuff to us. 
---
Other than that I feel like the next big news-dump that'll get people excited is *hopefully* the release day. 
---
Like damn I don't care if it is late august, I just *wanna-know* already so I can obsess about that specific day..
---
Are they going to have diminishing returns on cc?
---
Yup. However, AQ event is just a frozen still of a giant Anubis warrior walking up to you one frame, then you dead at the spirit healer the next frame. Then you disconnect. Worth it.
---
Yeah I saw a lot of people want to play Warriors, hopefully they're planning on DPSing.
---
Thank you sir!
---
I’m just able to so much more effectively plan around it this time at least.  Right now I’m putting a ton of effort into getting everything in order because I know once classic hits I’m MIA for minimum two months.
---
You gain Honorless Target when you land though.
---
And then another 14 weeks of raid lockouts with nothing new.
---
What asinine assumptions, 5 characters per account at level 60 lol.
---
Bitch they might be
---
Plot twist. His other hand has thunderfury.
---
Be R3 or above to get the discount.
---
It would be kind of tough to do right now without know exactly how the api will work.
---
Phase 2 literally sounds like the end of days on a PvP server. We're talking putting the "WAR" in Warcraft
---
Right? I'm dying here. I'm betting it'll be during some trip or work event already scheduled -_-
---
Yeah, I agrew with you. I did abuse it and was a dick. Probably shouldn't allow me to do it again haha.
---
&gt; There are better solutions to the problem it was designed to solve. Don't let civilians chase, make them immune, make them respawn extremely fast, or any number of other options.
---
None of those solutions are vanilla-like.
---
Which will be terrible for people wanting to rank up.  Want to participate in the SS vs. TM pvp raids?  Well then expect to get hit with nonstop penalties from DKs.  Lots of low levels will be there dying and giving you DKs.  
---
You'll be forced to pvp only in high level zones where large scale pvp isn't really a thing early on.
---
Honest question doe...who gets priority for sulfuras?
---
Remember this comment in November 2019 when this sub is filled with QQ of rankers stopping anyone 50+ from leveling.
---
Use an invisible pot and hope they don't have detects invis on.
---
So it needs to be raid v raid. Which can also be tracked. Literal non issue imo
---
What items does Ret have priority on, because I certainly don't remember any, at least from Ony/MC. And you definately won't get any tier pieces if there are holy paladins that need it.
---
i cant believe blizzard is actually doing all this right. holy crap
---
You can only track 1 resource at a time. So either herb or mining on the mini map
---

Scroll down to champions gear. iLVL 63 is old blue set, iLVL 66-71 is updated one.
---
I know the first audio mod I'm putting in the game lmao.
---
Adorable, we were just a bit older but not with a long shot, those were the days!
---
Very few servers will have equal faction populations. Better hope your faction is the more popular one or else prepare to be camped for the 3 hours a week you can play on Sundays.
---
LOL this is perfect
---
yes yes and yes
---
Ah, you right dog, you right.
---
you need to join a pvp guild (or just a guild) and group up with ppl that quest too so you won't be an easy victim, or higher level ppl to protect you and establish control over the territories. So you'd level in the territories your faction has control you and protect you form. 
---
its gonna be a mad fun and the actual war in the world. 
---
If lets say some guild of the other faction farms honor in some territory locating there, you could just avoid it the world is quite big, there can't be this highere level hard ganking everywhere. its just not visible.
---
and in some zones there gonna be your faction control where they farm honor, and in some zones there gonna be a constant brawl where ppl go to farm honor, cos they know other faction highlevel ppl come here aswell.
---
btw we don't know what server pop gonna be still. its not about 1% really, everyone will be involved make ton of friends and conenction and have fun with it.
---
In vanilla there were a period when there were a honor system but no bgs. most ppl think of it as the most fun period in vanilla. not just 1%, but ppl that were super causlas and 13yo. So i don't know  why you you think its gonna be unplayable or something.
---
im pretty sure its gonna be exciting and very fun.
---
Someone, somewhere, at some point in time, spent their DKP on this item
---
Hi, /u/Bozhidar95
---
Spirit healers arw easy to find in Vanilla. You don't need an addon for that. They are always on the other side of the map. ALWAYS. Sometimes on the other side of another map.
---
Yes but why would anyone in their right mind assume that? It makes no sense for loot to work like that in vanilla.
---
Dwarf priest here. I was debating priest or Pally but I've definitely decided priest. Also, dwarf not because of the meta but because I like their aesthetic and starting zone(s). Planning on raid healing endgame if I can find a guild that works for my days off. Monday/Tuesday for now. Hoping to go back to Sunday/Monday. I work nights as well so I'm probably looking at a west coast US server though I live on the east coast
---
Kinda like everyone said if you don't want world pvp go on a pve server. Classic was like this and made many people new friends to come counter gank for them or getting a bunch of people and getting revenge.
---
"The Horde is a faction of outcasts and oppressed races banding together."
---
That right there is why I'm going Horde after a lifetime of Alliance. I've separated the truth from the prettiness. Every time someone talks about "mud huts" or "horde scum" it only vindicates me. Alliance elitists sound like Imperial Officers in Star Wars
---
The meta has shifted though. The rankers will hang out in BRM or near flightpaths. They aren't looking for epic large scale world PVP or fair fights even. They just want the most honor per hour, and wiping lvl 50s is the fastest way.
---
Oh fuck off with this. It's possible to critique something without having to provide a better alternative.
---
Stay away then. Then sounds AMAZING.
---
AMAZING!!!
---
He he ita gonna SUCK for people who dont reach 60 before phase 2. Oh, and its gonna suck for people at 60 to. And by suck, I mean its gonna be AMAZING, except for the guys who are not 60 at phase 2, for them it will just suck. A lot.
---
The earlier you start paying attention, the more
---
gold you’ll have. The last character is leveled in vanilla had around 150g at 40 (remember this specifically since I borrowed gold to a friend who was short). 
---
It doesn’t take more time, and it’s not hard. But there is a certain rng factor to it. A couple lucky drops and you’re all set. 
---
- sell stuff worth selling (bear/monkey/eagle/tiger greens/blues of the correct armor type etc. people will buy them)
---
- avoid running five mans with people you don’t know/under leveled groups and avoid dying as much as possible 
---
- don’t bother leveling professions and skills you don’t need until after 40 if you’re not actually using them for something.
---
For instance: don’t learn LW patterns at 30 just for the sake of a skilling LW, wait until you have your mount. Create a bank alt and store your materials there instead.
---
Yeah I checked my math on drop rates, 20g/hr is way optimistic, it's probably more like 10g/hr and that's assuming you're a zero-downtime class like hunter/warlock/priest/druid, my bad. Still, 4~ or so hours of grinding is enough to get you halfway to your mount; if you don't have the rest by then you've been burning cash along the way somehow.
---
Gotta get shit out as fast as possible my dude. Can't be spending time on content if you want it out the door as soon as humanly possible to get those fresh clicks.
---
That's fucking casual. I'll just call I sick the next week. But I'd rather do it legit
---
Pingaan Do you mind updating it with the new info posted from blizzard?

---
Wow I never knew that! It does make total sense though. I wonder what visionary at blizzard was like: "hey.....we have one race on each faction that plausibly fits in one of our existing starting zones....may as well throw the two of them in right?"
---
Admittedly I think the race choice would have felt pretty weak at 3 per faction, 4 each seems like a better number
---
Cata idk, it wasnt great, but MoP was actually fun, it had one of the most fun raids when it comes to tactics (ToT), dailies sucked but the lvling quests were nice and it was the time where many specs were just so nice to play (never forget destro locks)
---
&gt;Lots of low levels will be there dying and giving you DKs
---
Dishonorable kills do not accrue from greykilling iirc. Only NPCs marked as "civilian".
---
Yeah, sure, it is so fun having to use a consumable just to try and get into a dungeon because enemy players want to camp the entrance.   
---
Invis pots might work for DM where there might be 3-6 players but I guarantee you the 20+ gank crews I saw at BRS had see invis up.  
---
Classic WoW PVP will not be like Vanilla's PVP.  
---
People who are expecting Classic WoW to be the same experience of Vanilla WoW are gonna get culture shocked by the vanilla meta that has been refined for the past decade.  
---
I played both Vanilla Wow back in 2004 and I've played Vanilla player servers and it isn't the same experience at all.
---
\~, 1, 2, 3, 4, ,r, f, z, x, c,( scroll up, scroll down with modifiers so I can still zoom in and out), middle click, 2 extra mouse buttons  and then I get 3 more keybinds of each of these keys with Shift, CTRL and Alt modifiers.
---
Great. Please adress the itemization. I am very worried that it'll play a large role in de-valueing the content. I am getting mixed signals from this post. PVP rewards will be 1.12 - yikes, but the vendors won't have all items right away, which is good.
---
STV or tanaris isn't the problem.
---
Getting wiped from a rotation of 5 -10 different groups of rankers roaming WPL is what is going to be the problem.
---
Honor without DHKs only existed during a brief time between when the Honor system was released (Classic Phase 2) and when Battlegrounds were released (Classic Phase 3).
---
So the only period in Classic where it would make sense to not have DHKs is Phase 2.
---
Preach it! Gonna be spreading the ret love on EU. Love the ClassicCasts.
---
Nice job! That being said I did see a guide a loooong time ago that basically was the optimal level route for hunters depending on their class, in that guide was a hunter pet recommended path part. I don't know who made it or really anything else about it, but I do remember it being like... A bafflingly long document.

60s gain honor from 48+. This is an important breakpoint to remember for warlocks too, as they need to acquire a ton of soulshards before raids lol
---
My brother went full Nick Cage in National Treasure on me with the release date.   He showed me some video and a wow armory page that somehow concluded that July 16th is the day.    He was extremely convincing and passionate so I would say the odds are 50/50 he is probably right or maybe he isn't...  either way, he's one of them two.

Honestly, if you can only  play 3 hours a week, why not just play a PvE server? PvE servers are awesome.
---
i made the mistake of going pve server for nostalrius 1st edition. i was flagged from lvl10 onwards and i didnt get one real fight. noone was ever flagged unless they were moving in groups, i didnt get a 1v1 once. however i did get killed sometimes after difficult pulls when i was almost dead anyway.
---
i stopped at lvl45 coz it was just a horrible boring experience and also from my small sample size people's average skill was quite a bit lower than on real servers.
---
Isn't it all relative to the rest of the server?
---
It doesn't matter how much honor you have, as long as you have more than the rest of the server you'll still receive maximum rank points and get rank 14 in the same amount of time as with BGs. 
---
Someone explain if I am incorrect.
---
You can't say you want Classic and then complain when you get Classic
---
In my experience mining and herbalism both require a bit of catchup for most zones. I'm sure there are guides and optimized routes that stay near common spawn points if you're willing to do that. You should also note that you'll be fighting over nodes if you're playing near release and you'll be doing that for *both* of your gathering professions. Skinning is based on the mobs that you tag and kill, so it's easier to keep up with as you level.
---
Warriors are dual wielding tank, and holy priest, well priests will be saturated when classic comes... If you are good in what you do you will have no problems finding a casual guild to main tank for
---
I wish i had a basement. You rich people and your fucking basement mansions. In my area we get 600 sq ft and we like it that way!
---
Hi, /u/Hoofootwow
---
I am currently playing on a pserver as a 42 Warrior (tanking as arms) and I also started my tanking career in BC on a warrior, I played a Hunter/Rogue in Vanilla.
---
I would very strongly recommend trying it out for at least a little while, even if it's just to mid 20s, to get a taste of how warriors "used" to be and how they were in BC and beyond.
---
There was certainly some shock at how the mechanics of tanking on a warrior gave you very little room for error. For instance, Thunderclap being a Battlestance only ability (as well as doing less threat than a Battleshout), everything but Taunt requiring rage, and how much being underleveled or having poor weapon skill played a part in everything.
---
It could be much better as prot, but I doubt many will level as Prot, so the majority of pre-50 dungeons are gonna be done by Arms/Fury warriors.
---
There is certainly a "dos and donts" list of things that are specific to fights and pulls, but I think the main thing to practice is rage management. It's really an uphill climb at the start of pulls, and that combined with over eager DPS, priests who bubble you (and kill your rage), mobs with CC like disarms and stuns (could be pserver only issues) and at the best of times still missing a decent chunk of special attacks that causes you to lose aggro, it can be a little frustrating.
---
These issues got solved later on, when they at least gave you a few non rage costing abilities to not let you fall into the slippery slope of not getting hit = no rage = no threat = loose mobs = dead healer.
---
I think any veteran WoW player can adjust to it, but it has it's own weird intricacies that you kinda want to check out before you fully commit to the class. From personal experience, the first 15 or so levels were pretty brutal and while discouraging, but it gets better as it goes, which is pretty much that MO for leveling up a warrior.
---
Dwarf lore in vanilla is amazing :D
---
Two handers mostly, pretty much all of them except BRE. Most guilds give hand of rag to rets but some will give to warriors 
---
There’s plenty of guilds that will give Ret paladins tier pieces, regardless of what your guild does
---
I would recommend EPGP with fixed-prices and decay, which allows you to give players points for participation (something zero-sum DKP can't do) and allows you to avoid bidding issues (which plague original DKP). Applying a decay of points each week will gradually reduce the points in the system while maintaining the overall priority order for loot, which combats people hoarding points.
---
  \*  Legendaries should be loot counciled and decided well in advance (we're talking Thunderfury, Sulfuras, Atiesh, and the scepter here).
---
  \*  Cosmetic items like mounts should be random /roll for anyone who has been in the guild for a month (i.e., not a trial member).
---
  \*  Tradeskill recipes should be random /roll for anyone who has been in the guild for a month (i.e., not a trial member) or assigned to players in a round-robin fashion to avoid one player having all of the guild's recipes and then quitting.
---
Most important of all though is to have your rules written down somewhere where every player can see them. Be transparent and allow your players some way to voice concerns or participate in improving the system over time, because no system is perfect.
---
Yeah TBC was perfect. Wrath you started to see more homogenous classes, LFG, and 10 &amp; 25 man versions of raids with different loot. That’s when the player base really became split on changes
---
Yes ferals are ok.
---
Hey ClassWoW Reddit!

---
Quick Overview:
---
* Region: Europe
---
* Server Type: PvP
---
* Faction: Pref Horde 
---
* Class: Warlock 
---
* Content: Raid 2-3 days a week, PvP when there's time. 
---
* Play Times: ~19:00/20:00 - 23:00/00:00 GMT+1
---
* Contact: Reddit PM

**A bit about me &amp; my history playing the game:** 
---
I started my journey in Azeroth February 2006 as a smol potat, being terrible at the game. I've since then ventured through every expansion at various levels of dedication, putting most of my time in TBC &amp; WotLK. 
---
Most of that time was spent in arenas achieving Gladiator multiple times. 
---
Since then, life has happened and even though I don't have 14-16 hours to pour into the game every day anymore, I'm still hoping to get a solid 4 hours of game time most days of the week. Those hours would preferably be spent on VoIP with some cool catz, getting stuff done. 
---
Raiding is definitely an aspiration I have for Classic, but if there's no raid for the night -- then BGs &amp; world-PvP would be second on the list. 
---
**A bit about you &amp; your plans for your guild:**
---
Most likely you already have a core-group of members you're looking to build your guild around. Perhaps you're a group of pals that played together during Classic, or perhaps you're a group of current guildies looking to make a Classic guild once it launches. 
---
In either case, you most likely have vast experience playing the game, reaching some level of success (define that how you want) &amp; know what it takes to achieve results.
---
If you think we're a good match for eachother I encourage you to PM me!
---
Blizzard should announce release date so I can schedule time off for work. Then announce server list.
---
I really want that mount. I know I won't get it tho. 😭😭😭
---
Why do you not have to worry about consumables as a healer?
---
They should just make so you can turn off being able to damage them entirely.
---
Yeah, this sub is really good at r/gatekeeping their world pvp content, like "if you don't like being camped by a no lifer who shared his account to get his gear and that you can't stand a chance because of gear difference, then you're not a real wow player" while WoW always was a PvE focused game with additional PvP content. There's a reason why PvE servers are named "Normal", and not the other way round.
---
The flagging system just makes so much more sense to me, that you opt-in to fights you want to take. So if you run around on level 60 while flagged, you can fight other level 60s who did the same thing and have actual, challenging fights against people who want to pvp, and they can opt-out if they don't. The downside is, you can't farm low-geared low-level players, which is, if we're being honest, the true reason why people choose PvP over PvE servers.
---
I like the reputations idea. That's legit!
---
Also keep in mind that average play time per day is also a factor in this. The more that you're playing on average each day, the lower of your % of xp gained was rested, meaning you gained more natural xp, meaning you killed more things, meaning you made more gold.
---
How was it a personal jab? Are we not allowed to tell people when they perform their job poorly now?
---
It was Camilla to not have DKs first. I'm cool with that version. It was much better.
---
Well I have no idea what that server was like, but the PvE servers in vanilla WoW were very populated and fun.
---
**&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |**
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role. 
---
**Who do we want?**
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn't always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
**What roles are in current demand?**
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for heals, off tanks, and locks.
---
**Misc:** 
---
	\-Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
	\-Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even those with little interest in raiding). 
---
	\-World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases. 
---
	\-Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
[https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK](https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK) , we are still in the process of setting up appropriate tabs. Feel free to ask any questions/contact us here.
---
As alliance mage I put my HS on theramore to cover that part of kalimdor. Pretty much covered most places except plaguelands maybe.
---
Planing on playing horde mage this time around so let's see what is the best HS spot. Guess it depends what content you are doing. 
---
Anyway the comfort of teleports really cuts down your playtime. Basically never need to take a boat/zeppelin. One of the great advantages of mages.
---
I like that idea
---
Yes, its just an instant -% of your current weeks rank points.
---
30 LoL
---
I agree play what you want. You can always find a group for yourself and play style however it will be harder with these specs. Even in good guilds, there is room for a single boom kin or shadow priest. However, most raid leaders who are putting the effort in to organize (which is a lot of effort usually) won’t be accepting more than that. Some may. The key is to play the way you want, just understand it will be more difficult as those subpar dps classes can easily be replaced since rogues, warriors and mages are among the more popular vanilla classes
---
Silithus world PvP came in 1.12, after Naxxramas.
---
If they’re releasing the phases exactly as it was in Vanilla, then can we expect all content to be released within 2 years? I can’t remember exactly, if someone could confirm please, but Vanilla was around for about 2 years before BC was released, right?
---
Can I ask, why is phase 2 gonna be like that? I was too young in classic to properly understand most of what I was doing lol
---
Can we please just stay in Phase 2 :x
---
Lots and lots of rogue's trolling NPC's. Gonna love and hate it
---
This is one of the coolest thing I ever heard of and I wish I was playing back then to see it.
---
&gt; The game also has it in lore that the alliance and horde are not in open war but rather small skirmishes to defend their current territories and to fight over resources
---
Doesn't world pvp reflect that? Player characters, adventurers, aren't military.
---
STV vietnam, love the smell of ganking in the morning

---
Not meaning to be rude but I'm curious: what does the word "homeowners" mean to Americans? Do you list it as some sort of occupation or?
---
You are right, for some reason I thought Distracting Dagger was +4? Not +6.
---
Druids can pretty much only use trinkets in forms. Almost all use effects on items require you to shift out. That’s worth noting at least. 
---
If you wanna troll people in classic, play a rogue. Literally the least gear dependent pvp class. Has by far the best defensive kit, prep for cooldown refresh, and can stun lock all classes but paladins  and to death during pretty much all of phase 1 content come classic (excluding dwarfs who know how to use stoneform). Their stun lock combo does not require good gear either to be effective, and you can pretty much start doing it to level 60s once you hit 52. 
---
For early content, rogues are broken. Once people get higher gear levels, things start to even out.
---
I mean when it has no critique to the video and instead is just a jab at the mexican in the video its not a critique. 
---
"Hey ugly, You are ugly!" What a critique...
---
How many people will hit rank 8 without BGs? Not a lot.
---
Was just being facetious with the fact that if you're a casual player, phase 2 is going to be a rough time.
---
Personally, it doesn't matter how much time I have to play; I'm going to roll on a PvP server because I enjoy WPvP.
---
I have followed every update since the announcement. I likely won't have a ton of time to play, and largely am not into ganking or being ganked. 
---
I'm not hardcore, but I am an attentive and enthusiastic casual.
---
I loved to game and played it on an extremely competitive level starting late Vanilla, then all the way through TBC. 
---
Semi-hardcore in Wrath and once the Cata talents kicked in I simply quit the game over night. Having friends who continued to resub every one in awhile, it seems to me that the game has gotten gradually worse with more or less every expansion, since TBC (or perhaps Wrath). 
---
I for one am excited about the prospect of replaying TBC once again, as I do believe 40man raids are rather wack. 
---
Whether it's carried by nostalgia of if it will truly be enjoyable, just the feel of Vanilla WoW, will hopefully be a fun experience. If nothing else it seems to be a catalyst of gathering 'old gaming friends' back together.
---
I have a question, if you rank up to  R14 before the rewards are released, can you still purchase them down the road if you derank over time?
---
How could phase 1 take 6 months?
---
Kargath
---
Just realized today that this is happening - I've been busy adulting.  
---
where do I sign over my life?
---
May I ask why dont you want to raid if you are going to be playing alot? Its not as time consuming as people think, unless you are a hardcore speedrunning top guild you wont be needing much consumables or resistance gear. Raiding 1 night a week will be enough to clear most of Vanilla.
---
Great reply. Fully agree
---
I remember I got one for Christmas one year around TBC. Completely blew me away as I didn't even think about the fact that the old one was bad - let alone that my parents would know this... Nor were they very supportive of me spending all my sparetime on gaming.
---

This isn't what I'm asking. Spirit healer locations are easy to find on databases. What I am asking is if there is a map showing which areas correspond to which respawn point
---
Sorry man. The Horde is just to smart. You Alliance wouldn’t understand lol
---
Just the week?

I read in another thread that it wasn't as good a legendary as the other items in the game (Tf, Ateish). 
---
Apparently enh shammys got a good prio then fury warrs then ret
---
Zerging is a bit of overwhelming with zerglings but also the aspect of doing it quickly and neglecting development. So zerging as leveling in WoW is a mad rush to 60, all for the XP, forget everything else. 
---
Works for me.
---
BGs or no BGs doesn't matter; that's not how the vanilla ranking system works. The only thing that matters is relative honor gained. If you gain the most honor in that week you will be in standing 1 which means you get 13K RP. And you can be sure high end guilds will have roaming gank squads (just like they did in OG vanilla btw when the honor system was released) which camp hot spots like Thorium Point or BRM to make sure they have the most honor gained for that week.
---
What you need is be 60 before phase 2, bring on the speed running guides !
---
I like it a lot. A small part of me would like to see the DK's shifted into Phase 3 along with the implementation of BGs, as I do view DK's as a hindrance to out-and-out WPVP that would discourage many from participating due to the punitive effects. Then again, moving it to Phase 3 is tacitly stating that the WPVP era  is now "over" with the release of BGs. For many people that's inherently  true, but staging DK's here kind of sends the message that Blizz thinks so too so I am OK with them leaving it in Phase 2 and having it just be 'the way things are' from the get-go.
---
Basin not till ZG? Noooooooooo. I can't wait that long.

---
1.12 PvP gear before BWL release is such a terrible idea. Making people do a r14 grind to get their PvE BiS is just dumb
---
this is the first time I've been disappointed with a blue post
---
battlegrounds in phase THREE?  AB in phase 4? jesus man.... this is brutal
---
Yeah. Wrath was still pretty good (compared to the expansions after) but it marked the beginning of the end. I would play wrath again for sure but not Cata. Maybe they could just do completely new expansions? Emerald dream? Idk
---
That someone was probably a hunter
---
That to. "You think you do but you don't" was right.
---
Yes and no. That argument, just as much as the rest of the paragraph are there to show just how much PvP is **not** the focus even in lore. Or rather, it does not have a bigger role than the PvE aspect.
---
I don't mean to undermine the PvP part of WoW but the history of the game(not the lore) has shown that PvE has been always the bigger focus of the developers. WoW, no matter which version, is always a PvE MMORPG first with optional PvP and not the other way around. Yet, a lot of the people in this sub seem to think that PvP is the be all and end all and some even insult others for not wanting to do PvP.
---
And you are correct ofc. While the player characters are members of either the Alliance or Horde, they are, in terms of wPvP, acting indepently. BGs on the other hand are different as the player characters enlist to fight for their faction there.
---
&gt;Well listen here you little shi-
---
It was not a good system. Those going for R14 were all in on it together and let each other take turns being at the top. It was shady as hell and didn't give any room to breathe.

It was a marker of "adulthood" for a long time. You get married, have kids, buy a home. It was often used as a symbol of settling down, and being successful enough to have a good job and afford a home. Mostly, this was a milestone of adulthood from the postwar era through the 1980s.
---
These days though, it's kind of a crapshoot. Depending on where you live, homes may be entirely out of range of buying, even if you have a good job with a steady wage.
---
what
---
That’s just kind of how it was in Vanilla so they’re sticking to the original release timeline.
---
Yep. I choose to play PvP servers because I love getting ganked (honestly). I have always preferred to play on servers where I was in the vast minority. Before Blizzard got rid of servers, I transferred from a PvE server onto Illidan US, which was a PvP server that had 16 Horde to every 1 Alliance (I played Alliance). The population imbalance turned the game into a whole new experience - a lot more like a survival game than a "fantasy MMO". Every open-world victory I experienced felt amazing, because it really **was** an accomplishment.
---
I just feel like a lot of the people who are complaining about Phase 2 don't share my tastes. However, if they mess with the PvP system to the point where I can't get that "survival game" experience, I'll play on a PvE server because it's really the next best thing. PvE servers are awesome.
---
"Each rank requires a minimum amount of Rating Points to be calculated every week, then calculated in comparison to other players on your server."
---
Doesn't sound like it's all relative, to me.
---
Great post!
---
Can’t wait for phase 4 - my favourite BG and Favourite raid!
---
Ya i have a UD mage on a private server and the Teleport locations are awesome.
---
Teleport to Ogrimmar is so convenient i dont want to give that up.
---
How did earning PvP-titles such as sergeant work?
---
I'm a married man with a 9-5 job.  Tuesday night is D&amp;D night with some of my friends (in which I am a player).  Thursday night is movie night / D&amp;D night with different friends (in which I am the DM).  Weds night is when I prep D&amp;D that's happening Thursday.  Friday nights are date nights with my wife, and I don't want to have any commitments any given weekend as that's when we do fun things together.
---
Basically even if I wanted to, I could raid Monday nights.  And usually on a Monday I'd rather just chill.
---
INB4 “No changes” fanboys
---
Lucky you with two monitors.. I used to prepare for my WoW sessions by going to wowhead and looking up all the quests in a zone, I'd then look through the comments for chords and any additional useful information which I would write down in a piece of paper.
---
Felwood and feralas were great zones for when the gankers were out in force. Lots of vertical blockers in feralas with pockets of mobs
---
Keep telling yourself that you're a good "pvper" when the only thing you do is camp redridge levelers LOL.
---
PvP servers are more fun. It’s really boring when the whole world feels like a neutral city.
---
You sure were envious.
---
I wish I had rooms. You rich people and your fucking apartment mansions. In my area we get 21 square feet and we like it that way!
---
I think phase 2 is going to be shorter than phase 1 and 3. I played on one server with a 1-month world pvp phase and it was a blast.
---
Arms Warrior will be viable!
---
There were also minimal requirements to advance.
---
Can someone explain? I thought phase 2 was Dire Maul?
---
Thats not allowed.
---
I don't think it's any more stupid today than it was 15 years ago. And yeah, it's super dumb and encourages really unhealthy behavior and a ton of time wasted on a video game... and I want one.
---
But what about when you want to fight but the other person doesn’t. That’s not fun. You’re just tuning around looking for a fight but not finding anyone.
---
Most add ons from vanilla have some modern version outside of addons that have been completely broken(original decursive etc...), those will likely be modified to work in classic.
---
&gt; You don't want these tourists playing PvP anyways.
---
Tourists can eventually turn into dedicated players, and you want that constant influx of new players to replace the burnouts.
---
The ironic thing is, based on your post, I don't think you know what you want. A long or short phase 2 will not change the long-term landscape of WPvP. WPvP zones will always be dangerous in Vanilla, so you have no concern here. However, a long phase 2 can damage server populations and even trivialize future PvE content, which Blizzard should be mindful of (and I think they are).
---
PvP flagging is literally a cancer to PvE servers. It is something I will never subject myself to ever again.
---
Who’s that guy?
---
If you're bored, then put your PvP flag on! The only difference is they get the first shot; You can handle that, can't you?
---
I miss the old days of UCMs on Warcraft 3 almost as much as I miss classic.
---
I don't know if it will be possible with the 7.3.5 API.  Here's a brief history as to why I'm not sure:
---
* In WotLK, there was an addon called AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) which let you draw on the game world.  Some people used it for graffiti, and others used it to significantly simplify raid encounters.  I remember using this addon during early ICC progression, and it would draw circles that would tell you exactly where to stand, that would fill up on timers, and would basically take over the job of raid-leading.  
---
* Blizzard broke the addon in patch 3.3.5.  Some say it's to stop the graffiti, others say it's to stop the easy-mode raids.  
---
* Wildstar is announced by a former WoW developer, and it features the easy-mode graphics as a part of the base game.
---
* Blizzard adds the easy-mode graphics to the game in Mists of Pandaria.
---
So, I don't know if the addon **could've** been built in Vanilla (whether it waited until WotLK because it hadn't been developed yet or because the API couldn't support it).  I do know that from Patch 3.3.5 you couldn't make an addon draw in the game world like that.  But I don't know if it will work with later patches.
---
While we do have the release plans for both PVE and PVP now, we have rather little indication as to how blizzard will decide when to realease phase 2-6. Do the have a schedule / timeframe in mind? Will they base it on certain metrics? ...
---
What would they rather risk: moving things along too quickly or too slowly?
---
\---
---
Considering that phase one will (likely) last a bit longer than most of the other phases, I don't expect a release of phase two in 2019.
---
One that would be allowed could be like a ”x yards” distance meter that turns red when out of area.
---
You can get R14 even with 10k honor per week, if other players will be lower than you.
---
There is no requirement "700k minimum".
---
Sharding will probably solve that for you 😂
---
The release of honor and the associated awards without any BGs means that the only way to rank up is WPvP which will lead to the chaos people are talking about.
---
Yes it is.
---
You end up not using vampiric embrace half the time because you're just generating more threat which you don't want since Mind Blast has additional threat.
---
So the people who actually WANT to PvP are at a disadvantage on a PvE server because they will never get an opener. Sounds legit /s
---
Better hope you're 60 by then or else you might as well just chill in Org until phase 3.
---
In all fairness when they broke AVR they also added raid markers into the default UI.  Not quite as powerful but for the purposes of marking locations on the ground pretty good.
---
&gt;PvP flagging is literally a cancer to PvE servers.
---
Excuse me but I have actually no idea what you're talking about.
---
Sometimes I think for a moment it would be nice if blizzard buffed some of the specs like ret dps and shaman tank ect so they were more viable.
---
Then I remember I’m no changes and I put myself in time out.
---
The number of people who will commit the hours to hit rank 14 will not be high and the hours they put in will be insane. At that point they deserve the edge that gear gives them imo.
---
... What? How retarded are you to assume that based on my one comment? I simply do not agree with the opinion that "95% of WPvP is level 60 rogues ganking low levels", there's plenty of nice WPvP in vanilla such as Blackrock Mountain PvP, Southshore vs Tarren Mill and general any WPvP, especially huge faction/territory wars.
---
Undercity is close to some good places, but it's the Zep to Grom'Gol that makes it worth it.
---
For an alliance character, you can port to IF, fly to Wetlands, and then take the boat to Theramore.  Or set your hearth as another poster said.

I want to play a PvE server but my friend wants to play PvP.
---
I'm still torn as to whether to play on the same server as him or not.
---
Glad I could help!
---
Rank 1 SWP costs less mana.
---
What does weekly decay have to do with it? that's just a flat % reduction that everyone gets. The way your weekly RP is calculated is relative to other players on your server. It doesn't matter how much actual honor everyone gained as long as they passed the minimal threshold of 15 HKs and there's a minimum number of rankers for the R1 bracket to exist (250). What matters is who gained the most (standing 1 / bracket 1) and all the other brackets are calculated from there. See here https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0_formulas)
---
Nice bandwagon jumping
---
Just go to a PvE realm and flag for PvP when out in the world when you’re ready. Back when I was new to the game my friends and I rolled on a PvE realm and you could still go to TM and PvP there by flagging yourself.
---
They came with each rank
---
what did you expect? that they gave rank 14 gear for badges and gold?
---
Every class is viable though
---
Unfortunately you won't get in very many fights that way, most people will just assume its a trap and there's some level 60 rogue stealthing around or something. But it's really unfortunate how deeply entrenched the circlejerk that PvP servers are the only way to truly experience vanilla wow is on this subreddit. If someone joins a PvP server without the intention to gank every single opposite faction player within their level range that they see then they are mostly just serving as farmable content for those that do have that ruthless PvP centric mentality. He who strikes first in PvP usually wins, especially when the other player is already fighting a mob. After years of only doing world PvP in self defense and when contesting limited resources on private servers I can't wait to be able to play on a PvE server.
---
If you wont turn your PvP flag on because you can't handle an opener then... get gud?
---
He could technically Zerg to 60 as a multiboxer
---
*slow clap*
---
Well damn, might have to pick up playing with addons and see if I can find some type of workaround.
---
Oh im taking way more than a week
---
The only requirements for rank is min level.
---
No you got it all wrong, The rewards in theory are good but the rewards they plan to have a 1.12 itemization which is way too powerful at the beginning.
---
Was that 3.3.5 or was that in Cataclysm?
---
Raid markers existed before that, they just couldn't be used on the ground.
---
Marking locations was good, but it was a cheap substitute compared to what AVR could do.
---
I wasn't even allowed to play the game (age 12, kinda understandable) in the sense that I didn't get to buy playtime until TBC release. Got to level 12 and only rejoined 2 days before WotLK launch. Played up to Ulduar and quit again.. played during Siege of Orgrimmar in MoP and quit again.
---
Most playtime for me was probably in various vanilla private servers years ago actually.
---
Damn this is pretty much my exact setup, down to the pet controls on extra mouse buttons.
---
I use C instead of Z on the bottom row though, easier for me because my thumb is resting right there.
---
Please use the search bar next time
---
I hope they go down the OSRS path. Keep classic going well into future
---
Then they keep playing and catch up.
---
Sad that blizzard is including something in classic that was in vanilla? I mean, you do you, but I honestly don't know what you expected.
---
It seems like you're being intentionally inflammatory. You should take that cancer somewhere else tough guy.
---
If you would know how much players bash the referee you would be suprised how thick of a skin they have. I play soccer myself and insulting the referee happens all the time, they let it slide more often then not because they know it is in the heat of the moment.
---
&gt;Unfortunately you won't get in very many fights that way
---
This hasn't been my experience. I always got lots of fights by permanently having my PvP flag on in a PvE server.
---
Will they adequately duplicate servers being down for 20 hours on patch days while the forums get flooded with complaints though?
---
Yes there has to be a #1 on any given week but to hit the highest ranks you have to be consistently at or near the top of the server. Doing that without Battlegrounds is very difficult because wPvP is much more random whereas Battlegrounds were basically a simple function of how competent your group was and time.
---
Not at all, I appreciate the intent behind it.  That being said, I wish it would be limited to quest giving NPCs.
---
I'm hoping for TBC.  That's the main reason I wanted Classic.
---
Realistically, we can't take anything for granted.
---
Thousands of players took RP-PvP servers for granted and were gobsmacked to see Ion say he won't release any at launch.
---
Here's hoping for a server list - but don't take it for granted.
---
No one liked DHKs back then and wanted them gone. Why would we like them now?
---
Whats your nationality if I may ask? Im making a guild for people like us.
---
Cata was basically when the new systems came in so there wouldn't be a point to doing Classic Cataclysm.
---
I think most people would tell you to play on the same server as your friend, but I would honestly suggest you play on a PvE server if that's what you like.
---
Usually Shamans and Paladins.
---
Incorrect, there will be plenty of hardcore players like myself that were already rolling on PvE and there will be plenty of casual players who roll on PvP servers.
---
Not a useful pve weapon so anyone who want to put the effort to get it for whatever reason. Its popular with paladin and shaman because the proc scale with spellpower.
---
Play PVP. You’ll spend the first 30 levels in zones mostly controlled by your faction, so the ganking will be at a minimum.  There’s just not much ganking in Westfall or Barrens.
---
30-40 STV will be painful (...for you!) 
---
After that, with some creativity, you can find lesser-popular leveling areas and really grind through the remainder. 
---
Also consider that you’ll have a friend. Most gankers don’t want to get into a 2-on-1 situation.
---
With 40 man raids, there WILL be spots for "meme" specs. My guild cleared most of naxx and we still had boomkins and enhancement shamans in our group. But yeah... with that said, don't EXPECT to raid if you want to play one of these weird specs.
---
I believe the post says there is "no tracking" during phase 1. This suggests to me that come phase 2 everyone starts from zero.
---
Now this sound like the guild I'm looking for. Interested in what time zone and type of realm you're thinking about committing to.
---
Norwegian, but I prefer to play in international guilds.
---
You also had to get at least a certain amount of honor.  For example if everyone on your faction only gets 1 honor noone will ever get to rank 14.
---
Well actually i'm thinking about ranking so i might be farming flight path and lvl 50 questing instead.
---
You can always just level up leisurely and wait to play after BGs launch.
---
My brother: 36yo already married with a daughter of 1yo, working, responsibilities, dealing with my father ramblings etc... etc....  
---
Me: 30yo (in 1 month), unmarried, not engaged, working 6h per day, 5 days per week, very few responsibilities, craving Classic, and planning to be even more South Park no-lifer than usual when it drops while still being able to spoil my niece (hopefully with with WoW and things like Legacy of Kain saga) when she'll grow up and learn to speak.   
---
Can't be blessed more than that tbh...
---
Thanks for this mate
---
Keep telling yourself that :).
---
Hes not wrong though! Lets be real how many fights would you win if you were one the defensive rather than being the agressor? Not many if you dont like the fact world PvP will happen on PvP servers.
---
&gt; And no - I'm not gonna play on a PvE server. I would rather not play at all then. Vanilla is all about the PvP.  
---
If you play on a PvE server, you can turn your PvP flag on and leave it on. You'll get plenty of PvP.
---
The flag system on PvE servers is really good, I don't get why you people who don't like imbalanced PvP don't play on PvE servers. It's not shameful, it's just where you find fair combat. PvP servers are NOT about fair combat and that's what I like about them.
---
You forgot to /dance.
---
Their should be gate keeping. Your stance is reasonable you don't like random pvp and ganking so you play on a pvp server. Nothing worse though then when one of yours trys to come into our shit. Then starts demanding we pad all the sharp corners for them. Those people suck and absolutely need to be stopped at the gate.
---
population on nost pve was actually the best part. iirc somewhere between 2-4k players.
---
US, east coast.  However I have a reasonably large friend group who will also be playing (~15-20 of us) and I'm not sure what our plan will be quite yet.
---
Having said that I think there is definitely room for a guild that raids "whenever people happen to be online and willing."
---
Me.
---
Ore actually sells on the AH for the first months. Herbs don't.
---
stv is easily skipable
---
One of the things that strikes me about this, is that it potentially buys blizzard time? I have no clue how much work is involved with reworking bgs and raids to fit with classic, if any at all. But if they can effectively delay portions of work due to the content phases... does that make a release date sooner rather than later? Or just less likely to suffer a delay... yeah it’s probably that.
---
Definitely! My guild will be EU for Norwegians and Swedes only. I wish you luck, champion.
---
Ah yes, my preferred AV
---
**Before** *blizzard says classic will be like vanilla:* **People think they do**
---
**After** *blizzard says classic will be like vanilla*: **They don't.**
---
I'm not sure that adding in BGs a full content cycle after adding PvP rewards is such a good idea. People are going to camp flight paths for months and it will drive people to quit the game.
---
I'll be playing a stealth class so for me it's not a problem but I've seen this happen before and whichever faction is more successful usually beats the other faction by such a big margin that it kills the losing faction.
---
Game came out the day after my 14th birthday. Good times indeed.
---
#nochanges
---
It’s funny how most of us really just want TBC classic and not vanilla lol.
---
This is making me re think my class and server choice. I was set on Priest, PVE looking to raid now I’m thinking Paladin, PVP to do battlegrounds. Argh!
---
But if you take candle, then it gets pushed back to winter.
---
Ha! This is exactly the kind of stuff I'm looking for. I wanna have one toon with Eng and another with Herb alch. Likely going to have mage/druid, so it's going to be hard to choose which one gets all the fun eng items. Rocket boots were around in vanilla right? Or was that BC+ only?
---
I'm looking forward to all of this. Trolling around in WoW is the most fun I've had. I like raiding enough, and I love PvP, but all the item rewards are basically just incentive for me to go terrorize the open world and start wars. It's just too fun to not mess with people.
---
that's a good point
---
you'll be okay.
---
Ooooh... that makes me wonder...
---
My major concern is choosing a server that is located close to me. Blizzard did not mention this on their official websites, but servers such as the ones in, for instance, North America, were not all bundled in in one location in US, they had sub-regions too, and in the case of NA, there were west coast and east coast servers. You would not know their location from the game alone, but people were able to figure out their locations via IPs and pings and such and post them on third party websites. The obvious need for such information to people like us is letting us know which servers were physically closer to us and would thus result in a noticeably reduced ping compared to their counterpart servers.
---
So... when Classic comes out, I want to be online the second the servers go live because I want to lock in a name for my toon, but this also means I need to know before hand which server I'll play on, and unless they give us access to those servers before hand (or just straight up tell us their locations) we won't know their locations, and so I might end up choosing a server that's east coast (I'm west coast), locking in a name, and then finding out halfway through that it's not the optimal server for me...
---
TL;DR:
---
Is it possible that they would do a open beta stress test WITH all the servers that will be available at launch available for the beta? Because if that's a possibility, that will enable folks much smarter than me to do their magic and tell everyone where each server is located and allow us to plan accordingly for launch.
---
Now THAT’S immersive! XD
---
It sounds like you're implying that because of the lore and Blizzard spending more of its budget and time designing raid encounters, PvP is just some minigame. Don't take this the wrong way but you are kinda undermining WoW PvP. I played a PvE server in retail vanilla then when I first played on a bootleg server I realized I was indeed missing out on 50% of the game.
---
just go pvp. if you are duo leveling you won't really have the problem of being ganked by others, or at least much less.
---
Thank you.
---
How does the leveling experience feel? I loved rogue in wotlk+, but I was definitely babied by Recup (I think that was in wrath?). I know 1-10 is an absolute nightmare, and the lvl 10 quest is also awful, but when does it start getting that feeling of, "I can screw with anyone I want and have the upper hand"?
---
It was stupid 15 years ago and it's stupid today. I don't like ganking and I obviously don't like getting ganked but I don't mind joining the odd battleground. I didn't really know what I was getting into 15 years ago when I chose a PvP server but I hated the ganking. I'll be happy to avoid that part of the game entirely this time around by choosing a PvE server.
---
[PvPer's FW](http://memes.ucoz.com/_nw/18/14234081.jpg)
---
You play your way, but there’s good reason why most people believe PvP is a fuller experience. 
---
I find PvE to be incredibly boring and also unimmersive. It doesn’t make sense to be in a world of “warcraft” where fighting can only rarely happen. Dueling exists for a gentleman’s fight; warcraft exists for wanton slaughter to the death.
---
Furthermore, with end-game PvE content in Vanilla being far simpler than retail end-game, it doesn’t make sense to me why anyone would limit their PvP options.
---
But, like I said, different strokes. You can love that experience, but there are many good reasons why most don’t and won’t.
---
I think all ppl that want to tryhard farm honor will condense in one zone and kill each other in on open world pseudobg. and thats by far gonna be the most efficient way to farm honor. 
---
also your faction need defend menethil harbor if there is some camper. and guess what/ ppl will be motivated to do it, cos there is honor for it. 
---
items are kind of a bummer indeed, but not many ppl will have them. and it will take awhile to get. i'd like them have fully progressive billzlike itemization.
---
Also thats how it happend back in the day, a period of no bgs but ranking, ppl played back in the day right? casual aswell.
---
if you are against it you are against how it was vanilla. so i don't know how you say you like vanilla pvp..
---
I hope that there's all the content, then maybe like a 1-2 year break where the game just stays stagnant, then they start making new content OSRS style. Or TBC if that's what people want.
---
The real Battle for Azeroth!
---
He played well for the time, yes. To be playing at the level that perplexity is however, you need to be using things like engineering and skull.
---
They don't want to go through and change the 1.12 data.
---
I remember reading that they had the 1.12 data intact, they might not actually have the data prior to that, it would explain why they're resistant to itemization, but cool with removing items from the drop table.
---
Their current approach is explained not having / wanting to mess with item stat tables.
---
play pve realm
---
"And without further ado, lets explore!"
---
Since we don't know yet how Blizzard will control server population and faction ratio, I'm thinking about playing on a PvE realm just to eliminate the threat of ending up on a 90-10 server.
---
I don't know if it was already a problem in vanilla but it surely was in WotLK. People will stop making new characters on a server where their faction has a disadvantage and instead chose one where *they* have that advantage. So instead of joining a 45-55 they'll join a 55-45 and this goes on and on. The more imbalanced the server gets, the more people will transfer away, the less people will create new characters ... It never stops until one side is essentially dead. So it gets really hard to find a group for anything and wherever you go, you're vastly outnumbered.
---
On PvE servers, people don't care if they're in a slight imbalance since most players don't flag for PvP anyway.
---
I do enjoy world pvp, but I wouldn't mind if it becomes optional (like on a PvE server) if it helps the longevity of the server.
---
Funny, my experience is that herbalist doesn’t really require catch up, but mining requires a specific grind to get past tin.
---
&gt;hardcore players
---
&gt;rolling on PvE
---
chose one
---
That goggledog always makes me laugh
---
The stats of all items through all patches have been posted on this sub many times. There are few webbsits that got that data.
---
I recently asked barrens.chat the same and to my knowledge there is no public data for this. People do run private server "repacks" with essentially admin controls. The ".near" command gives the information of which spirit healer you are closest to. This could be used to then create waypoints.
---
This addon feature would be immensely helpful for speedlevelers, and anyone in general who knows or wants to use death-skipping for fast travel.
---
I'll prompt this subreddit, some discords, and barrens chat sooner towards launch and when official API information is released so we can begin making add-ons.
---
Id be ok with a dishonorably kill only if its was to prevent keepin an npc down. Say kill a couple times, then for 24hr its a dishonorably kill if its killed again.
---
That makes sense for single-player games, but on progressive games such as WoW, you are just letting everyone get a week-long head start on you. It's not like that will make EVERYONE hit 60 before you go online, but still, doesn't it bother you knowing that much of the population will have a 20+ levels on you when you start? Wouldn't you want to go along with the curve, rather than fall behind it?
---
Granted, unless you no-life it, the hardcore players will still get to level 60 before any of us, but leveling alongside the majority of the population still appeals to me more than being late to the party, you know?
---
To each his own - just my thoughts.
---
that will depend on population cap. if caps are something crazy like 20K. i would agree with you.
---
if pop caps are 5K ish (more reasonable imo) there will be gank squads but they will be avoidable
---
You're not wrong, nigmastolemybike, you're not wrong.
---
I think there is a decent chance that no one has R14 weapons until phase 3.  I think it takes at least 14ish weeks to reach R14 if you are 1st in honor each week. I also think there is a decent chance that phase 2 lasts 3 months or less (based purely on speculation)
---
I honestly believe MC will feel like LFR 
---
The hardest part will be getting warm bodies that have resistance gear.
---
On PVE it is usually scheduled. Someone would post in a realm forum that they or their guild/group/whatever would be in a certain place, at a certain time flagged for pvp and hope that some others would come to fight them. Otherwise smaller scale a couple people might flag and then troll around near where enemy players were hoping for a fight but not in a consistent way.
---
Because I have a family, career and kids now, I’ll be a casual player.
---
With that being said, I want to make my life as easy as possible once I hit 60 and progressing with the least amount of time invested.
---
I believe a Shaman will get me into the most groups the easiest, with minimal time played once I’m 60. 
---
So, I’ll be rolling a shaman. I do keep changing my mind to holy priest, but I’m like 80% sure I’m going Troll Shaman.
---
I think their wording was just bad. Each rank requires a certain number of ranking points. The number of ranking points you get each week is entirely dependent on your standing relative to other players.
---
I think there's some minimum requirement, it's small, but in theory if 100 honorable kills ranks you first on your server then you get the same 13,000 ranking points as someone who spends 10 hours a day playing BGs.
---
The biggest problem is consistency. You need to be in the top ~5 players for 5-6 weeks in a row to hit R14. With BGs it's effectively just a question of how much time you can put in. wPvP is much more random which is going to make it difficult to lock down a top spot week in and week out.
---
You can still have "warcraft", you just play more like Durotan - fight people who are looking for a fight, not those who aren't. Playing flagged up on a PvE realm is a fun way to play, and you often get the "fair fights" everyone on PvP servers crave.
---
Haha, man vanilla is going to hit you right in the face.
---
You say "most" but PVE players are the majority. Just not on this subreddit for whatever reason.
---
oh not you have to play the game
---
lol, thats the name im chasing for release! i see this as a good omen!
---
Classic going to be easy as. Problem with vanilla is tanks mainly wore tanking gear and their tps was so low it would hold my dps back. We didn't have meme specs but people were not very good. I was our lone fury warrior and I got a lot of shit, they kept telling me to tank or play rogue and that's why I quit in aq40.
---
Phase two happens: "You're a good guy. Don't come to the Dire Maul entrance tomorrow."
---
Firstly, thanks for your well thought reply.
---
I dont really have any intention of raiding.
---
I only want to be able to travel to level.
---
Thoughts regarding that, sir (or madam)?
---
You are immediately jumping to that conclusion though. I don't see PvP as a minigame. It's just a part of WoW that's smaller than the PvE  - in terms of developer focus, development time and player interest. And I am not making that one up, it's a literal fact that we were able to see staying like that since the game started. 
---
I'm sorry if it may appear as such. I don't mean to undermine PvP. Heck, this whole comment chain started because I asked people to stop undermine players who **don't want to** PvP all while talking about the reality of how big PvP in is.
---
Classic isn't classic without a ridiculously cluttered UI.
---
I really hope that they space out the phases by a good margin.
---
25. Single. No kids. 
---
I have a full time job and play in a band. I'm going to no life the shit out of wow. I might not even really sleep the first couple weeks. I might never get another chance to truly no life a game again.
---
Screw text gimme some voice acting!
---
Have you given any thought to the consequences this will have on people's leveling experience?
---
I'm pretty sure there will be a massive outcry from the playerbase once they hit level 48 and all of the rankers swoop in to gank them and camp flight paths.
---
This is a massive shitshow waiting to happen, I can't believe nobody's talking about how bad this is for PvP.
---
September 22nd
---
Seems like a good excuse to save money. Cant spend money if you never leave the house!!
---
The decay means you *have* to camp your Thorium point/whatever spots almost *constantly*.
---
&gt;R11: epic mounts, do not require epic riding to use
---
Wait 
---
# WHAT?
---
That was a THING? Did it give you 100% riding without the riding skill?
---
Lol this eunuch trying to convince others that it's not so bad living without balls
---
Considering phases 2 and 3 don't introduce any new raid content, I think those phases will be rather short compared to phase 4 for example.
---
I don't blame him for not watching it that first 10 seconds was cancer.
---
Damn, this looks great. Yes, I would love to have this available.
---
Doesnt that require they get like 4 dedicated debuff slots though? I thought the limiting factors on Spriest dps was that they need debuff slots for SWP and mindflay. Also they couldnt dps for more than 4 minutes even chugging pots on CD and all the other mana consumables.
---
Someone floated the idea of naming them after bronze dragonflight members in another thread and I love that idea.
---
And there are people that think Classic has infinite content and never needs anything past Naxx.
---
And on the other hand, I really love being the 10% on a 90-10 server, so if Blizzard does try to control server population, I'm probably going to roll on a PvE server. Not out of protest, but because I think the PvE flag system works really well for fair fights.
---
I don't understand this reaction. What did you expect when they said they wanna keep Classic wow as authentic as possible and recreate the experience?
---
I’ve always missed Dwarvenizer/Trollnizer adding. That was some of the best times chatting with folks using thay
---
I got the first Sulfuras on horde on my server (warrior). Alliance had like 8 of them, mostly given to paladins. After the first battleground we did we were all extremely grateful that the went to paladins and not warriors.
---
Start by having her watch you play. If she shows any interest in anything (cool looking zone, creature, etc) just focus on showing her things like that. Maybe let her walk around a city or somewhere she won't get ganked. If she shows any interest have her create a character. She could get hooked. The most important thing is to let her do her own thing.
---
Also in a band so would love to maybe hear some of your music?
---
I agree that the updated gear is a terrible idea. Gear is the main driving factor at max level and having gear available that is way better than anything else available for the better part of a year is good for no one. 
---
For people that aren’t going to put in the time to get the pvp gear it makes all of the raid gear available feel much less meaningful.. when you get an epic weapon from molten core or bwl I can’t imagine it would be nearly as exciting knowing that that one neckbeard in your raid has weapons way better than it that you have no hope of ever getting. 
---
And for the neckbeards that will get pvp epics it means you have almost no upgrades to look forward to in raids aside from the odd trinket/ring/necklace... there seriously won’t be any serious upgrades until naxx.
---
I feel that the pvp gear as a whole is flawed in how the only alternative is gear that automatically upgrades itself after a certain amount of time which is still lame but at least it doesn’t completely break the balance of the game. It would make more sense to have multiple pvp seasons in classic but obviously that isn’t going to happen. 
---
Personally, I have no life and feed off of having better gear than everyone else so with this system I’m almost definitely going to grind out rank 14 since the gear will be massively better than anything else.. but I won’t be happy about it lol
---
They have fixed it.
---
Ah sorry I didn't get you were saying that.  
---
Do you mean his dot, the knockback and the lava splashes were fire and his melee was physical?  I don't really get why that would be a "buff", since you're in plate fr gear anyway.
---
It's true, and I agree, but blizz is going for authentic vanilla and not fixed vanilla.
---
My absolute favorite time in Vanilla wow was when the honor system came out without battlegrounds. God it was fucking fun.
---
Not going to lie, I still have nightmares of people trying to kill Vashj and throwing the balls up the ramp (line of sight) that the water elementals dropped... “It’s not working, I can’t throw it!” (NO LINE OF SIGHT)
---
Or that guy at Mt. Hyjal who would throw you into the air and you had to use the feather to avoid fall death.... (Used the feather too soon or doesn’t use it at all) 
---
LOL
---
Your asking for that. I'd like some basic QOL stuff, It's frustrating to be shoehorned into one playstyle.
---
Yeah I think a lot of people are under the illusion that tourists are a strictly bad thing, and the faster they leave the better.
---
The reality is that the bigger the audience, casual players or not, the more support Classic will get in the long term.
---
Hi, /u/Korgoth420
---
My dream is they release TBC but fix the scaling issue they introduced by making hellfire peninsula greens better than vanilla raid gear.
---
I don't see a real issue there. Both BWL and Naxx will be cleared in 1 day after release regardless of PvP rewards. Also only a tiny fraction of raiders will make it to rank 14. It will have only a very small influence on raiding.
---
In the other hand more PvP activity is good for dedicated PvPers. It means more/faster BGs and more mid-tier competition. I think it will be super fun.
---
He wants to be able to troll and kill low level npcs with no downside.
---
Just building on this BRM and Diremaul will likely be super camped (I love wpvp so I dont mind) making people who want to run BWL/MC with world buffs the perfect target for the more coordinated (grouped up) pvpers.
---

---
I will stay on my RP PVE server and get everything I need from PVP out of Alterac I guess. But I am happy to see that place again.
---
Lame video imo...
---
Definitely cower in fear of their gear, but make no mistake about it you don't need to be a highly skilled player to reach rank 14. It's all time investment and having a stronger premade group than your opponent. That's all there is to it.
---
Thought you meant Death Knights from your title, and I was about to hey very upset.
---
No. You can only get them whilst at that rank
---
BGs aren't coming in until most likely right after the weapon grind is able to be finished through world PVP.
---
Weapons come in phase 2, BGs start in phase 3 and I doubt itll be less than 3 months between phases
---
Remember, gear comes out in phase 2.....after that if you want rank 8, that’s 8 weeks of dedication, you only get a rank a week and that’s if you beat everyone else. So there goes 2 months of time, and remember there is no battlegrounds so it won’t be that easy. BGs come out phase 3, so you need to devote more weeks if you want rank 10-11 and zg is already out. 
---
This is completely fine if you ask me, it won’t ruin anything.
---
Boy do we have news for you!
---
It's tough to say really. Going down the "just release expansions" route will inevitably result in either A: continuing on to the expansions that killed the experience, or B: just stopping eventually. 
---
Whereas new content can go on forever, and can be tailored to avoid the mistakes made in certain expansions. The main drawback is that it's massively more expensive to go this route.
---
There are a fair amount of negatives to the flagging system on pve servers. My first server was pve back in vanilla. Had on idea what I was doing, just picked the server it recommended. In my experience flagging yourself in pve is basically letting everyone know they can throw the first punch. And they usually do it when your back is turned or fight tons of mobs.
---
Not to mention my favorite move ever. Start a duel with an opposing faction member while flagged. Once the dual starts /forfeit their first attack immediately flags them and your party jumps them. 
---
If you are someone who is looking to pve and pvp occasionally this balance might be fine for you. But if pvp is the priority, you are better off on a pvp server when you can get in as many low blows as you would be receiving.
---
That's my strategy, I'll be rocking a tauren shaman, they can't use the pvp reward raptors right?
---
I think there will also be a ton of small scale pvp. I would either be ganking or in a 3-5 man group 90% of the time, and most did the same. Was more efficient than joining a zerg, so a lot of people preferred it. 
---
This time in original vanilla was almost like a chaotic version of arenas sometimes. Had a lot of groups we regularly clashed with.
---
Eh?
---
Though this happened much more rarely (because they were hard to kill) but I think the NPC kill that carried the most impact was a flight master. I remember this happened numerous times to the FP in Westfall when I was playing, thus locking people in and not letting them leave the area except on foot or hearth. Though the Horde couldn't kill anyone not flagged for PvP, Duskwood was just across the river, so occasionally some poor sops from Duskwood would venture into Westfall, be camped, slowly make their way to Sentinel Hill, only to find out they can't quickly fly out, because the flight master's not there...
---
So a copy of vanilla/Mona Lisa. 
---
I get your analogy now. So no, I don’t think people would give a stuff what he does to a COPY of the Mona Lisa.
---
Correct
---
Kind of true, but the same thing applies to wPvP.
---
I'm actually going to be playing a PvP server, and ideally the PvP server that has the greatest faction population imbalance - and I'll be playing the minority faction. I've done that in retail (played on Illidan NA Alliance) and will do that in classic. 
---
I just made this post because people like you are assholes to PvE-ers who don't deserve it.
---
But if you want to walk the talk then find me in game, my name will be Nascence and you already know where to find me.
---
Holy shit I can almost see all the tears on the forums already, it's gonna be fantastic

---
Well getting married ain't allways a good thing like. Im 45 and divorced looking for to put in the hours into classic wow. If i knew what i knew now 20 years ago i would of stayed single. But that's another topic.
---
I remember at one point they were doing rolling restarts/updates a few servers at a time. When my server went down I made a new character on a random server and the spawn was filled with 100+ people doing the same thing, and people would be just bullshitting around and announcing which servers went up.
---
His melee attacks are supposed to be elemental and only be mitigated by fire resistance. On Nost and LB his attacks weren't elemental, so you needed fr, defense and armor to mitigate his attacks.
---
Ragnaros' regular attacks are supposed to be elemental and they weren't until they finally fixed it midway through LB, so the realm first on ND was the first time where Rag was finally properly scripted.
---
I don't understand the negative reaction to this and people lamenting the possibility of obnoxious world pvp and camping. This is how it was and it's what we asked for. You can't moan and groan at the possibility of tradable loot one second and then cry about campers the next. It's all part of the same experience. We don't get to pick and choose aspects we like and those we don't. Ya'll wanted classic, well blizz is gonna give it to you.
---
In a similar boat. I was excited to level and do low level classic BGs. I always took a day or two on the last level of the bracket to pvp and squash players with my level and gear advantage. 
---
I guess the only silver lining is I won't have the battlegronds temptation so I can focus more on the journey of 1-60 and not feel rushed to endgame pvp for gear. Because let's be honest... it's not going to be an easy grind, who knows what phase we will be in by the time most of us even hit 60. Plus incentive to level an alt when the phase drops for WSG and AV!
---
I cant wait!
---
The way mount skill worked in vanilla from like 1.1 until 1.10 was you paid a tiny bit of gold for the mount skill, and then the actual mount itself was 90% of the cost.
---
You paid like 100g for the mount skill and then if you grinded to rank 11 for the mount it saved you about 900g since the mounts themselves were dirt cheap due to being time gated behind the rank grind.
---
Alliance scum
---
You dont need much room to play classic!
---
I'm planning to have every class to 60 and bis gear, then I just play casually on my retirement days
---
shrug
---
Well then we are in the same boat (alliance warrior myself), but you're wrong that they don't deserve it
---

This isn’t looking good for Phase 5.

Not with dks there. I won't go anywhere near a city, unless we want to pick off a few guards to lure people out.

The difference is quite a bit larger than that. Even amongst the top tier dps, warrior and rogues pull ahead quite a bit at the start, but dps isn't everything.

I used to get my 2 year old to farm motes of fire for me in shadowmoon while I did the chores. He's 13 now and destroys me in any game we play that isn't CO op.
---
thats what i'm saying, people thinking there will be guilds of people in rank 14 gear before bwl comes out is hilarious to me.
---
Yes all races rush, zerg's are specifically known for their overwhelming numbers which is why zerging means doing something in large numbers, not doing something quickly
---
85% of vanilla was spent with DKs.
---
heh, the irony
---
It's clean, but only showing 12 keybinds? Pshh.
---
Yeh I don’t have the time lol. Even playing 20-40h a week I don’t think I’d be able to pvp enough to reach 14.
---
Just wondering, how are zergs less efficient? Is honor received split amongst the raid per HK or something?
---

Releasing 1.12 PVP gear that early is a huge mistake.

I'm 33. Finally have myself a great job, just bought a new motorcycle, looking at buying a new gaming rig in the next few months; all that's missing at this point is the wife and kids.
---
This speaks to me on levels I didn't know I had.
---
Lol.  Must be   glad I could be your Rasputin
---
The whole "buy things with marks" was in TBC and later. You bought reputation/honor items with gold, as long as you had the required honor level/reputation level.
---
AFAIK:
---
At first, there were individual mount skills for each race's mounts, and you then had to buy 100/1000g mounts for 60/100% speeds. There was no training skill beyond that. That was changed in 1.12.1, with the mount rework.
---
In this patch, Blizzard made due with the race-specific riding skills and generalized the riding skill to what we know now, which is apprentice/journeyman (75/150 skill) riding for 60%/100% mounts. It was also then that the swap in the huge cost went from buying the mount to training the skill. R11 mounts still didn't require purchasing the epic riding skill.
---
&gt; Rank 11 mounts, and the AV faction mounts should only require apprentice level riding skill.
---
[Here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.1)'s the patch notes for 1.12.1, with a neat FAQ about the mount rework.
---
&gt; But if pvp is the priority, you are better off on a pvp server when you can get in as many low blows as you would be receiving. 
---
I think that's the right mentality to have on a PvP server - this post is really talking to people who don't share that mentality.
---
I am assuming there is room for more! I haven't dug into it too much, however the concept is lovely! 
---
There is an add-on I have seen used on some videos where people have a circular action bar come up, containing all of there potions and consumes which I think is also a nice touch!
---
How in the hell has Madseasonshow been only once on this list?
---
Quality stuff, relaxing voice, mature manner. And he actually played classic, has a whole series about it, as a boon.
---
The amount of effort &amp; luck combined made it that way, especially since BWL had so many 2h weapons
---
When MC was the only raid it was pretty great - even when ZG and BWL were new it still would frighten anyone to come across in PvP, but that diminished slowly throughout when folks realized how much more deadly other weapons cloud be. It was also kind of like Priest's Benediction being a big "Kill Me" target, that Orange Hammer was a similar sort of target since it was so visible from across the map
---
Which is why most people who want to actually pvp will be in southshore/tarren mill during phase 2
---
I believe you’re completely overestimating the impact of it.
---
Most 2h melee weapons are purely used in PvP.
---
Or in theory by Enh Shamans or Ret Pallies, allthough those two specs are really support specs, so it is better to craft Nightfall for them.
---
Haha I'll be an Alliance warrior too! At least we can duel it out :P
---
&gt; *People will mostly ignore pvp during phase 1 outside of RP reasons or just to fuck with people.* 
---
I doubt it, I think there will be lots of wpvp in phase one too. If a few people start pvping it creates a chain reaction and the whole zone goes to war because everyone wants revenge at anyone of the opposite faction, at least that's usually how it goes down in my experience. Fun but also kinda frustrating sometimes!
---
Just avoid the hotspots and you'll be fine. Hillsbrad and STV will be off the chain.
---
Not just for casters. The hunter set is fucking amazing. Unless you have the entire giantstalker set, you'll want to be wearing 2 pieces of it.
---
It doesn't work like that, you can gain more than one rank per week if you get enough RP. See here https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0_formulas)
---
oooooooor just roll on a PvE server and play whatever character you want whenever the fuck you feel like it and never have to worry about  being ganked :)
---
This announcement seals me not playing till at least phase three. Maybe not at all.  
---
For some reason I thought Blizzard would be more reasoned than the private server crowd. 
---
Stuff that would clearly be a benefit to the game that simply wasn't ready at the time should go in. Battlegrounds are in this category.
---
For fucks sake man, do you have some problem or why are you commenting multiple times at different comment chains?
---
Go suck it up, accept that I know that FW is the best but its importance proportional overblown after 2 dwarfs, and that I'm a horde priest anyways. 
---
Just like there are night elf warriors, there will be human/ne priests. Both choices work out. End of story. I have no interest in discussion with you; How invested can you be. Jeez.
---
They’d have to manually edit the database values as well as add new rows, completely altering the 1.12 data. 
---
Here’s an example: let’s say Vanilla patch 1.10 introduced “The Sword of 1000 Truths.” Its item ID is #12345, and it gives +55Str and +20Stam.
---
Blizzard needs to nerf this weapon. They have two options:
---
1. The sword with ID #12345 has its stats lowered in the database. When players with these swords login that patch Tuesday, the stats are reduced.
---
2. A new item, with the same art assets and name is created. It has a new ID (item#51515). All references to item #12345 are replaced with #51515 - this means equipped weapons, loot tables, bank slots etc. Like option 1, players will see the reduced stats, but it is unlikely they’ll know its a completely new weapon.
---
It’s likely that while Blizzard was rapidly developing the game, they just used option 1 - it requires the least amount of space and, honestly, “what value is there in keeping old data”? (Foresight can be a painful talent to acquire in the dev world lol).
---
What you’re asking Blizzard to do is #2, but in reverse. Take them items that existed in younger patches and create new versions of them. This would require going through every item and spell in the 1.12 data and creating *at least* one earlier equivalent (some items went through multiple changes). That’s a ton of work. I don’t think the value is there - the casuals won’t really care or notice, not to mention those items changed for a reason.
---

We're a raid first, PvP second type of community. Right now we have already formed a little of our core with our 20 members.  We have known each other for many years and some of us are family. Average age I would say is around 30yrs old. We are a mature group of people but we have open dialog.  
---
Even with our core members, we are still seeking *class* leaders, *raid* leaders, *main and co* tanks and help with overall management of the guild/discord. We are very excited for the re-release of Classic WoW. No position is a lock in the early part. Everyone will have to prove their worth and skill.  
---
If this sounds like a match for you please reach out to me on discord @ #JayD9596
---
Mage.
---
Warriors are slowest levelers
---
Rogues are actually not the best levelers also (no mana, but they need to eat every 2/3 kills), are not very mobile, and you will be competing with a lot of people for gear because of how popular the class is.
---
Priest is nice because you can dps OR heal a dungeon, so easier time finding dungeons, BUT... they have NO mobility.
---
But mages... aside from blink giving you a small boost to walking, you will also have teleports and will save money on things like food (and if you're smart, make a little money selling conjured food). Plus you will have the ability to farm resources to funnel into your alts.
---
I will say this; no matter who you choose, after you log in and play a little while on your main, create ALL your other toons and take the time to run them to the main city WITHOUT setting anything as your home. The benefits of this are:
---
You can effectively use them  as your bank alts until you decide to play them 
---
AND
---
Once you DO decide to play them, they will have accumulated rested experience. I know, in the beginning levels, it's basically nothing to level them, but even that little boost will help. If you didn't set anything as your home, then using the hearthstone will teleport you to your starting location, and you can start questing as if you never left.
---

&gt; Server list!
---
The sooner they announce the Server List, the sooner the streamers can tell their window licking audience which one they plan to play on, the sooner I can take an interested look at whats left.
---
We get your point dude, one post is more than enough, much less spamming this in all the comment threads about the blue post
---
The blue gear is more problematic than the epics even, because it's just so strong and so easy to get. The epics themselves are still a problem tho; you're not supposed to progress BWL and AQ40 with AQ40-level gear (which is what the updated R12/13 set is).
---
[Could be the hunter's, could be the rogues](https://i.imgur.com/yBjrkAf.png). It's up for interpretation.
---
That’s literally the whole point of begging for classic dude lol
---
Of course if that's what you want go for it. Just gave some tips how you could react when being ganked
---
This is definitely a huge change, something far more radical than adding a few abilities to a few weak specs or changing some coefficients for better dps balance.
---
I'm actually dumbfounded that they think this is a good idea.
---
It was never about "can". People deserve to know that realistically they will have a lower chance of getting into groups and guilds if they play a "meme spec". If they're fine with that, then by all means go ahead, but it's something they should be aware of.
---
Tricking people into thinking that it doesn't matter at all is just misleading.
---
Also whatever rank you were when they stopped that whole system you got to keep that title. I've pretty much always kept my knight champion over my head because it kinda shows I've been around for a while.
---
The answer is that pservers have the drop rate on all items increased 50x including rares and epics. 
---
Quest drops are also heavily increased
---
Bag drop rates are off the charts.
---
Honestly, I saw this meme and instantly thought of you Esfand😂
---
I really hope not, at least w/ regards to BC. Not that I think it was a bad expansion - quite the opposite, in fact - but it sowed the seeds of most of the changes that really hit the game hard down the line and got most of us to stop playing.
---
Ideally, what I'd like to see is Classic go the OSRS route. Take inspiration from TBC and Wrath but go its own way, keeping to the original design philosophy that made Vanilla so great.
---
Except this time no poncy cussing elves in the gorram Horde!
---
Yeahhh... you go and go ahead and just forget about flying out of Tarren Mill.
---
"Only my playstyle is the correct one!"

Yeah you definitely sound like the mature one.

I am going to turn off my phone and social life. I will book annual leave but tell no one outside of work. I am single and my friends will assume I'm sick hopefully. I am going to draw the curtains, stock up on supplies and play the hell out of wow. I am buying another laptop just in case my existing on dies. Nothing will prevent me from playing this game for 14 days straight. Only a real family emergency will prevent this now.
---
Loading screen tip: ‘don’t you guys have phones?’
---
He ain't wrong though. The current community really is trash in comparison to vanilla and earlier expansions. Dunno what caused it or why but the sad reality is that far and large more toxic and less enjoyable to be a part of.
---
I've tried all expansions to date but the last one I stayed and enjoyed was MoP. I think Blizzard and this subreddit will honestly be surprised at the amount of interest Vanilla gets on release.
---
&gt;"Even 20-40h a week" 
---
mate, people who grind for rank 14 play at minimum 15 hours A DAY. EVERY DAY
---
For the most part, I won't even be interested in raiding when classic hits. 40 people trying to get dibs on 2 drops, and that's if you can even use what does. I know the gear is the best you can get but I'm just sitting here excited to know that dungeons will be tough again. Im legitimately looking forward to that most of all.
---

No we raped the shit outta them at the number 6 dance later that night!
---
&gt; I think all ppl that want to tryhard farm honor will condense in one zone and kill each other in the one big open world bg sort of.
---
That won't work, and it's why TM/SS won't be so epic. You can only get honor from killing a specific player a few times, then he's worth 0 honor. They're going to be farming flightpaths/hubs where fresh players are constantly coming to. This also means that if the alliance premade comes to defend, then they get VERY little honor after they kill 10 horde a few times.
---
&gt; Also thats how it happened back in the day, a period of no bgs but ranking, ppl played back in the day right? casual aswell. i think most ppl liked it, it actually remebered as one of the most fun periods of vanilla, why woudlnt it happen again.
---
Yes, that's sort of how it worked back in actual vanilla. However, we aren't in 2005 anymore. We're in 2019, and people know how to farm honor. The most efficient way to farm honor without bgs is killing 48+'s in searing gorge, ungoro, menethil harbor, korgath, brm, diremaul, etc. If one of those dries up, you go to the next.
---
Realistically how many people could get rank 14 items in phase 2 per faction? Anyone got a ballpark idea? Still I think this is perfect and true to classic
---
For a minimum of 3 months.
---
I put 5 in to shadow focus so that you get fewer resists. When something like psychic scream or silence or blackout tries to hit, resistance can make it "miss", so I'm thinking that would help, but haven't looked too strictly into it.
---
Shadow weaving occasionally puts an extra debuff on a target, making things like frost nova harder to dispel on your target. Not a big thing, but any extras can help
---
Inevitably someone kills an NPC and gets the entire raid DKs and that really pushes you back in rank a lot.
---
Is anyone else not sure what class they want to roll because of this news? I was hoping to have two level 60s by the time the honor system rolls out because there is one I want to PvP with specifically. Now we just need to know how long the phases will be. Hopefully the first phase is at least 4-5 months long.
---

Scare Beast has a 10 yard range. If you're killing the pet while in form and staying away from the Hunter, then you're not exposing yourself to fear or Viper Sting. That only happens if you're in melee range after the pet is dead - and at that point, I would probably just let him Viper Sting me (assuming I have enough mana) so that he can't Scatter + Trap.
---
Intresting. I never thought of it like that.  See I agree after TBC, and if they decided to go to Wraith and then develope new without Cata I could live with it. But we will see.  I am hyped to play and just started following wow classic for the past couple of days. I never was a hardcore wow guy, was pretty poor growing up so didnt have an account mostly played on others accounts.  So some of the details might be lost on me besides when I played it recently it just was so far from what I remember it being
---
I recommend waiting until you get your mount to catchup on your gathering - especially for Mining with that Tin --&gt; Iron deadzone. Running around on foot in hopes you find a node only to have it give no skillup is pretty rough, especially with everyone else running around so you see even fewer nodes. If you instead just wait till you get your mount you'll be able to return to places that will likely be less populated by then and you ride through much faster
---
I played retail vanilla in a semi-progression guild and we cleared AQ40 with an out of line raid roster with boomkins, rets, ferals. It takes a few more wipes and you won‘t be contributing at the server-first race but who cares? To have that diversity what absolutely fun and worth every single setback we had.
---
Exactly which is why I said in my first post I’ll never get rank 14. Not with the vanilla honor system. Doesn’t bother me I plan to focus on raiding and the AH. Maybe a few years after Naxx release they will modify the system but I put the chances of that at .0001% chance of happening.
---
For levelling?
---
6 and 8 slot bags from bag vendors
---
Then look at a few quests with a bag reward, such as the one in Duskwood.
---
Do we know how long it will take between p1 and p2?
---
ingame after people are 60 and can show equip and skill.
---
Are you sure? I wouldn’t really trust wowwiki half their shit is from random patches and not accurate.
---
I could be wrong, but I’ve always remembered myself and everyone else only gaining 1 rank a week, and all I did was pvp
---
I'd be fine with them releasing another vanilla when that happens.
---
As long as you can feel elitist somewhere.

Hm. I could see that. Herbs are more spread out over zones while mining nodes tend to be around the periphery. It's also been a long time since I did any mining / herb leveling in WoW, so I'll take your experience over mine.
---
Warlock has been looking tempting to me. I really love debuffing, but find it criminally underused in not just MMOs but RPGs In General.

My dream would be it progresses to TBC and then a fresh Classic server release at the same time or a few months after.  Then TBC to Wrath, Classic to TBC, Fresh Classic, etc.

1.12 pvp loot before BWL isnt close to what vanilla was

Did you read the part of the post about how PvP loot is being restricted to the appropriate phase that it was introduced in?
---
LOL you weren't lying!

ya savage gladiator chest is one of the biggest items affected by it. thats barely ppl mention for some reason, when its pretyt much  as huge, titan leggins. The stats change is completely crazy. and its prebis for hunters, warriors, enh shamans, ret paladins. and you keep it through raids.
---
it almost got 3% crit (if we count agility) and thats from a 5man dungeon... its compeltely insane item honestly, and pretty much better than anything in early wow. 
---
if they have it in the first tier of raiding, its a real bummer.

Hi guys, I played a shammy from BC onwards (pala+warrior back in vanilla) so I'm excited to play as a resto shammy for classic. Tauren because I'm a sucker for giant cows. I'm open to PVE and PVP though my goal would be to see all the raid content (though not hardcore), happy to take whatever time, either in a casual or semi-hardcore environment.

Any priority you may have in a guild (Raiding, PvP, RP, Social experience, etc) - honestly just looking for likeminded people who have played this game for ages. Never got to raid properly back when I played vanilla, so excited to see that content as live. 
---
You can PM me here directly, probably easiest! 
---
Thank you, excited for the summer :)
---
You have to consider that this subreddit is in relation to the whole expected classic community a relatively small one. Most people aren‘t looking into forums and reddit or they  are quite readers and those who look into forums and this subreddit are much more hardcore and purposeful.

[whatevah, I do wut I want!](https://youtu.be/z0-KZS1dDyw)
---
Is there somewhere I can read how the PvP rank system actually works? You seem to know some details!
---
Hey guys, it's Tip here!
---
yhea it sucks, when of the best things that the p-servers added a few years ago was the progressiv itemization. Made game alot more fun when you would go back to dungeons you otherwise would do once
---
What do you mean ?
---
Then we could finally play the game !
---
Nightfall buffs Sulfuras proc though! Game on!
---
I had tons of world pvp fun on a normal server in vanilla.
---
Shoot me a PM and we can exchange tunes \m/
---
Not going to work. Rankers will soon figure out the most efficient way of getting honor, and it will involve systematic ganking until players are honorless targets. There is no way nonrankers are going to show up for much more than clearing way for their raids. Maybe once in a while they will respond to some call to help. They will tire fast though, and go back to what they were doing whether it be afking at IF bridge or what have you. Rankers on the other hand, have no option but to keep going.
---
perfect thanks!
---
This is lame. The should allow ranking in phase 1, WSG in phase 2, and AV in P3. Does this mean people have to wait until BWL to play WSG? Huge turn off for most pvpers. Camping flight paths is boring for both the campers and the ones getting camped.
---
People said it would be crazy and difficult in many regards. But if you’re looking to play on a PvP server I don’t know who would call it horrible. In fact phase 2 will have the most active wpvp before people spend more time in instances bgs. PvE servers are just flat out not comparable. The only benefit to PvE servers is you don’t have to deal with gankers while leveling an alt.
---
I love the optimism. It means you’ll keep respawning for that second and third honor kill each day. Many gracias.
---
I think a lot of people forget that back in the day PVE servers were listed in server selection as "Normal". PVP was PVP of course.
---
PVE servers were far more popular. This PVP or no balls thing is a private server thing. Play what you want.
---
TBC was *far* from perfect. Mechanically, it got a lot right, especially with regards to off-spec viability, but it also sowed the seeds of a lot of the changes that later ruined the game.
---
From the new races' starting zones having a more narrative-driven experience in which your character was treated like the Champion of ~~Azeroth~~ your people, to the general focus of the game's design starting to shift toward endgame content over world content, to the arena fundamentally changing the nature of PvP from group-based fights balanced around a RPS design to mechanically homogenized classes and featureless items accommodating the competitive esports scene. And flying, of course, but as bad as that ultimately proved to be I honestly put it at the bottom of the list compared to the scope of the changes listed above.
---
I think it would be cool to see Blizz take inspiration from TBC/WotLK in creating new content for the game while keeping to the original philosophy of vanilla/Classic's design, but I'd hate to see them simply progress from Classic into BC/Wrath content without accounting for and addressing the ways each of them fundamentally altered the nature of the game. It would be a shame to have to give up the game again for the same reasons I did the first time after getting a second chance like this.
---
Especially as going straight from Classic into TBC would mean the Horde once again being overrun by the poncy cussing plague of tusk-less pointy ears.
---
Elves are for eating, not allying with.
---
I really don't get why people care about their /played. I i play pservers and when I rush 60 the game isn't suddenly more fun or anything I realize that the most fun I've had was actually at lvl
---
30 when I was pvping in ashenvale with my paladin and another warlock, nobody could kill us and I was op with the paladin quest hammer. Some classes have an op phase when you're leveling you'll feel it, for example lvl 20-30 paladin and 30-40 shamans are hard to kill and you shouldn't plan to skip over that phase and instead enjoy it by wpvping in your zone.
---
Great - not only are you completely clueless but also too dumb to give any insight into your retarded assumptions.
---
Bud, you're posting on a sub about a remake of a 15 year old game, I don't think you have much room to talk, you're definitely a closet nerd at best.
---
Its okay, embrace it.
---
This is my hope.
---
Name checks out
---
This is what I love about PvE. Especially in the zones where you auto flag. Makes just those places pvp instead of every goddamn where
---
Generally people looking to farm honor will probably center around popular places like SS/TM . There used to be diminishing returns on killing the same person so corpse camping wasn't rewarding.
---
To me the original phase 2 was the most fun part of vanilla wow PvP. I really felt disappointed when it shifted to the boring, premade BG grind. An eternal phase 2 would be good in my book...
---
Hi, /u/bahrambds
---
Gotta be honest I was hoping the rewards would be in from the get-go. I have good memories of leveling up my warrior and getting them sexy defilers boots soon as I was able to equip them.
---
My guild's gonna give it to people who play ENH
---
I'm highly sceptical to that there is a techincal thing that prevents them from changing items. Being the world largest video game company, converting data sure is not something new but mostly time comsumming. 
---
I would belive that the chocie is from the game designers and not the people handling the database?
---
Honestly man, you’re not wrong. But who cares? This is what we miss. Yea the unfair gank squads too. It feels good to roll them over with a full group on the way to BRM or Strat. 
---
Casual players gonna get farmed for honor on a PvP server unless they play smart. That’s how vanilla was too.
---
This point is getting wearisome, and it's not even the O.P.'s fault.
---
Say that there were 50/50 min-max vs. casual crowd (assuredly oversimplified, but for the sake of argument):
---
Guild up with one another. Plain and simple. Advertise yourself as a feral druid cat D.p.S., as a protection paladin looking to tank 5-mans or off-tank a raid, etc., and you'll get picked up by one of the "Fuck perfectionism, let's all have fun" guilds. The rest of you choosing faction/class/race and spent the months before game release path'ing your quest lines, researching pre-BiS, and discussing which talent points will maximize your efficiency, you all will find *your* people looking to snatch you up.
---
All of us will have people on "our team" with regard to these aspects. It's clearly divided, and we'll each just fall on our respective sides of the fence. The dust will settle, fun will be had by all, but not every applicant will be the best fit for the position. That's life. Move on, find a new job.
---
ya, also they changed the stats on these items, inprenaxx time, purely as a catch up mechanic so ppl that start playing the game would get a better gear, and feel less dumbed, for the same reason they added t0.5 gear. 
---
its not like they wanted ppl to progres mc with this items. its quite obviously a catch measuremenet for the enviroment of the late vanilla.
---
and now we'll have to raid mc+ony with these crazy items?
---
I acknowledge and link StaySafe's video in my own. Thank you for your criticism :)
---
Competitive? MC will be cleared by P2, I don't get your point. Who cares what gear they re-clear it with.
---
Ok thanks! Might've been a silly question but was always curious..
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_system\_(pre-2.0)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0))
---
Yeah, we used to PVP in Ashenvale and go for the Astranar Flight Master.
---
Source to confirm this? Bags early definitely seem increased (I still have speedruns hitting 7-8 with only the Carry Your Weight bag, though) but 50x seems greatly exaggerated? Source to confirm?
---
&gt;If you play something like Ret Paladin you won't be invited to groups unless you know 4 people who will willingly waste their time to cater to you. If you aren't in a premade most people will just respond with "lol" and ignore you.
---
This is a dreadfully pessimistic view of how forming groups work and I think it's a HUGE stretch to say "most people" act like that. Certainly some people do but I don't think it's fair to characterize that as the norm. Most people want to get a group filled as quick as possible because it's kind of a pain in the ass.
---
Not from the unbuffed singletarget test i saw
---
Nah, I'm going to be 60 before it matters anyway.
---
They did bluepost this week. Until the next week at least.
---
it's ok, you're already a grown up now so it can't possibly affect your life growing up
---
I still reckon it'll be an august release, July is just getting our hopes up.
---
And it'll give me enough time during summer to do stuff with my pals before vanishing for a while.
---
Agree. Makes no sense to me.
---
Added items with 1.10: remove because they got op stats
---
Updated items with 1.10: keep for no reason given
---
Let’s strike! How about none of us bathe or shower until we get a release date! I’ve already got a head start!!
---
This needs way more upvotes.
---
I remember reading all about the AQ gate opening when I started playing in TBC. There were actually some realms that didn't have their gates open until wrath.
---
That said, how hard was tanking? Like if I go Nelf Warrior or Dwarf Warrior..I’ll be expected to tank right? I didnt tank anything in Vanilla :/
---
I didn't realize Ron Jeremy played wow
---
More power to people who want to roll on a PvE server. All I'm saying is if you want to roll on a PvP server prepare to be killed in situations that aren't always fair.
---
you summed it up really well especially the part about taking on multiple mobs and getting raid loot. I stopped playing in WoD but even then getting a heroic raid staff and raid gear for my druid was very meh and no one really cares unless it gave you +bajillion hps or some other stat, and when you go into the public you don't really stand out from anyone else because everyone is xmogged anyway and you would need to inspect them. Being  raid geared was no big deal, it was about how many higher ilvl versions of that same raid gear you had that mattered which was silly to me.
---
It depends on the server, but there are many 15x+ loot rate realms that I've seen in the past across varying xpacks.
---
There’s lots of really dumb servers, I assumed this was in context of the “blizzlike” servers, aka the “popular” ones
---
Geez, get a clue. The weekly decay has everything to do with it. It takes 3 weeks of being number 1 on the entire server to go from R13 to 14.
---
I turn 30 next month. I guess this will be be.
---
^ this
---
The part that sucks about dks is how stupid those civilian npcs always were. At least make them run the hell away, not have 3 of them attack me after blundering into a frost trap. At that point they have taken up arms against the horde and should no longer be considered civilians.
---
You need to be at least 1CP higher.
---
You think you do, but then you also actually do.
---
Why... not .. just wait for Classic?
---
34st from what I've heard
---
depends on your realm. Sometimes it may be much easier, sometimes much harder.
---
When did they remove dishonorable kills? We avoided civilians because they would knock an entire rank down
---
They never said that sharding in low level zones were set in stone though. They said that they would look into different methods and that they would update us later on on the issue.
---
So, a solid update around sharding would certainly calm a lot of minds.
---
im planning on rolling a prot paladin https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/baobey/prot_paladin/ all are welcome to join my guild!
---
^^ Who gives a fuck if someone is playing ret. As long as they know how to play pally they aren't useless seeing as pallys have loads of utility
---
I'm fairly certain Priests are going to be just as desired as Shamans. Even if that isn't the case, I think you might regret investing a bunch of time into leveling/ gearing a Shaman if you would have rather played a Priest. I know, for me at least, the look and feel of a class matters a lot when I'm gonna be spending hundreds of hours looking at it. 
---
That's just my two cents though.
---
Can confirm 10 g per hour grinding mobs for vendor gold is obtainable and what I do from 36 to 40 to have mount money.
---
Not really. Some drop rates are even nerfed so they don't get overfarmed and mess up the economy.
---
I don't know when it was patched but I would assume it was before cata maybe when they revamped the whole resource management systems of every class. I played paladin on pservers and they definitely have to worry about mana especially in longer boss fights as holy which you will be speccing in raids, they can heal for longer than other healers imo. When leveling as Ret unless you I've a lot of int gear you will be mana deprived for most of the time because the highest rank holy light with take half your mana so you have to downrank and only use big heals when you're out of food or bandages to lower downtime.
---
&gt;any more stupid today than it was 15 years ago
---
We've had 15 years to learn, so in effect, yes it would be more stupid now to implement it than to have a better version in the spirit of classic (i.e. still rewarding dedication without having it be as game-able).
---
&gt;... and I want one.
---
You say you do... :P
---
God I am so excited! :D Cant wait for phase 3, warsong is my favorite pvp mode.
---
It's a tired trope that really doesn't apply here, vanilla servers had scores of DOAC/EQ veterans used to hardcore pvp
---
Doesn't take a tactical genius with years of 1.12 experience to figure out how to gank players.
---
I discussed this on a recent Countdown to Classic podcast. The drop rates are listed in the pserver core tables vs the drop rates of items from vanilla data mining. They come from a dev currently working on producing a next gen core to update pservers to more correct vanilla values.
---
Because you don't understand the importance of Dishonorable Kills.
---
So this sub is booming with more and more people. Are we all the 1%...? So pretentious do say you speak for everyone when really you don't really know.
---
Don't hate me too much for this... But it's WILCO, as in will comply.
---
Ret and Enhancement get the most use out of Sulfuras, but I doubt a guild would pitch in to help them make it.
---
You'd be surprised by how friendly vanilla is to playing casually. Rushing to max level is really the only exception. Past that, a couple nights of raiding a week is all you really need to keep pace. Throw in a dungeon per night and you're good to go. Others will be ahead of you at first but everyone will be about par by the time the next raid releases.
---
You gotta have skinning in there. Leveling 2 gathering professions is a waste of time.
---
Is this for serious?
---
No, 47 or 48 is still green for 60s
---
As a warrior or pally main (still deciding), _level with me_
---
The /s was for sarcasm. Maximum yikes
---
The new servers can hold thousands more than original.... I'm hoping for 0 sharing, awesome server reliability, much larger clashes than ever before in a non structured way.
---
Vanilla WoW specifically? Private servers are the only means of trying it out right now so obviously this option if you’re absolutely set on her trying Vanilla. If you have qualms about the morality of private servers you could just wait until WoW classic officially comes out and have her try it then.
---
There is a WoW free trial but it’s pretty whack and of course the current experience is not even remotely similar to Vanilla anymore.
---
I chose both and I'm sorry that makes you feel bad.
---
It's not. Ashkandi is better and easier to get.
---
Wow - this is one of the few things I did not know about pre-1.12 WoW. Even though I started in 1.12, I constantly read and watch videos of how WoW used to be (out of curiosity AND because I'm a huge nerd)
---
My dream in classic is to participate in organized World PVP. Like, random skirmishes are cool, but that's all I ever experienced, even on a PVP server. That's why I'm hoping going RPPvP will provide some real good Lord of the Rings style stuff
---
If you haven't introduced her by this point, then I'd say your best bet is to wait for Classic. **Unless** you want to do some speed leveling with her, in which case you should probably introduce her to the same vanilla environment you'll be going through in Classic. That said, I think speed leveling through Classic would be a mistake for a new person. So just wait for Classic.
---
Those were new servers started on the expansions
---
that loot was not introduced when WSG/AV/Honor system first came into play. There were many months with far inferior loot tied to the honor system. The pvp gear they are going to release before BWL launches will have many items BiS until Naxx.  They might as well launch with tier 0.5 as well
---
Dishonorable kills shouldn't be implemented at all.  It was the very first thing that they did that made the world feel way smaller because there was no reason to trek across the world for a capital city boss kill any longer.  Dishonorable kills forced people into battlegrounds for efficient honor farming for titles and gear and all but destroyed mass world pvp.
---
Lmao exactly
---
I remember the honor being split evenly. Running around in wpl as a zerg wont get you enough kills to make it worthwhile. So people would only zerg places that already have people like Hillsbrad and BRM.
---
I solo pvpd a lot, but I was also a hunter which is imo the best class for grinding honor in world pvp. I would also run into 3-5 man groups a lot. TFO wsg on my server, and I died a ton to those guys
---
But did they still give you 100% speed even if you had Apprentice Riding?
---
I’m 29 married and have a house. So glad we don’t have kids yet, cuz I’m going HAM when classic goes love.
---
I have to assume you haven't played private servers - literally every single point of interest in PvP zones will be heavily camped by gank squads, people will be getting griefed like crazy etc. You guys don't realize the extent of autism that goes on with ranking.
---
Phase 2, not a problem levelling for a rogue.
---
I thought you can’t? Did this change sometime in classic?
---
Durrr it's PvP server is not a good reason to state when casuals are *literally* going to be camped off the server by gen 1 rankers. Every point of interest in 50+ zones is going to be hard camped for 16+ hours/day for 3 months by them (myself included)
---
At least that flight master was on the island behind some guards - the Westfall one was positioned in such a way that you could kite him out of that place without tagging any guards... though you still had to deal with his griffins.
---
&gt;a period of no bgs but ranking, ppl played back in the day right?
---
for 8 weeks yes. Something tells me that this period on classic will be a lot longer.
---
My before and afters going to be identical. Except just add halo to it as well with MCC
---
It's not even levelers - anyone not running around doing stuff in the world with at least 3+ others is not going to have a fun time, level 60 or not. As I said in my other post, every single point of interest in level 50+ zones is going to be camped 16+ hours a day by us gen 1 rankers. People who haven't played private servers will not understand the extent, and within a week of phase 2 launching the crying will be insane.
---
Not a huge fan of DHKs but let’s fucking goooo!
---
They haven't talked about population cap per server, I think that's a pretty important topic.
---
Ok, then explain why does this happen on every pserver that releases honor before BGs?
---
Also, when honor patch came out in vanilla, did people already know about the rank 14 grind ahead of them?
---
I can assure you that the probability is high. It makes sense. It's like if you were telling someone about a probability statistic and were reassuring them that your numbers are accurate.
---
Can confirm. My family was broke AF and it was the #1 reason all I did was play WoW as a teenager. 15/mo is _easy_ to scrounge up compared to most other hobbies.
---
I aggrod 3 in crossroads one time. One guy decides he is going to drop group and kill them. Guess who got 3 dishonorable kills? Ugh
---
You do whatever makes you happy buddy!
---
This pic looks fake?
---
I’m in almost the exact situation. I worked out a rough schedule where I get home from work, feed animals and make dinner. Grind for a few hours, then give my lady some loving. Then hop back on for 1-2 hours and sleep.
---
Is their information to be accessed by the public for “Vanilla data mining”?
---
The level 50+ zones are the ones that are going to have serious issues with anyone leveling or frankly doing anything in them post phase 2. Any server with a dominant guild is going to have a very bad time.
---
This person has obviously never played Classic. Every single 48-60 is gonna be camped into oblivion
---
Oh yeh, people with braincells did. Not everyone has those though.
---
I can ASSURE you the PROBABILITY is high. 
---
It's assuring that their opinion on what is probable is accurate.
---
There are a good amount of small changes I would personally accept.  I think no changes is the best blanket way to be fair.  Ret, Shadow, Feral and enhance/elemental RIP.
---
Yes, you can confirm with calculations from the old Allakhazam
---
I've played on a 5k pop server, and it was pretty bad.
---
You cant really avoid 5 people that are waiting for you land at a flight path.
---
Idk long travels seems like a benefit of your only goal is leveling.  See the world. Go through dangerous zones to get where you need to. Be terrified of ?? Members of the opposite faction.  If your only goal is leveling take your time and enjoy it.    But yeah I guess horde have good teleportation.
---
Listen guys, This is really bad for the game, I personally wouldn't mind this, but if you're someone who is not 60 by the time this rolls around , you're gonna get stuck 48-60. Basically if you wanna rank, every single quest zone where you're gonna be, is gonna be camped with level 60s trying to rank, especially when the gear is updated to it's 1.12 state. The gear from ranking is gonna be SO good, that it's more beneficial, even for PvE minded players, to be ganking lowbies, than doing dungeons.
---
So you’re going to wait to find out which server has the worst faction imbalance?
---
"forced" lol
---
There's weakauras in Classic?
---
Yes. The R11 mounts had 100% speed. They only required Apprentice Riding to be used. You didn't gain any advantage for using them with Journeyman Riding.
---
A mount's speed doesn't scale with riding skill like it did in later expansions. A level 40 mount will always be 60% and the epic mounts/ZG mounts/R11 mounts will always be 100% speed.
---
Warcraft 3 had flying machines. I think the pilot was a dwarf
---
Rankers are going to hardcamp every point of interest in level 50+ zones for 16+ hours a day to compete for honor. It's going to be awful for anyone who's not a hardcore player (the vast majority of the population on servers)
---
Anyone who's saying this is a good thing hasn't played private servers at all and don't realize what's going to go into ranking early on these servers. Anyone on a populated server with a dominant guild is going to have a nightmare of a time trying to do anything.
---
No one is forcing anyone to grind. And a handful of people will get to Rank 13 before BWL.
---
So it would just be a rush to the pre-registration instead, kind of like the ticket events that you're talking about. You just moved the problem.
---
If you paid for the game sub/game, you have equal "right" to be on a server as anyone else. I don't see why you or I deserve earlier access just for F5ing a webpage.
---
U can go combat. Works good with great gear and with a healer on u it's pretty strong. I used to play hemo build too but I really don't know if hemo is normalized in 1.12. It's been a while.
---
Actually man I jumped the gun and you’re right. 2.5k was the old cap right?
---
When lvl 48-59 characters give honor to level 60s, and there's a working honor system, every open world zone is a hotspot.
---
If people wanna grind 14 hours a day for weeks so they can beat a 14 year old raid a bit faster then power to them
---
my guild was 18 and up. lots of college kids, some married couples. I really didn't think that many kids played - I didn't get a computer till I was in college
---
Goldpaw does good work.
---
And you can get 24 slots from his description. Or use bartender and Masque skins for more
---
Fair point. Whereas I haven't played retail since... '07? '08? Whenever Wrath came out, anyway. So my memories are exclusively of the game as it was during Vanilla and TBC. And the latter was great, as I said, but it did have its faults, just most of them were more systemic and not apparently obvious until years down the line.
---
Yeah, it's going to take a while to get a healthy max level population for raiding and lvl 60 BG's, I don't mind if they give us 6 months to level before cranking out a new chunk.
---
SAVOR IT.
---
I'm going to do a lot of research and make my best guess. If my faction ends up being in the majority then I will reroll - that would not be any fun for me.
---
Just do the grind man. Be a raid boss. :)
---
Go away carebear. This is an AMAZING choice.
---
Would you be fully against low level sharding for say a month upto level 20 zones or even 10? 
---
Just wondering what some people’s opinions are on it? I can see the negatives and positives of both
---
Jesus!  I have night terrors of Ganklethorn Vale.
---
I think I can smell you from here man
---
You're right, it is healthy and I very much appreciated it.
---
The hype has been building for me for classic wow over the past couple of weeks, but tbh I'm not where I want to be in terms of personal/creative projects and wow would just be a further distraction from that.
---
 Your post was a nice little dose of reality to help get me back to hustling, so thank you.
---
If i did somehow find time for wow it'd have to be very casual
---
I played it when the game originally launched, and it was amazing. pls go to your pve servers
---
People running around in gear you're not supposed to get 1.11 is obviously a huge fucking change, why is this specific change totally fine?
---
5 piece 2.5 for shaman is really good for Resto because it shortens your chain heal. That plus 3 piece T2 is supposed to be BiS until tier 3.
---
Somewhere around 3k. Hardware could in theory support 3.5-4k (but of course running at 100% capacity wouldn't be ideal, in case of a world boss spawn or such).
---
Bro it’s gonna take at least two months for people to get that gear, and at that points it’s maybe a couple people per server. Along with the fact that they’ll have had to made the money to buy it all as well... by that point BWL will probably be close to out anyways. So a couple of the *most* hardcore people will have an edge going into BWL. So what? It really has the most minimal impact on my play.
---
I wouldn’t be so sure. I could def see it falling into phase 4.
---
look at those gaming chairs, you kids now a days have it so good, you have no idea what it's like sitting on a wooden kitchen chair and raid
---
On Gorefiend in the guild Ember we had a filthy mouthed Aussie named Pougmahone that was the only one willing to farm up the mats to craft it... so we had a Ret Paladin with this baby in our guild.
---
It was a PVP/PVE hybrid guild so he got to have a lot of fun in BG's helping the guild get about 8 Grand Marshals.
---
It's not. You said you played the game when it was released. That was 14 years ago, a LOT has changed. You have no idea the private server meta and how Classic is going to be played (It's a completely different game than it was back then)
---
I will be one of those people ranking the first months, so not sure why you're calling me a carebear. It's just a bad design choice - casuals are going to quit in droves come Phase 2 when they literally can't do anything in the world in any level 50+ zone.
---
I think you could be right on the August. Though I’d like us to just surprise us with a June release... 
---
One can only hope
---
I recently leveled to 39 on a server and vendored every single item I came across, ended up with 87g. I did not have any professions and did not spend an extended amount of time grinding mobs.
---
So assuming you can use the AH to get even a small amount of extra cash, you should easily break 100g if you aren't wasteful.
---
💩
---
No worries here.  R13 is an insane grind... if they're putting in that time then good for them. 
---
I'll probably cap out at around 9 or 10 and be happy with my blues... I think epics start at 11 for chest and legs and something else... 12 for helmet, gloves and shoulders?  If they got it in them.... props.
---
delusion!
---
Yes what a compelling argument you have. Playing 14 years ago means nothing, coming from someone who played then as well.
---
There was an UD Priest, Villefort, who was infamous on my server for doing just that.
---
Yeah this probably works fine for retail where you only ever have to use a handful of abilities. Lots of random flavor abilities in classic that you don't want to go searching in your spellbook for to see the cooldown of.
---
I hope your guild ends up being mostly consisted of boomers. We are few but together we are strong.
---
Let them have their PvP gear. Who cares about how they have an easier time to PvE. They have to nolife the shit out of the game for weeks to get it. Whoever does this, GL to you.
---
I'm pro-sharding in starting zone. I hate sitting in que for hours, randomly disconnecting and getting pushed back to the end of the line.
---
But, I do not support sharding beyond what I just wrote above. Anything more than starting zones will be bad for the game.
---
There are specs out there yes. But if you want to be good at pvp, daggers is the way to go because of the burst.
---
Vote this up guys blizz needs to see these kinda seems on a daily basis!!!!
---
People having full BWL gear before it releases won't affect you? Are you just going to avoid all world pvp?
---
Is there word yet on roughly how long each phase is expected to last?
---
They fixed honor tagging city leaders quickly in vanilla and I'm pretty sure they are not bringing it back for classic.
---
No-one got R14 legitimately because R14 was the most unethical, unhealthy grind WoW has ever had. 
---
I'm not surprised they're putting it back in, but it was an absurdly terrible design.
---
Vampiric Embrance isn't utilized unless in extremely rare occasion, and only if asked by the raid leader. SWP isn't used either, beacuse it will always be replaced before it's expiring, so it's just a mana waste. With the right buffs (I always played Ally, so with BoW and BoS) you can handle the mana consumption with a lot of mana potions.
---
Not with DHKs it won't. Unless you mean ganking.
---
Server locations/types/numbers

Plenty of stuff to cover yet.
---
Feral is doable if you're into spending a large amount of time farming that Gnomergan Mace.
---
Like... a **lot** of time, though
---
It’s actually one of the most fun and rewarding parts of PVP. Not much else compares.
---
What counts as a dishonorable kill?
---
You also pretty much had to pay someone in China to play when you slept
---
I’ve never actually played wow but will play classic. I like this idea so me and some irl friends can coordinate. Is there going to be a means of looking at faction balance?
---
nobody would do the rank 14 grind if you had to stay rank 14 to use the weapons.
---
**[NA - Alliance]** Hardcore PvP and PvE guild currently recruiting members of all classes/roles for world pvp/end-game raiding.
---
We're a core group of around 12 players who all played and raided in vanilla WoW looking to expand our ranks to create a competent, quality over quantity raid team to progress through everything classic WoW has to offer. That being said, our ultimate focus and reason for clearing PvE content is to dominate in PvP. We will be on a PvP server.
---
Our Philosophy: We don't expect everyone to go 110% autism-mode to min-max every aspect of their performance, but we do expect competence, efficiency, and a willingness to excel from all of our members. Our experienced players are willing to help guild mates run dungeons, get attuned, and understand their class, gearing choices, rotations, and the raid encounters. We'll gladly take a proactive player who is learning a new class over a veteran who isn't willing to put forth the effort.
---
Loot System: Loot council
---
Raid Times: Undecided. We will try to find a time that works best for the majority of our players as we get closer to that point. 
---

Bringing back DHKs ruins the interest I had in the game. 
---
No-one misses those.
---
There's nothing preventing them from doing so with the honor system and DHKs in place. People who'd achieved the rank they wanted used to go out of their way to farm DHKs simply to demonstrate how stupid they were.
---
And griefers, by definition, don't care about mechanical incentives or penalties. They're just in it to ruin someone else's day. So what if their honor score tanks as a result? It has no bearing on their ability to be an anonymous asshole in a video game, so screw it.
---
I get that Blizz needs to try to do *something* about griefing, but DHKs are not the solution. Even if they worked as intended, they also have the result of stifling world PvP. Which isn't worth the price of entry.
---
Too many PvE snowflakes on this subreddit. They're lucky winter is coming.
---
In the first Starcraft Zerg were known for rushing their opponent really quickly by rushing for a spawn pool and six zerglings very early in the game. Zerg Rush.
---
Those 5 people aren’t doing world PvP. They’re grinding for their hardcore shit. It doesn’t matter mate. They are focused on their next 60 or perfecting their black lotus path or gearing up their guildmates. It doesn’t matter. I guess it doesn’t matter if the rewards aren’t available until BWL opens. But I’m not worried either way about this. As long as honor isn’t calculated from launch it’s fine to me.
---
I know its sarcasm? Does that make it okay to push dumb strawmen?
---
I'm sorry its difficult to understand for an inbred child who uses "yikes" unironically. /s
---
I’m thinking you find a PvP server where a bunch of streamers roll horde.
---
Everyone complained about dire maul gear being available at the start because it's overpowered, this is the same exact shit but suddenly it's ok?
---
Warlock. You won’t die much and if you do you’ve got soulstone!
---
That depends on gear score. When you first hit 60 though. Daggers will lead pvp. The burst is just better then the other specs. Once you get to later raids though. Swords do become very viable in pvp. Though I am a bad rogue so I don't wanna give you a spec. I can say though I do know for a fact Hemo will eventually be the best pvp spec. Which is not a dagger spec. I do know that much.
---
arms is for pvp, fury has awlays been much better in PVE
---
&gt;opinion
---
&gt;accurate
---
Would the honor be split between the group that tagged an enemy or anyone that contributed to the kill?
---
Server types and names is a definite post that's coming.
---
I dont believe well get a beta or stress test.
---
We won't have dynamic respawns with sharding.
---
Why would they ever do shared quest items? That's a private server gimmick to get groups to play together.
---
They went over just starter areas, no where else.
---
Why would they put in guild banks?
---
&gt; I dont really have any intention of raiding
---
Or doing dungeons?
---
BRM doesn't just have raids.
---
Now I want a class weaknesses guide :(
---
I hope to see you with Hand of Rag kickin ass PvPing on stream!
---
Now you’re reminding me we could be over a month off from a release date.  
---
God dammit leeroy
---
People knowing how mechanics work, more effective add-ons, and computers that aren't literal potatoes will make BWL much, much easier than it was.
---
BIS won't at all be required to get that shit done.
---
Well, if it released July 16th, then 2020 would only be 4 and 1/2 months away. However I do think phase 2 could be in 2019 easily.
---
As someone turning 30 tomorrow I feel personally attacked.
---
I know right?
---
Anyone can do Dire Maul a few times and get geared to the teeth. We all can’t do r14. It’s a handful of people at most, not the entirety of the server. So no, it’s not the same shit at all, in my opinion. 
---
Out of curiosity, how would you fix this? Enable purchasing the items later? Have blizz make multiple iterations of the gear?
---
The only solution is to level your main and planned alts to 60 before phase 2....
---
This is more the way I was leaning towards, if we all got to enjoy day 1 that would be the most ideal prospect.
---
I would like to see us all making friends from those in our servers early on, but we will also get to level 20 in the first 48 hours (easily) and be past the sharding process. So it’ll affect me for a day to have a smooth launch it’s worth it
---
you can tell who the oldest and who the youngest is by looking at the monitors.
---
What are Relics? I have no memory of this.
---
Sure it does. I remember the chaos then and that's 100% what I want. 
---
That's literally the best argument there could ever be for it.
---
Go play pve carebear.
---
Yeah, I say that, but I bet I start it up a day or so after launch. Depending on when that is
---
Go into Teldrassil and take a strigid hunter for Claw 2. Then learn the skill
---
Dismiss and go a little more north and tame an elder nightsaber. It’s a dark cat and matches the mount. You’ll be able to train it Claw 2 within an hour.
---
I started late and was like level 58 or so when the gates were opening. Went to Silithus, had no idea what was going on but there were like a million people and I was getting about 2 FPS. If I had known then that I was witnessing something awesome, I probably would have stuck around longer!
---
I'm looking forward to it this time, plan on taking a week or two off work and maybe, if I'm lucky, becoming a Scarab Lord. Not even for the mount or title but it looks like a really cool chain and I want to witness it with my own eyes. 
---
Cool screenshot, thanks for sharing!
---
I think between groups, then within that group. Idk, I could be wrong. I'll have to look it up.
---
I've been suggestive of this in a few different forums too.
---
They would have to have server caps (to begin with).
---
Horde and Alliance would also have to be capped.
---
Example;
---
1500 Horde, 1500 Alliance, 3000 Soft Cap, 5000 hard Cap on release
---
It would also get people reactivating there subscriptions 1-2 months early to reserve a realm and character name.
---
Yesss I think it is the most important thing they have not discussed. 
---
Although since we are seeing them stick so much to how vanilla was I think the same will go for server caps and pops.
---
Considering the PvP announcement today about the phase 2 situation it’s even more likely. They know it would be a nightmare unlike anything in vanilla with pops at 8-10k and 60s grinding the world PvP spots for months to get honor.
---
Going by classes I'd give it to a shaman or paladin over a warrior. Warriors get a better weapon from Ragnaros himself and also Nefarian. It has no lasting power for them.
---
Really though it should go to whomever actually wants to farm the mats for it. It's not a cheap weapon to make so that alone should eliminate most contenders.
---
Fresh server?  U best be grinding alot of mobs to vendor stuff
---
play on a pve server. catering to the 99% is not the way to go.
---
So much fucking this. 
---
I played a resto shaman in vanilla, and the guild I joined literally didn't clean MC or ZG until I joined... and they were like "Holy shit, you were the missing piece, so glad you could make it!!!" I wasn't the best healer in the guild, but situationally I was aware of how I could make those around me better, and that appears to be what it took for that guild to do the thing. So learn whatever class it is you're playing, figure out what they do well, and never think you're too important to buff those around you. Giving them a little bit of help, goes a LONG way to making the content easier to manage. 
---
I've got a handful of real life friends coming back to play classic wow with me, and some old guildies from a different server, and I'm straight up starting off day fucking 1 as a Nelf Druid, and I'm rolling tank so hard. I may also level a priest for heals, and a mage for ranged DPS, but that druid is going to tank from the day he's born until the day he dies. 
---
One of my friends is going to play a Warrior tank, and he will likely be our main tank in any end game content, but I'll be right there with him as primary offtank, and probably our main tank for all 5 man content. 
---
I'm also trying to talk all of my real life friends into rolling a druid or rogue alt so we can do some crazy stealth runs together at 60.
---
IMHO go skinning and then 1 of either mining or herbalism. Skinning will be a consistent, reliable boost to your income that you don't have to fight other players with the same skill for. As someone mentioned above, it will be difficult to make money off of Herbalism for at least month. So unless you're going to store every herb up in your bank (and hope you have enough slots before they actually sell for reasonably money in the AH) I would think skinning would help you in the gold department more. Plus it would suck to be, say, 28 trying to afford spells, or 40 trying to get your mount but be broke because you're going to make a little more money a month from now with Herbalism. If in that position I'd much rather have the money now and a mount/my spells.
---
Yes the people on my server (Maelstrom US) called it the Honor Cap. The top PvE guilds who pvped would decide who was next and that person would get the cap and so on. It was garbage. I had nothing to do that summer (classes) so I played an incredibly unhealthy amount that summer and got rank 14. I also had an open group, anyone could whisper me and join. The top guilds were pissed because it forced them to either give up, be more inclusive, or beat me and my open group on honor gains. That only happened one weekend when it was AV bonus and we always played Arathi Basin.
---
You don't understand, it's not going to be chaos it's going to be groups of better/more geared players, who've player private servers for years, farming you and every other casual who has (or has not) played Vanilla since 2005. It's going to be relentless and MUCH different than it was back then.
---
You can say it's not all you want, but the fact is you haven't played the game in 14 years. A lot has changed and you don't know what it's going to be like. I assume you're a casual player who wants "muh world pvp" which is great and all, again I'll be one of those rankers farming but it's not going to be what you expect it to be.
---
Facts. I'm playing in Classic to prep my characters for the possibility of TBC. He also got excited for Cata over Wrath lmao.
---
majority of players will be mage and rogue dont forget that
---
And this is why I'm not and never have been fully in support of #nochanges. I loved playing WoW when it first came out and am super excited to get back to the way things were, but that doesn't mean I think it was perfect.
---
Vanilla had some pretty definite flaws. Top o' the list was off-spec viability in PvE, which was largely corrected for in TBC (though that one came with its own, more insidious, problems). Directly underneath it was the gods-awful honor system, which was hot garbage when it first debuted in '04, and which will still be hot garbage when it goes live again in '19.
---
I don't know what the solution to that is, though you're probably correct that it may require some pretty drastic changes. I'm okay with that. Blizzard would have to try pretty damn hard to come up with a worse system than one which all but explicitly incentivizes unhealthy and unethical behavior on the part of the players, up to and including flagrant violation of their own ToS via account sharing and cross-faction coordination.
---
Psyched for phase 5: The Mystery phase
---
no lol
---
It's just that people who were older aren't as nostalgic and interested in classic wow, it's one out of many games they played
---
So if the rewards will be from 1.12 and you’ll be able to get them in the patch BEFORE AV, won’t that make av wsg and especially ab rep rewards obsolete?
---
It'd make a very pleb v expert contention on servers. Like if a server is full from pre-registration, it's likely full of people who are on this sub, like you said, who probably know what they're doing. So some servers could just be devoid of too many noobs whereas others are filled with them.
---
I think it'd end poorly.
---
Progressive itemization would be a good way to fix this, so you don't have melees potentially running around with AQ-level melee weapons before BWL is even out.
---
